None will likely admit belief in Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, and only three (Lindsey Graham, John Kasich, and George Pataki) will likely say human activity causes climate change. None favors the Dodd-Frank financial reform law or the current legal status of abortion or the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision on gay marriage. All would repeal Obamacare. All pledge to cut taxes, increase defense spending and reduce overall government spending.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut this conformity masks disagreement on a host of other issues, including immigration, trade, education, the minimum wage and that most sacred of Iowa\u2019s cows, ethanol subsidies. Squint a little, and the GOP 17 start to emerge as individual people who differ not just in personality but also in their ideas about how to govern. Those differences could become magnified with a fickle GOP base that is ready for fresh blood \u2014 and looking for reasons to dismiss candidates from the unwieldy field of hopefuls.\n\nHere\u2019s where the candidates diverge:\n\nImmigration\n\nImmigration is the topic on which the candidates\u2019 views are most fluid, reflecting unresolved tensions between the party\u2019s pro-immigration corporate wing and its anti-immigration social-conservative wing. Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Rick Santorum, Carly Fiorina, George Pataki, and Jim Gilmore all explicitly oppose a path to citizenship for the undocumented. So, surprisingly, does Jeb Bush, generally thought to be the most pro-immigration candidate; although he favored a path to citizenship previously, he now favors \u201ca path to legalized status\u201d but not citizenship.\n\nThe most pro-immigration candidate is not Bush, but Graham, who\u2019s said he would veto any immigration bill that did not contain a path to citizenship (though he wants that path to be \u201clong\u201d and \u201chard\u201d).\n\n\u201cHe has the longest history of really being a leader of the moderate Republican wing on this,\u201d said Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the nonprofit Migration Policy Institute\u2019s U.S. Immigration Policy Program.\n\nMike Huckabee has spoken favorably of citizenship for undocumented children (\u201cI would like that person to become a very generous tax-paying citizen\u201d), and in his 2015 book, \u201cGod, Guns, Grits, and Gravy,\u201d Huckabee pointed out that President Ronald Reagan \u201cwas responsible for the greatest immigration amnesty act in American history.\u201d With regard to grownups, though, Huckabee opts not to be Reaganesque: \u201cI strongly oppose amnesty and government benefits for illegal immigrants who have violated our laws,\u201d his campaign Web site declares.\n\nDonald Trump, to all appearances the most blatantly anti-illegal-immigration candidate, has passed up opportunities to oppose explicitly a path to citizenship. \u201cIf somebody\u2019s been outstanding, we try and work something out,\u201d he said last month on MSNBC. Although Trump wrote scornfully in his 2011 book, \u201cTime to Get Tough,\u201d about \u201cObama and his pro-amnesty pals,\u201d Trump supported a path to citizenship as recently as 2012, and for all his bluster about \u201crapists\u201d crossing the border, he\u2019s said nothing lately to contradict that.\n\nJust about all the GOP candidates have shifted their positions on immigration at one time or another, sometimes more than once. But the champion escape artist on this topic is Marco Rubio, who has expressed at least seven different positions over the course of his political career. Asked in late June if he supported a path to citizenship, he said: \u201cI do.\u201d\n\nTrade\n\nOn trade, the GOP candidates face a dilemma similar to that on immigration: support legislation that the business community strongly favors or oppose it to appease conservative partisans (in this instance less ideological than reflexively opposed to granting additional powers to Obama).\n\nThe simple way to resolve this tension is to oppose fast-track trade-promotion authority but support (or at least not oppose) the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That\u2019s the option chosen by Rand Paul (who voted against it in the Senate), Ben Carson, Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal and Huckabee. Fiorina comes close to this position, saying she opposes fast-track and feels \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with the TPP. Ted Cruz voted for fast-track in May but against it in June, complaining that it was now tied to a \u201csecret deal\u201d between Senate Democrats and Republicans on funding the Export-Import Bank, which he opposed.\n\nThe more traditionally pro-trade GOP position is to favor (or at least not oppose) fast track and the TPP. That\u2019s where Rubio, Bush, Walker and Graham have come down. Kasich appears to be in this camp, too, though his public statements are less definite.\n\nThen there\u2019s the \u201chell no\u201d caucus that explicitly opposes both fast track and the TPP. Donald Trump is its sole member at the moment, but Fiorina, Santorum and Cruz may end up joining him.\n\nEducation\n\nThe education issue that most divides the Republican slate is the Common Core, a set of academic standards developed by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers. Here the conservative impulse to impose academic rigor on schools in thrall to \u201cwhole child\u201d progressivism is at war with the equally conservative impulse to maintain control of education policy at the state and local levels. With the Republican National Committee now officially opposed to Common Core, local control is winning.\n\nNot surprisingly, the two strongest Common Core supporters among the GOP 17 are both governors: Bush and Kasich. But even Bush now says the federal government should exercise no influence over it, and Kasich didn\u2019t push back recently when his state Legislature dumped one of the tests created specifically to test students on Common Core mastery.\n\nAnother governor, Jindal, initially backed Common Core but later decided he wanted nothing to do with it after the Obama administration created financial incentives for states to adopt it. \u201cAs we have seen in Obamacare,\u201d Jindal wrote in April, \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s Washington believes it knows better than the peasants in the states. But centralized planning didn\u2019t work in Russia, it\u2019s not working with our health care system, and it won\u2019t work in education.\u201d Jindal also sued the Obama administration to butt out.\n\nCruz is also virulently anti-Common Core. He\u2019s tweeted that \u201cwe need to repeal every word of Common Core,\u201d even though there\u2019s nothing to repeal because Congress never legislated it. Later he clarified that if elected president he would discontinue the federal incentives to participate in the program.\n\nTrump opposes the Common Core quite fervently, too, though it\u2019s not clear his motivation goes any deeper than a desire to bash Bush for supporting it. In a July 7 interview Trump said it was \u201cpathetic\u201d that Bush was \u201cin favor of Washington educating your children.\u201d\n\nMinimum wage\n\nRepublican candidates are notably willing to talk this year about income inequality, a topic Mitt Romney famously relegated in 2012 to \u201cquiet rooms.\u201d Just about all the GOP candidates \u2014 and especially Cruz and Paul \u2014 have spoken publicly about the problem, if only to point out that it\u2019s gotten worse under Obama.\n\nBut only two of the GOP 17 \u2014 Carson and Santorum \u2014 favor hiking the minimum wage. \u201cI think, probably, it should be higher than now,\u201d Carson told CNBC\u2019s John Harwood in an interview. Carson didn\u2019t specify how much the federal hourly minimum should be increased above the current $7.25. (Congressional Democrats have lately coalesced around $12, though a few are pushing for $15.) Santorum has said he favors a small increase.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I think every candidate that calls themselves conservative should be calling for an increase in the minimum wage,\u201d said Dave Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. \u201cThe polls show that a majority of Republican voters favor increasing the federal minimum wage.\u201d\n\nFor the rest of the pack, the only question is whether the wage floor should remain where it is or be abolished altogether.\n\nWalker and Rubio are abolitionists, though both say they wouldn\u2019t act on that conviction.\n\nOf Wisconsin\u2019s state minimum, Walker said in October, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to repeal it, but I don\u2019t think it serves a purpose because we\u2019re debating then about what the lowest levels are at. I want people to make, like I said the other night, two or three times that.\u201d Walker then said much the same about the federal minimum wage in a July interview with Fox News.\n\nSimilarly, Rubio said two years ago, \u201cI don\u2019t think a minimum wage law works,\u201d a view he repeated in January. But in the January remarks he elaborated that \u201cas a practical matter\u201d he didn\u2019t favor its repeal: \u201cIt is what it is and that\u2019s a disruption we don\u2019t need.\u201d\n\nCruz can sound like an abolitionist when he talks about the minimum wage. \u201cI think [it] consistently hurts the most vulnerable,\u201d he said in January. But \u2014 somewhat uncharacteristically for a candidate who released a video showing how to cook bacon with a machine gun \u2014 he\u2019s less emphatic than Walker and Rubio (and similarly refrains from calling for repeal). It\u2019s possible that Cruz approaches the issue with more trepidation because his father, Rafael Cruz, generated headlines last year by saying \u201cthe average black does not\u201d understand that boosting the minimum wage would increase black unemployment.\n\nThe most nuanced abolitionist position is to say wage floors should be set by government, but not at the federal level. \u201cI think a minimum wage is a classic example of a policy that is best carried out in the states,\u201d Fiorina said in April. Bush appeared to flirt with that position in March \u2014 but then, as he\u2019s done so often, he walked back the statement. \u201cI think state minimum wages are fine,\u201d Bush said at a campaign stop in South Carolina. \u201cThe federal government shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d Later he clarified that he merely opposed a federal increase.\n\nEthanol\n\nNo issue tests a presidential candidate\u2019s mettle like ethanol.\n\nOn the one hand, it\u2019s a central concern of Iowa voters, who exert clout disproportionate to their number in the primaries because of the \u201cfirst in the nation\u201d Iowa caucuses. Ethanol is derived from corn, which is derived, to a great extent, from Iowa, the top corn-producing state.\n\nOn the other hand, the environmental benefits of ethanol are judged dubious at best; a recent Web post from the Environmental Working Group argued that ethanol had an even worse effect on climate change than would the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nThe $6 billion federal tax subsidy for corn-derived ethanol expired in 2011, but federal law requires that refiners blend into the nation\u2019s fuel supply increasing amounts of biofuels (mostly ethanol and biodiesel, which is derived from various animal fats and agricultural oils), with a 2022 statutory target of 36 billion gallons.\n\nOpposition to ethanol would seem a natural for conservatives, who frequently oppose environmental regulation. But the Iowa caucuses complicate that calculus, even for Republicans. Christie, who prides himself on plain speaking, suggested to Iowans in March that he\u2019d leave the Renewable Fuel Standard be. Graham and Santorum favor the ethanol mandate, too. Carson said in Iowa in May that he favors more ethanol production, to be achieved by diverting $4 billion spent annually on oil subsidies to build ethanol stations.\n\nCruz stands out as the ethanol opponent who\u2019s not afraid to say so to Iowa voters. \u201cThe answer you\u2019d like me to give is \u2018I\u2019m for the RFS, darn it,\u201d he said in March. \u201cThat\u2019d be the easy thing to do. But people are pretty fed up with politicians that run around and tell one group one thing and tell another group another thing. Then they go to Washington and don\u2019t do anything they said they would do. I\u2019m going to tell you the truth.\u201d The truth, in this instance, is that Cruz has already sponsored a bill phasing out the RFS over five years.\n\nBush, after some initial hemming and hawing, earlier this week told Iowans that he, too, would phase out the RFS. \u201cThe best way to get to energy security is by letting markets work,\u201d he said. \u201cRFS has had great success, but over time it has to be phased out.\u201d Fiorina, Perry and Walker have said much the same, though Perry has softened his language since 2012.\n\nHuckabee, meanwhile straddles the issue, the liberal Mother Jones reported gleefully in May. The magazine contrasted Huckabee\u2019s anti-RFS language in his 2015 book (\u201cso-called environmentalist policies hurt the poor when the supply of corn and other grains fell, causing skyrocketing food prices and shortages that led to riots\u201d) with his response to a questioner saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve been an unabashed supporter of the RFS.\u201d Huckabee\u2019s reply: \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nThe rest\n\nEven when the GOP 17 agree, one can find differences worth noting.\n\nOn repealing Obamacare, most of the candidates have been vague about what they\u2019d replace it with (\u201csomething terrific,\u201d Trump said). Only Jindal offered up a truly fleshed out alternative. Jindal proposes providing states with $100 billion over a decade to devise their own health care systems with just one requirement: no discrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions.\n\nNone of the candidates, with the possible exception of Trump, can be said to be pro-union, but Walker is the most virulently anti-union. \u201cWe took on the unions and won,\u201d he said in his announcement speech, referring to his elimination of most collective bargaining for Wisconsin\u2019s public employees and the state\u2019s new right-to-work statute freeing workers from any legal obligation to pay dues to a union that bargains collectively on their behalf.\n\nWalker is also the candidate most ardently opposed to gay marriage, favoring, along with Cruz, a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision to legalize it. Graham actively opposes such an effort, and most of the other candidates would just as soon avoid talking about it. Huckabee is an exception; he\u2019s proposed something akin to the \u201cmassive resistance\u201d campaign by segregationists after Brown v. Board of Education, in this instance directed not against school integration but gay marriage. Paul proposes that the government get out of the marriage business altogether.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of GOP presidential contenders that will likely say human activity causes climate change.
