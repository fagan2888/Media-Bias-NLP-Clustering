Zak said during the event\u2019s opening remarks. \u201cWe are proud to connect industry-leading U.S. experts to Mexico\u2019s plans to enhance its infrastructure in order to improve the daily lives of its people.\u201d\n\nThe agency this week bragged via Twitter that it awarded a new grant to a Mexican industry group \u201cto help modernize Mexico\u2019s freight railcar fleet.\u201d\n\nThe amount of that grant \u2013 which USTDA is giving to the Asociaci\u00f3n Mexicana de Ferrocarriles, Mexico\u2019s national railroad trade association, is unclear, as USTDA announced the grant without revealing its value.\n\nOne conference attendee claimed it was a $150 million, though that amount is highly unlikely in the context of past agency grants. An email and separate tweet sent to USTDA was acknowledged, but clarification on the amount was not given by deadline.\n\nThe railway grant will support the Mexican industry group\u2019s efforts \u201cto modernize its fleet of specialized freight railcars.\n\n\u201cThe project will recommend specific investments in new systems, services, terminals and railcars to meet the projected growth of freight transportation in the country.\u201d\n\nUSTDA said it also plans to release \u201ca complete Resource Guide to highlight additional projects in Mexico\u2019s energy, water and environment sectors.\u201d\n\nWhile USTDA arguably is a relatively small agency \u2013 its FY 2014 budget request is just under $63 million \u2013 it consistently undergoes criticism along with calls for closure. Former Rep. Ron Paul and free-market think tanks such as the Cato Institute regularly denounce it as among the most duplicative and wasteful of all federal entities.\n\nUSTDA, Ex-Im Bank and OPIC consequently are among the most egregious examples of \u201ccorporate welfare waste,\u201d the Cato Institute concluded in a 2005 report. These and similar organizations \u201cshould be terminated,\u201d contends the report\u2019s author, Chris Edwards.\n\nTotals for previous Ex-Im Bank and OPIC financing of Mexican infrastructure projects were not readily available for this report, but a search of prior USTDA initiatives reveal numerous efforts to arrange U.S. backing of such projects.\n\nUSTDA under Obama has financed a multitude of other transportation initiatives that simultaneously benefit the Mexican people and U.S. businesses, courtesy U.S. taxpayers.\n\nMultiple DMs and feasibility studies for airport modernization and expansion initiatives, as well as for numerous environmental endeavors, have received USTDA funding since Obama first took office.\n\nSome of these endeavors precede Obama and took place under the George W. Bush administration.\n\nThe agency under Bush was equally generous to the Mexican government, which likewise received grants to explore financing options for infrastructure as well as \u201cgreen\u201d projects.\n\nBush\u2019s USTDA in 2006 paid for a DM whose aim was to help Mexico achieve closer parity with the \u201cstrength and competitiveness\u201d of the U.S. and Canada\u00b8 its North America Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, partners.\n\nDespite the overall viability of this trading block, USTDA at the time lamented that Mexico \u201csuffered from lost manufacturing jobs to Asia and is searching for methods to regain its competitiveness,\u201d according to the DM for the Mexico Secretariat of Communications & Transportation Multimodal National Plan.\n\n\u201cOne of Mexico\u2019s solutions to increasing competitiveness is to capitalize on its geographical proximity to the U.S., offering more secure and efficient trade transportation networks with the U.S. and thus Canada,\u201d the agency said in that endeavor.\n\nUSTDA similarly financed an analysis of Mexico\u2019s planned modernization of Tijuana as a modern transportation center just south of the California border.\n\nThose discoveries further affirm what Jerome R. Corsi, WND senior staff reporter, had suggested in his book \u201cThe Late, Great USA: The Coming Merger with Mexico and Canada.\u201d about these tri-national transportation and political linkages.\n\nRecently USTDA separately awarded a $50,000 grant to KED Group to assess Mexico\u2019s needs in an \u201cintelligent transportation\u201d project in the State of Jalisco.\n\nThe agency last October awarded a $50,000 contract to the Seneca Group to conduct a DM on behalf of the Mexican Association of Railroads. That endeavor\u2019s purpose was to help USTDA decide whether to help fund additional projects supporting \u201cthe development of Mexico\u2019s freight rail system, which is a critical component of Mexico\u2019s economy and trade.\u201d\n\nPotential projects were to include assessments of railroad infrastructure \u201cto accommodate the transportation of various oil and gas products.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear whether that project is a predecessor activity to the USTDA grant announced this past week at ConnectMEX. Often the agency will conduct a DM before carrying out a more expensive and detailed feasibility study of the same project.\n\nUSTDA separately agreed to provide a $455,000 grant to the State of Puebla Secretariat of Transportation to conduct a feasibility study of a proposed \u201cintelligent transportation system\u201d project.\n\nPuebla authorities reached out to the administration for help because the \u201cdemand for public transportation is expected to increase at an even higher rate than its population growth.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials agreed that the development of bus rapid-transit systems along six of the Puebla\u2019s key corridors would \u201cprovide significant benefits to Puebla\u2019s population in terms of improved convenience and safety, shorter travel times, and reduced environmental impacts.\u201d\n\nWND had reported on those projects as part of a broader review of Mexico-specific, U.S. funded initiatives. However, in contrast to the USTDA intelligent transportation system and railway endeavors \u2013 which must hire U.S. contractors \u2014 the U.S. Agency for International Development is prohibiting U.S. contractors from participating in a recent assistance scheme.\n\nThe ConnectMEX conference was carried out for USTDA by the Business Council for International Understanding, or BCIU, a New York non-profit whose stated objective is to \u201cfacilitate dialogue and action between business and government to promote international understanding.\u201d\n\nBCIU is led by Chairman Ahmet C. Bozer, a Turkish businessman and president of Coca-Cola International, as well as BCIU President Peter Tichansky, who also serves on a United Nations advisory board \u201cto build a permanent UN memorial to the trans-Atlantic slave tragedy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The Obama administration has taken its corporate-welfare road show to Mexico, where American taxpayers funded a three-day conference over the last week, with an aim to simultaneously subsidize U.S. industry while helping Mexico tap into the U.S. Treasury to fund its national infrastructure plan to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars.
