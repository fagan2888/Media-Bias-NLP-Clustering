Clinton and Crist: The odd couple\n\nWhile everyone\u2019s focused on Hillary Clinton\u2019s next potential campaign, it\u2019s Bill Clinton who\u2019s been racking up frequent-flier miles, trying to get Democrats elected in the midterms.\n\nHe\u2019s crisscrossed the country in the past eight months, doing more than 20 events for Democratic hopefuls from Florida to Kentucky to Rhode Island as the party\u2019s most sought-after surrogate and rainmaker. In some cases, he\u2019s gone to bat for candidates who supported his wife six years ago; in others, he\u2019s gotten behind contenders who have long relationships with the former first couple. And the former Arkansas chief has an obvious soft spot for governors, a group that has received little attention from the current president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAt a campaign rally in Miami Friday, Clinton will test the strength of a relatively new relationship, with Charlie Crist, the Republican-turned-Democrat who\u2019s running for his old job as Florida\u2019s governor. Crist was once a harsh Clinton critic, denouncing him during the impeachment scandal in the late 1990s \u2014 a fact state Republicans have been quick to resurrect.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The McDonnell verdict's lesson: Politicians beware)\n\nBut now, as his wife is eyeing another national campaign, the perennial battleground of Florida looms potentially large for the Clintons. And Bill Clinton and Crist have developed a rapport, speaking a number of times since Crist launched his candidacy, multiple sources familiar with the conversations told POLITICO. Clinton, a famous dispenser of campaign advice with an eye for the granular in a race, has occasionally chewed over Crist\u2019s own bid against GOP Gov. Rick Scott.\n\n\u201cWhoever wins Florida is the next president of the United States,\u201d said John Morgan, a major Democratic donor whose law firm employs Crist. \u201cThat\u2019s just math.\u201d\n\nThe governor is \u201cextremely important,\u201d Morgan added. \u201cThey control the secretary of state, voting days, voting hours.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Crist won his primary last week against Nan Rich that Clinton was able to formally back him. Rich was a supporter of Hillary Clinton, Morgan noted, and now that Crist is the nominee \u201cI think [Clinton\u2019s] hands are untied.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Podesta eyed for Clinton campaign chair)\n\nClinton and Crist had their first real dealings in 2010, when Crist was running for the U.S. Senate as an independent. His advisers sought help from Bill Clinton to get the Democrat, Rep. Kendrick Meek, a longtime Clinton ally, to drop out of the race and thwart then-state Sen. Marco Rubio from winning. Clinton tried, but Meek stayed in and Rubio won. Still, it established some level of political discussion between the Clinton and Crist camps.\n\nThe appearance with Crist will cap a week of campaigning for Democratic gubernatorial candidates by Clinton. Earlier, he attended events for Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy and Maine candidate Mike Michaud. While in Maine, he stopped by Kennebunkport to pay a visit to former President George H.W. Bush, with whom he has forged a bond since working with him on post-Hurricane Katrina relief.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The POLITICO 50)\n\nClinton will attend a fundraiser on Saturday for embattled Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu and another one the following weekend for Georgia Democratic Senate hopeful Michelle Nunn.\n\nThe former president did an ad for Rhode Island treasurer candidate Seth Magaziner, the son of Clinton\u2019s longtime adviser Ira Magaziner. He is doing a direct mail piece for Nina Turner\u2019s secretary of state race in Ohio, another key presidential proving ground.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "A campaign rally in Miami will test the strength of a relatively new relationship.", "title": "Clinton and Crist: The odd couple", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/bill-clinton-charlie-crist-florida-2014-election-110625.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/09/04/140904_clinton_crist_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Democrats,Hillary Clinton,2014 Elections,Bill Clinton,Charlie Crist", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "A campaign rally in Miami will test the strength of a relatively new relationship.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde085\"", "article_summary": "Clinton and Crist: The odd coupleWhile everyone\u2019s focused on Hillary Clinton\u2019s next potential campaign, it\u2019s Bill Clinton who\u2019s been racking up frequent-flier miles, trying to get Democrats elected in the midterms.\nAnd Bill Clinton and Crist have developed a rapport, speaking a number of times since Crist launched his candidacy, multiple sources familiar with the conversations told POLITICO.\nHe is doing a direct mail piece for Nina Turner\u2019s secretary of state race in Ohio, another key presidential proving ground.\nRich was a supporter of Hillary Clinton, Morgan noted, and now that Crist is the nominee \u201cI think [Clinton\u2019s] hands are untied.\u201d( Also on POLITICO: Podesta eyed for Clinton campaign chair)Clinton and Crist had their first real dealings in 2010, when Crist was running for the U.S. Senate as an independent.\nStill, it established some level of political discussion between the Clinton and Crist camps."}
