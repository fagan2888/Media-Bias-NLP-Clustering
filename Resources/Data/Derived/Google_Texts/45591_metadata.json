Don\u2019t give up internet video just yet \u2014 there are some things that you can do to maximize performance. Many of them don\u2019t cost a cent!\n\nStep 1: A good router\n\nThe first thing to look at, however, does cost a little money: a good router.\n\nYour ISP might provide you with a basic wireless router or you might have one that you picked up in a Black Friday sale for $30, but it probably isn\u2019t helping your connection live up to its full potential. Investing in a quality router can make a big difference.\n\nLook for a router that offers packet prioritization and quality of service (QoS) features. They\u2019ll let you choose which apps and computers get first crack at available bandwidth and which you\u2019d prefer to restrict. You may, for example, not want torrent downloading apps running full speed during the day.\n\nFor DIY types, third-party router firmware like Tomato USB or DD-WRT is worth checking out. As long as you purchase a router with a compatible chipset, you can flash these custom-built firmwares and add loads of new functionality (including QoS) without having to spend big on a tricked-out router at the store. Some companies even sell routers with DDWRT preinstalled.\n\nStep 2: The technical stuff that makes a difference\n\nChanging the DNS servers on your router can help, too. Try running Gibson Research\u2019s DNS benchmark tool. It\u2019ll quickly show you which public DNS servers return the fastest responses to your computer. Assuming you know how to access the router\u2019s administration interface, you can hop in, insert the two best DNS servers the tool located, and start saving a few precious milliseconds of lookup time.\n\nAnother thing that can help speed up surfing is a caching proxy server. Squid is a good, free option \u2014 and you don\u2019t necessarily have to have a spare Linux box lying around to use it. A Windows executable is available too, thanks to the crew of Acme Consulting.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a ton of devices connecting at the same time, good ol\u2019 WinGate is still around, too. It\u2019s free to use for up to three simultaneous connections and it\u2019s a bit less intimidating to set up than Squid.\n\nWhy use a caching proxy? It can speed up access to frequently-used resources, and every device you configure to use the proxy will reap the benefits.\n\nStep 3: Look to your browser\n\nNow, what about your browser? All the major browsers are much better now than they were even last year, but which one is best for slow connections? There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all browser, so the best thing to do is keep an open mind and give several of them a try.\n\nOpera, for example, has its slick Off-road Mode which can make surfing on sluggish connections feel a whole lot faster. When it\u2019s turned on, webpages you request first get compressed and optimized by Opera\u2019s remote proxy servers. Image quality is reduced and things may not always look perfect, but when speed is the top concern that\u2019s a sacrifice worth making.\n\nGoogle Chrome offers loads of features that are designed to make it feel faster, too. Chrome can pre-fetch content it thinks you\u2019re going to access in the background so that it loads more quickly when you click a link. It\u2019s pretty good at predicting where you\u2019ll click, too, which shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Google knows an awful lot about the browsing habits of Chrome users, after all.\n\nInternet Explorer 11 offers similar predictive browsing and pre-loading features, and they can make it appear every bit as fast as Chrome on most popular websites.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to get your hands dirty, Firefox might be the best option. There are so loads of helpful extensions available and an endless list of toggles you can test on the about:config page (just make sure to keep tabs on the changes you make) that will help improve browser performance on slow connections.\n\nAnd the rest\u2026\n\nAnother piece of software worth checking out is a good download manager. If you frequently download very large files, you might want to consider installing an app that can schedule transfers. Free Download Manager is a good one, as is JDownloader \u2014 just make sure you grab the scheduler add-on for it.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for some more advanced ways to speed things up, you may want to consider a renting a virtual private server (VPS). They\u2019re a great way to minimize transfer times, and they\u2019re not as expensive to rent as you might think.", "article_metadata": {"zdid": 1580989, "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "@geekdotcom", "description": "For most people home internet connections have gotten a whole lot faster over the past decade, but in some places today even a 5 megabit (Mbps) connection seems blazing fast.
