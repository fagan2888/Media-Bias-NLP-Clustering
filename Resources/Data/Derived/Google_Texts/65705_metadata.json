We train them here, we raise them here and now they have jobs, they don\u2019t have to go elsewhere.\u201d\n\nFlorence Mayor Stephen Wukela said earlier this week that this is just one of many upgrades that will be coming to this area.\n\n\u201cWhen they are putting so much money into one spot, in florence, it says to me that this is going to be a place that is happening for years to come,\u201d Gray said.\n\nThe new jobs are expected to be in tact by December of 2015.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Quinton Gray, an MBA student at Francis Marion University is excited and hopeful for the new changes coming to downtown Florence.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_06b9e1fdab4924636f286ef7ff3fe2fa", "og": {"site_name": "WBTW.com", "description": "Quinton Gray, an MBA student at Francis Marion University is excited and hopeful for the new changes coming to downtown Florence.", "title": "More than 150 new job opportunities in Florence", "url": "http://wbtw.com/2014/11/21/more-than-150-new-job-opportunities-in-florence/", "image": {"width": 320, "identifier": "http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8f0835f18bc1d1939fc9e0f3ee3667db?s=200&ts=1464220608", "height": 180}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Quinton Gray, an MBA student at Francis Marion University is excited and hopeful for the new changes coming to downtown Florence.", "creator": "@wbtwnews13", "image": "http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8f0835f18bc1d1939fc9e0f3ee3667db?s=240", "title": "More than 150 new job opportunities in Florence", "site": "wbtwnews13", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "msapplication-tooltip": "Myrtle Beach, Florence SC News, Weather, Sports", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540732783", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WBTW.com", "google-site-verification": "sKiGHRJ4PLYZDhmjRqAd2omwp83Wb6Zpdmli8JiKSDw", "keywords": "News Uncategorized", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WBTWNews13", "published_time": "2014-11-21T13:01:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-21T13:01:04+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wbtw.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8f0835f18bc1d1939fc9e0f3ee3667db?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefe0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFor Francis Marion Students, I think this is a good development that will keep students here in the Pee Dee.\nMed-Enroll isn\u2019t just bringing new life to downtown Florence, it\u2019s creating 153 jobs which is a huge opportunity for Francis Marion Students.\nDoctor Susan Peters the Director at the Center of Entrepreneurship at Francis Marion thinks this investment is one worthwhile.\nFlorence City Council approves plan for new downtown 85 unit apartment complex (Image 1)Quinton Gray, an MBA student at Francis Marion University is excited and hopeful for the new changes coming to downtown Florence.\n\u201cNot only can we place our nurses in great hospitals in florence, but we can actually place business students and place engineers and place management students straight into a very well-paying job, straight out of college\u201d Gray said."}
