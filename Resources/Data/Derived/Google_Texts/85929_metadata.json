Rick Womick and his Republican cohorts in state government are looking for a way to respond to the Supreme Court ruling which granted marriage equality to gays and lesbians.\n\nSpecifically, some lawmakers are trying to figure out a way they can enable any narrow-minded state employees to refuse providing services to same-gender couples.\n\nJesus has already given Womick, his fellow state legislators and any bigoted state employees the appropriate response: \u201cLove thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d (Matthew 22:39)\n\nThose calling themselves Christians in our state legislature should get busy and do the Lord\u2019s work by extending health-care coverage to their neighboring families who cannot afford healing.\n\nThat effort would be far more worthy of the special session they are urging our governor to call in opposition to social justice.\n\nAlan Edwards\n\nNashville 37201\n\nBusiness owners\u2019 prerogatives\n\nIn the 1960s when the hippies began to come out of the woodwork, restaurant owners and other business establishments posted signs saying, \u201cNo shirts, no shoes, no service.\u201d\n\nWas that discrimination against the hippies? Or, did the business owners have the right to refuse service to those whom they chose not to serve?\n\nWhat is the difference between that and business owners today (wedding chapels, bakeries, florists, etc.) refusing service to those seeking a same-sex wedding ceremony?\n\nDo business owners not have the right to serve (or to refuse to serve) whom they will? Where does someone else\u2019s \u201crights\u201d infringe on my \"rights\"?\n\nIncidentally, I still see signs saying, \u201cNo shirts, no shoes, no service.\u201d More power to those business owners.\n\nHugh Fulford\n\nGallatin 37066\n\nViolating one\u2019s oath\n\nRe: \u201cBill would \u2018protect\u2019 clergy from performing gay marriages,\u201d June 26.\n\n\u201cThere's nothing in state or federal law that requires clergy to officiate any wedding.\u201d\n\nANY wedding, not just same-sex weddings.\n\nAnd as far as I know, there never has been.\n\nSo why are all these Chicken Littles running around crying that the sky is falling? Are they so paranoid that if they don't have something real to be afraid of, they have to make something up?\n\nElected officials take an oath to obey the law.\n\nIf they feel their religion interferes with their ability to obey the law: 1) they were lying when they took that oath, 2) they need to find another job.\n\nState employees are also expected to obey the law. If they can't, they need to find another job.\n\nWhat if they decide they can't serve black people or Jews or Mormons or Muslims or Hindus or Buddhists or anybody else who isn\u2019t a white heterosexual Christian?\n\nYes, you have to obey Supreme Court rulings, whether you agree with them or not. What other Supreme Court decisions do the legislators want to ignore?\n\nWhy don\u2019t they just vote to secede from the Union and then they won\u2019t have to obey the U.S. Constitution or the U. S. Supreme Court?\n\nThat would settle the issue once and for all, wouldn't it?\n\nElise Stevens\n\nNashville 37216\n\nHurdles after same-sex marriage ruling (Photo: Cagle Cartoons)\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1S3u5Mu", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Readers sound off on same-sex marriage and the Supreme Court ruling.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Readers sound off on same-sex marriage and the Supreme Court ruling.", "title": "Letters, July 27: Gay marriage ruling", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/07/25/letters-july-27-gay-marriage-ruling/30644251/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Readers sound off on same-sex marriage and the Supreme Court ruling.", "title": "Letters, July 27: Gay marriage ruling", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/35a106a2ea6ae3b1f2cf775c1c33f3bc581c36c3/c=0-40-800-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/20/Nashville/B9318147105Z.1_20150720201820_000_G27BD72UV.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/U.S. same-sex marriage ruling", "gci-categories": "Events/U.S. same-sex marriage ruling", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Letters, July 27: Gay marriage ruling", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1ee374163b8d091cff89bfa41d3047d13ab4d364/c=70-0-730-880/local/-/media/2015/07/20/Nashville/B9318147105Z.1_20150720201820_000_G27BD72UV.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/59cddb8796e1d9ff4ee40b41c3d02b7a867b9a87/c=0-40-800-840/local/-/media/2015/07/20/Nashville/B9318147105Z.1_20150720201820_000_G27BD72UV.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0262d44234c1b35c81f26eb93ac984f3fc3d1602/c=0-133-798-733/local/-/media/2015/07/20/Nashville/B9318147105Z.1_20150720201820_000_G27BD72UV.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/90d7673ff299351c7f80ea9bc38ce91d9c9b4c1c/c=0-215-800-665&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/07/20/Nashville/B9318147105Z.1_20150720201820_000_G27BD72UV.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-26T06:02:00.240000-05:00", "shorthed": "Letters, July 27: Gay marriage ruling", "articleid": 30644251, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d58edc4d6dafb9e71c1149df371563b4052b46ba/c=0-215-800-665/local/-/media/2015/07/20/Nashville/B9318147105Z.1_20150720201820_000_G27BD72UV.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b16f1d36c848ca4495d2a4406feaea80a5e58268/c=152-0-645-880/local/-/media/2015/07/20/Nashville/B9318147105Z.1_20150720201820_000_G27BD72UV.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "gay marriage, same-sex marriage, bible, webster's dictionary, civil war"}, "article_summary": "Elise StevensNashville 37216Hurdles after same-sex marriage ruling (Photo: Cagle Cartoons)Read or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1S3u5Mu\nReaders sound off on same-sex marriage and the Supreme Court ruling.\nTennie NobleCharlotte 37036Love thy neighborRe: \u201cGay marriage opponents seek court ruling response,\u201d July 21.\nYes, you have to obey Supreme Court rulings, whether you agree with them or not.\nOr, did the business owners have the right to refuse service to those whom they chose not to serve?"}
