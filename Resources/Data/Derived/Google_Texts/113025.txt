Donald Trump wants a soft media vetting even as he promises to carry out a hardline presidency on immigration, terror, and civil rights. But to cite his own line, “we don’t have a country” when a nominee for President refuses to release his taxes. Why? Because in 1972, the Vice President plead no contest to tax evasion and the President’s returns were being audited; the country clearly decided it did not want criminals in charge of its government, the world’s highest office.

Trump does not get the idea of standards. Paying taxes properly shows a standard of responsibility, without the excuse of government “throwing money down the drain.” Trump believes there are no standards he cannot bend; is it also true of his taxes?

The nine Chairs of House committees who endorsed him bent–and certainly lack any semblance of moral integrity or truthfulness by the claims in their announcement: ““This great nation cannot endure eight more years of Democrat-control of the White House. . .It is paramount that we . . . maintain control of both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Any other outcome is a danger to economic growth, puts our national security in peril, enshrines ObamaCare as the law of the land, entraps Americans in a cycle of poverty and dependence, and undermines our constitutional republic.” “To solidify this partnership, we endorse Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee for President and call upon all Americans to support him.”

For these Congressional chairs, whose party put the country into the worst recession in a century and whose answer was to call for cuts in safety nets; once their danger (only days ago!), Trump is now their answer.
