Survey says the top choice is \u201cBush\u201d (followed by \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201chonest\u201d). I read this result as negative, confirmed by these results that include Clinton, Biden, Rubio, Trump, and Sanders:\n\nJeb Bush has a negative 32 \u2013 41 percent favorability rating among all voters, with Clinton getting a negative 39 \u2013 51 percent score, her worst ever.

Trump and Clinton have the worst scores among top candidates on honesty. Clinton is not honest and trustworthy, voters say 61 \u2013 34 percent, her lowest score ever; Trump is not honest and trustworthy, voters say 54 \u2013 38 percent.\n\nHot Air\u2019s Jazz Shaw has more here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "What words represent the top choices that respondents associate with Hillary Clinton in the latest Quinnipiac poll (full results here)?
