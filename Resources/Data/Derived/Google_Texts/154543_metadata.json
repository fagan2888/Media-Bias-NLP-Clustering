That much is undeniable. Climate change is presenting us with a tremendous, urgent threat, and coal is the dirtiest and largest single source of the fossil fuels still pouring into our atmosphere.\n\nBut while that\u2019s settled (among scientists, if not some particularly stubborn politicians), the conversation about how we\u2019re actually going to transition away from coal is just getting started. And too often left out of that discussion, says journalist Richard Martin, is the human cost of the industry\u2019s decline \u2014 how the people, and communities, built on Big Coal\u2019s promises will be left to fare once it\u2019s no longer in the picture.\n\nTo better understand the dramatic changes afoot, Martin, who is currently the editorial director at the clean energy firm Navigant Research, traveled to the heart of coal country, in both the U.S. and China. His resulting book, \u201cCoal Wars: The Future of Energy and the Fate of the Planet,\u201d tells the stories of people living through the last days of the industry \u2014 and of the industry\u2019s determination to not go quietly.\n\nSalon spoke with Martin about the so-called war on coal and about how environmentalists and Republicans alike can make this necessary transition less painful. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the title of the book. It\u2019s provocative: The \u201cwar on coal\u201d is a phrase that\u2019s mostly thrown around by Republicans. Do you agree with that characterization?\n\nPeople like Mitch McConnell claim there is a war on coal led by the Obama administration, and the fact is whatever you think of the administration\u2019s policies, it\u2019s not federal regulation that\u2019s killing the coal industry, it is broad market forces that have been gathering for years, if not decades. The coal industry was in decline before the EPA released its clean power plan last year and the decline is going to continue beyond Barack Obama\u2019s term in office.\n\nI thought hard about that title before deciding to go with it. My personal opinion is that war metaphors and analogies are overused and they tend to diminish the horrors of real armed conflict. But in this case, I felt like a) that term is out there and b) there is something of a battle, a struggle, a war, if you will, going on between those who want to keep burning fossil fuels, particularly coal, and those who are bent on shutting the coal industry down. Again, whether you think it\u2019s a good thing to limit our consumption of coal or not, the fact is there is a broad and growing consensus that we need to move off of coal. That is true in China, which is the world\u2019s largest producer and consumer of coal, it\u2019s true in the U.S. at a national level, and it\u2019s increasingly true even at a state level in the places where the coal industry has traditionally been the mainstay of the economy.\n\nAgain, the political side of this is not as relevant to me as broad forces that are really forcing us to reckon with what we want to become of the way in which we get our electricity going forward. To play out the metaphor, the coal industry is an empire with no single emperor. But believe me, I\u2019ve spent the last two years looking at a lot of coal plants and a lot of coal mines and it is an empire that stretches worldwide. It is a huge global industry, it accounts for still almost 40 percent of the electricity produced in the U.S., which is down from nearly half just a few years ago. It accounts for three-quarters of the electricity in places like China and it is something of an existential struggle.\n\nThis is not a book of advocacy or environmental policy or technology. The premise of the book is if we don\u2019t do something to drastically reduce our consumption of coal, there is no hope of limiting global climate change. My view is either we shut down the coal industry, or it\u2019s going to shut us down. What the book tries to do is take a look at the human drama and the human costs associated with this effort to transform our power system and really, if not shut down, then certainly limit our ongoing consumption of coal.\n\nOne of the things the book really gets at is that people on the environmental side who think about this as a war see big coal as the enemy \u2014 but there perhaps isn\u2019t enough attention paid to the people who have jobs in the coal industry, who are being affected by the industry\u2019s decline. How did that perspective change the way that you\u2019re thinking about these issues?\n\nI think that\u2019s a great point and I\u2019m glad it comes out in the book. I think what\u2019s happening in the environmental community is there is a growing awareness of the cost of making this huge shift. Certainly the Obama administration just in the last few months has come up with a few initiatives to try to achieve what many people call a just transition \u2014 in other words, to provide some form of hope going forward for the people in these communities. I\u2019ve been in places like Holmes Mill, Kentucky, and let me assure you, there is nothing there except coal. When the coal industry shuts down, as it has already done in many places in Appalachia, there\u2019s nothing for these people to do except get jobs at Wal-Mart or Burger King. Those places have been abandoned and, again, I am all for shifting away from coal but we can\u2019t do it unless we find a way to provide jobs and hope for the people in these communities that have been dependent on coal for decades. As one economic development official in West Virginia said to me, \u201cGoogle is not coming to southwest West Virginia.\u201d Google is not coming to eastern Kentucky. There\u2019s not an economic savior on the horizon.\n\nWhat there are, and what I write about a lot in the book, are a lot of grass-roots efforts to come up with new ways for these people to make their living and provide for their families, whether it\u2019s farming hemp, whether it\u2019s turning mountaintop removal sites into industrial parks that include solar power and so on. I wouldn\u2019t say these efforts have borne a lot of fruit so far, but they\u2019re certainly going on at the community and the county and the state level and that\u2019s where we need to focus our resources. When people like Mitch McConnell stand up in the U.S. Senate and decry the Obama administration\u2019s war on coal, they\u2019re not really helping their constituents. Every hour or dollar spent on fighting the war on coal is a resource that doesn\u2019t go to really helping these people in places where the coal industry is not coming back. That realization has taken hold at the community level, it hasn\u2019t necessarily taken hold in the U.S. Congress.\n\nWe focus a lot on convincing people that coal is contributing to climate change, that climate change is a problem. But if we\u2019re looking for political compromises, or just to not have someone like McConnell fighting every single effort to clean up coal or cut down on its use, it seems the more pertinent argument is just convincing people that this isn\u2019t going to destroy them in the process.\n\nI agree with that. It\u2019s certainly true that the people in these communities are angry and bitter towards the federal government, towards the Obama administration in particular, etc. At the same time, I had plenty of conversations with people who have worked in the coal industry and live in these places, but are starting to acknowledge that this is not the future and we\u2019ve got to find some other way to provide for these families. I\u2019m based in Boulder, Colorado, and I went over to Craig, which is a coal town in the Yampa Valley on the western slope of Colorado, and its mayor worked for 30 years in the coal mine there outside of Craig. But he has worked with local officials and a company called Clean Energy Collective to bring a solar garden to Craig that is literally in the shadows of the Twentymile Coal plant. He\u2019s one of the people who is saying, look, you can submit to these changes or you can get ahead of them. You can drive the car or you can get dragged behind the bumper, and we don\u2019t want to get dragged. He\u2019s one of those people who is by no means a fan of Barack Obama or his energy policies, but who is grappling with the changes that he sees happening around him and is being realistic about the way forward.\n\nYou mentioned before how coal is, at least in the U.S., an industry that is already on the decline. That isn\u2019t Obama\u2019s fault the way some Republicans suggest that it is. What does that suggest to you about whose job it is to start thinking about different ways forward for communities that are still dependent on coal?\n\nI think it\u2019s definitely the job of Barack Obama and the head of the EPA and the congressional delegations from these places. Again, it\u2019s very interesting to see the dichotomy that\u2019s happening in the environmental movement. If you talked to, let\u2019s say, Bill McKibben, whose work I respect quite a bit, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s very focused on what\u2019s going to happen to the people in Holmes Mill, Kentucky, when the divestment movement really spreads. I think somebody like Bill \u2014 who, by the way, contributed a very nice blurb for my book \u2014 if you ask him he would say, yeah, we need to do something for these people, we need to figure out a way forward for these communities. But I think organizations like the Sierra Club have begun to think hard about this and have begun in certain limited ways to incorporate that into, for instance, their Beyond Coal Campaign. It is the job of the people who are working to change our energy system to think about a just transition, but in my opinion, where it\u2019s really going to come from, again, is at the community level. You can offer all the retraining programs at the local community colleges that you want across Appalachia, but the fact is it\u2019s only going to happen by those people getting together and figuring out what are the competitive advantages we have, what are the resources other than coal that we have that we can draw on to really create an economic future in these places.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Coal is an environmental disaster, says journalist Richard Martin, but there's a human cost to its downfall", "title": "What environmentalists get wrong about Big Coal", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Coal is an environmental disaster, says journalist Richard Martin, but there's a human cost to its downfall", "title": "What environmentalists get wrong about Big Coal", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/05/what_environmentalists_get_wrong_about_big_coal/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/coal_truck.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Coal is an environmental disaster, says journalist Richard Martin, but there's a human cost to its downfall", "title": "What environmentalists get wrong about Big Coal", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/coal_truck.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Climate Change, Coal, divestment, fossil fuels, greenhouse-gas emissions, power plant rule", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7264\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Climate Change, Coal, divestment, fossil fuels, greenhouse-gas emissions, power plant rule, Sustainability News, NewsCoal has got to go.\nTo play out the metaphor, the coal industry is an empire with no single emperor.\nSalon spoke with Martin about the so-called war on coal and about how environmentalists and Republicans alike can make this necessary transition less painful.\nMy view is either we shut down the coal industry, or it\u2019s going to shut us down.\nEvery hour or dollar spent on fighting the war on coal is a resource that doesn\u2019t go to really helping these people in places where the coal industry is not coming back."}
