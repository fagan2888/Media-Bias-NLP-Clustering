Nonprofit health insurer Kaiser Permanente, already a giant in the health care industry, is getting even bigger. The organization reported Friday that it was acquiring Group Health Cooperative, a fellow nonprofit insurer based in Seattle that boasts nearly 600,000 members.

“This agreement is a natural extension of our long, successful working relationship with Group Health and it provides us with the opportunity to expand access to high-quality, affordable care and coverage,” said Bernard J. Tyson, chairman and CEO, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals. “Kaiser Permanente and Group Health Cooperative are a natural fit. The opportunity to unite will allow us to best serve the current and future needs of our members, customers and employees. We look forward to welcoming the people of Group Health Cooperative into the Kaiser Permanente family.”
