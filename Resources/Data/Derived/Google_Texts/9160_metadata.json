The president of the world\u2019s biggest economy cannot use an Apple smartphone. The reason is simple: even though some people consider the iPhone to be one of the safest smartphones available on the market, the Secret Service does not allow Barack Obama to use a smartphone from Apple due to security concerns; at least that is what Obama told to a group of people visiting the White House last week on Wednesday.\n\nAFP reports that according to Barack Obama, a super secure smartphone from Canadian telecommunication company BlackBerry is the only smartphone he is allowed to use as the head of the United States of America. ?I\u2019m not allowed for security reasons to have an iPhone [\u2026]? \u2013 that is what Barack Obama said during an event that promotes his health care initiative (also known as Obamacare). He also mentioned that both of his daughters (Malia and Sasha) own an iPhone and they spend a lot of their time using their smartphones from Apple.\n\nConsidering how strict security detail is with the president of the United States, this news doesn\u2019t really surprise us. Not to mention that Barack Obama wasn\u2019t even allowed to own a BlackBerry by the Secret Service; he had to fight in order to convince them to allow him to keep one and the Secret Service didn\u2019t like it. The permission to use a BlackBerry however, came with a cost: Barack Obama is only allowed to use his BlackBerry for communication with about ten individuals, which eh says is ?no fun?.\n\nA September report from the Washington Post said that presidents invariably fall behind times when it comes to using the latest gadgets because ?there are some legitimate security and legal constraints?; this means that it is almost impossible for presidents to use digital services just like any other consumer.\n\nApple\u2019s sixth iteration of its mobile Operating System, iOS 6, was granted a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 level 1 validation, which means that a few government agencies are allowed to approve use of special devices running iOS 6; however, that doesn\u2019t mean all government officials can use iOS 6 devices. And in the case of the president of the United States, there are still a lot of things that need to be approved to allow the use of an iOS 6 based device.\n\nWhile it\u2019s possible that some people will interpret Barack Obama\u2019s remark as a hint that the federal government could revise the policies regarding the issue, that was not what the U.S. president was trying to say. He only intended to admit that he wasn\u2019t as up to speed with technology as his listeners.\n\nBarack Obama said: ?Now my suspicion is that for a lot of you, between your cable bill and your phone bill, you\u2019re spending more than $100 a month [\u2026] The idea that you wouldn\u2019t want to make sure you\u2019ve got the health security and financial security that comes with health insurance for less than that price, you guys are smarter than that. Most young people are as well?. You can watch the video here.\n\nThis is not the first time that Barack Obama brings up Apple\u2019s iPhone it his recent rhetoric. Two months ago the U.S. president said that his health care initative (Obamacare) should not be judged too harsh for the initial errors and compared it to how Apple fixes bugs in its mobile Operating System, iOS: \u201cI don\u2019t remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads or threatening to shut down the company if they didn\u2019t [fix a glitch]. That\u2019s not how we do things in America\u201c.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.2", "og": {"site_name": "iOS Doc", "description": "Some of you may know that U.S. president Barack Obama is very fond of BlackBerry smartphones, but since he became the president of the United States, he doesn't have a say when it comes to choosing...", "title": "Obama Not Allowed To Have An iPhone", "url": "http://www.iosdoc.com/obama-not-allowed-to-have-an-iphone/", "image": "http://www.iosdoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.iosdoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obama.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@jetpack", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-site-verification": "K6ogqGVEgCoRhF0cR7DtPtupTQVo75iDdSjNFM288KM", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-12T19:12:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-13T20:59:26+00:00", "author": "http://www.iosdoc.com/author/mihai-puiu/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b27\"", "article_summary": "This is not the first time that Barack Obama brings up Apple\u2019s iPhone it his recent rhetoric.\n\u2013 that is what Barack Obama said during an event that promotes his health care initiative (also known as Obamacare).\nAFP reports that according to Barack Obama, a super secure smartphone from Canadian telecommunication company BlackBerry is the only smartphone he is allowed to use as the head of the United States of America.\nObama Not Allowed To Have An iPhoneSome of you may know that U.S. president Barack Obama is very fond of BlackBerry smartphones, but since he became the president of the United States, he doesn\u2019t have a say when it comes to choosing a smartphone.\n?I\u2019m not allowed for security reasons to have an iPhone [\u2026]?"}
