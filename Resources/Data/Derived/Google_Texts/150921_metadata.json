When asked about the possibility of reforming the immigration system, Speaker John Boehner and the rest of the leadership would mournfully shake their heads and say they\u2019d love to get something done, but they just couldn\u2019t trust President Obama to enforce whatever law they passed. Until that key element of trust could be restored, they said, no legislation would leave the House.\n\nEveryone knew that was a load of crap; the reason Republicans wouldn\u2019t move forward on immigration was that the caucus was terrified of the political blowback from conservatives, and not willing to hand the president a huge legislative victory. Those two obstacles couldn\u2019t be overcome, and the Senate\u2019s immigration reform bill, passed last summer with bipartisan support, slowly died.\n\nThe death of that bill has resulted, predictably, in everyone blaming the other side for the failure to get reform done. But yesterday Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, one of the GOP\u2019s chief proponents for immigration reform, came out and blew some holes in the Republicans\u2019 attempts to deflect blame and said plainly what needs to be said: Republicans killed immigration reform.\n\nDiaz-Balart has been quietly working to cobble together his own reform bill and muster support for it. After Boehner told Obama two weeks ago that no votes on immigration would be held this year, Diaz-Balart made one last plea to the House leadership, and they gave him the same answer: no vote. So he held a press conference yesterday to discuss the \u201cdisappointing and highly unfortunate\u201d turn of events, and let fly with some real talk:\n\nIt is highly irresponsible not to deal with the issue. I know it is difficult, especially when you have a President that failed to build the trust of the American people or the U.S. Congress, and who has done little to enforce current law despite his assertions to the contrary. But we were sent here by the American people precisely to tackle difficult issues and not to take the easy way out.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting statement, in that he gives the GOP\u2019s reason for inaction (mistrust of the president) the due credit you\u2019d expect a Republican to give it, but then says it doesn\u2019t matter because legislators are expected to, you know, legislate.\n\nBut what of this argument that Republicans just couldn\u2019t trust Obama enough to pass a bill? According to Diaz-Balart, that\u2019s not necessarily true. \u201cI feel absolutely confident that we had the majority \u2014 of the majority \u2014 of support from the House Republican Conference,\u201d for his bill, he told reporters. Diaz-Balart could just be blowing smoke on this point; the bill won\u2019t get a vote anyway, so he\u2019s free to invent whatever level of support he wants. Either way, whatever backing was there got wiped out by \u201cmultiple unexpected events \u2014 most recently the primary defeat of Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., and the uproar over the child migrant surge at the southwest border,\u201d according to Roll Call.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
