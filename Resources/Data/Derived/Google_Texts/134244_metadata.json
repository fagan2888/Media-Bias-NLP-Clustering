Voters approved parcel taxes in 2004 and 2011 to keep it afloat, but a third proposed tax in 2014 failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed.\n\nFinancial advisor Harold Emahiser said the problem is that 80 percent of the hospital\u2019s patients are on Medicare or Medi-cal, which doesn\u2019t pay enough for services rendered.\n\n\u201cThe issue here isn\u2019t if the hospital was only run better,\u201d Emahiser said, \u201cIt was not run inefficiently.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the cost per patient day compared to other (East Bay) hospitals, it was 24 percent lower. It\u2019s not a cost issue. It\u2019s a revenue issue. It\u2019s reimbursement.\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBasically this hospital has to go down because it serves too many poor people. That\u2019s not right,\u201d said Michael Parker with the Richmond Progressive Alliance, one of many western Contra Costa residents who lamented the loss of a critical resource.\n\n\u201cWithout this hospital, the residents of West Contra Costa will be deprived of meaningful health care anywhere near their homes,\u201d said Dr. Sharon Drager, who works at the hospital and serves on its governing body.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the hospital closes they\u2019ll lose an emergency room, an advanced cardiovascular unit, a cancer center, an advanced wound center, as well as medical and surgical inpatient and outpatient services. State of the art care for heart attacks will no longer be nearby but many miles away on crowded freeways. As soon as the hospital closes, the medical community will disappear. A hospital is an ecosystem. It\u2019s not a building.\u201d\n\nBut despite many dire predictions, virtually none of the 200 people at the meeting called for a significant delay.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been closing for 10 years. Please set the date, Let us close with dignity,\u201d said Steven Scotty, who works in the cardiac catheter lab.\n\nThe board pushed back the closure date by one week, too see if a last minute proposal by San Diego entrepreneur Larry Anderson to buy the hospital can get off the ground. Anderson has received praise for the turnaround of Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside, but was later fired from his job as CEO.\n\nAnderson\u2019s proposal was only seen by Doctors Medical Center\u2019s lawyer Thursday morning. It includes a Chinese investor and $3 million contributed by the hospital\u2019s doctors. West Contra Costa County Healthcare District Board Vice-Chair John Gioia reluctantly supported the delay, to give the proposal a chance to come together.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go on faith when we decide our fiduciary obligations of whether to keep spending $2 million a month of taxpayer money in the hopes that somebody says they can turn something around,\u201d said Gioia.\n\nAt a cost of $500,000 a week, the hospital could keep running through July in hopes of a financial rescue, but then might not have enough money to pay what\u2019s owed to employees and vendors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The hospital has been in dire financial straits for decades.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Doctors Medical Center to Close in April, Barring Miracle\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/03\\/27\\/doctors-medical-center-to-close-in-april-barring-miracle\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-03-27 09:48:25\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-03-30 10:21:59\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24749,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Doctor's Medical Center\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/03\\/RS14652_IMG_20150326_174348916-e1427474277469.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The hospital has been in dire financial straits for decades.", "title": "Doctors Medical Center to Close in April, Barring Miracle", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/03/27/doctors-medical-center-to-close-in-april-barring-miracle/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/03/Maria-Sahagun-400x225.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "doctor\\'s medical center", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Anderson has received praise for the turnaround of Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside, but was later fired from his job as CEO.\nBy Andrew StelzerDoctors Medical Center in San Pablo will begin shutting its doors next month, barring an angel donor who can make up the hospital\u2019s $18 million deficit.\nThat\u2019s not right,\u201d said Michael Parker with the Richmond Progressive Alliance, one of many western Contra Costa residents who lamented the loss of a critical resource.\nWest Contra Costa County Healthcare District Board Vice-Chair John Gioia reluctantly supported the delay, to give the proposal a chance to come together.\nThe hospital, which serves the largely low-income residents of West Contra Costa County, has been in dire financial straits for almost 20 years."}
