MILWAUKEE (WITI) -- A Milwaukee man is in the hospital in serious condition. He was injured in a hit-and-run that occurred last Thursday, January 29th. His family is asking for help as police search for the driver responsible.

"He doesn`t deserve it one bit. It's just so sad," Yolanda Pacocha said.

Pacocha's brother, 32-year-old Dustin Schlueter is in the ICU at Froedtert Hospital.

"He was on a breathing tube and I guess this morning he was able to start breathing on his own," Pacocha said.

Pacocha says her brother has a broken ankle and bleeding and swelling on his brain.

"The right side of his face is all puffy and blue. He has a big swollen eye," Pacocha said.

Pacocha says her brother had just left work at Schlitz Park Thursday night. He was walking home around 10:00 p.m. when he was struck by a car. Milwaukee police say he was in the crosswalk at Martin Luther King Drive and Cherry Street when he was hit by a car headed southbound. A witness told police the driver stopped briefly before fleeing the scene.

"It`s like, heartless. How can you just leave somebody laying on the ground after you hit them, not to see if they`re okay, if they`re alive and just take off?" Pacocha said.

Police say they are investigating, as Schlueter is asking the public for help.

"If anyone sees anything suspicious with a car maybe around that area call police just so we have an idea of who this person is and try to find them," Pacocha said.

Schlueter's family is optimistic about his recovery, but they're worried about the extent of trauma to his head when he wakes up.

"Hopefully with time everything will start clearing up and he`ll be back to his normal self," Pacocha said.

Schlueter does not have health insurance. An account has been established for him at GoFundMe.com.

Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact Milwaukee police.
