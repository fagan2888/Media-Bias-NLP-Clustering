Two truant teenagers in an empty kitchen. We tried mixing the resulting green powder with water and drinking it. The taste was so foul it was all we could do to stop ourselves vomiting. In the end we mixed it with Cherry Coke to ameliorate the flavor and then we drank it all up.\n\nThe skin contained a naturally occurring psychedelic drug called mescaline. Soon, everything seemed to vibrate. It was as if the walls, windows, even the chairs were humming a low, beautiful melody. Then I noticed that we were speaking in colors. My friend\u2019s words were blue swirls and mine were green. Our conversation curled and twisted in front of my eyes like smoke in a vacuum chamber. Later I held a glass of water, gazing at it for what seemed like an immensely long time, its utility swallowed up in its beauty and it seemed that the whole Earth existed within that glass and the thought occurred to me: \u201cI\u2019m in the presence of God.\u201d\n\nTen years later I was staying in a tiny monastery deep in a Thai forest. I had been living and meditating there for close to a month. My mind was still \u2014 still in the way a tuning fork rests after being struck for a long time. I sat outside watching the fading light graze the trees, feeling egoless and empty of thought. Butterflies erupted from the green foliage in a movement that seemed so excessively beautiful I was thunderstruck and as I looked, I thought: \u201cDamn, this is exactly like mescaline.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just me who has made the link between psychedelic drugs and meditation. Indeed, the link between psychedelics and spiritual experience was the first line of inquiry Timothy Leary and his cohorts pursued in their 1960s Harvard experiments. In the 1990s, Dr. Rick Strassman ran a series of experiments using a powerful psychedelic known as DMT, and he too noticed the similarity: \u201c[The effect of] DMT has a similarity with experiences that are possible with a lot of meditation,\u201d he said.\n\nScientists are currently conducting separate studies on psychedelics and meditation \u2014 both are being trialed to treat the same conditions. A review study by the Journal of the American Medical Association, released in March this year, found that meditation may be as effective as medication in treating conditions such as depression and anxiety. Hot on the heels of this study was the Psilocybin Cancer Anxiety Study at NYU\u2019s Bluestone Center for Clinical Research, which found that Psilocybin (the active drug in \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d) was effective in treating anxiety and depression in terminal cancer patients. There are now dozens of studies that document how both meditation and psychedelics can treat depression, addiction, anxiety and PTSD.\n\nSo if psychedelics produce similar effects to long periods of meditation and other austere religious practices, could we have stumbled upon what Strassman calls \u201cthe spirit molecule\u201d? Are psychedelics an alternative to spiritual practices?\n\nHardly, say the Buddhists. The second noble truth of the Buddha is that \u201cthe origin of suffering is the attachment to desire.\u201d Psychedelics are by their nature an experience, a strange and beautiful one but often elusive. This creates a craving to have the experience again. It is this craving that is the Buddhist definition of discontent. Rather than freeing the mind from attachment, psychedelics create more.\n\nPerhaps the gold standard to measure whether psychedelics are a good substitute for meditation is to see whether fundamental changes in character occur. A meditation instructor once told me: \u201cWhen I took LSD in the \u201960s, it was profound, but it didn\u2019t help me develop the character to live from that truth day by day \u2013 without grounding in morality and mindfulness it was merely a flash of insight.\u201d\n\nRichard Alpert, who was one of the first psychologists to study LSD, and later became the spiritual teacher Ram Dass, has a similar view, \u201cI see them [psychedelics] as a door opener and a catalyst and a facilitator; I don\u2019t see them as a full path.\u201d Alpert also describes what his Indian guru told him after trying LSD himself: \u201cYour drug is useful. It would allow you to come in and have the darshan [vision] of Christ, but you can only stay for two hours and then you\u2019ve got to leave. It would be better to become Christ than visit him, but your medicine won\u2019t do that, because it\u2019s not the true samadhi [enlightenment].\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mind-altering drugs can open us up to the amazing possibilities of the universe \u2014\u00a0but true self-discovery is harder", "title": "True secrets of psychedelics: Are they everything they\u2019re cracked up to be?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Mind-altering drugs can open us up to the amazing possibilities of the universe \u2014\u00a0but true self-discovery is harder", "title": "True secrets of psychedelics: Are they everything they\u2019re cracked up to be?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/08/true_secrets_of_psychedelics_are_they_everything_theyre_cracked_up_to_be/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/enter_the_void_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mind-altering drugs can open us up to the amazing possibilities of the universe \u2014\u00a0but true self-discovery is harder", "title": "True secrets of psychedelics: Are they everything they\u2019re cracked up to be?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/enter_the_void_2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nathan A.
