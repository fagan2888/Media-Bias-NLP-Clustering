S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear two cases challenging Obamacare\u2019s HHS Mandate, abortion advocates are trying to scare women into thinking that the courts are about to take away their precious right to infertility.\n\nIn response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hear the two cases, NARAL Pro-Choice America asked, \u201cWill bosses be able to deny women birth control?\u201d\n\nOf course, nothing could be further from the truth. The lawsuits challenge the government\u2019s right to force the employer to pay for a woman\u2019s birth control in her employer-provided health insurance. No one is telling women that they can\u2019t walk down to the corner Walgreens and buy whatever birth control they want.\n\nA legitimate question is: Why is that an employer\u2019s responsibility?\n\nFertility is a natural condition of a woman. Taking a drug to override the body\u2019s natural state is hardly the responsibility of a company\u2019s owner. And plenty of studies have shown that the birth control pill is not particularly healthy for a woman to be taking.\n\nLinda Greenhouse, in a New York Times op-ed, calls the effort on the part of those companies that have brought the lawsuits against the birth control mandate \u201ca war on modernity.\u201d Evidently modern women don\u2019t want to risk becoming mothers, and they don\u2019t want to pay for it either.\n\nWhat a sad commentary on womanhood. I find it so frustrating and truly disappointing that all the feminist movement has come to is contraception and abortion. It is bad enough that feminist leaders campaign for abortion on demand and free birth control, but it is a real indictment of 21st century women that they buy this definition of themselves.\n\nI guess it is an admission of my age that I grew up in an era when it mattered to women that they be perceived as \u201cladies.\u201d That didn\u2019t mean that we couldn\u2019t have lots of fun and get involved in interesting activities. But it implied that we had a certain self-respect and wanted others to respect us as well. Yes, there were fewer opportunities for women academically and in the working environment. But it was not necessary to throw off all vestiges of respect to make gains in the boardroom and the classroom.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing that so many women don\u2019t respect their true womanhood and embrace fertility as a gift. If they are as smart as they like to think they are, they might be able to learn how to work with nature.\n\nThen no one would have to spend any money on birth control.\n\nLifeNews Note: Ann Scheidler writes for the Pro-Life Action League.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Feminism Has Reduced Women to Contraception and Abortion", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Now that the U.
