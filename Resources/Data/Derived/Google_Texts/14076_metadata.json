Worries that a handful of first-term senators in the mix might suggest a lack of seriousness about the real work of governance were brushed off by pointing to Barack Obama as precedent.\n\nNow the party\u2019s rising stars are two men who have exactly as much experience in government as they do interest in making government work. Their fealty to the Republican Party is almost as recent as their decision to run for president. Carson was a registered independent until 2014, and Trump flaunts his pan-ideological predilections to this very day.\n\nConservatives like to paint liberals as slaves to sentiment. The \u201cbleeding hearts\u201d sobriquet also connotes eyes too misty with tears to see the hard truths: We legislate based on immigrant sob stories and vote for presidential candidates to salve our own guilty consciences. Trump\u2019s politically incorrect shtick is just another way of calling out this supposed divide: \u201cWe\u2019re tired of the nice people,\u201d he says, and by saying it creates a truth if it didn\u2019t exist before.\n\nFor his part, Carson has been eager to prove his soothing bedside manner is an interface, not a core value. His youthful Democratic sympathies were Kool-Aid-induced; Reagan \u201creprogram[med]\u201d him: \u201cHe sounded like a logical person and my mind changed.\u201d\n\nSince the neocons first uncracked themselves from the Ivy League, the conservative movement has masqueraded as the \u201cthink, not feel\u201d wing of American politics. But their courtship of nativists, segregationists, and other grievance-seekers has led to this Trump/Carson moment. Not the party of ideas, but the party of stupid, where even smart, successful people have to pander to the dumb and incoherently angry.\n\nAccording to CNN, 75 percent of those supporting candidates with no previous electoral experience are attracted to \u201ctheir views on the issues.\u201d I suspect that respondents selected that answer because they couldn\u2019t just grunt.\n\nTrump\u2019s distaste for policy specifics could fill dozens of white papers that he\u2019d never read. The fact that Carson justified his damning of Obamacare as \u201cworse than 9/11\u201d because the 9/11 attack was \u201can isolated event\u201d speaks to his ignorance about terrorism as much as it does about the effects of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Trump and Carson are winning a huge slice of the GOP base because of that prideful ignorance, which to voters signifies not just a rejection of the establishment or elites but a release from the hard work of having to think.\n\nLet me be clear: To say Carson and Trump are anti-intellectual doesn\u2019t mean they are dumb. Far from it.\n\nTrump, especially, has shown a genius\u2014a high-level forethought, not some native street smarts\u2014in how he communicates his\u2026 oh, let\u2019s call it his \u201cvision.\u201d Carson, too, has crafted his brand to appeal to those tired of ideas and arguing and philosophical debates. Given Carson\u2019s smooth affect, his marketing handiwork is, ironically, a less subtle product than Trump\u2019s; it shows the seams from where Carson has had to forcibly rip out the parts of his intellectual history that evince a deviation from the full-throated anti-establishmentarianism the Republican base now demands. (Forget his much-discussed turnaround on abortion: what about endorsing death panels, affirmative action, and eliminating for-profit insurance companies?)\n\nBoth Trump and Carson are brilliant in leveraging their extraordinary professional success as bait to voters whose principal complaint hinges on a nagging sense of failure. Audiences aren\u2019t flocking to these brutalist polymaths for their ideas. Indeed, in a party already thirsty for innovative policy approaches, Trump and Carson stand out for the pride they take in their xeriscape platforms: empty places, where occasional quasi-insights drift by like tumbleweeds, unmoored from experience or data.\n\nTrump\u2019s screechingly casual approach to information is especially appalling. An anecdote in a recent Rolling Stone profile charts the route from Trump\u2019s complete ignorance on the heroin epidemic in the Northeast (\u201cYou know New Hampshire has a huge problem with heroin? Why do ya s\u2019pose that is?\u201d), to his query of the reporter for information (\u201cI tell him that it probably has to do with OxyContin and school kids raiding their parents\u2019 medicine chests\u201d), to his airy reference in a speech minutes later: \u201cIt starts probably with OxyContin, from what I\u2019m hearing.\u201d The conclusion implies, among other things, that this is a subject he may have discussed more than once.\n\nFrom the embroidered, hearsay nature of Trump\u2019s answers to concrete questions, I would say he treats facts like gossip\u2014except I\u2019m sure he takes gossip more seriously than facts. Trump knows he is expected to have some command of issues beyond \u201cdeals,\u201d and so he clings to one or two more-or-less certain applause lines like a sticky-fingered child. Witness these excruciating exchanges with a slumming Hugh Hewitt, in which Trump dismisses questions about the intricacies of Middle East foreign policy with a koan-like recitation, \u201cThe Kurds, by the way, have been horribly mistreated.\u201d He says this even when the question is about Hezbollah, or al-Baghdadi\u2014or, points for trying, the \u201cQuds.\u201d\n\nSuch rote memorized factlets have all the substance of cotton candy, and when he stretches them to apply to topics outside his limited scope of knowledge, they tatter and fall apart embarrassingly. Or, what would be embarrassing, if it were not for the fact that Trump has been able to rely on the underlying distrust his supporters have for experts.\n\nCarson is not much better. If Trump\u2019s shameless doubletalk (to evangelical voters, especially) suggests he thinks his supporters are suckers, Carson thinks his are rubes. His compulsory campaign tome is punctuated with what should be hackle-raising condescension, or at least revealingly faulty logic: \u201cIf you know all 26 letters of the alphabet, you are on your way to reading.\u201d Perhaps he thought he was writing an audiobook script.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Why am I here?\u201d One thing (neurosurgery) has nothing to do with the other (the presidency), and to pretend the skills are transferable is an insult\u2014mostly to neurosurgeons.\n\nCarson has a predictable defense to his nonchalant naivet\u00e9: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody who knows everything,\u201d after all. He\u2019ll delegate, just like how when he \u201cruns into a kidney problem\u2026 will call in a renal specialist!\u201d But he\u2019s giving comfort to the patient by only taking the analogy halfway. The real parallel wouldn\u2019t be a surgeon calling in for help on a single complication, it would be having a really smart diplomat trying to figure out how to run an ER.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between being anti-intellectual and being dumb; there\u2019s also a difference between having a governing philosophy and being smart. Scott Walker, for instance, has a more-or-less coherent approach to governing (do less and less of it). But he appears to be impersonating an honest-to-goodness dumbass, incapable of answering the simplest questions without sinking into the rhetorical version of Zeno\u2019s paradox. He gets halfway to a definitive opinion, then halfway again, forever splitting the distance between himself and, it seems, the nomination.\n\nWalker, like all the other Republican politicians with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that matches the job opening, has been reduced to playing dumb. Is it an accident that the first major candidate to drop out was also the one with the longest gubernatorial r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nYou can\u2019t spend 40 years tacitly making racists feel welcome in your party and expect the intellectual atmosphere not to suffer, or for that anti-intellectualism to stay bounded with race.\n\nNot only does the GOP\u2019s history of leveraging racism, if not explicitly endorsing it, explain Trump\u2019s success (as numerous commentators have pointed out), it also explains Carson\u2019s rise\u2014and not just as embedded in the sideways condescension of considering Carson \u201cnot like the others.\u201d Carson appeals to the same anti-intellectual, anti-government, anti-idea, anti-democratic set of biases the GOP establishment has been cultivating for decades.\n\nBigotry entered into the conservative movement\u2019s DNA like a virus, altering the intellectual inheritance of the party of Bill Buckley and Irving Kristol. Where once it meant something to declare certain attitudes or policies too ugly or hateful to take seriously, much less include in debate, there is now a movement that can\u2019t afford to call out bald ignorance and gross sexism for fear the most ardent banner-carriers might get offended. They say it\u2019s the left that is governed by political correctness, but the deference paid to the sensitivity of Trump\u2019s followers is as oppressive as any campus trigger warning.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "anamariecox"}, "keywords": "Politics-Election, 2016 Election, 2016, Ben Carson, u.s. poli, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, GOP race", "publicationDate": 201509140508, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Decades of leveraging racism plus pandering to the dumb and incoherently angry explains not only the success of the billionaire\u2014but also the neurosurgeon.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "How the Party of Stupid Birthed Trump and Carson", "tags": "article:politics-election,obsessional:2016-election,entity:event/2016_election,entity:person/ben_carson,topic:politics,entity:person/donald_trump,obsessional:donald-trump,entity:politicalevent/gop_race", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"How the \u2018Party of Stupid\u2019 Birthed Trump and Carson\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/14/how-the-party-of-stupid-birthed-trump-and-carson.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/09/14/how-the-party-of-stupid-birthed-trump-and-carson/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/48075611.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/09/14/how-the-party-of-stupid-birthed-trump-and-carson\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-09-14T05:08:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Ana Marie Cox\",\"tags\":[\"politics-election\",\"2016-election\",\"2016_election\",\"ben_carson\",\"politics\",\"donald_trump\",\"donald-trump\",\"gop_race\"]}", "news_keywords": "PoliticsElection, 2016 Election, 2016 election, Ben Carson, US Politics, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, GOP race", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Ana Marie Cox", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-09-14T05:08:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/ana-marie-coxhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/09/14/how-the-party-of-stupid-birthed-trump-and-carson", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Decades of leveraging racism plus pandering to the dumb and incoherently angry explains not only the success of the billionaire\u2014but also the neurosurgeon.", "title": "How the \u2018Party of Stupid\u2019 Birthed Trump and Carson", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/14/how-the-party-of-stupid-birthed-trump-and-carson.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/09/14/how-the-party-of-stupid-birthed-trump-and-carson/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1442268348393.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/a/ana-marie-cox", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca002\"", "article_summary": "Not the party of ideas, but the party of stupid, where even smart, successful people have to pander to the dumb and incoherently angry.\nCarson was a registered independent until 2014, and Trump flaunts his pan-ideological predilections to this very day.\nLet me be clear: To say Carson and Trump are anti-intellectual doesn\u2019t mean they are dumb.\nBoth Trump and Carson are brilliant in leveraging their extraordinary professional success as bait to voters whose principal complaint hinges on a nagging sense of failure.\nFor his part, Carson has been eager to prove his soothing bedside manner is an interface, not a core value."}
