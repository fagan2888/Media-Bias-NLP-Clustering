Brian Kuester, District Attorney for the 27th Prosecutorial District of Oklahoma, said Daniel Beaty was sentenced to 13 years with all but the first five suspended.\n\nBeaty was charged with 13 counts of arson in April after Tahlequah police arrested him for the crimes. Authorities say he confessed to setting around 40 fires over the past two years.\n\nMany of the fires went unreported, so he was only charged with the 13. Police say surveillance video from a nearby business showed Beaty setting one fire, leading to his arrest.\n\nBeaty, 20, was sentenced June 24, 2015, Kuester said in a news release.\n\n3/24/2015 Related Story: Fire Chief: Tahlequah Teen Admits To Over 2 Dozen Arsons", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A Tahlequah man entered a guilty plea and was sentenced in a serial arson investigation.
