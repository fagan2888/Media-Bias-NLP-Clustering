State Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler has called for an extension of the enrollment deadline due to the numerous technical glitches and errors that have hampered signups and renewals, but the exchange said there won\u2019t be a formal extension.\n\nDetails about the special enrollment process for customers stuck in the system will be released later today.\n\nBy the second week of December, close to 56,000 people had bought health insurance or renewed their coverage through Healthplanfinder. The exchange has not released updated numbers, but officials reported a surge in signups as the deadline for Jan. 1 coverage approaches. Close to 7,000 customers bought a plan through the exchange from Friday to Sunday alone.\n\nPeople who do not have insurance through an employer or government program such as Medicare or Medicaid can buy individual insurance for themselves and their families until Feb. 15. The state\u2019s goal is to enroll 215,000 people through Healthplanfinder by that date. People seeking insurance can also buy plans directly from insurance companies or through brokers. Plan bought outside of the exchange, however, are not eligible to tax benefits that can lower the cost of coverage and medical bills.\n\nCustomers who need help can call the toll-free customer support line at 1-855-923-4633. They can also find an insurance broker or a navigator specially trained to maneuver the sign-up process through the links at the bottom of the exchange\u2019s homepage.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "Washington consumers who want health insurance coverage beginning Jan. 1 must renew or sign up and make their first payment by 5 p.m. today.
