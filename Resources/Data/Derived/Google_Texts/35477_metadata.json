The book is all about the Millennial generation and addresses how we can take back our futures and achieve the American Dream which is difficult, but not impossible to do, thanks to Obama\u2019s policies.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBefore 2016, it\u2019s crucial that Millennials\u2013the majority of whom voted for Obama twice\u2013realize that the policies of Warren and Clinton will only set them back further. I wrote this book in a way that\u2019s enlightening\u2013it contains 3 years of research\u2013yet accessible and fun to read.\n\nBreitbart News: Ok, and you\u2019ve written about a number of issues in the book here, so tell us about the economy. How has he destroyed the economy for Millennials?\n\nK: Obamacare is a perfect example of a huge new regulation that will particularly set our generation back. I interviewed close to 300 doctors and surgeons to get their feedback and alternative solutions to Obamacare so we can provide affordable, high-quality insurance to all Americans. Those solutions are included in the book, including a legal way to opt-out of the ACA until the law is repealed. Congress could use these ideas\u2013from real health professionals\u2013as a starting place for writing better legislation.\n\nCurrently, about 15 percent of Millennials are unemployed and over a third, which is an all-time high, have been living in their parents\u2019s basements during the Obama years. I have a background in commercial real estate. One \u201cservice\u201d that I provide for Millennials in \u201cLet Me Be Clear\u201d is an important, yet entertaining-to-read, historical explanation for how you can trace this entire economic downturn to the housing policies of Presidents Carter, Clinton\u2013and, though to a lesser degree, even Bush.\n\nI then show and how President Obama exacerbated these poor housing policies, which helps explain why our economy has not recovered. This historical storyline allows Millennials\u2013too young to remember these policies\u2013to see that instead of voting for Warren or Clinton in 2016, they will be better off supporting someone who will promote a more entrepreneurial form of government. 70 percent of Millennials aspire to become entrepreneurs according to a recent study from Deloitte. So, in order for Millennials to achieve their entrepreneurial dreams, we will need a new set of public policies.\n\nBreitbart News: And get the government off their backs, right?\n\nK: Right.\n\nBreitbart News: So tell me about energy\n\nK: One issue that I\u2019ve been paying a great deal of attention to is fracking and how modern technology is allowing us to utilize our own vast energy resources. Yet, we are transporting these resources\u2013crude out of the Bakken\u2013in a very dangerous and environmentally unfriendly way, which is by rail. In \u201cLet Me Be Clear,\u201d I talk about Obama\u2019s buddy, who I call \u201chis mistress,\u201d namely Warren Buffett, and how he stands to profit off not building pipelines like Keystone XL.\n\nI explain why we should build this pipeline and others like Sandpiper because they are economically smart and environmentally safe. Most importantly, pipelines make the transportation of crude safer for humans, preventing train derailments such as the one that occurred last Monday (February 16) in West Virginia. If that derailment had happened just 35 miles sooner, the capital city of Charleston would have been devastated. Rail cars are not meant to transport oil extracted from shale, a highly volatile form of crude.\n\nWe do need to build pipelines; they garner bipartisan support, and they would create jobs for Millennials as well as reduce energy prices for Millennials\u2013and all Americans. An additional benefit, according to the Wall Street Journal and IHS Energy\u2019s February report, is that 70 percent of the \u201cresulting refined products\u201d like diesel and gasoline would stay here in the U.S. and be consumed by Americans if we were to build Keystone XL.\n\nBreitbart News: Okay, and so the last issue I\u2019ll ask about is education. So what do you think?\n\nK: Education is a topic that Democrats have used to buy votes from Millennials, particularly the topic of student loan debt forgiveness. A major reason why Obama won in 2008 and 2012 is because he proffered promises like: If you vote me, you won\u2019t have any student loan debt. Warren is signalling that she will use a similar ploy and we should expect Hillary to do so as well if she\u2019s the DFL presidential candidate.\n\nPart of what I do in the book and in my speeches is show how Republicans could address this issue in a more transparent, ethical, and solution-oriented way than the Democrats. Colleges are ripping students off. I mean, the average student is spending a minimum of four years and potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars on undergraduate and graduate degrees only to find themselves nannying or working as a barista. We must stop pumping taxpayer dollars into under-performing schools, and instead hold colleges accountable in a free market way. Additionally, some young people should be rejecting the cultural and political pressure to attend college altogether. College is not a universal path to success, especially for entrepreneurs.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019s latest plans to address student loan debt do not address the heart of the problem. This means the Republicans have an opportunity to offer a better way to solve this national crisis\u2013where 7 million Americans are now in default on their student loans\u2013and I explain more on how to do so in the book and in my presentations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Katie Kieffer: \"I wrote \u201cLet Me Be Clear.\u201d The title turns Barack Obama\u2019s famous catchphrase against him on behalf of my generation.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Katie Kieffer: \"I wrote \u201cLet Me Be Clear.\u201d The title turns Barack Obama\u2019s famous catchphrase against him on behalf of my generation.\"", "title": "A Brief Interview with Katie Kieffer, Author of 'Let Me Be Clear' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Katie-Kieffer-Flickr.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/04/a-brief-interview-with-katie-kieffer-author-of-let-me-be-clear/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Katie Kieffer: \"I wrote \u201cLet Me Be Clear.\u201d The title turns Barack Obama\u2019s famous catchphrase against him on behalf of my generation.\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Katie-Kieffer-Flickr.jpg", "title": "A Brief Interview with Katie Kieffer, Author of 'Let Me Be Clear' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "College, Education, Energy, Environment, fracking, Hillary Clinton, Katie Kieffer, Keystone XL, Millenials, Obama, Sandpiper pipeline, student loans, Warren Buffett, young entrepreneurs,Big Government, Economics, Obamacare,katie kieffer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "young entrepreneurs", "published_time": "2015-04-04T14:23:42-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc004\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERKatie Kieffer: The title [\u201cLet Me Be Clear\u201d] turns Barack Obama\u2019s famous catchphrase against him on behalf of my generation; it\u2019s our turn to be clear with our president.\nI wrote this book in a way that\u2019s enlightening\u2013it contains 3 years of research\u2013yet accessible and fun to read.\nThose solutions are included in the book, including a legal way to opt-out of the ACA until the law is repealed.\nBreitbart News: Ok, and you\u2019ve written about a number of issues in the book here, so tell us about the economy.\nSo, in order for Millennials to achieve their entrepreneurial dreams, we will need a new set of public policies."}
