Never before had the 164th Legislative District been represented by a Democrat, an African-American or a woman. Suddenly, its state representative fit all three descriptions.\n\nYet, there are some Democrats that argue the district is still awaiting its first liberal representative.\n\nDavidson, who sailed to re-election in 2012 by winning nearly 70 percent of the vote, has fallen out of favor with a faction of Democrats dismayed by her voting record on women\u0092s reproductive rights, school vouchers and congressional redistricting. There is chatter that the party could withhold endorsing a candidate until after the May 20 primary.\n\nDavid Landau, chairman of the Delaware County Democratic Party, declined to speculate on whether the party\u0092s committee members would endorse a candidate at Thursday\u0092s nominating convention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u0093The committee members in the 164th will make their choice,\u0094 Landau said. \u0093That\u0092s the procedure we\u0092re going to use. I\u0092m not going to comment one way or the other what is going to happen at the convention.\u0094\n\nThe Democratic primary could play a larger role in determining the district\u0092s representative than the general election. Redistricting efforts made the district a fairly secure Democratic seat by adding Lansdowne and Yeadon.\n\nDavidson will face at least two challengers in the primary \u0097 Billy Smith, a former Lansdowne councilman, and Dafan Zhang, an East Lansdowne resident who went from being homeless to an Ivy League graduate. Both oppose Davidson\u0092s voting record on vouchers and women\u0092s rights, though Smith has made his opposition a greater focus of his campaign.\n\nA Republican candidate has not been announced.\n\nSmith ardently has claimed the district needs a more liberal Democrat in Harrisburg. He has drawn the public support of a handful of prominent local Democrats, including Upper Darby Democratic Committee Chairman Ed Bradley.\n\n\u0093I am a liberal, progressive Democrat,\u0094 Bradley said. \u0093Given that, I don\u0092t feel comfortable supporting her, especially in light of her votes against a woman\u0092s right to choose and her votes to defund public schools by supporting vouchers and charters. These are just issues that no liberal Democrat in a community like ours can accept.\u0094\n\nThough Bradley is backing Smith, Davidson has gained her share of Upper Darby supporters during her three years in office.\n\nNewly elected Councilwoman Sekela Coles said Davidson understands that Upper Darby residents are not single-issue voters.\n\n\u0093I see her as being independent-minded,\u0094 Coles said. \u0093I think people want somebody to represent them who thinks with their own mind.\u0094\n\nDavidson, who has been branded a conservative Democrat, stands by her voting record.\n\n\u0093In this day of extremism, I think I\u0092m a bold moderate,\u0094 Davidson said. \u0093You have to be bold to be in the middle these days because you\u0092re going to be pulled either to the far left or to the far right.\u0094\n\nDavidson\u0092s scrutinized votes mostly revolve around women\u0092s reproductive rights and vouchers.\n\nShe favored a 2011 bill that required abortion clinics to meet the same safety standards as freestanding, ambulatory surgical facilities. She also voted in support of a 2013 bill preventing health insurance exchanges offered through the Affordable Care Act from covering most abortions.\n\nDavidson said she has been painted as a radical by her opponents for supporting the bills, which received substantial bipartisan support. She was among about three dozen Democrats who voted in favor of each bill.\n\nThough Davidson shied away from attaching a pro-choice label to herself, she said women \u0093absolutely\u0094 have a right to choose.\n\n\u0093They have a legal right to choose, which was upheld by the Supreme Court and I support that,\u0094 Davidson said. \u0093But I believe what Bill Clinton said \u0097 that abortions should be legal, safe and rare. So I stand with all of those Democrats that support that.\u0094\n\nAs for her 2013 vote to limit abortion coverage, Davidson said she voted to uphold existing federal law preventing federal money from funding abortions.\n\n\u0093That (law) hasn\u0092t prevented women from exercising their right to choose,\u0094 Davidson said.\n\nCritics claim the bills are part of a nationwide trend of state laws being passed by Republican legislatures to circumvent Roe vs. Wade. As proof, they point to several Pennsylvania abortion clinics that have closed since the ambulatory standards bill was signed into law.\n\n\u0093I strongly believe in our constitution and the interpretation of the constitution,\u0094 Zhang said. \u0093I want to oppose the (fight) to chip away women\u0092s rights.\u0094\n\nIf the 2011 bill truly was about safety, Smith said, the General Assembly could have better enforced the regulations already on the books.\n\n\u0093They could have given them some more teeth,\u0094 Smith said. \u0093They could have made it so that legislation addressed those issues as it relates to safety \u0097 checking them out and making sure that they fit under the current regs, as opposed to creating new regs to shut them down.\u0094\n\nThough Davidson\u0092s votes on reproductive rights aligned with dozens of House Democrats, her support of school choice was not the Democratic norm. She was one of just four Democrats to favor a failed voucher amendment to a 2011 bill.\n\n\u0093I just wanted to make a statement that we really need to discuss this further,\u0094 Davidson said. \u0093It wasn\u0092t something that was going anywhere, but we needed to have a real conversation about how we\u0092re going to fund public education and how we\u0092re going to improve outcomes for children and families. We\u0092re not having that conversation.\u0094\n\nIdeally, Davidson said, traditional public schools would perform well enough that all parents would opt to send their children there. However, parents deserve the choice to enroll their child in the school that best fits, Davidson said.\n\nBoth Zhang and Smith argued that vouchers siphon resources that otherwise would be directed to the public school district. With resources scattered, Zhang said, it is difficult to fix public schools.\n\n\u0093Not everybody in the district has the same opportunity to send their kids wherever they want,\u0094 Zhang said. \u0093By taking money from our public schools, it\u0092s going to start a race to the bottom.\u0094\n\nDavidson\u0092s voting record has cost her support from the political action committees of Planned Parenthood and the Pennsylvania State Educators Association \u0097 two PACs that generally back liberal candidates.\n\nBoth PACs endorsed her in 2010, but did not do so in 2012, citing her voting record. Campaign contributions from the PSEA totalling $39,000 in 2010 \u0097 which Davidson said were unexpected and forwarded to the House Democratic Campaign Committee \u0097 were not offered in 2012. However, Davidson received $37,000 in 2012 from Students First, a PAC advocating school choice.\n\nDavidson also has won support from Philadelphia Democrats U.S. Rep. Robert Brady, D-1, and state Sen. Anthony Hardy Williams, D-8, who each represent portions of Delaware County. They, along with former Gov. Ed Rendell, have contributed to her previous campaigns through their respective PACs.\n\nYet, it\u0092s the local support that Davidson will need to gain her party\u0092s endorsement in the primary. Both Yeadon and Lansdowne will join the 164th District this election and could prove critical. The primary is the first step in selecting their new representative.\n\nAudrey Harris, chairwoman of the Yeadon Democratic Committee, is among several local Democrats who have endorsed Davidson. She called Davidson a \u0093visionary\u0094 whose voting record is reflective of the community her district is inheriting.\n\n\u0093I got to know her as the incumbent recently,\u0094 Harris said. \u0093Now, I see her as a mover and a shaker. She does have a good track record for getting things done.\u0094\n\nFormer Lansdowne Mayor Jayne Young said she believes borough residents are more likely to back a more progressive candidate. She has endorsed Smith.\n\n\u0093I\u0092m a policy wonk,\u0094 Young said. \u0093I can like you as a person, but really dislike how you vote. I think the state representatives are incredibly powerful people. We need to have a voice in Harrisburg that\u0092s going to discredit some of the crazy that\u0092s going on there.\u0094\n\nZhang has not announced any endorsements.\n\nThough committee members in the 164th District are split on who to back for the primary, Landau is confident the party will fully support whomever emerges as the Democratic candidate on May 20.\n\n\u0093One is always concerned about primaries in the sense that people campaign and emotions can run high,\u0094 Landau said. \u0093I\u0092m confident based on our past track record that the Democrats will come together. They will support whoever wins the primary.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Primary elections, Primary elections news, Primos Primary elections news, PA Primary elections news, US Primary elections news, world Primary elections news.", "title": "Three\u0092s a crowd in 164th Legislative District", "og": {"url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20140217/NEWS/140219611", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.delcotimes.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/delcotimes.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Three\u0092s a crowd in 164th Legislative District"}, "twitter": {"domain": "delcotimes.com", "description": "The 2010 election of Margo Davidson was hailed as a historic triumph by local Democrats.
