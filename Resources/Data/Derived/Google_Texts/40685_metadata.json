But if God were enforcing the conventional rules, Trump would be brooding atop his midtown Manhattan aerie, wondering how he came in last behind James Gilmore.\n\nThis has to terrify Clinton. She knows how to run against a normal Republican. Unfortunately for her, a normal Republican isn\u2019t on the menu.\n\nHow would Trump win? The same way he won the primaries: by selling a more entertaining story.\n\nAbout three years ago, the eponymous \u201cAce\u201d from the legendary Ace of Spades HQ blog wrote a brilliant little essay on \u201cThe MacGuffinization of American politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a movie or book, \u2018The MacGuffin\u2019 is the thing the hero wants,\u201d Ace writes. \u201cUsually the villain wants it too, and their conflict over who will end up with The MacGuffin forms the basic spine of the story.\u201d\n\nThe Maltese Falcon in \u201cThe Maltese Falcon,\u201d the Ark in \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark,\u201d the daughter in \u201cTaken\u201d: These are all classic MacGuffins. Alfred Hitchcock apparently argued that it doesn\u2019t really matter what the MacGuffin is, so long as the hero wants or needs it and it sounds important enough to justify the hero\u2019s efforts.\n\nAce\u2019s insight was that the mainstream media covers Barack Obama as if he were the hero in a movie (with Republicans as the villains, of course). Whatever Obama wants \u2014 Obamacare, immigrant amnesty, the stimulus, a deal with Iran \u2014 isn\u2019t important to a worshipful press corps. Whether policies are good or bad, lawful or unlawful, is kind of irrelevant. What matters is that the hero wants something.\n\n\u201cWatching (MSNBC\u2019s) Chris Matthews interview Obama,\u201d Ace wrote, \u201cI was struck by just how uninterested in policy questions Matthews (and his panel) were, and how almost every question seemed to be, at heart, about Obama\u2019s emotional response to difficulties \u2026 navigating the plot of President Barack Obama: The Movie.\u201d\n\nI think something similar has been at the root of Trump\u2019s success. I can\u2019t bring myself to call him a hero, but many people see him that way. Even his critics concede that he\u2019s entertaining. I see him as being a bit like Rodney Dangerfield, constantly complaining he doesn\u2019t get enough respect.\n\nRegardless, Trump bulldozed his way through the primaries in part because the nomination was his MacGuffin and people wanted to see the movie play out. Many voters, and nearly the entire press corps, got caught up in the story of Trump \u2014 much the same way the press became obsessed with the \u201cmythic\u201d story of Obama in 2008. People just wanted to see what happened next.\n\nThis could be terrible for Clinton. She began her campaign thinking she could stage a remake of The Obama Story the way they\u2019re remaking \u201cGhostbusters\u201d: same plot, only this time with women. It doesn\u2019t work that way. Fair or not, the story of Hillary Clinton: First Woman President isn\u2019t as exciting as Barack Obama: First Black President. And, more to the point, The Hillary Story is far less entertaining than The Trump Story.\n\nEveryone suspects they know what President Hillary Clinton: The Movie would look like. Trump: The Movie? That could be a wild ride.\n\nClinton\u2019s best bet is to tell voters it would be a horror movie so terrifying, no one will want to see it. I\u2019m not buying tickets to either show come the fall. But I\u2019ll be following the promotions closely.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By conventional rules, Donald Trump should lose to Hillary Clinton in a landslide.", "author": "By Jonah Goldberg", "og": {"url": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/opinion/trump-can-sell-a-more-entertaining-story-than-hill/nrKnQ/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/2e/93/MY_DDN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "By conventional rules, Donald Trump should lose to Hillary Clinton in a landslide.", "title": "Trump can sell a more entertaining story than Hillary"}, "twitter": {"description": "By conventional rules, Donald Trump should lose to Hillary Clinton in a landslide.
