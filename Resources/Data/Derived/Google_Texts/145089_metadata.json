But make no mistake\u2014this is the opening of the \u201cChina Decade,\u201d the moment when the emerging giant\u2019s international influence crosses a crucial threshold. These five facts explain why China\u2019s rise is inevitable, even in the face of bad news\u2014and why it won\u2019t last forever.\n\n1. Rough Summer\n\nEconomic indicators have been pointing to a Chinese slowdown for some time\u2014exports had already dropped 8 percent last month compared to the same time last year\u2014but matters have come to a head these last couple of months. Between June 12 and July 8, the Shanghai stock market plummeted 32 percent. On July 27, the stock market fell 8.5 percent, its greatest single-day drop. To put that in perspective, \u201cBlack Tuesday,\u201d which kicked off the Great Depression in 1929, saw the Dow plunge 12 percent. Markets under the thumb of autocratic regimes were thought to be immune to such wild swings; turns out they\u2019re not.\n\nOn August 11th, the Chinese government devalued the renminbi to kick-start their slowing economy. By the end of the week, the currency\u2019s value had fallen by 4.4 percent, its biggest drop in 20 years.\n\n(The New York Times (a), CNN Money, The New York Times (b), TIME)\n\n2. China\u2019s Rise\n\nYes, growth is slowing, but to levels enviable in any developed country. In the mean time, China\u2019s march to no. 1 continues. In 2014, China\u2019s total GDP overtook the US\u2019s when measured by purchasing power parity. Using this metric, China accounted for 16.32 percent of world GDP in 2014, eclipsing the US\u2019s 16.14 percent.\n\nMore impressive than the size of China\u2019s economy is the speed with which it\u2019s grown. Back in 2000, Chinese imports and exports accounted for 3 percent of all global goods traded. By 2014, that figure had jumped to more than 10 percent. In 2006, the U.S. was a larger trade partner than China for 127 countries. China was the larger partner for just 70. Today, those numbers have reversed: 124 countries trade more with China than with the United States.\n\n(International Monetary Fund, Financial Times, Russia Today)\n\n3. China\u2019s Resilience\n\nAnd despite recent turmoil, China\u2019s economy has staying power. That\u2019s in part because China\u2019s leadership has spent decades building its foreign exchange reserves, which today are valued at $3.7 trillion. That\u2019s by far the world\u2019s biggest rainy day fund.\n\nMore important than its money buffer is China\u2019s consolidated political leadership under Xi Jinping. China\u2019s president has presided over an extensive anti-corruption campaign that has already seen 414,000 officials disciplined and another 200,000 indicted. In the process, Xi has probably rebuilt some of the party\u2019s lost credibility with China\u2019s people. He has definitely sidelined current and potential opponents of his reform program\u2014and of his rule. And the lack of backlash illustrates just how strong his political control really is.\n\n(Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic)\n\n4. Spreading Wealth (and Influence)\n\nConsolidated leadership also enables Beijing to pursue its comprehensive global strategy. China has spent the last two decades tactically investing around the world. Chinese investments in Africa jumped from $7 billion in 2008 to $26 billion in 2013, helping the continent build desperately-needed roads, rails and ports. In Latin America, China has already pledged to invest $250 billion over the coming decade, giving Beijing a solid foothold in the West. This extends China\u2019s influence well beyond East Asia, helps China secure long-term supplies of the commodities it needs to continue to power its economy, creates jobs for Chinese workers, and helps China open new markets for its excess supplies of industrial products.\n\nChina also wants to use its money to reshape the world\u2019s financial architecture. To that end, Beijing just launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to rival the Washington-based IMF and World Bank. Given that 57 countries have signed up as founding members, some of them US allies who chose to ignore US objections, it\u2019s well on its way. With initiatives like the AIIB, China will continue funding infrastructure projects\u2014and building goodwill\u2014for years to come.\n\n(Bloomberg, BBC, Wall Street Journal)\n\n5. Problems Ahead\n\nAll that said, China\u2019s longer-term challenges are becoming impossible to ignore. By 2050, it\u2019s estimated that China\u2019s work force will have shrunk by 17 percent. Blame demographics\u2014back in 1980, the median age in China was 22.1 years; in 2013, 35.4, and by 2050 it will rise to 46.3. An aging labor force is like an aging sports star: both want more money, and both are nowhere near as productive as they once were.\n\nPollution continues to take its toll\u2014less than 1 percent of China\u2019s 500 cities meet WHO air quality standards. China\u2019s environment ministry concedes that nearly 2/3 of underground water and 1/3 of surface water is \u201cunfit for human contact.\u201d A new study estimated that 4,000 Chinese die prematurely each day thanks to air pollution. As China\u2019s masses join a growing middle class, the leadership will have to deal with stronger public demand for clean air and water. Beijing better deliver if it wants to keep the peace, and its regime, intact. And the public will have the means to make its demands known: There are already 650 million Chinese people online, and censorship, however sophisticated, can never fully control the flow of ideas and information in a social media market of that scale\u2014witness the information leaking out on the Tianjin blast. China\u2019s leaders know they must care about public opinion.\n\n(Bloomberg, UN Economic and Social Affairs, Council on Foreign Relations, Russia Today, CNN)\n\nChina\u2019s growing strength threatens the established world order, but its domestic vulnerabilities will have global repercussions, as well. It\u2019s still too early to tell which of the two will be more destabilizing. Either way, the world will be shaped by Beijing\u2019s successes and its failures.
