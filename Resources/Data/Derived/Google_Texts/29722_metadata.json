Football: Washington vs. East Lincoln (Dec. 13, 2014)\n\nThe Mustangs scored the go-ahead touchdown with more than eight minutes remaining in the game. After punts by both sides, East Lincoln had the ball inside the Washington five yard line with just a few minutes left.\n\nRather than score immediately, the Mustangs and head coach Mike Byus elected to stay out of the endzone and take time off the clock.\n\n\u201cIf we get in the endzone, there\u2019s an eight-point difference and you have to kick off to them and risk a kick return,\u201d Byus said. \u201cIf they score and go for two, you\u2019re in overtime. I preferred having them down one but with 99 yards to go.\u201d\n\nAfter turning the ball over on downs, Washington had one final chance to drive 99 yards with 56 seconds on the clock. They moved about 40 yards but failed to get out of bounds on several run plays and the Pam Pack ran out of time.\n\n\u201cYou can practice it and you can talk it, but experience is valuable and we had not had a game this tight since, I don\u2019t know when,\u201d said Washington Head Coach Mike Byus. \u201cIf we played this week under these circumstances, our guys would do something totally different. We just got the short end tonight.\u201d\n\nThe championship is East Lincoln\u2019s second in school history. The first came just two years ago when the team defeated the Tarboro Vikings for the 2-A title, 24-20.\n\nWashington was making its first trip to the final game in the history of the program.\n\nEast Lincoln was led by dual-threat quarterback Chazz Surratt, who ran for 75 yards and a touchdown and completed 15 of 28 passes for 212 yards and another touchdown. Surratt was named the Most Valuable Player of the game.\n\nDemarius Valentine and Cameron Dollar had 65 receiving yards each for East Lincoln while Coleton Banks had 36 yards and Sage Surratt picked up 34 yards.\n\nWashington was led by 111 rushing yards from Markel Spencer, while Xzavier Clark ran for 100 yards and a touchdown and Stepfon Rodman ran for 83 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThe first quarter of the game was scoreless after Washington began with a six-minute drive that ended with a turnover on downs. East Lincoln then got the ball and missed a field goal after five more minutes.\n\nThe Mustangs got on the board first in the second quarter when Surratt got his team down to the red zone thanks to a connection with Dollar. From six yards away, Surratt took the ball in himself.\n\nWashington responded on the next play with a seven-yard touchdown run from Rodman. The game was tied at 7-7 at halftime.\n\nEast Lincoln gave up a fumble near midfield midway through the third quarter and Washington took advantage to seize its first lead of the game. The Pam Pack went ahead 13-7 on a two-yard touchdown from Clark, but the extra point was blocked.\n\nOn Washington\u2019s next possession, the team fumbled inside its own 20 yard line. East Lincoln took over at the 16 and a few plays later, Surratt found Banks for a nine-yard score. The blocked Washington extra point proved important as the Mustangs went ahead 14-13.\n\n\u201cWe generally don\u2019t turn the ball over,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cTonight, those couple of plays were costly.\u201d\n\nWith East Lincoln leading by one point, the teams punted back and forth to each other before the Mustangs got the ball deep in Washington territory and watched the clock tick away.\n\nAfter the game, Byus praised his defensive unit and its coaching staff for giving up yards to the Washington running attack but not giving up too many points. He was proud of his defense\u2019s ability to stop the Pam Pack in the final minute.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of the kids because they have found a way to win no matter what type of team they ran up against, whether they had speed or they had power,\u201d Byus said.\n\nWashington had not lost since the first week of the year, falling 37-6 to Havelock. The team gave up just 24 points through four postseason games entering the championship.\n\nEast Lincoln finished the season with a perfect 16-0 record, solidifying the many regular-season accolades the Mustangs had collected. The team was the top seed in the 2-AA west bracket and the top-ranked team in the final Associated Press regular-season 2-A poll.\n\nFollow Zach Mayo on Twitter at @ZachMayoHSOT", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.highschoolot.com/rss/612&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.highschoolot.com/rss/612&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.highschoolot.com/rss/612&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.highschoolot.com/rss/612&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.highschoolot.com/rss/612&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-12-13 17:09:00", "description": "Washington failed to score on its final drive of the game with less than a minute remaining.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-12-13 20:40:20", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14277003|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.highschoolot.com/washington-east-lincoln-tied-at-halftime-of-2-aa-game/14277003/", "image": "http://wwwcache.highschoolot.com/asset/content/football/2014/12/13/14277269/14277269-1418521209-160x120.jpg", "description": "Washington failed to score on its final drive of the game with less than a minute remaining.", "card": "summary", "title": "East Lincoln stops Washington in final minute for 2-AA title"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-13T17:09:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"url": "http://www.highschoolot.com/washington-east-lincoln-tied-at-halftime-of-2-aa-game/14277003/", "image": "http://wwwcache.highschoolot.com/asset/content/football/2014/12/13/14277269/14277269-1418521209-646x485.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Washington failed to score on its final drive of the game with less than a minute remaining.", "title": "East Lincoln stops Washington in final minute for 2-AA title"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "After punts by both sides, East Lincoln had the ball inside the Washington five yard line with just a few minutes left.\nFootball: Washington vs. East Lincoln (Dec. 13, 2014)The Mustangs scored the go-ahead touchdown with more than eight minutes remaining in the game.\nEast Lincoln finished the season with a perfect 16-0 record, solidifying the many regular-season accolades the Mustangs had collected.\nEast Lincoln took over at the 16 and a few plays later, Surratt found Banks for a nine-yard score.\nEast Lincoln then got the ball and missed a field goal after five more minutes."}
