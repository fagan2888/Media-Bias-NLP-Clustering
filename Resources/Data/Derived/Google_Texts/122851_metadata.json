Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks during a campaign rally, on Saturday, Jan. 30, 2016, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to admire about Bernie Sanders. He capably ran Burlington, Vermont, as mayor in the 1980s. He\u2019s a man of integrity: fashioning a successful political career despite a principled shunning of both major parties, while amassing a credible campaign war chest from small donations. He\u2019s sincere in his convictions, at least three of which \u2014 full-throttle public works spending, free public college tuition and wariness about military adventurism \u2014 are sound ideas. I\u2019m on record that I could vote for him or Hillary Clinton should Republicans nominate a nut, which seems likelier with each passing day.\n\nSo I feel entitled to voice an unpleasant truth, and since Sanders finished in a virtual tie with the supposedly invincible Clinton in Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses, I\u2019ll kick him when he\u2019s up: His most ardent enthusiasts are as cultish as Donald Trump\u2019s. The founder of the left-wing Daily Kos blog was struck by their \u201cirrational cherry-picking of news to convince themselves that victory is just around the corner.\u201d If you don\u2019t believe him, check out the comment threads on even respectful commentaries suggesting that maybe, just maybe, Sanders won\u2019t win. His diehards demonize Clinton as a sellout and anyone who says a nice thing about her as a shill (an example of that in a moment). Sanders himself dissed Planned Parenthood, which endorsed Clinton, as \u201cpart of the establishment.\u201d\n\nGiven this ideological rigor mortis, it\u2019s no wonder some Sanderistas are clueless that on their man\u2019s two signature issues \u2014 reforming Wall Street and health insurance \u2014 his ideas range from half-baked to bad\u2026\n\nGiven this ideological rigor mortis, it\u2019s no wonder some Sanderistas are clueless that on their man\u2019s two signature issues \u2014 reforming Wall Street and health insurance \u2014 his ideas range from half-baked to bad, as smart progressives are pointing out.\n\nStart with financial reform. Sanders calls for breaking up big banks and reenacting Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that separated commercial from investment banking activities. The small-is-beautiful shtick misses the real problem: poor regulation. All of Canada\u2019s banks were too big to fail, yet that nation didn\u2019t need a bank bailout, because wise regulation made them behave.\n\nMeanwhile, our economy crashed because both commercial and investment banks trafficked in risky, mortgage-backed securities, something Glass-Steagall, for all its worthiness, wouldn\u2019t have stopped. The real problem, economists say, was lack of oversight of such non-traditional, \u201cshadow banking\u201d activities. The Dodd-Frank financial reform began plugging that hole with some Canada-style regulations, including a consumer protection bureau and rules on derivatives that are working.\n\nSanders\u2019s call for single-payer health insurance seems, at first blush, more reasonable. After all, it works in other countries. But pushing for it here would mean re-litigating Obamacare. Leave aside the brazen pipedream that that would be doable, when a Democratic Congress wouldn\u2019t even add a public option to Obamacare. Ah, say Sanderistas, but Bernie\u2019s proposed a superior alternative to Obamacare. Actually, he\u2019s proposed mush.\n\n\u201cSanders promises his health care system will cover pretty much everything while costing the average American almost nothing, and he relies mainly on vague \u2018administrative\u2019 savings and massive taxes on the rich to make up the difference.\u201d That critique comes not from a Republican but from liberal editor/blogger Ezra Klein, in an extended takedown.\n\nOne telling detail: Sanders calls his plan \u201cMedicare for all\u201d while promising Americans would face no deductibles and co-pays. But Medicare does impose deductibles and co-pays. Indeed, Sanders has said his plan would cover services Medicare doesn\u2019t, yet in other countries, single-payer works precisely because the government doesn\u2019t cover everything, declining enough patient claims to keep health spending on budget.\n\n\u201cTo be harsh but accurate,\u201d the Nobel-winning and proudly progressive economist Paul Krugman writes, \u201dthe Sanders health plan looks a little bit like a standard Republican tax-cut plan, which relies on fantasies about huge supply-side effects to make the numbers supposedly add up.\u201d\n\nTo suggest we\u2019ll get to universal coverage by improving Obamacare won\u2019t excite Sanders enthusiasts goosed by the candidate\u2019s call for a political \u201crevolution.\u201d Ignorant of history, they don\u2019t know that progressive change in America typically is evolutionary, not revolutionary. And they don\u2019t understand that that can be a good thing; progressives cheered it when Ronald Reagan\u2019s most radical budget and tax cuts were defeated or rolled back by Congress.\n\nIf Sanders nevertheless is nominated and a majority of us choose him over an unfit Republican this November, what then? At worst, we\u2019d likely get a placeholder a la Jimmy Carter or the first President Bush, his bad ideas thwarted by lawmakers unwilling to chase misguided reforms. At best, Sanders would run the country the way he ran Burlington: pragmatically, which means he\u2019d occasionally tell his base to stick it.\n\n\u201cWhy Bernie Sanders Matters,\u201d a new biography, recounts how anti-war activists \u2014 including David Dellinger, the grand old man of the American peace movement \u2013asked then-Mayor Sanders\u2019s permission to protest General Electric\u2019s weaponry work outside its Burlington plant, the entry to which they planned to block. Dellinger thought Sanders, who protested the Vietnam War, might be simpatico.\n\n\u201cI will have you arrested,\u201d retorted the mayor, who felt the action would unfairly target GE\u2019s workers. He made good on his threat.\n\nHis most ardent enthusiasts are as cultish as Donald Trump\u2019s.\n\nHaving campaigned explicitly on his single-payer and bank planks, President Sanders would find compromising on them politically difficult but not impossible: Barack Obama has governed by settling for half-loaves. That\u2019s what soured the utopian left on him, and the most extreme denizens of Sanders Land are as unforgiving of apostasy as the Tea Party. Krugman, lamenting the reaction of some Sanderistas to his Bernie criticism, writes, \u201cRight now I\u2019m getting the kind of correspondence I usually get from Rush Limbaugh listeners, although this time it\u2019s from the left\u2014I\u2019m a crook, I\u2019m a Hillary crony, etc., etc.\u201d\n\nKrugman, who blogs at \u201cThe Conscience of A Liberal,\u201d assures his progressive readers that \u201conly some\u201d Sanders supporters are this extreme. I too know reasoning ones; some are friends, and some contribute to comment threads, along with their crankier compatriots. It might be helpful for the former to have a grown-up chat with the latter, passing along the wisdom Krugman offers dyspeptic Sanderistas: \u201cYou might want to think hard about why you\u2019re not just sure that you\u2019re right, but sure that anyone who disagrees must be evil.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019s indisputable contribution has been to attract people, youth in particular, to participate in the political system. If he should lose, and if many of his partisans then drop out because they think the system is corrupt, rather than accept the fact that people disagree, part of the Vermonter\u2019s efforts will have been in vain.\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Their blind loyalty prevents them from seeing the truth.", "og": {"site_name": "cognoscenti", "description": "Their blind loyalty prevents them from seeing the truth.", "title": "The Problem With Bernie Sanders's Supporters", "url": "http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2016/02/02/bernie-sanders-rich-barlow", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/16/files/2016/02/0202_Sanders_supporters_cog-592x324.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2016/02/02/bernie-sanders-rich-barlow", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/16/files/2016/02/0202_Sanders_supporters_cog-592x324.jpg", "site": "@cogwbur", "card": "summary", "title": "The Problem With Bernie Sanders\u2019s Supporters"}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-02-02", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe602b\"", "article_summary": "Supporters cheer as Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
