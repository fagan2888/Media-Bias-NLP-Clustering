Leon Cooperman Bloomberg News

Hedge-fun manager Leon Cooperman, the founder of Omega Advisors, said the five-year bull market in stocks hasn’t peaked, but isn’t likely “to rage” from current levels.

“It’s kind of a very classical” Mr. Cooperman said Monday in an interview on CNBC. “Is the bull market aging? Yes. Is it over? No. Is it likely to rage from here? I think highly doubtful.”

Mr. Cooperman, the CEO of Omega, which has about $10 billion under management, said the market is about fairly valued at current levels. The S&P 500 trades at 15.4 times next year’s earnings.

“If the economy’s growing at 2%-2.5% and profits are growing, say, 5%, inflation is 1.5%, short rates are zero and the 10-year government [bond] is currently 2.70%, there’s no basis for the market to have a 30% year again like it did last year,” Mr. Cooperman said. “I think the market is in a zone of fair valuation.”

He sees the S&P 500 moving up to the mid-1900s by the end of the year as long as the economy can keep growing at its current pace. The S&P 500 recently dropped 0.3% to 1872. It has rallied 177% off the March 2009 bottom.

“I think it will continue to age because most bear markets relate to a recession and it does not look like a recession is in the cards anytime soon,” Mr. Cooperman said.

In addition Mr. Cooperman, whose firm owns about 2% of eBay sided with billionaire investor Carl Icahn‘s mission to get the ecommerce company to spin off payments unit PayPal.

“I give Carl a lot of credit for taking the time and showing the energy, and in this case, we happen to agree with him,” Mr. Cooperman said in the interview. “I think they should spin out a portion of PayPal.”
