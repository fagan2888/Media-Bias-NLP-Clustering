The vast majority of U.S. firefighters are community volunteers Wildfires like this August 2013 disaster near Banning, California bring volunteer firefighters out of the woodwork to risk their lives\n\nSince the Obamacare law doesn't specifically carve out an exemption for them, fire departments where 50 or more people work \u2013 either as volunteers or officially as employees \u2013 are expected to provide health insurance for every one of them.\n\nIn towns with more than one volunteer fire department, all the staffers will likely be lumped together for tax purposes, pushing many municipalities above the 50-worker threshold.\n\nThat could cost departments of life-savers hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. Those that dump their volunteers into the federal insurance exchanges would still have to pay an annual $2,000 fine for each 'employee' after the first 30.\n\n'I can tell you right now we can\u2019t afford it,' East Derry, Pennsylvania Fire Company Chief Edward Mann told the Patriot-News. 'While a volunteer fire department may not have a payroll, the rest of it isn\u2019t free. The only part that is free is the labor.'\n\n\n\nMann's concerns are likely to get at least some attention in Washington: He's also the state fire commissioner in Pennsylvania, where 97 per cent of fire departments are fully or mostly staffed by volunteers. That's the highest percentage in the U.S.\n\n\n\nEmployees? Volunteer firefighters count toward an employer's worker totals under the Affordable Care Act, since the law doesn't carve out a exception for them\n\n'A public safety disaster': Volunteer fire departments could close down unless the government exempts them from Obamacare\n\n\n\n\n\nNationally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency reports that volunteer fire departments make up 71 per cent of America's 1 million firehouses. Another 16 per cent are 'mostly volunteer.'\n\nIt's unclear how many of those departments involve at least 50 people, making the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act's latest unintended consequence difficult to calculate.\n\n\n\nBut the International Association of Fire Chiefs has asked the Internal Revenue Service to let all volunteer departments off the hook. The federal government has taken no action so far.\n\nFirefighters in Buchanan, Wisconsin are mostly volunteers. They fought this house fire and put it out without a single injury\n\n'If the IRS classifies volunteer firefighters and emergency medical personnel as employees in their final rule, fire departments may be unintentionally forced to comply with requirements that could force them to curtail their emergency response activities or close entirely,' the organization said in a statement.\n\nA U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson said in a statement that the agency has 'received a number of comments concerning volunteer firefighters and other volunteers in response to proposed regulations issued last December.'\n\n'We are taking those comments into account as we work toward issuing final regulations on the employer-responsibility provision' of the Affordable Care Act, the spokesperson said.\n\nBut Bill White, a volunteer firefighter for 50 years and leader of the Dive Rescue Specialists in Scott Township, Pennsylvania, said an IRS rule that officially makes volunteers subject to Obamacare employer mandates would be a disaster.\n\n'We're barely paying the bills that we have now,' he told the Scranton Times-Tribune\n\nPennsylvania Republican Rep. Lou Barletta fired off a letter to the IRS last week.\n\n'Obamacare has raised more questions than it has answered,' Barletta said in a statement.\n\n'First, are volunteer firefighters considered employees and therefore subject to the employer mandate under Obamacare? And second, how should volunteer time be counted to see if they\u2019re working 30 hours?'\n\nAftermath: On Dec. 4 a home in London Township, Mich. was reduced to cinders -- and volunteers kept the blaze from spreading to forests or other houses\n\nEven big municipalities like Jersey City, New Jersey need volunteer firefighters. This November 27 fire destroyed a downtown store and damaged three others\n\n'Does it mean when a volunteer is wearing a beeper or carrying a fire department cell phone? Does it include downtime at the station house? Listening to a scanner?'\n\n'If Obamacare is the law of the land, then so is the law of unintended consequences,' he said, 'and there seems to be a lot of that going around these days. Just like the flu.'", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "the affordable care act,barack obama,", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2520979/Obamacare-mandates-set-shutter-THOUSANDS-volunteer-departments.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "According to the IRS, volunteer firefighters are 'employees' - so the fire departments will have to buy them all health insurance or pay hefty fines.", "title": "Obamacare rules could shutter THOUSANDS of volunteer fire departments", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2520979/Obamacare-mandates-set-shutter-THOUSANDS-volunteer-departments.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/09/article-2520979-19E0147A00000578-980_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2520979, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "the affordable care act,barack obama,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2013-12-09T20:58:27.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=David+Martosko,+U.S.+Political+Editor", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-12-10T16:53:36.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Obamacare mandates set shutter THOUSANDS volunteer departments"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "According to the IRS, volunteer firefighters are 'employees' - so the fire departments will have to buy them all health insurance or pay hefty fines.", "title": "Obamacare rules could shutter THOUSANDS of volunteer fire departments", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2520979/Obamacare-mandates-set-shutter-THOUSANDS-volunteer-departments.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/09/article-2520979-19E0147A00000578-980_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "According to the IRS, volunteer firefighters are 'employees' - so the fire departments will have to buy them all health insurance or pay hefty fines."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6c6\"", "article_summary": "But the International Association of Fire Chiefs has asked the Internal Revenue Service to let all volunteer departments off the hook.\n'First, are volunteer firefighters considered employees and therefore subject to the employer mandate under Obamacare?\n'We are taking those comments into account as we work toward issuing final regulations on the employer-responsibility provision' of the Affordable Care Act, the spokesperson said.\nIt's unclear how many of those departments involve at least 50 people, making the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act's latest unintended consequence difficult to calculate.\n'I thought the kinks were worked out of Obamacare at the first of the month,' Central Florida volunteer firefighter Carl Fabrizi told Sunshine State News."}
