We maintain our position as being a politically neutral company,\" said the spokeswoman on Saturday.\n\nThe UK Treasury could not immediately be reached for comment but the Lego characters were no longer featured on the government website and had been removed from Buzzfeed and replaced with generic images.\n\nThe economy has emerged as a key issue ahead of the referendum, with the UK government hoping to sway voters by saying they would be 1,400 pounds better off saying in the union. Scottish nationalists, however, say independence could benefit each Scot to the tune of 1,000 pounds a year.\n\nOpinion polls show voters remain reluctant for Scotland to end its 307-year union with the United Kingdom, although support for independence has risen this year.\n\nA poll by Populus published in the Financial Times on Saturday found 47 percent of about 500 respondents questioned in Scotland between May 28 and June 6 wanted to stay in the United Kingdom, while 40 percent wanted independence. The poll found 13 percent remained undecided.\n\n* For the list of what Britain's government suggests Scots could do with 1,400 pounds, see: here\n\n($1 = 0.5969 British Pounds)\n\n(Editing by David Holmes)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Belinda Goldsmith", "Author": "Belinda Goldsmith", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The British government has removed images of Lego figures enjoying the possible gains of Scots rejecting a vote for independence, after the Danish toy maker complained about the use of its characters in a online campaign.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "title": "UK government removes Lego figures from Scotland independence campaign", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
