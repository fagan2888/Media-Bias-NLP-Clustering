Hobby Lobby was an earthquake, holding that business owners could use their own religious beliefs to limit their employees\u2019 rights. As a practical matter, however, its real impact is still up in the air. So far, every single federal appeals court to consider the question has approved current Obama administration birth control rules that accommodate religious objectors while still ensuring that most employees have access to birth control. That includes an opinion by Judge Jerry Smith, one of the most conservative federal judges in the country.\n\nYet, despite this winning streak, women who work for the litigants in these cases could be forgiven if they thought that they were the big losers in court. Last month, for example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit handed down its opinion in a closely watched case, holding that current federal birth control rules do not \u201csubstantially burden\u201d religious objectors nor do they \u201cinfringe upon their First Amendment rights.\u201d On Friday, however, the Tenth Circuit stayed this order pending the Supreme Court\u2019s final disposition of the case.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a particularly surprising decision. Indeed, it is really the only proper course for a court of appeals given how the Supreme Court has handled birth control decisions post-Hobby Lobby.\n\nThe Hobby Lobby decision itself allowed religious objectors to exempt themselves from federal rules requiring employers to include birth control in employer-provided health plans. Yet it also contained language strongly suggesting that an alternative method of ensuring that workers have access to birth control \u2014 where employers fill out a form if they have a religious objection and then the government works separately with the employer\u2019s insurance administrator to provide birth control coverage to employees \u2014 would survive Supreme Court review. The Obama administration\u2019s current rules call the Supreme Court on this bluff, implementing the very same accommodation that the Hobby Lobby opinion implied to be legally acceptable.\n\nFour days after Hobby Lobby was handed down, however, a majority of the Court granted temporary relief to a religious college that objected specifically to the fill-out-the-form accommodation in an order that remains in effect today (the Court did require the college to give formal notification of its objection to the administration in lieu of the form, but that formal notification could exclude key information that the government needs to implement its policy). In an angry dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor all but accused her colleagues of lying in the Hobby Lobby opinion. \u201cThose who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. \u201cNot so today.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court has thus far gone out of its way to ignore the unanimous consensus among federal appeals courts who say that employers must comply with the Obama administration\u2019s current rules. In February, for example, the Third Circuit sided with those rules. Yet, in April, Justice Samuel Alito stayed that decision in what was styled as a temporary order pending \u201cfurther order of the undersigned or of the Court.\u201d More than two months later, however, no \u201cfurther order\u201d had issued, prompting the solicitor general to write the Court asking why this case remained in limbo.\n\nThe Court responded to the solicitor general at the end of June with a brief order effectively holding that the case must stay in limbo.\n\nFor the moment, in other words, anti-birth control employers are winning despite the fact that they keep losing. Until the Supreme Court releases its hold over these cases, the unanimous consensus among federal courts of appeals means very little at all. It is also an ominous sign for supporters of reproductive health that they will have a harder fight ahead of them in the Supreme Court than they have thus far faced in the courts of appeal.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Federal appeals courts are unanimous in saying that employers must comply with current birth control rules.
