So instead of paying the $500 or more for her needed chest x-ray, she left \u2013 untreated, the paper reported.\n\nSEE ALSO: Florida cancer patient to lose insurance during treatment because of Obamacare\n\n\u201cThe people in there told me that since I didn\u2019t have an insurance card, I would be billed for the whole cost of the x-ray,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. You know, I signed up last week like I was supposed to.\u201d\n\nMs. Galvez said she had enrolled in Carefirst Blue Cross three days before Christmas, for $450 per month.\n\nAt the same time, she said, in The Daily Mail, \u201cno one has sent me a bill.\u201d\n\nMs. Galvez\u2019s experience was shared by others.\n\nA woman who asked to be published only by the name Mary said she couldn\u2019t receive emergency services at the Inova Alexandria Hospital down the road, in Alexandria, Va., for the same reason.\n\n\u201cI had chest pains last night,\u201d she said to The Daily Mail, on Thursday. \u201cThey took me in the emergency room. They told me they were going to admit me, but when I told them I hadn\u2019t heard from my insurance company since I signed up, they changed their tune.\u201d\n\nShe said that a nurse told her that her hospital bill would be at least $3,000 a day if she stayed, due to her inability to prove insurance coverage. Rather than stay and pay, she left.\n\n\u201cShould I be in the hospital? Probably,\u201d she said, The Daily Mail reported. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s one of those borderline cases. I have to think that if I were really in danger, they wouldn\u2019t give me the choice. But what if I think I\u2019m covered and I\u2019m really not? The emergency room bill is going to bad enough.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Staffers with at least one hospital in Northern Virginia turned away several patients this week due to confusion about Obamacare: Were the patients covered by insurance or not?", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Staffers with at least one hospital in Northern Virginia turned away several patients this week due to confusion about Obamacare: Were the patients covered by insurance or not?", "title": "Obamacare patients socked with huge cash bills flee hospitals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/3/obamacare-patients-socked-huge-cash-bills-flee-hos/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/08/budget-battle-polljpeg-0df0b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/08/budget-battle-polljpeg-0df0b.jpg", "description": "Staffers with at least one hospital in Northern Virginia turned away several patients this week due to confusion about Obamacare: Were the patients covered by insurance or not?", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare patients socked with huge cash bills flee hospitals"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
