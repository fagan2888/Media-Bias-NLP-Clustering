The concept, promoted by consulting engineer Robert Pyke, would offer as much water as the tunnel scheme pushed by Gov. Jerry Brown, could be built sooner and at a fraction of the cost of the tunnels, the farmers say. The governors tunnels are the heart of the so-called Bay Delta Conservation Plan. If built, each would be 40 feet in diameter and be buried 150 feet deep for a 35-mile run to the state and federal irrigation projects pumping plants near Tracy. They would siphon off fresh water from the Sacramento River before it could flow naturally into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. After Mr. Pyke detailed his idea recently at a meeting in Clarksburg, three prominent Delta businessmen enthusiastically endorsed his alternative and urged everyone to get on the Pyke Western Delta Intake Concept bus instead of the Bay Delta Conservation Plan bus. Right now we have a bus at the curb at the Capitol, began Courtlands Steamboat Acres pear farmer Tim Neuharth. Its a big bus. Its the only bus. The door is wide open in the front. The door is wide open in the middle. On the marquee it says BDCP. Its the only vehicle at the curb that we have to work with. There needs to be another bus at the curb so that there is an alternative. My opinion is Robert Pykes plan is the alternative. Another endorser who spoke was Sean Doherty Sr., a lobbyist in Sacramento, who with former California Assemblyman Bill Berryhill, has formed Citizens Coalition for Delta Protection. They recently added Mr. Pyke to their board of directors. Mr. Doherty told the Clarksburg audience that the polling is not good on the Bay Delta Conservation Plan. Its at 56 percent right now, he said. Anyone who is involved in politics will tell you that in order for a tax initiative to pass, you need to go into the election with 65 percent. And if the BDCP is mentioned in the water bond, it fails at 70 percent. Could the governor be about to make a big announcement? Mr. Doherty, who said he and Mr. Berryhill have been discussing Mr. Pykes alternative plan with key legislators in Sacramento, said to look for the governor to make an announcement about the twin tunnels and a water bond in the next two weeks. We know it is coming, said Mr. Doherty. We have an idea of what hes going to say and it will be fairly significant about the BDCP. If the BDCP falls, and we dont present an alternative, and we believe the alternative is the Western Delta Intake, the BDCP will come up with some other monster that will destroy the Delta. This plan makes perfect sense. And it needs all the support that you can get. If we can fund phase one [to do a scientific study of Mr. Pykes WDIC], Bill Berryhill and I are convinced that we can get the additional funding through legislative action by the State Legislature, Mr. Doherty said. He said the amount needed would be about $850,000. The study is needed to show this is a viable alternative and needs to be pursued. The Pyke plan in bulletpoints The following are the proposed benefits of going with Mr. Pykes WDIC plan:  The WDIC would be located on Sherman Island on the south end of Sacramento County. Sherman Island is now mostly owned by the state of California.  All waters (rivers, streams, island pump outs, run-off, etc.) must pass through the Delta to the WDIC site.  Due to all of the water passing through the Delta, money for Delta infrastructure will remain in the Delta  WDIC is half the distance to the state and federal pumping stations, meaning a huge reduction in construction costs and mitigation costs  WDICs permeable embankments are far more efficient and effective than other fish screen proposals, which are ineffective or unproven  Due to all waters passing through the Delta and the inclusion of additional storage, which allows true Big Gulp-Little Gulp operation, southern water users would receive more water over the long haul versus BDCPs proposal.  WDIC is self-regulating; meaning over-pumping of water at any time will result in too much brackish (salt) water. The pumps must be turned down or shut off as a result of too much brackish water. Other benefits, according to Mr. Pykes presentation:  Costs 50 percent less than the BDCP  Provides flood control benefits  Helps retard saltwater intrusion  Reduces traffic delays on Highway 160  Restores more natural flow patterns  Ensures reasonable, minimum outflows  Creates new habitat where it is most useful at and off the western end of Sherman Island, close to the mixing zone  Adds shaded riparian habitat along Sherman Island and other islands improved to the fat levee standard in accordance with the ESP of the Delta Protection Commission. The WDIC plan proposes additional south-of-the-Delta storage, much of it likely as groundwater, but also perhaps including new Westside storage. During periods of very high flow, the new intakes and the existing South Bay intakes, with fish screens along the Old River, could be used simultaneously. The WDIC also recommends, to maintain South Delta water quality, there would be lined canals to recirculate water from the aqueducts to the San Joaquin River as necessary. What Im proposing, said Mr. Neuharth, is that this (North Delta CARES) group and others like it step up to the plate and be on the offensive instead of the defensive. This is a war! This is a war for your homes, your farms, your properties, and your businesses. If we dont get on the offensive, the BDCP will roll over the top of you. And Im not an advocate saying You cant take any water out of the Delta. There are wet years where there is water they can take out of the Delta  but not in this particular (Sacramento River) location. It needs to be after it has passed through the Delta. Mr. Neuharth said it is a good time to push Mr. Pykes plan forward because the BDCP is wavering. Theyre getting knocked around pretty good. So when your enemy steps back, you advance. You dont step back and let them regroup. You hit them hard and go after them. BDCP and company has put a tremendous amount of effort into science and marketing. They have a lot of people in this state and back in Washington aware and thinking we have this huge problem that the levees are going to collapse and blah, blah, blah, he said. So why not piggy back off that? Right now, why not get this study done and piggy back on all this publicity and use it to our advantage? Mr. Neuharth said the next step is to find or create a 501C organization that could be a depository for the initial $250,000 needed to fund Mr. Pykes study to get credibility. Mr. Doherty said his organization is working on that but presently it is a 501C4 for advocacy and lobbying, but allows for contributions that can be deducted as a business expense. The third Delta businessman who endorsed the plan at the Clarksburg meeting was Bill Wells, the executive director of the Delta Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau and a columnist for the Bay Delta Yachtsman magazine, who has held a seat on the BDCP as a Delta representative. Bobs an absolute genius, said Mr. Wells, and one of the top 10 smartest people Ive ever met in my life. When you talk to Bob, you get straight answers. When you talk to guys like Jerry Meral [former head of the BDCP], he was a master of double-talk, said Mr. Wells. I know Bob does a lot on his own dime just because he knows right from wrong. You can watch the video of Robert Pykes complete presentation with slide graphics, plus the comments of farmer Tim Neuharth, Sean Doherty and Bill Wells in the other videos here: Dr. Robert Pyke provides history of CA water supply and details on his Western Delta Intake Concept (WDIC) from Gene Beley on Vimeo.

You have to give Dr. Pyke credit for devising an alternate plan for water conveyance in the Delta. But it does not do ONE BIG THING -- improve fish runs to the Bay Delta and improve the large ecology of the Delta. To do that would conceptually require some sort of interchange where fresh river water could flow to the sea and Delta water could still flow south (or west under Pyke's proposal) to convey water to Central Valley farms and southern cities. The only way to do that is to keep the fish flows on the ground surface and separate the water conveyances for farms and cities in a subsurface pipe. So we are right back to the tunnel concept. Anybody can come up with a better and cheaper plan than the Twin Tunnels when fish flows do not have to be considered. The original Peripheral Canal would still be much cheaper but it also doesn't do much for fish flows. There are many cheaper alternatives to the tunnels but the environmentalist will hold any alternative plan hostage to their dream of a fish only river. Dream on about a cheaper alternative.

Wayne Lusvardi is out-to-lunch on this one. Wayne, I know my talk and hence the video are quite long, but if you actually watch the video you will see that the WDIC does multiple positive things to improve the Bay-Delta ecosystem and the prospects for native aquatic species.

Gene , you can add me to the list of WDIC proponents. I have known Dr. Pyke for some time now and have long been familiar with the concept he is proposing. I highly doubt it will ever be built given it's inability to be gamed, but, I certainly think it is a viable alternative. As opposed to what Mr. Lusvardi might have you believe the BDCP / tunnel plan does not improve or increase the net positive outflow from the Delta. Arguing that the WDIC doesn't either is a little odd at best. Perhaps Mr. Lusvardi could share his logic on this ? Could it be that the co equal goals are not so equal ?
