The ninth time’s the charm.

After failing to reach base in his first eight at-bats, New York Yankees first baseman Greg Bird finally recorded his first major-league hit Saturday against the Blue Jays.

There was a small Colorado connection on the play. Bird singled to shallow left-center field — between third baseman Josh Donaldson and former Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki — in the top of the eighth inning off former Rockies reliever LaTroy Hawkins.

Bird finished the game 1-for-4, and is batting .111 after nine at-bats.
