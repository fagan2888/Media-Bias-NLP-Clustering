Champagne, no.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays ended baseball\u2019s longest playoff drought Friday night without even knowing about it.\n\nToronto entered play Friday believing it could clinch a wild card by beating the Tampa Bay Rays, and with losses by Minnesota and the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nNot long after the Blue Jays beat the Rays 5-3, Minnesota lost 6-4 at Detroit. But when the Angels defeated Seattle 8-4, it looked as if Toronto would need one more victory Saturday to halt its 22-year postseason absence.\n\nIt turned out, however, that because of the remaining schedules of the Rangers, Astros and Angels, the Blue Jays had clinched at least a wild-card spot, no matter what. With the AL West trio all to face one another before the end of the season, only two of the three can finish with as many wins as Toronto\u2019s current total of 88.\n\nIf that happens, one would win the AL West after a tiebreaker while the other would claim the wild card along with the Blue Jays or New York Yankees.\n\nThe Blue Jays haven\u2019t been to the postseason since winning their second straight World Series in 1993. Seattle, which last went to the playoffs in 2001, now holds the distinction of the team with the longest postseason drought.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, the Blue Jays\u2019 official Twitter feed was still waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\n\u201cWith a win today, we will officially clinch a 2015 playoff berth!\u201d the club tweeted.\n\nEven MLB.com initially said the Jays were still \u201con cusp\u201d of the playoffs, along with the Mets and Dodgers. It changed its headline to \u201cJays in\u201d shortly after.\n\nThe Blue Jays finally got on board, tweeting a message that read \u201cPlayoff bound! The Blue Jays are heading to the postseason.\u201d\n\nManager John Gibbons learned about the wild-card berth only after arriving at the stadium Saturday.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s gratified,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long and the guys have played great. They really turned it on the last two months. So it\u2019s a good feeling. But we\u2019re trying for much more than that.\u201d\n\nToronto extended its AL East lead to four games after the White Sox beat the Yankees Friday.\n\n\u201cThe wild-card game is not something that we as a unit would celebrate,\u201d pitcher R.A. Dickey said. \u201cWe\u2019re after the division championship.\u201d\n\nCatcher Russell Martin found out about the wild card from reporters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that we\u2019re in the playoffs for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s great. But our goal is to win every game until it\u2019s over.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Blue Jays finally halt 22-year postseason absence", "title": "Blue Jays finally halt 22-year postseason absence", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/26/blue-jays-finally-halt-22-year-postseason-absence/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__blue-jays-APp1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__blue-jays-APp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-26T13:08:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T21:37:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Toronto Blue Jays ended baseball\u2019s longest playoff drought Friday night without even knowing about it.\nNot long after the Blue Jays beat the Rays 5-3, Minnesota lost 6-4 at Detroit.\nAs of Saturday morning, the Blue Jays\u2019 official Twitter feed was still waiting for the other shoe to drop.\nThe Blue Jays haven\u2019t been to the postseason since winning their second straight World Series in 1993.\nThe Blue Jays finally got on board, tweeting a message that read \u201cPlayoff bound!"}
