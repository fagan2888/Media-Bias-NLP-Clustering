A man involved in a citywide crime spree has been taken into custody, according to Colorado Springs police.

Officers were tipped off that 23-year-old Eric Garcia was staying at Howard Johnson Lodge on 1231 S. Nevada Friday night. A CSPD tactical unit and canines set up surveillance, and arrested Garcia when he left his hotel room. Garcia allegedly tried to make a run for it, but was quickly taken down by one of the police dogs on scene.

Garcia was treated for his injuries from his encounter the canine, then was taken to the CJC.

Police say Garcia was part of a group that has been stealing pricey electronics and tools from big-box stores throughout the city. The suspects would allegedly assault any loss prevention officers who tried to stop them from stealing. Police say Garcia has been identified as a suspect in eight of the robberies.

CSPD says they expect to make more arrests in this crime spree.
