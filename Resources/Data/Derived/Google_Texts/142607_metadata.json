He left in the spring of his senior year without graduating. Some thought perhaps there was a family illness or financial troubles at home. Walker has said he got a job and always meant to go back for his degree, but didn\u2019t.\n\nRelated: Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker Could Be a Contender\n\nThe fact of his non-graduation from college hasn\u2019t bothered most Wisconsin voters, who elected him three times in four years to his state\u2019s highest office. Still, as Walker gets more national attention in the run-up to the 2016 election, he may need to address the issue. Though not every U.S. president had a college degree \u2013 think George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Harry Truman \u2013 most presidents did, and many have held advanced degrees.\n\nNevertheless, plenty of American presidents have endured inconvenient truths or awkward realities. Here are some little-known facts about a few of our commanders in chief this Presidents\u2019 Day:\n\nGeorge Washington inherited 10 slaves at the age of 11 when his father died. He privately opposed slavery, publicly didn\u2019t challenge it, and was the only prominent Founding Father to free his slaves in his will.\n\nThomas Jefferson spent most of his time reviewing his finances and debts, as he lay ill in bed in the final days of his life.\n\nMartin Van Buren learned English as a second language (his first language was Dutch).\n\nJames K. Polk was the youngest former president to die in retirement, at age 53.\n\nRelated: How Barack Obama Amazed His Law School Professor\n\nJames Buchanan was the only lifelong bachelor among the presidents. He also had an eye defect that caused him to cock his head slightly to the left \u2013 leading people to think he was unusually courteous.\n\nAbraham Lincoln, who loved gadgets, was known to test-fire muskets and rifles on the grassy areas around the White House (known now as the Ellipse and the National Mall).\n\nUlysses S. Grant smoked 20 cigars a day.\n\nWarren G. Harding\u2019s wife, Florence Kling DeWolfe, kept a little red book of people who offended her.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt was related to 11 other former presidents, either by blood or marriage (John Adams, James Madison, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren, William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt, FDR\u2019s fifth cousin).\n\nHarry Truman received the first Medicare card ever issued at age 81 on July 30, 1965. Truman had called for a national health insurance program in 1945 \u2013 and 20 years later, Lyndon B. Johnson personally handed him the card.\n\nRelated: Which Former President Cost the U.S. the Most?\n\nDwight Eisenhower was a skilled chef known for his vegetable soup, steaks and cornmeal pancakes.\n\nLyndon B. Johnson rejected the official portrait painted of him in 1967, calling it \u201cthe ugliest thing I ever saw.\u201d That painting now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, a gift of the artist, Peter Hurd. (LBJ was OK with the replacement portrait by a different artist.)\n\nThroughout Ronald Reagan\u2019s film career, his mother answered most of his fan mail.\n\nGeorge W. Bush, during his time in the White House, read 14 Lincoln biographies. In the last three years of his presidency he read 186 books.\n\nBarack Obama dislikes ice cream, possibly because he worked in an ice cream shop as a teenager. He instead prefers shaved ice.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Some in the press are starting to question why Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor an", "title": "15 Presidential Facts You Never Knew", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/15/15-Presidential-Facts-You-Never-Knew", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02132012_Lincoln_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/15/15-Presidential-Facts-You-Never-Knew", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02132012_Lincoln_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Some in the press are starting to question why Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor an", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Still, as Walker gets more national attention in the run-up to the 2016 election, he may need to address the issue.\nThough not every U.S. president had a college degree \u2013 think George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Harry Truman \u2013 most presidents did, and many have held advanced degrees.\nWalker spent four years at Marquette University, where he was active in college politics but was a so-so student.\nWalker has said he got a job and always meant to go back for his degree, but didn\u2019t.\nTruman had called for a national health insurance program in 1945 \u2013 and 20 years later, Lyndon B.
