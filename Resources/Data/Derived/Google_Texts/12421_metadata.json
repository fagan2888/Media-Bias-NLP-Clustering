Associated Press\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2018s third White House counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, is rejoining Latham & Watkins LLP, her third stint at the firm over a career that also includes time as a federal prosecutor and a legal adviser to President William Clinton.\n\nMs. Ruemmler, 43 years old, is President Barack Obama\u2019s longest-serving counsel and was tapped for the job in 2011. She previously held significant roles at the Justice Department, and was co-lead trial counsel in the securities fraud prosecution of former Enron CEOs Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about getting back into court,\u201d Ms. Ruemmler told Law Blog in an interview on Tuesday. Her last trial was in 2008, she said, adding, \u201cI love doing trials, so that\u2019s something that I\u2019m very enthusiastic about.\u201d\n\nStarting in July, Ms. Ruemmler will be a partner in Latham\u2019s litigation department and a member of the firm\u2019s white-collar defense and investigations practice group. She was previously a partner there from 2007 to 2009, when she rejoined the Justice Department and served as the Deputy Attorney General\u2019s primary adviser.\n\nMs. Ruemmler said her government experience has also provided insights into the significant challenges that face top lawyers in charge of big companies. \u201cThe president would often say to me, \u2018I need you to be looking around corners,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI think I can help clients in the private sector by playing that same role.\u201d\n\nAt DOJ she assisted in managing various components of the sprawling agency, including the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys. And investigations into the Enron matter offered a unique vantage point on how various decisions the company made help lay the groundwork for the later actions of some executives, she said.\n\nAs White House Counsel, Ms. Ruemmler oversaw a staff of 25 lawyers\u2014\u201clike managing a boutique law firm\u201d\u2014and advised the President on everything from national security to implementation of the Affordable Care Act and judicial nominations. She also managed the Administration\u2019s response to Congressional investigations, litigations and crisis management.\n\n\u201cThe White House really sees everything, and you touch everything,\u201d Ms. Ruemmler said. \u201cMy job was to defend the interests of the president and the presidency, to ensure that the office and the officeholder were protected and also that he had the information that he needed to make decisions. Any problem or challenge that hits the President\u2019s desk is one that doesn\u2019t usually have an easy answer.\u201d\n\nMs. Ruemmler\u2019s predecessor as White House Counsel, lawyer Bob Bauer, left that job in 2009 to return to private practice at Perkins Coie LLP. President Obama\u2019s first counsel was Greg Craig, who landed at Skadden Arps Meagher & Flom LLP.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "Former White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler Returns to Latham", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/05/20/former-white-house-counsel-kathryn-ruemmler-returns-to-latham/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Former White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler Returns to Latham", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Jennifer Smith", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Law Blog Blog", "page.subsection": "Law Blog", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-05-20T17:25:19-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/05/20/former-white-house-counsel-kathryn-ruemmler-returns-to-latham/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-LB-48099", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/05/20/former-white-house-counsel-kathryn-ruemmler-returns-to-latham/", "type": "article", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "site_name": "WSJ", "title": "Former White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler Returns to Latham"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Law Blog", "article.id": "BL-LB-48099", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-05-20T17:26:01-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9dff\"", "article_summary": "Former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler at an installation ceremony for FBI Director James Comey in October 2013.\n\u201cThe White House really sees everything, and you touch everything,\u201d Ms. Ruemmler said.\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about getting back into court,\u201d Ms. Ruemmler told Law Blog in an interview on Tuesday.\nMs. Ruemmler, 43 years old, is President Barack Obama\u2019s longest-serving counsel and was tapped for the job in 2011.\nMs. Ruemmler said her government experience has also provided insights into the significant challenges that face top lawyers in charge of big companies."}
