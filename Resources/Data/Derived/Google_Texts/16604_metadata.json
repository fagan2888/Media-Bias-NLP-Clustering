Even Star Wars and Lord of the Rings never managed that feat, and the honor would put director Francis Lawrence in elite company: Only Steven Spielberg has ever helmed back-to-back yearly box-office champs: E.T. and Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nThat kind of elite company should make Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence the biggest action star in the world (and she\u2019s already the most successful action heroine in history). So why is she not thought of as one? She\u2019s an Oscar-winner, the Internet\u2019s best friend, and an accomplished butt-plug collector, but she\u2019s has yet to be in the same breath with Rambo.\n\nWe know that female-led action films can do incredibly well; check out the Alien and Terminator franchises if you need evidence of that. And we know, by extension, that women can kick ass and take names in action movies, from the spectacularly gonzo Kill Bill (Vol. 1 or 2, take your pick) to the slick Tomorrow Never Dies. Yet, despite the fact that many actresses specialize in action films, have built their careers in action, and are highly regarded for their skills, they aren\u2019t called \u201caction stars.\u201d They\u2019re actresses, superstars, and movie stars, but rarely are they actually celebrated for being queens of action.\n\nOur relationship to female action stars (yes, I\u2019ll say it) says a great deal about how we view women in film, but also women in society. Actresses are often stuffed into a box of femininity, and the woman warrior is considered to be the antithesis of feminine; think Grace Jones in A View to a Kill: tough as nails, with fly fashion to boot, but framed in very butch, masculine terms. Filmmakers seem to struggle with how to handle women in action movies when they aren\u2019t objects or minor characters, and audiences can\u2019t cope with them either.\n\nIt would be a mistake to shove action stars like Angelina Jolie and Uma Thurman into the \u201caction\u201d box just as it would be to force them into the \u201clady actors\u201d box. Action actresses are so much more than these simple aspects of their acting careers, but it\u2019s frustrating to see their contributions to the action canon simply erased; even just the words \u201caction star\u201d are usually associated with men, not women.\n\nThe list of women who are specifically known for their action work, not just those who\u2019ve displayed a dynamic range (like Lucy Liu, who is equally adept on Elementary and Charlie\u2019s Angels, or Shailene Woodley, who sparked a worldwide handkerchief shortage in The Fault in Our Stars and then went on to play the tough-as-nails Tris in Divergent), includes some big names.\n\nMajor, headlining, box office-crushing names, like Angelina Jolie, Scarlett Johansson, Pam Grier, Jennifer Lawrence, Linda Hamilton, Sigourney Weaver, and Uma Thurman. Meanwhile, others are hardly to be sneezed at: Katee Sackhoff as Starbuck on Battlestar Galactica was the epitome of the action star, while Michelle Yeoh (who, notably, does many of her own stunts) is a famous actress in her own right and Milla Jovovich has led the Resident Evil series to considerable success.\n\nWomen in action aren\u2019t anything new, either; Pearl White was one of the earliest action stars, period, in The Perils of Pauline. She starred in pre-WWI films and led the charge for women in film, but almost immediately thereafter, women were relegated to more sedate, quiet roles. Soon, film stars were hired more for the purpose of being screen sirens than action heroes, and it wasn\u2019t until the rise of actresses like Pam Grier in the 1970s that women started taking the boxing gloves back. It\u2019s notable, too, that blaxploitation films marked the return of women action heroes, and that producers today are increasingly turning to black stars to fill female action roles.\n\nIt\u2019s not that women can\u2019t star in action films, or that female-led films aren\u2019t capable of holding up at the box office. The Terminator franchise, when adjusted for ticket inflation, has brought in $826 million at the box office, domestically. Linda Hamilton played a not insignificant role in the success of the franchise, yet she\u2019s not billed as an action star any more than Alien\u2018s Sigourney Weaver, who brought in $914 million at the box office (again, adjusted for ticket inflation).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Oscar winner and Internet darling is the planet's biggest action star.
