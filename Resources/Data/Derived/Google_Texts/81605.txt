James Spader is NBC’s touchstone for Thursday nights this fall, staying put as the network adds new dramas behind “The Blacklist.” NBC announced its 2015-16 primetime slate Sunday morning ahead of the “upfront” presentations to advertisers in New York tomorrow.

“The Blacklist” will be used to launch two new series, “Heroes: Reborn,” the spinoff of that popular drama, and “The Player,” from the producers of “The Blacklist.”

NBC’s other new dramas, “Blindspot” and “Heartbreaker,” will bow after “The Voice” on Mondays and Tuesdays, respectively. “Blindspot,” a conspiracy drama that opens with a woman (Jamie Alexander, above) covered in mysterious tattoos found naked in Times Square, is from prolific producer Greg Berlanti (“Arrow,” “The Flash,” who also landed “Supergirl” on CBS for fall).

NBC will be short on comedies, long on dramas for fall, with only two comedies making the cut. “Undateable” and “People Are Talking” are set for Fridays.

Besides Spader, the other boldface name on NBC’s lineup is Neil Patrick Harris, whose variety show, “Best Time Ever,” will air Tuesdays through November.
