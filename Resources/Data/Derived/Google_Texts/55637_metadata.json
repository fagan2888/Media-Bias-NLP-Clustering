He\u2019d go from speaking to students about \u201ca world of pure logic, pure reason, pure cause and effect\u201d to coaching them on how best to evoke \u201cthe messy nature of human affairs.\u201d Lightman, a physicist turned novelist (\u201cEinstein\u2019s Dreams\u201d was a bestseller and \u201cThe Diagnosis\u201d was a finalist for the National Book Award), is like a one-man bridge between what C.P. Snow, in 1959, famously described as \u201cthe two cultures\u201d of the sciences and the humanities, realms of knowledge whose growing estrangement Snow deplored.\n\nIn his new collection of essays, \u201cThe Accidental Universe: The World You Thought You Knew,\u201d Lightman explores the way recent (and not-so-recent) discoveries and theories in physics and cosmology affect the sort of questions human beings ask in fiction: questions about the meaning of life, the nature of morality, the importance of love. These are obviously puzzles that concern many physicists as well as novelists. But even those scientists who excel at penning lucid popular explications of their work are rarely as gifted at articulating the \u201cmessy\u201d bits, such as the contradictory human desires for order and transgression, or our delusory longing for permanence. Some of what Lightman writes about in \u201cThe Accidental Universe\u201d could be called philosophical or metaphysical and some of it verges on the poetic, but whatever the subject, he writes with a limpid serenity and frankness that feels as fresh and as clarifying as a spring rain.\n\nAll of the essays in this collection are rewarding, but the most intriguing for popular science lovers will be the first, which gives the book its title. Lightman explains the emerging consensus among theoretical physicists that our own universe is only one among countless alternate universes, universes where the properties of matter and energy may differ significantly from our own. Physicists call this \u201cthe multiverse.\u201d\n\nIf the multiverse concept is true \u2014 and, as Lightman points out, it\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019ll ever be able to conclusively test it \u2014 then, he writes, \u201cthe philosophical ethos of science is torn from its roots.\u201d That ethos rests on the conviction that science is moving us toward a more and more complete understanding of the laws of nature and that \u201cthese basic principles are so restrictive that only one self-consistent universe is possible, like a crossword puzzle with only one solution.\u201d Or, as the Nobel-winning physicist Steven Weinberg put it, \u201cWe now find ourselves at a historic fork in the road we travel to understand the laws of nature. If the multiverse idea is correct, the style of fundamental physics will be radically changed.\u201d\n\nThe multiverse also offers a refutation of the concept of Intelligent Design. Like Intelligent Design, the multiverse is an idea that accounts for the fact that the universe we inhabit is finely tuned in various ways that permit the existence of life. If certain factors (such as the amount of dark energy in the universe) were a little bit greater or lesser \u2014 poof! But if there are an infinite, or nearly infinite, number of universes, some of which are nothing but a cold fog of evenly dispersed particles and others a single, tiny, infinitely dense point, then ours is merely one of a few universes configured so as to allow life. There\u2019s nothing particulary remarkable about our existence in it, because if it were otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t be around to remark on it. Thus, ours is an accidental universe, rather than the inexorable and inevitable result of set laws that can be discovered and understood by humanity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A scientist-novelist explains the revolutionary philosophical implications of new theories of the universe", "title": "\u201cThe Accidental Universe\u201d: Physics overthrows itself", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A scientist-novelist explains the revolutionary philosophical implications of new theories of the universe", "title": "\u201cThe Accidental Universe\u201d: Physics overthrows itself", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/12/the_accidental_universe_physics_overthrows_itself/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/accidental_universe.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A scientist-novelist explains the revolutionary philosophical implications of new theories of the universe", "title": "\u201cThe Accidental Universe\u201d: Physics overthrows itself", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/accidental_universe.jpg", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Atheism, Books, Editor's Picks, Must-Do, Physics, Religion, Science, Universe, What to Read", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc718\"", "article_summary": "Thus, ours is an accidental universe, rather than the inexorable and inevitable result of set laws that can be discovered and understood by humanity.\nIf certain factors (such as the amount of dark energy in the universe) were a little bit greater or lesser \u2014 poof!\nIf the multiverse idea is correct, the style of fundamental physics will be radically changed.\u201dThe multiverse also offers a refutation of the concept of Intelligent Design.\nLightman explains the emerging consensus among theoretical physicists that our own universe is only one among countless alternate universes, universes where the properties of matter and energy may differ significantly from our own.\nTopics: Atheism, Books, Editor's Picks, Must-Do, Physics, Religion, Science, Universe, What to Read, Entertainment NewsAs MIT\u2019s first professor with a joint appointment in science and the humanities, Alan Lightman sometimes found himself teaching physics in the morning and then walking across a courtyard to lead a fiction writing class in the afternoon."}
