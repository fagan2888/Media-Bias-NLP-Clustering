He called with excellent news: No longer will I have to type out that long descriptor for this housing option, or stumble through its ugly acronym, CCRC. The new name for these places, adopted Sunday at an industry meeting in Boston: \"Life Plan Community.\"\n\nLess of a mouthful, and a clearer description of the concept.\n\nHobson participated in a survey effort by LeadingAge, an association of not-for-profit aging service providers, and Mather LifeWays, a not-for-profit organization that operates what we can now call LPCs. The conclusion from a year of feedback: \"Continuing care\" has a connotation that able adults don't like applying to themselves.\n\nHobson thinks the new name fits the elders who choose this kind of all-inclusive housing: \"These are folks that have a lot of vitality, and there's no question that they're planners.\"\n\nAnd while he understood the industry's need to come up with an identity that would appeal to aging baby boomers, he personally pressed for equal consideration of current residents' attitudes about who they are. He often remembers one who stopped him in the parking lot shortly after he came to work at Plymouth Harbor.\n\n\"She says, 'Mr. Hobson, please don't say that you are going to care for me for the rest of my life,'\" he recalls. \"She didn't want that. What she wanted out of her life here was more growth -- without distractions of worrying about the aging process.\"\n\nOptimal aging forum\n\nOf course, there's more than one way to accomplish that goal. After all, only about 2 percent of Americans 70 and older live in what we will now happily call life plan communities. Many Sarasota high-rises are functional NORCs (another ugly acronym, for naturally occurring retirement communities). That's why it's great to see the Downtown Sarasota Condo Association approaching this topic mindfully.\n\nThe DSCA Forum on Optimal Aging and Life Planning will take place Wednesday, Nov. 18, from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at the Hyatt Regency Sarasota. Registration is $15 for members, $20 for nonmembers, and includes lunch. To register, go to the DSCA website.\n\nFollow Barbara Peters Smith on Twitter @BarbaraPSmith.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "What she wanted out of her life here was more growth -- without distractions of worrying about the aging process.\"\nThe DSCA Forum on Optimal Aging and Life Planning will take place Wednesday, Nov. 18, from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at the Hyatt Regency Sarasota.\nOptimal aging forumOf course, there's more than one way to accomplish that goal.\nMany Sarasota high-rises are functional NORCs (another ugly acronym, for naturally occurring retirement communities).\nAfter all, only about 2 percent of Americans 70 and older live in what we will now happily call life plan communities."}
