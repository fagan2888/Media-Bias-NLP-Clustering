The report also said that another 49 percent of the complaints sat unaddressed for at least two months.\n\nRelated: How the IRS is Botching Obamacare Tax Collection\n\nThis is significant auditors said because \u201cthe burden on taxpayers can include receiving an incorrect refund amount or even owing the IRS penalties and interest.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s even more at stake than delays in handling complaints. This is the second scathing report in less than a month to question the agency\u2019s productivity and work quality. In August, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said the IRS was struggling to collect a new tax that\u2019s critical to financing the president\u2019s health care law; auditors say the IRS\u2019s flawed collecting process is allowing it to raise only three-quarters or so of the revenue that was originally expected.\n\nThe IRS had originally estimated that the tax would bring in about $1.2 billion in the second and third quarters of 2013 \u2013 but it\u2019s only received $913.4 million.\n\nThe IG\u2019s findings, suggesting that the IRS is not meeting its expectations and completing its work, come just as the agency is taking on even more responsibilities under Obamacare.\n\nRelated: Obamacare\u2019s Next Challenge: IRS Verification\n\nThe agency is tasked with enforcing more than 40 new provisions under the health law, including distributing insurance premium tax credits to help low and middle income people purchase health insurance through the state and federal exchanges.\n\nIRS also will impose penalties on individuals who decline to purchase health coverage as well as medium to large employers (in 2015) who fail to provide coverage to their full-time employees.\n\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen has continuously warned lawmakers that the agency\u2019s work may suffer if it does not receive an increase in funding to cover these new responsibilities.\n\nIn June, Koskinen warned an audience at the IRS Nationwide Tax Forum in Chicago, that budget cuts would hinder the agency\u2019s ability to serve taxpayers, Politico reported. He said if the agency doesn\u2019t receive proper funding, the level of phone service to help respond to taxpayer questions would drop to 53 percent.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t receive the funding and we can\u2019t do the hiring needed to handle this call volume, we estimate our level of phone service next year would plunge to 53 percent, which would be the lowest since 2008,\u201d Koskinen said. \u201cAt 53 percent, that would mean close to half of those trying to get our help over the phone would not get through.\u201d\n\nSeparately, he told lawmakers in Congressional Testimony that he was \u201cdeeply concerned about the ability of the IRS to continue to fulfill its mission if the agency lacks adequate funding,\u201d Koskinen said. \u201cOur current level of funding is clearly less than what the agency needs, especially to provide the level of taxpayer services the public has a right to expect.\u201d\n\nUnder the $1.1 trillion omnibus budget passed this year, the IRS was allocated $11.2 billion \u2013down from $12 billion the previous year\u2014this was the fourth year in a row it saw its budget cut. Koskinen and other IRS officials had warned Congress that the budget cuts would put a significant strain on their ability to do their job.\n\nHowever, lawmakers\u2014especially House Republicans\u2014were eager to cut the agency\u2019s budget after last year\u2019s scandal involving the alleged targeting of conservative groups, on top of IG reports revealing that the agency had spent tens of millions of dollars on lavish conferences.\n\n\u201cThe IRS has been targeting American taxpayers, as we\u2019ve learned, for their political beliefs for the last four or five years,\u201d Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI) said in a statement after proposing to cut the IRS\u2019s tax enforcement budget by $788 million this year. \u201cNow this culture within the IRS has grown to one of stonewalling, double-talk and mistrust. It\u2019s up to Congress to use the power of the purse\u2026 to rein in the IRS and force them to conduct their analysis in an unbiased manner.\u201d\n\nTop Reads From the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service is on the hot seat again as federal auditors blast the ag", "title": "Can IRS Collect Obamacare Taxes When It Can\u2019t Handle Tax Complaints?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/07/Can-IRS-Collect-Obamacare-Taxes-When-It-Can-t-Handle-Tax-Complaints", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06182013_Obamacare_Tax_Stroke_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/07/Can-IRS-Collect-Obamacare-Taxes-When-It-Can-t-Handle-Tax-Complaints", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06182013_Obamacare_Tax_Stroke_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service is on the hot seat again as federal auditors blast the ag", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf13\"", "article_summary": "The latest report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reveals that between 2012 and 2013, the IRS failed to address at least 47 percent of complaints filed against tax preparers.\nThe report also said that another 49 percent of the complaints sat unaddressed for at least two months.\nIn June, Koskinen warned an audience at the IRS Nationwide Tax Forum in Chicago, that budget cuts would hinder the agency\u2019s ability to serve taxpayers, Politico reported.\nKoskinen and other IRS officials had warned Congress that the budget cuts would put a significant strain on their ability to do their job.\nRelated: How the IRS is Botching Obamacare Tax CollectionThis is significant auditors said because \u201cthe burden on taxpayers can include receiving an incorrect refund amount or even owing the IRS penalties and interest.\u201dThere\u2019s even more at stake than delays in handling complaints."}
