A Denver district judge Friday dismissed a lawsuit by teachers that challenged Denver Public Schools’ tenure policies, according to court records.

Denver District Judge Michael A. Martinez determined that the Colorado Education Association, which filed the lawsuit, failed to prove its claim that a state law changing the way teachers were evaluated and awarded tenure violated teachers’ due-process rights.

The lawsuit was filed after the legislature’s passage in 2010 of Senate Bill 191, which amended the Teacher Employment, Compensation and Dismissal Act.

Plaintiff Cynthia Masters, representing the CEA, opposed a provision of the bill that allowed districts to dismiss nonprobationary teachers when they are no longer needed because of a drop in enrollment or closing a school or program.

Before the law was passed, districts were required to find a new position for nonprobationary teachers when they were displaced.

SB 191 mandated provisions in teachers contracts that required the consent of the hiring principal before a teacher could be transferred to a school.

The teacher could be placed on unpaid leave if they were not hired by a principal within a year. Plaintiffs claimed the law violated the Colorado Constitution’s contract and due-process laws.

Martinez wrote in his decision that courts have found that laws are not intended to create contractual or vested rights.

The judge also noted that legislatures have the right to modify or change property rights.
