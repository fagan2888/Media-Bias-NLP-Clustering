They would also reduce energy consumption by 12 percent.\n\nThe mandate for the industry could yield big savings for consumers. The DOE estimates users of residential dishwashers could save more than $2 billion in utility bills.\n\nThe energy conservation standards for residential dishwashers would also have \u201csignificant environmental benefits,\u201d according to the DOE. The efficiency rules would lead to massive reductions in carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury.\n\nThe carbon emissions reductions alone could lead to billions of more in savings for the public, the DOE estimates.\n\nHowever, the energy conservation standards would shrink the size of the residential dishwasher industry by one-third.\n\nThe Energy Department estimates manufacturers would end up paying more than $200 million to comply with the efficiency rules.\n\nThe public has 60 days to comment on the proposed rules.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Residential dishwashers are facing new efficiency rules from the Obama administration.", "description": "Residential dishwashers are facing new efficiency rules from the Obama administration.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Tim Devaney", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Residential dishwashers are facing new efficiency rules from the Obama administration.", "title": "Feds order up more efficient dishwashers", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/227551-dishwashers-facing-new-efficiency-rules", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/227551-dishwashers-facing-new-efficiency-rules", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-18T11:41-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Tim Devaney", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-18T11:41:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/227551-dishwashers-facing-new-efficiency-rules", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Residential dishwashers are facing new efficiency rules from the Obama administration.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds order up more efficient dishwashers"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds order up more efficient dishwashers"}, "article_summary": "The Energy Department\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy proposed Thursday new energy conservation standards aimed at reducing the energy and water consumption of residential dishwashers.\nResidential dishwashers are the latest household appliance facing new efficiency rules from the Department of Energy (DOE).\nThe energy conservation standards for residential dishwashers would also have \u201csignificant environmental benefits,\u201d according to the DOE.\nThe Energy Department estimates manufacturers would end up paying more than $200 million to comply with the efficiency rules.\nThe efficiency rules would lead to massive reductions in carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury."}
