Nothing changes. Every year it\u2019s the same old same old: the pitching is deplorable, the vaunted offense fails to realize its potential, the losses mount and the team sinks to the bottom of the standings. Rocktober was an anomaly, an aberration, perhaps a gift to the incomprehensibly loyal Todd Helton from the baseball gods.\n\nI\u2019ve been an ardent fan since the Rockies\u2019 inception. I am one of 10 people who divvy up season tickets each spring. I spend my money on eight games only to be heartbroken \u2014 sickened \u2014 watching each sad collapse on the field. I don\u2019t know who to point a finger at. Ownership, management, the altitude, the fans who continue to pour into Coors Field regardless of the quality of product therein?\n\nThe Rockies recently suffered 11 consecutive losses. I just don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m expected to continue holding out hope for something different.\n\nDavid Lampert, Denver\n\nThis letter was published in the May 18 edition.\n\nSubmit a letter to the editor via this form or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/05/17/what-is-a-colorado-rockies-fan-to-do/37715/", "site_name": "eLetters", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2015/05/colorado-rockies1-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "What is a Colorado Rockies fan to do?"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "What is a Colorado Rockies fan to do?", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/05/17/what-is-a-colorado-rockies-fan-to-do/37715/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2015/05/colorado-rockies1-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@denveropinion", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Rockies are an embarrassment to the city of Denver and the state of Colorado."}, "article_summary": "The Rockies are an embarrassment to the city of Denver and the state of Colorado.\nI\u2019ve been an ardent fan since the Rockies\u2019 inception.\nI don\u2019t know who to point a finger at.\nI just don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m expected to continue holding out hope for something different.\nThe Rockies recently suffered 11 consecutive losses."}
