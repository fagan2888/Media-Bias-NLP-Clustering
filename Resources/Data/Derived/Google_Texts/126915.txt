MOUNT JOY, Pa. (AP) â€” A central Pennsylvania woman accused of running a prostitution service out of her home says she charged only for massages, and that any sex that occurred with clients afterward was just "free fun."

Thirty-two-year-old Crystal Sweigart faces a preliminary hearing Dec. 18 on charges she was operating illegally.

But the Mount Joy woman, who posted ads offering "massage and stress relief" says she charged $50 for massages, but didn't solicit payment for sex.

She says anything that happened when the massage stopped becomes two consenting adults having fun. Sweigart went on to explain that she's simply an "open-minded, sexual person who connected with men who were unfulfilled."

Police have also charged a man and another woman who, they say, operated a Craigslist page used to advertise for Sweigart's clients.
