But it quickly became clear that Republicans have a problem: Senate Democrats who might not like Obama\u2019s policies on Iran but may not be ready to override their president, especially after the forceful arguments he made in the State of the Union.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn interviews Wednesday, several Democrats who had supported a previous version of Iran legislation sponsored by Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) said they are reconsidering their positions. Meanwhile, a previous version of an Iran bill offered by Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) did not have any Democratic co-sponsors.\n\nLast week, at the Senate Democratic retreat in Baltimore, Obama forcefully made a case against further Iran legislation. He did the same thing Tuesday night in front of millions of Americans, saying he would veto any sanctions legislation because it would \u201call but guarantee that diplomacy fails.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s words appear to be sinking in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m considering very seriously the very cogent points that he\u2019s made in favor of delaying any congressional action,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). \u201cI\u2019m talking to colleagues on both sides of the aisle. And I think they are thinking, and rethinking, their positions in light of the points that the president and his team are making to us.\u201d\n\nAsked if he\u2019s spoken directly to Obama about Iran, Blumenthal said: \u201cThe president and his staff are in touch with all of us.\u201d\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said he is actively weighing the president\u2019s position against Warner\u2019s own belief that Congress needs to keep pressure on Iran. Even the hawkish Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who said Wednesday that the administration\u2019s comments sound \u201clike talking points straight from Tehran,\u201d was noncommittal on whether he would again co-sponsor Iranian sanctions legislation that he once led. \u201cI have no idea yet,\u201d Menendez said.\n\nThe issue, said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, is one of timing. While Democrats and Republicans alike want to be tough on Iran, the president\u2019s party is more open to giving Obama some breathing room.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s overwhelming support to toughen up the sanctions,\u201d said Schumer, a member of Democratic leadership who co-sponsored sanctions legislation last year. \u201cThe question is when. At times in the past the president asked for a little time, until March. That\u2019s something people are looking at.\u201d\n\nKirk\u2019s bill would impose new sanctions if diplomatic talks fall apart or Iran violates an interim deal. Corker\u2019s would allow Congress an up-or-down vote to reject or approve any final deal between the U.S. and its allies and Iran. Sources familiar with the process in both chambers said Republicans have made no final decision on which bill will provide the base for the legislation. Another option is merging versions of the two bills, though Corker doubted that would happen. The House is also working on new sanctions legislation.\n\nA decision is expected in the near future, with a vote perhaps as early as February, given the support Iran legislation enjoys from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).\n\nOn the GOP bill to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline, Obama swiftly came out with a veto threat because it was clear not enough Democrats in Congress would vote to override him. That\u2019s not the case for Iran: Sixty senators publicly supported sanctions legislation in the last Congress, but it was widely believed that more Democrats would have voted for the bill if it had come to the floor.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said the vote would be a nail-biter if it were held today. But he expects enough Democrats to have Obama\u2019s back to reject an override, whether on tightening sanctions or requiring congressional approval for a nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cIf I had to be pushed, I\u2019d guess there\u2019s at least 34 that would say: \u2018This is premature, we should wait,\u2019\u201d Durbin said in an interview. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything that we would do that would jeopardize the negotiations, I think many Democrats would oppose it.\u201d\n\nRepublicans think Democrats are bluffing and will be unable to oppose hardline legislation on Iran, whatever form it takes. But they acknowledge that it\u2019s a tricky calculus to get to 67 votes when the president is leaning so hard on Democrats to hold the line, which might require legislation quite different from what\u2019s been proposed so far.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we\u2019re going to get to the magic 67 and be able to override this veto,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of figuring out what that would look like to command the broadest possible support in the Senate. And then we\u2019ll have that debate with the president.\u201d\n\nOf course, the GOP may have further problems getting to 67 thanks to defections from Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who have stayed away from new sanctions legislation.\n\nWhite House chief of staff on Iran sanctions debate\n\n\u201cWhile negotiations are going on, I worry that we will fracture our coalition,\u201d Flake said of Western nations that have coordinated on Iran negotiations and sanctions. \u201cI want to keep that coalition together.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry aims to have a framework for a deal by March, so the race is on in the Senate to beat him to the punch. The Banking Committee postponed its vote on the Kirk bill this week but will move swiftly next week with a hearing Tuesday, a classified briefing from the administration on Jan. 28 and a committee vote Jan. 29, Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said. Corker is also ramping up activity \u2014 he held a hearing on Iran on Wednesday and is moving toward developing a new draft bill.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is two tracks,\u201d Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said. \u201cOne is the sanctions and the other is the congressional approval.\u201d\n\nWhat legislation moves though Congress, he added, \u201cdepends on a number of Democrats. There are a number of Democrats that are in agreement about the ratification. There\u2019s others that are very much opposed to the sanctions because the president said he would veto them for sure.\u201d\n\nKeystone and Iran sanctions, a hardline Homeland Security funding bill that attacks Obama\u2019s immigration policies, and legislation that tweaks Obamacare\u2019s definition of the 40-hour work week: That\u2019s a lot of veto threats for the GOP Congress\u2019 preliminary agenda. At the same time, Republicans are trying to give Obama expanded negotiating authority on trade deals and work with him on cybersecurity legislation.\n\nIt\u2019s a tricky balance that illustrates what Washington is in for during the next two years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of trying to slot things so that we\u2019re doing thing \u2026 that the president would actually sign,\u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader, citing cybersecurity and trade as two areas of agreement. \u201cAnd this [Iran bill] will be obviously be more controversial.\u201d\n\nManu Raju contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Obama\u2019s overtures to Senate Democrats complicate matters for Republicans working on sanctions bills.", "title": "Democratic Iran hawks hesitate on overriding Obama", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/iran-senate-democrats-barack-obama-114467.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/21/140121_richard_blumenthal_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Mark Kirk,Senate Republicans,Bob Corker,White House,Sanctions,Iran Nuclear Program,Barack Obama,Chuck Schumer,Iran,Benjamin Netanyahu,Senate Democrats,Mark Warner,Robert Menendez,Richard Blumenthal", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Obama\u2019s overtures to Senate Democrats complicate matters for Republicans working on sanctions bills.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8078\"", "article_summary": "Last week, at the Senate Democratic retreat in Baltimore, Obama forcefully made a case against further Iran legislation.\nMeanwhile, a previous version of an Iran bill offered by Sen.
