Above, a Brazilian PSA educates citizens on the symptoms of dengue, such as fever and intense pain. Ag\u00eancia Bras\u00edlia, CC BY 2.0\n\nIt seems we can add Brazil onto the dengue vaccine bandwagon.\n\nThis Monday, the French-based pharmaceutical company Sanofi (and its vaccine branch, Sanofi Pasteur) announced that their vaccine, called Dengvaxia\u00ae, received approval from Brazil\u2019s National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). The large nation is now the third to do so within the span of a month, after Mexico and the Philippines.\n\n\u201cThis new approval of Dengvaxia\u00ae by the ANVISA, a well-recognized and World Health Organization (WHO) certified regulatory authority is an important milestone for Sanofi Pasteur,\u201d said Guillaume Leroy, Vice President of the dengue vaccine team at Sanofi Pasteur, in a statement. \u201cDengvaxia\u00ae has the potential to significantly reduce the dengue disease burden and to help Brazil reach the WHO\u2019s 2020 dengue reduction objectives.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported by Medical Daily, Dengvaxia\u00ae offers protection against all four of the major disease-causing strains of the dengue virus (a possible fifth strain was recently discovered, but hasn\u2019t been conclusively shown to cause illness).\n\nDengue, in all its forms, is transmitted by mosquitoes belonging to the species Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus. While only one-fourth of dengue infections actually progress to the point of physically making you sick, the disease is still estimated to harm close to 100 million people every year, according to the WHO. Other research has concluded that 3.9 billion people are at risk of contracting dengue. Dengue can range from a flu-like illness to a severe hemorrhagic fever that causes internal bleeding, shock, and can shut organ function.\n\nWhile surviving infection from one strain of dengue ensures lifelong immunity against that one strain, it doesn\u2019t prevent reinfection from another strain and it actually increases the risk of developing severe dengue should reinfection happen. Though Dengvaxia\u00ae only offers a moderate level of protection against contracting dengue \u2014 somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 percent judging from clinical trials \u2014 it does appear to dramatically reduce the chances of more severe complications even if you still come down with dengue.\n\nThat\u2019s a boon that Brazil could surely need, since dengue has reportedly infected over 1.4 million Brazilians this year alone, thanks largely to a particularly severe outbreak of dengue earlier this year. Brazil's annual cost in fighting the disease is estimated to be $1.2 billion USD.\n\n\u201cApproval of the first dengue vaccine is an important public health breakthrough with critical importance to our country, which bears the greatest dengue burden in Latin America,\u201d said Joao Bosco Siqueira Jr. of the Department of Community Health, Institute of Tropical Pathology and Public Health, at the Federal University of Goias in Goiania, Brazil. \u201cThe 2015 dengue outbreak is still very present in the minds of Brazilians so Dengvaxia\u00ae\u2018s approval is a most welcome addition to our ongoing dengue prevention efforts.\u201d\n\nThe vaccine will be approved for people ages 9 to 45 living in endemic areas, following research findings showing it proved most effective in that specific age group. An estimated 70 percent of dengue cases in Brazil occur in people over the age of 9, according to Sanofi Pasteur.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "brazil, becomes, third, country, approve, worlds, first, dengue, vaccine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Brazil becomes the third nation in less than a month to approve the world's first dengue vaccine.", "title": "Brazil Joins Mexico And The Phillipines in Approving Dengue Vaccine", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brazil-becomes-third-country-approve-worlds-first-dengue-vaccine-367284", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/29/1631651592924349cac65z.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brazil becomes the third nation in less than a month to approve the world's first dengue vaccine.", "title": "Brazil Joins Mexico And The Phillipines in Approving Dengue Vaccine", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brazil-becomes-third-country-approve-worlds-first-dengue-vaccine-367284", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/29/1631651592924349cac65z.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/29/1631651592924349cac65z.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-12-29T20:37:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-30T02:27:09-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Brazil becomes the third nation in less than a month to approve the world's first dengue vaccine."}, "article_summary": "Brazil becomes the third nation in less than a month to approve the world's first dengue vaccine.\nAg\u00eancia Bras\u00edlia, CC BY 2.0It seems we can add Brazil onto the dengue vaccine bandwagon.\nAn estimated 70 percent of dengue cases in Brazil occur in people over the age of 9, according to Sanofi Pasteur.\nThis Monday, the French-based pharmaceutical company Sanofi (and its vaccine branch, Sanofi Pasteur) announced that their vaccine, called Dengvaxia\u00ae, received approval from Brazil\u2019s National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA).\nWhile surviving infection from one strain of dengue ensures lifelong immunity against that one strain, it doesn\u2019t prevent reinfection from another strain and it actually increases the risk of developing severe dengue should reinfection happen."}
