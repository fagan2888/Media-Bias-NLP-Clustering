Yet the Department of Justice has refused to indict even IRS official Lois Lerner, who invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence to avoid incriminating herself in testimony before Congress.\n\nUnfortunately, the failure to prosecute anyone responsible for abusing the IRS\u2019s authority reflects the Obama administration\u2019s broader contempt for the Constitution and rule of law, as discussed in my new book, \u201cLawless,\u201d whose official release date is Tuesday.\n\nConsider just a few examples:\n\nGoing to war in Libya in blatant violation of the War Powers Resolution, and in defiance of the legal advice of the president\u2019s own lawyers, based on the ridiculous theory that bombing the heck out of Libya did not constitute \u201chostilities\u201d under the law\n\nAppointing so-called policy czars to high-level positions to avoid constitutionally required confirmation hearings\n\nModifying, delaying, and ignoring various provisions of Obamacare in violation of the law itself\n\nAttacking private citizens for engaging in constitutionally protected speech\n\nIssuing draconian regulations regarding sexual assault on campus not through formal, lawful regulation but through an informal, and unreviewable, \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter\n\nIgnoring 100 years of legal rulings and the plain text of the Constitution and trying to get a vote in Congress for the D.C. delegate\n\nTrying to enact massive immigration reform via an executive order demanding that the Department of Homeland Security both refuse to enforce existing immigration law, and provide work permits to millions of people residing in the U.S. illegally\n\nImposing Common Core standards on the states via administrative fiat\n\nIgnoring bankruptcy law and arranging Chrysler\u2019s bankruptcy to benefit labor unions at the expense of bondholders\n\nTrying to strip churches and other religious bodies of their constitutional right to choose their clergy free from government involvement.\n\nMore generally, the president has abandoned any pretense of trying to work with Congress, as the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers requires. He prefers instead to govern by unilateral executive fiat, even when there is little or no legal authority supporting his power to do so.\n\nPresidents trying stretch their power as far as they can is hardly news. What is news, however, is that top Obama administration officials, including the president himself, see this not as something to be ashamed of, but as a desirable way of governing, something to brag about rather than do surreptitiously.\n\nObama behaves as if there is some inherent virtue in a president governing by decree and whim, as if promoting progressive political ends at the expense of the rule of law is proper not simply as a desperate last resort but as a matter of principle.\n\nAfter all, Obama says, democracy is unduly \u201cmessy\u201d and \u201ccomplicated.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t wait,\u201d the president intones, as he ignores the separation of powers again and again, ruling instead through executive order.\n\n\u201cLaw is politics,\u201d and only politics, according to a mantra popular on the legal left, and therefore the law should not be an independent constraint to doing the right thing politically. Obama seems to agree.\n\nAs Obama\u2019s lawlessness has received increased attention from Congress, the (conservative) media and the general public, the president has been defiant, even petulant. When confronted by allegations of lawlessness, Obama takes no responsibility, and doesn\u2019t even bother to defend the legality of his actions.\n\nHarry S. Truman famously said \u201cthe buck stops here.\u201d Obama responds to serious concerns about his administration\u2019s lawlessness with a derisive \u201cso sue me.\u201d\n\nAs George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley writes, Obama \u201cacts as if anything a court has not expressly forbidden is permissible.\u201d And in many situations, no one has legal standing to challenge the president\u2019s actions in court \u2014 which means that no judge can stop the administration\u2019s lawbreaking.\n\nSo sue me? If only we could.\n\n[Cross-posted at the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Daily Signal.
