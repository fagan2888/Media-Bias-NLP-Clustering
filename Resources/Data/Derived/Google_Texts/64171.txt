Thomas Pfau, the Alice Mary Baldwin Professor of English at Duke University, has written an incisive evaluation of Brad Gregory’s The Unintended Reformation at The Immanent Frame . I pass the piece on given interest in Gregory’s work among First Things’ readership and Ephraim Radner’s review of it in First Things’ pages.

Radner faulted Gregory’s work for failing to identify a failure of love as a root cause of the fracturing of Western Christianity that is the Reformation. Pfau is much more appreciative of much of Gregory’s work (“a book whose courage and ambition I applaud, if for no other reason than that it exemplifies what an engaged form of historiography [and humanistic inquiry more generally] can and should do”); what makes his piece especially worthwhile is its trenchant engagement with critics of Gregory’s work and their often uncritical allegiance to the modernity of the modern academy. For those interested in Gregory’s book, the emergence of modernity, and the modern academy, Pfau’s piece is well worth reading. Excerpts:
