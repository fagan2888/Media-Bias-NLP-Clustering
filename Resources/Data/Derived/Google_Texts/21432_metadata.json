He slammed illegal immigrants in the infamous \u201crapists\u201d rant. He called for the banning of Muslims who try to enter the United States. Within his own party, he gave his opponents and biggest critics unflattering nicknames en route to destroying their chance at the presidency. He left \u201clow energy\u201d Jeb Bush, \u201cLyin\u201d Ted Cruz, and the rest of the Republican nominees in his dust trail, scratching their heads asking how and why they lost to Donald Trump.\n\nThe billionaire businessman turned presidential nominee racked up wins, accumulated votes, and dished out the pain.\n\nThick-skinned New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had the foresight to hop on the plane that bears the Trump name before any other GOP casualty could. Trump, Christie, and the rest of his team are one win away from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but before they get there they have to beat \u201ccrooked\u201d Hillary.\n\nIt might sound like fiction, but for the U.S. electorate in 2016, it\u2019s a fact.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s voter appeal has many working parts. His U.S.-China trade reform is one of the mechanisms that connects Trump to his supporters. They like that he wants to get tough on China for currency manipulation. They believe he\u2019s the right choice to take on America\u2019s $19 trillion debt. Whether or not anything he says makes sense/is possible/is actually a policy or \u201cjust a suggestion\u201d as he recently told CNN in reference to banning Muslims from entering the U.S., seems to depend on what state he\u2019s in and which demographic he\u2019s catering to at any given point in the election. He\u2019s not the first politician to do that, and he\u2019s not the last, but he is the first to do this.\n\nTrump has taken a swat at many people (political opponents, citizens who don\u2019t support him, President Obama), places (China, Mexico) and things (ObamaCare), since he entered the race for the White House. Voters are the exception. Besides the above video, his charm has allowed him to befriend supporters across the nation without being blatantly patronizing. Voters like what he\u2019s selling when it comes to blaming President Obama for everything including the sun, saying the sitting President will, \u201cgo down as perhaps the worst President in the history of the United States.\u201d The \u201cperhaps\u201d in that statement makes it a meaningless claim but it successfully receives applause breaks at Trump rallies \u2013 mission accomplished.\n\nSecond Amendment defenders have aligned themselves with Trump for his statements on the controversial issues of gun-control, Trump\u2019s stance is very simple to understand,\n\n\u201cThe right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period.\u201d\n\n(Yee-haw!)\n\nThe military and specifically veterans are also holding Trump in high regard. According to the Republican nominee, \u201cThe current state of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is absolutely unacceptable \u2026 Politicians in Washington have done too little too slowly to fix it. This situation can never happen again, and when Donald J. Trump is president, it will be fixed \u2013 fast.\u201d\n\n(He has a long-standing record of supporting veterans and has proven his efficiency in the business world, how that translates to governance is yet to be seen.)\n\nTrump\u2019s health care reform is essentially universal health care for Americans with a piece of what Sanders and Clinton are proposing and a twist of Trump (read: right-wing conservatives hate it). It\u2019s one of the most benevolent proposals to the populace and definitely a vote-getter, here\u2019s part of the TrumpCare tale.\n\n\u201cModify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s only other rational position is his tax plan. The key points of the plan are \u201ctax relief for the middle class, simplifying the tax code and growing the American economy without adding to the deficit.\u201d\n\nGee, that all sounds pretty good, maybe this Trump guy isn\u2019t so bad after all.\n\n(For the full story on Trump\u2019s positions, visit: donaldjtrump.com/positions.)\n\nHere\u2019s where the antagonizing/alienation begins. One of the positions that can be found on his website along with \u201cHealthcare Reform\u201d and \u201cU.S.-China Trade Reform,\u201d is a position literally called \u201cPay For The Wall.\u201d It\u2019s Trump\u2019s detailed plan on how he will make Mexico pay for a multi-billion dollar wall that stands along the U.S.-Mexico border. Here\u2019s part of how Trump would do that, pulled straight from his website.\n\n(Brace yourself)\n\n\u201cPay For The Wall\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an easy decision for Mexico: make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year. There are several ways to compel Mexico to pay for the wall including the following:\u201d \u201cOn day 1 promulgate a \u2018proposed rule\u2019 (regulation) amending 31 CFR 130.121 to redefine applicable financial institutions to include money transfer companies like Western Union, and redefine \u201caccount\u201d to include wire transfers. Also include in the proposed rule a requirement that no alien may wire money outside of the United States unless the alien first provides a document establishing his lawful presence in the United States.\u201d \u201cOn day 2 Mexico will immediately protest. They receive approximately $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens. It serves as de facto welfare for poor families in Mexico. There is no significant social safety net provided by the state in Mexico.\u201d \u201cOn day 3 tell Mexico that if the Mexican government will contribute the funds needed to the United States to pay for the wall, the Trump Administration will not promulgate the final rule, and the regulation will not go into effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have the moral high ground here, and all the leverage. It is time we use it in order to Make America Great Again.\u201d\n\n(And on the seventh day, Trump rested.)\n\nMoral high ground!\n\nIf Trump was trying to appeal to people who think the Mexicans are stealing our jobs, he might have crossed the invisible line on this one.\n\nBut perhaps there\u2019s still hope.\n\nOne of his points during his fiery-tempered campaign was the banning of all Muslims entering the U.S. Now Trump tells CNN it was \u201cjust a suggestion.\u201d Perhaps the idea of building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico will also become just a suggestion. If not, Trump will inevitably build a wall around himself with proposals like these and make it impossible for many to vote for him in the general election.\n\nNew demographics are on the horizon to try and appeal to. When will Trump realize that he will never get a chance to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d by running on policies that have to do with banning Muslims and building walls? The only building that can lead to the white one is building on his rational policies, which are: The U.S. China Trade Relationship, Healthcare Reform, Second Amendment Rights, Veterans Administration Reform, and Reforming The Tax Plan. If he can build on that he has a legitimate chance of beating either Hillary Clinton or (though unlikely) the venerable Vermont Senator, Bernie Sanders.\n\nWith the general election looming, Trump\u2019s positions need to become policies \u2013 fast. \u201cYuge\u201c issues such as climate change must be specifically addressed. So far, Trump has offered this to voters, \u201cnot a big believer in man-made climate change.\u201d \u2018Not a big believer\u2019 is not good enough. Flip-flopping, pandering to the crowd, and maturing politically should not be allowed to be this interchangeable on a daily basis at this point in the race for the most important job in the world.\n\nThe clock is ticking Donny.\n\nTrump (albeit a long shot), still has a chance at becoming the 45th President of the United States of America. If the economy continues to slump, ISIS still threatens and Sanders continues to surge, Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump will not be as predictable a win for Clinton as many perceive(d).\n\nTrump\u2019s saving grace is the geographical landscape of the election. The North East is usually a political stronghold for Democrats, but Trump is popular in New York and making New Jersey Gov. Christie his VP would also cut into Clinton\u2019s numbers. He also has a foothold in the ever- important Florida. The \u201crust belt\u201d and \u201ccoal country\u201d seem to be swinging his way. The South is likely to stay red. He\u2019ll get destroyed on the West Coast but due to his popularity on the East Coast (a rarity for Republicans), Trump should keep it competitive versus Clinton.\n\nWith respect to political experience, perhaps Trump\u2019s immature behaviour throughout his campaign is partly motivated by his insecurity. The only real world example/silver lining/something we can see with our own eyes of Trump teaming up with an elected official to show what he\u2019s capable of in politics, is a clip from many years ago (1986), when he teamed up with Mayor Koch to fix a skating rink in Central Park. Politicians mishandled millions of dollars in trying to rebuild the rink. Trump was sick of seeing the giant pothole in the New York City landmark and decided to get involved. He fixed it for less money and in less time and received acclaim from Koch for his work. It\u2019s not the strongest example, but once again there\u2019s not much to go on for the budding politician who doesn\u2019t seem interested in anything else but the presidency.\n\nIn conclusion, the \u201cTrump versus the world\u201d attitude is not good for Trump and subsequently the world if he keeps acting so immaturely. Donald Trump is a very intelligent man who has not lived up to his potential thus far. Winning the Republican nomination has a lot to do with the poor quality of his opponents and less to do with his strength as a presidential candidate. Even if it was a hustle and the real Donald Trump is yet to emerge, the \u201cjust a position\u201d argument might not be good enough to win over new voters. In terms of New York City icons, the demeanour he\u2019s displayed on the campaign trail reminds me more of King Kong than the brilliant business man of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s who was often asked to run for office. King Kong needs to crawl down from the Empire State building, let go of Hillary Clinton, take off the gorilla-suit and be (not act) presidential in order for voters and the rest of the world to take him seriously. It\u2019s difficult to imagine Donald Trump\u2019s current tone, positions and appeal to produce 51 percent of the vote in the 2016 general election. Or as Fran Lebowitz eloquently put it,\n\n\u201cThe lunatics vote in the primaries and Americans vote in the general and that is why we don\u2019t have a Republican president.\u201d\n\n[Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump is an offensive powerhouse.
