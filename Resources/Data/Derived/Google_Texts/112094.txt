A second person is dead after a two-vehicle, head-on crash Saturday in Aurora.

Aurora Police Sgt. Chris Carleton confirmed the second death on Sunday.

The two-vehicle crash happened at East 6th Avenue and Tower Road, said Aurora Fire Rescue Captain Mike Ackman.

A sedan with three people inside was eastbound on the two-lane section of 6th Avenue when it passed another vehicle into oncoming traffic, said Aurora Police traffic spokesman Sgt. Chris Carleton.

The sedan crashed head-on with an sports utility vehicle that was traveling west.

The man driving the sedan died at the scene, and police confirmed the death shortly after the accident.

Two other men in the car were taken to a hospital, and one of them died at the hospital later on Saturday.

One person from the sports utility vehicle was also taken to a local hospital.

Police havenâ€™t identified the people who died.

This is a developing story that will be updated as more information becomes available.
