Some customers of Connecticut’s health insurance exchange say problems with the exchange-generated forms they need to file their taxes have left them unable to file their taxes just days before the deadline.

The tax forms are known as 1095-As and are supposed to go to everyone who purchased a private insurance plan in 2014 through public exchanges like Connecticut’s Access Health CT.

On Friday, Access Health CEO Jim Wadleigh said anyone who is having problems related to a 1095-A and has not yet filed a tax return should file for an extension. Here’s more information on what to do.

If you haven’t filed your federal tax return yet:

You’ll need to file a request for an extension with the IRS by April 15. The form, known as a form 4868, is available here. When you get your correct 1095-A form, you can file your return using the information it provides.

If you already filed your taxes and think your 1095-A was incorrect:

You don’t have to file an amended tax return, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Even if you owe additional taxes, the IRS won’t seek to collect them from you.

However, if your 1095-A had incorrect information, you might benefit from filing an amended return – that is, you might end up owing less in taxes than you paid or qualifying for a larger refund. The treasury department suggests that people consider consulting with a tax preparer to determine if they would benefit from filing an amended return. The IRS has more information on that here.

If you did not receive a 1095-A form:

You should call Access Health at 866-230-8920.
