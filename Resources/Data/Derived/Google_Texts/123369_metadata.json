Facing New Hampshire's primary, Ted Cruz talked more about \"free-market principles\" and a \"commitment to the Constitution\" and said \"no one personality can right the wrongs done by Washington.\" Politico ran the headline \"Ted Cruz, born-again libertarian.\"\n\nI'm skeptical. Campaigning in Iowa, Cruz had emphasized religion and social conservatism.\n\nBut politicians no longer just target voters state-by-state\u2014they target by person.\n\nLast election, President Obama beat Mitt Romney partly by doing just that. Obama had 50 people working in data analytics. Romney had four.\n\n\"The campaign manager for the Obama campaign said the biggest institutional advantage they had was its use of data,\" observes Cato Institute fellow Emily Ekins.\n\nConservatives had data too, she says, but \"Republican insiders tended to be a little bit closed-minded when it came to new methodologies.\"\n\nNot Cruz. He told my producers recently, \"I bought a copy of David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager's book, The Audacity to Win, gave it to our senior team (and told them) we are going to nakedly and shamelessly emulate this.\"\n\nThe Obama campaigns kept detailed computer records on individuals likely to vote for Obama. On Election Day, volunteers concentrated on getting just those voters to vote.\n\nLikewise, this year the Cruz campaign didn't send volunteers to every single door to ask people for their vote. They saved precious time by knocking only on doors of likely Cruz voters who might need a nudge to go to the polls.\n\nCruz technology manager Chris Wilson told us that the campaign will then do \"whatever it takes. We go to their house. We'll bug them until they either turn out to vote or get a restraining order against us.\"\n\n\"Restraining order\" is a joke, but his volunteers do carry phone apps that even tell them what questions to ask occupants depending on whether a man or a woman answers the door.\n\nToday, all campaigns buy data from marketers. Ekins explains that \"companies amass enormous amounts of data based on transactions that you and I make\u2014whether we opened a store loyalty card, whether we subscribed to a magazine.\"\n\nThat data tells them something about how you think. Wilson told me, \"Someone who buys arugula, we've found that they tend to be a little bit more Democratic\u2014someone who buys iceberg lettuce tends to be more Republican.\"\n\nThere is truth in data. Outside Minneapolis, according to The New York Times, a manager of a Target store fielded an angry call from a father who was furious because Target sent his teenage daughter ads for baby products. You're encouraging my daughter to get pregnant, he complained.\n\nThe manager apologized and later called back to apologize again. But this time the father apologized, saying she is pregnant! Target knew before Dad did.\n\nNow politicians use similar data. Wilson says he can track where individual voters stand \"on moral issues, immigration, national security, on gun rights.\"\n\nTed Cruz adds that they then go beyond \"where\" people stand to target voters based on \"why.\"\n\n\"If you're a single mom, if you're carrying a revolver in your purse 'cause you don't want to get mugged, a duck-hunting ad is not going to do a thing to connect with you,\" Cruz told us. \"Just on the Second Amendment, we have a dozen different messages.\"\n\nThis offended some people who watched my recent TV special about this. pathgirl888 tweeted: \"Watching @JohnStossel re Tech Revolution. #Orwellian manipulation of IA voters ... creepy.\" Others complained, \"Cruz Camp is monitoring everything\" and \"INVASION OF PRIVACY!\"\n\nBut it's not just Cruz who does this. The Obama campaign reached into its supporters' Facebook accounts and asked them to persuade their friends to support Obama. Facebook then changed its policies to give \"friends\" more privacy protection, but it's safe to assume all future presidents will be elected with help from this sort of technology.\n\nWe asked an Iowa voter if he minded being targeted by Cruz. He said, \"No, I think it's excellent. Use every tool we can, because we have to defeat those people. They're using them.\"\n\nThe tech revolution is changing almost everything.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2016 BY JFS PRODUCTIONS INC.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Learning from the Obama election campaigns, Ted Cruz using data to win.", "title": "High-Tech Ted Cruz", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2016/02/10/high-tech-ted-cruz", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14550565166733.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14550565166733.jpg", "title": "High-Tech Ted Cruz", "description": "Learning from the Obama election campaigns, Ted Cruz using data to win.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Must Reads", "published_time": "2016-02-10T05:01:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/john-stossel"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Ted Cruz adds that they then go beyond \"where\" people stand to target voters based on \"why.\"\nLikewise, this year the Cruz campaign didn't send volunteers to every single door to ask people for their vote.\nThey saved precious time by knocking only on doors of likely Cruz voters who might need a nudge to go to the polls.\nBut politicians no longer just target voters state-by-state\u2014they target by person.\nCruz technology manager Chris Wilson told us that the campaign will then do \"whatever it takes."}
