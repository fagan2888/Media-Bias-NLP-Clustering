And Kelly in particular said Lynch should be the \u201cmost acceptable\u201d choice to the right wing.\n\nO\u2019Reilly spent most of the segment pointing out that Lynch stepped up in a case where a judge sentenced a man guilty of raping two underage boys to two years in prison. At the time, O\u2019Reilly really tore apart the judge, but had effusive praise for Lynch, who charged the man with a federal crime. O\u2019Reilly said, \u201cShe is a hero and should be respected by all Americans for standing up to a gross injustice.\u201d\n\nAnd O\u2019Reilly stood by that tonight as both he and Kelly talked about the case and Lynch. O\u2019Reilly said he was \u201cheartened\u201d by how she acted in that case when she didn\u2019t have to. Kelly went even further in giving Lynch due credit:\n\n\u201cThis is the person who should be the most acceptable to the right wing of the Republicans in this country of anybody who President Obama was considering. She is a straight shooter.\u201d\n\nKelly pointed out that Lynch doesn\u2019t have close ties to the White House and is not an ideologue (as Eric Holder\u2018s critics have charged of him), and she\u2019s \u201cbeen a leader\u201d in cracking down on gang crime and terrorism.\n\nWatch the video below, via Fox News:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill O'Reilly and Megyn Kelly joined together tonight in praise of Loretta Lynch, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn who's poised to be the next attorney general.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kelly.jpg", "title": "Megyn Kelly: Loretta Lynch Should Be \u2018Most Acceptable\u2019 AG Choice for GOP"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bill O'Reilly and Megyn Kelly joined together tonight in praise of Loretta Lynch, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn who's poised to be the next attorney general.
