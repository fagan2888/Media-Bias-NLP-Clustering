ColoradoCare could conceivably be the best thing that this great state has ever implemented. This statewide healthcare payment system would be an amendment, the 69th, to the Colorado Constitution. "Amendment" means the people have bypassed the parliamentary system and will implement their own needs directly by vote, versus referendum produced by the state legislature.

ColoradoCare proposes to create a health care payment for all Coloradans with zero deductibles to include: all preventative, hospitalization, surgery, long-term care, palliative care, mental health, substance abuse care, dental, eye, hearing and medication. For a household with income of $50,000 this would mean about $139 a month.

The opposition will come out strong and say things like that will be more than the entire state budget.

Here's what they won't say: Wow! Now you have a co-op system of health care with elected board members whose sole purpose and duty is to pay out health care and to drive down cost â€” elected board members. They won't mention that medical financial distress will be a thing of the past here in Colorado with no deductibles required. They wont tell us that our children are covered until they are 26. They wont remind us that this will opt us out of the Affordable Care Act and create a total health care even for the indigent. They will not tell us that we will immediately be saving billions. Longmont alone will save about $4.6 million for our city employee's health care benefits. The city of Denver saves $57 million. And while their health care benefits will absolutely increase 4 percent a year; our benefits, run at a platinum plan level, will only possibly go up 1.5 percent every two years, all for about the price of a Starbucks coffee a day.
