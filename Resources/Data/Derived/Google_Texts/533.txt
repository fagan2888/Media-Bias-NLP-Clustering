A 47-year-old woman died Saturday afternoon after she struck a utility pole in Tarrant County.

The woman crashed her pickup truck in the 5900 block of Teague Road in Rendon, about 40 miles southwest of Dallas. She was thrown from the truck and pronounced dead at the scene, said Terry Grisham, spokesman for the Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office.

The driver has been identified by the Tarrant County Medical Examiner’s Office as Bridgette Griffith.

The collision occurred near the woman’s house, Grisham said. Investigators say that she drove a short distance from her home, accelerated and lost control. They believe she was not wearing a seat belt, he said.

Griffith’s husband told investigators that he and his wife had been drinking alcohol on Saturday afternoon and had gotten into an fight.

“They had some words and she was in an agitated state when she left the house,” Grisham said.

The cause of the crash is under investigation. The collision with the utility pole knocked out power at some nearby homes, but it has been restored, Grisham said.
