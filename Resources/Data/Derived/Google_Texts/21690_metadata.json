But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big \u2014 when you stop and think about it, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019d just disappear over the course of time \u2014 to store that much grain.\u201d\n\nSocial media quickly overflowed with scorn. Critics \u2014 and not just archaeologists \u2014 pointed to well-documented evidence that the structures were built as tombs, not granaries. Photos of pyramid burial vaults circulated on Twitter. Soon, Carson\u2019s comments had become a meme with references to the food pyramid and \u201cStargate.\u201d\n\n[Ben Carson\u2019s first foray into politics \u2014 on both sides of a \u201992 abortion debate]\n\nBen Carson was becoming a joke.\n\nCarson, a famed neurosurgeon, is no stranger to controversy. He has made a string of incendiary comments in recent years. Carson has claimed that homosexuality is a choice, evolution is an idea encouraged by the devil and, most famously, Obamacare is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d\n\nBut to claim that the pyramids, which American kids learn about in grade school, were not tombs for pharaohs but grain silos built by a biblical hero appeared to rise to another level. To some critics, it was akin to Dan Quayle\u2019s infamous \u201cpotatoe\u201d gaffe. And when Carson confirmed to CBS Wednesday night that he still believes Joseph built the pyramids as granaries, the video began to assume Mitt Romney \u201c47 percent\u201d proportions as the moment when Carson\u2019s flaws as a candidate suddenly crystallized into a single quote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how one can be a neurosurgeon and a dimwit at the same time,\u201d one person tweeted, echoing a common refrain.\n\nThe Internet scorn, however, ignored a couple of things.\n\nFirst, there was the rest of the video: roughly 14 more minutes that frame Carson\u2019s pyramid quote in the context of a bigger critique of both science and ignorance.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s precisely that critique, that strange blend of surgical knowledge and scientific skepticism, that may have Carson positioned atop polls in Iowa and in contention for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nA 17-year-old video surfaced of Republican candidate Ben Carson claiming that the Biblical figure Joseph built the Egyptian pyramids to store food. The Fix's Chris Cillizza explains why this comment will only help Carson's campaign. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nAlthough attention has focused almost entirely on Carson\u2019s claim that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain, that statement is just one moment from the commencement speech, which 17 years ago already hinted at the beginnings of Carson\u2019s political career.\n\nThe entire speech doesn\u2019t appear to be online, but 15 minutes of it were uploaded to YouTube more than three years ago under the title, \u201cThe Andrews Experience \u2014 Dr. Ben Carson 1998 Graduation key note speaker.\u201d\n\n[Carson\u2019s positions on poverty create tension with rags-to-riches life story]\n\nThe video begins with a visibly younger Carson standing at a lectern, congratulating Andrews University\u2019s class of 1998. The school describes itself as the \u201cflagship university\u201d of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, of which Carson is a member.\n\nCarson begins the commencement speech with a prayer, then makes a joke.\n\n\u201cYou guys are fortunate today because we have two services and this one\u2019s supposed to be over at 11,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s a good thing that I\u2019m a surgeon \u2019cause I can cut this short.\u201d\n\nHe then frames his speech around the acronym and mantra made famous in his 1990 autobiography, \u201cGifted Hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought that I would talk my own personal philosophy for success in life: think big,\u201d he says. \u201cEach one of those letters as you know means something special, but the whole concept is something special also, because we must recognize to whom we belong. We belong to God. And God is the creator of the universe. the original big thinker. And since we are his offspring, there is certainly no reason that we should in any way limit our concepts of what we will be able to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nA view of the Great Pyramids of Giza, south of the Egyptian capital Cairo. (Dana Smillie/Polaris)\n\nCarson immediately jumps to the example of Joseph, implicitly drawing a parallel between himself and the biblical figure, the son of Jacob and wearer of the coat of many colors, sold into slavery by his jealous brothers.\n\n\u201cYou know I think back on Joseph, one of my favorite Bible characters,\u201d he said. \u201cJoseph\u2019s big thinking got him into a little trouble. He was thinking, \u2018All you guys are going to be bowing down to me,\u2019 and that was okay for him to think that but he shouldn\u2019t have said it. You have to exercise some wisdom.\n\n\u201cAt any rate, that big thinking of his, look where it got him. He ended up being sold into slavery. But did that dampen his thinking? In no way. He said, if I\u2019m going to be in prison, I want to be the best prisoner they ever saw. And he ended up in charge of the prison. I mean, that was pretty big thinking \u2026.\n\n\u201cAnd of course he ended up as prime minister of the most powerful nation in the world at that time, so that should tell us a fair amount about the persistence of having large concepts and making sure that we include God in those concepts. I think that is really the key.\n\n\u201cI think of some of the things that Joseph did as the prime minister of Egypt. Here was a man who was basically able to save the entire world with his big thinking: building grain reserves that would last for seven years of famine. Can you imagine having the technology, the wisdom, the knowledge to be able to do that? We can\u2019t do that now. He was able to do that back then.\u201d\n\n[Donald Trump: No apology for questioning Ben Carson\u2019s Seventh-day Adventist faith]\n\nHere, Carson appears to be referring to a passage in Genesis where \u201cJoseph stored up grain in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure.\u201d According to the Bible, Joseph then fed Egypt and the rest of the world during the seven-year famine that followed.\n\n\u201cNow, my own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain,\u201d Carson continued. \u201cNow all the archaeologists think that they were made for the pharaohs\u2019 graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big \u2014 when you stop and think about it, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019d just disappear over the course of time \u2014 to store that much grain.\u201d\n\nCarson appears to be interpreting the Bible literally, and concluding that the pyramids fit the bill as Joseph\u2019s grain silos. (Archaeological digs have shown that the pyramids are not hollow and so could not have held large quantities of grain. Rather, they contain narrow passages leading to royal burial chambers.)\n\n\n\nA visitor looks at a sarcophagus inside the \u201cSerapuem\u201d tomb, near the Saqqara or \u201cStep\u201d Pyramid, south of Cairo, Sept. 20, 2012. (Reuters/Mohamed Abd El Ghany)\n\n\u201cAnd when you look at the way that the pyramids are made, with many chambers that are hermetically sealed, they\u2019d have to be that way for a reason. And various of scientists have said, \u2018Well, you know there were alien beings that came down and they had special knowledge and that\u2019s how they were \u2014\u2019 you know, it doesn\u2019t require an alien being when God is with you.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really the key. People may not even be able to explain what it is that you\u2019re accomplishing, but they don\u2019t have to be able to explain it when God is there. All you have to be able to do is to accept his presence and his total understanding of everything and link yourself with that. What a difference that makes. It makes you calm.\u201d\n\nCarson then broadens his big thinking to cast doubt on science, more generally, as well as the Big Bang and evolution.\n\n\u201cI have many arguments, I guess you could call them \u2018discussions,\u2019 with so-called scientists who think that I should not believe in God because there is scientific evidence of the way life evolved.\n\n\u201cI remember once, a few years ago, there were about eight or nine panelists. They were all Nobel Prize-winners. And the question came up: How did life originate? And after all their machinations, they finally came to the conclusion that life emanated as a result of a bunch of promiscuous biochemicals getting together. That was the best that they could come up with.\u201d\n\nCarson then criticizes scientists some more.\n\n\u201cI recently had a discussion with a well-known physicist. He was talking about the Big Bang Theory and how all this obviously culminated into this wonderful, extraordinarily organized solar system that we now have, which you can set your watch by, where scientists can predict 70 years away when a comet is coming. That\u2019s an incredible amount of organization to have originated from just a large explosion.\u201d\n\nCarson then tells the story of how he supposedly stumped the physicist by asking him how he could reconcile such an \u201corganized\u201d universe with the laws of thermodynamics, specifically entropy, which says that systems tend to move toward disorder.\n\n\u201cWell of course he has no answer for that. They never have an answer for any of these things,\u201d he concludes, broadening his story into a universal. \u201cAnd see that\u2019s the wonderful thing about having a relationship with God. God has already told us what happened, so we don\u2019t have to come up with fanciful theories so that we can take the place of God. We don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s critics often portray him as a man who has drifted from a background in science in order to pursue a presidential bid. But the video shows he was criticizing the Big Bang and evolution \u2014 and redefining the pyramids \u2014 almost two decades ago.\n\nIn fact, Carson addressed the appearance of a contradiction between being a brain surgeon and a devoted Seventh-day Adventist in his autobiography. Raised by a single mother who couldn\u2019t read, Carson went from a struggling, angry young man in Detroit to a stellar student at Yale and then the University of Michigan\u2019s medical school, a transformation he credits to his faith.\n\n[As Ben Carson bashes Obama, many blacks see a hero\u2019s legacy fade]\n\nHe retold part of this story in the 1998 Andrews commencement speech, underlining the parallel between him and Joseph \u2014 young strugglers who came good through big thinking \u2014 even further. In fifth grade, Carson was the \u201cdumbest\u201d person in his class, he says. \u201cIt bothered me a lot.\u201d\n\nIn his autobiography, Carson describes how that frustration, combined with his faith, propelled him to become a world famous brain surgeon.\n\n\u201cGod wanted me to be a doctor,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s my belief that God gives us all gifts, special abilities that we have the privilege of developing to help us serve Him and humanity. And the gift of eye and hand coordination has been an invaluable asset in surgery.\u201d\n\nCarson does not disbelieve in science, he explains in the commencement speech. In fact, he complained that American students had, like a younger version of him, neglected their studies in math and science.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a significant problem for our nation because we have moved out of the industrial age, out of the agricultural age, into the information age where knowledge is power,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd those of us who claim a relationship with the creator of the universe certainly must avail ourselves of the knowledge that he has provided for us.\u201d\n\nBut he views science, and his medical knowledge, as grounded in God. \u201cEvery time we discover something new, I now know something that previously only God knew,\u201d he says, citing a friend who is both a scientist and a Christian. \u201cI think that is a wonderful way of looking at things.\u201d\n\nMany Americans agree.\n\nFour national polls currently show Carson ahead of Donald Trump, largely thanks to his support among evangelicals.\n\nWashington Post nonfiction book critic Carlos Lozada recently binge read eight of Donald Trump's books and five of Ben Carson's. So which Republican presidential candidate is the better author? (Tom LeGro/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cHe does the Christian identity thing, and it seems to be working for him better than it has for other previous examples,\u201d conservative activist and 2000 presidential candidate Gary Bauer told BuzzFeed.\n\nIn Iowa, where Carson also has an edge on Trump, a recent poll sought to explain why the doctor has surged into the lead. Iowa Republican caucus-goers told Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register pollsters that they liked the fact that Carson wasn\u2019t a career politician, that he was a successful neurosurgeon, that he had an inspirational story and that he criticized Obamacare.\n\n[Ben Carson\u2019s religion isn\u2019t hurting him with evangelical voters]\n\nBut the things they rated most highly were that \u201che has said he would be guided by his faith in God\u201d (62 percent found that \u201cvery favorable\u201d) and that he \u201capproaches issues with common sense\u201d (70 percent \u201cvery favorable\u201d).\n\nCritics who focus on Carson\u2019s pyramid quote miss that he called for better science education in the same speech, or that his comments about God, the Big Bang and evolution actually reflect that of most Americans, if not scientists. If Carson does snag the GOP nomination, then perhaps we will look back at the recently unearthed 1998 commencement speech not for his strange beliefs about biblical pyramid builders, but for another quote near the end of the clip.\n\nWhen Carson comes to the \u201cH\u201d in \u201cThink Big,\u201d he says it stands for \u201chonesty\u201d and then tells a story he believes demonstrates it.\n\n\u201cI remember a few years ago I made a commercial in Maryland because a vote was coming up about abortion, and I made a commercial basically saying that people needed to think before they killed innocent babies,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, the pro-life people took that commercial and they used it, along with some other things that were not true, to scare people. At which time I called a press conference and I asked them to remove the commercial from the air, and I said that even though I\u2019m very much against the concept of abortion, I\u2019m even more opposed to the concept of untruth, and that I didn\u2019t want my name associated with anything that smacked of untruth.\n\n\u201cAnd that required a lot of courage. But you know something, when you do something that is right, it\u2019s very interesting what the consequences are because, when all the dust settled, both the pro-life people and the pro-choice people thought that I was on their side.\u201d\n\nThen, as the crowd laughs, Carson delivers a prescient soundbite.\n\n\u201cSomebody said: \u2018You know, you ought to run for political office because everyone thinks you\u2019re on their side,'\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWhen you align yourself with God you are on everybody\u2019s side,\u201d he adds just before the video clip ends, \u201cbecause God is on everybody\u2019s side.\u201d\n\n1 of 50 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 See photos of Ben Carson on the campaign trail View Photos The retired neurosurgeon is seeking the Republican presidential nomination.
