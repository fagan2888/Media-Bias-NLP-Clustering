There was a lot of upbeat high-flying fun at the Cox Business Center on Saturday.

Jamfest was in Tulsa for its cheer and dance competition. Hundreds of Green Country's talented cheerleaders and dancers of all ages competed.

Competitors were as young as 3 years old all the way up to 18.

"We work in the office all week long to make sure we have the perfect competition for these kids and that's why we do it, it's for the kids" Katie Loos said.

"We like to walk away knowing that each one of these individual athletes had a blast."
