Greg Abbott speak at the Kaufman County Republican fundraiser on Saturday night.\n\nThe governor told the crowd gathered at Terrell Bible Church that Texas is a model for America. He voiced his strong stance against the Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality as well as his desire to repeal every word of The Affordable Care Act \u2014 commonly referred to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cOur United States (Supreme Court) assaulted that freedom of religion this last week in it\u2019s ruling on marriage,\u201d Abbott said. \u201c\u2026Marriage is nowhere to be found in the U.S. Constitution and because of that, throughout time, the United States Supreme Court has never ruled in a way where the federal government controls states\u2019 definition of marriage until now.\u201d\n\nAbbott said while conservative Republicans may have lost that case, they will not give up fighting for their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I did yesterday morning (Friday morning) was issue an executive order from the governor\u2019s office to all state employees and all state agencies making two points crystal clear,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cOne, no state employees can be discriminated against because of their closely held religious beliefs about marriage being between one man and one woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond point is that no entity doing business with the State of Texas, whether you\u2019re an individual, a person, a group, an organization or corporation can be discriminated against because of your closely held religious belief that marriage is a union between one man and one woman,\u201d he said.\n\nAbbott also said he helped in passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, patterned after the Federal Religious Freedom Act, protecting those who held religious beliefs different from the government\u2019s stance on key issues. He also highlighted the passing the new open-carry gun law during the recently ended Texas Legislative session, as well as maintaining a conservative form of government both in budget and policy.\n\n\u201cLet me just close with this. It is a fact \u2026 America needs Texas,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cTexas is the pathway for the future of this country. And Texas needs Kaufman County.\u201d\n\nOrganizers of the fundraiser said dozens of attendees were able to participate in a silent auction and enjoy barbecue while connecting with one another on multiple topics.\n\nKaufman County GOP secretary, precinct and finance chairman Lori Cook said that the turnout surpassed her expectations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than I expected,\u201d said Cook. \u201cI asked the Lord to just bless our efforts and he has exceedingly and abundantly done that.\u201d\n\nCook said funds raised will go for administrative uses, renting locations for special programs, candidate forums and paying the bills. She said the party does not endorse candidates for primary elections and that while the event was held at a local church it was not a church related event.\n\nTim Spillman, who is running for sheriff for Kaufman County, also had a chance to be among other conservative leaders and politicians in support of the fundraiser. Spillman has been involved with the Kaufman County Republicans for nearly three years.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the biggest event that I can remember we\u2019ve had\u2026It\u2019s going to be interesting with what\u2019s going on to hear what he (Abbott) has to say,\u201d Spillman said.\n\nThe program started with an invocation by Ronnie Oldfield, Kaufman County treasurer, followed by dinner and later a pledge to the United States flag by State Sen. Bob Hall.\n\nThe pledge to the Texas flag was performed by State Rep. Stuart Spitzer and the song \u201cTexas, our Texas\u201d was led by Bo Graham. Terrell Mayor Hal Richards welcomed special guests and John Cook recognized veterans and elected officials.\n\nRemarks and special recognition were given by Jimmy Weaver, chairman of the Kaufman County Republican Party. Texas U.S. Rep. Jeb Hensarling also gave remarks before introducing Abbott.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Terrell Tribune", "description": "A crowd of about 200 gathered with anticipation to hear fellow Republicans and Texas Gov.
