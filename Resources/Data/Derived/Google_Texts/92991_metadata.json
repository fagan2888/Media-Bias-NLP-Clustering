We\u2019re told she\u2019s a fashion designer, model, actress, socialite and blogger. We see she\u2019s a wearer of bikinis.\n\nStill, why Kim Kardashian is famous is a mystery.\n\n\u201cI do not know what she does,\u201d Stephen Colbert joked on his Comedy Central show this week, echoing the thoughts of many of us. When someone\u2019s primary expertise is omnipresence, the more we know, the less we actually learn.\n\nBut we\u2019re getting more insight from Kim\u2019s latest and more unlikely role as a rather convincing video game character.\n\n\u201cKim Kardashian: Hollywood,\u201d a free-to-play mobile game by the reality star, is one of the more refreshingly honest critiques of our city and the celebrity culture it feeds. Released in late June for Apple and Android devices, the game has been a constant in Apple\u2019s most-downloaded app charts. Developer Glu Mobile announced this week that \u201cKim Kardashian: Hollywood\u201d generated $1.6 million in its first five days of release.\n\nAnd, yes, a game involving a Kardashian does at first warrant a roll of the eyes.\n\n\u201cDating famous people will get you more fans,\u201d the game tells us after loading. Moments later it informs us that pets are good for our self-image. Later, it educates us on the three things that matter when it comes to success: \u201cExposure, exposure, exposure!\u201d\n\nStill, as vapid as it all seems, it doesn\u2019t take long for it all to ring uncomfortably true.\n\nThe premise is simple. Players create a svelte character, male or female, and it arrives preordained as a future tabloid-worthy celeb. The rest of the game consists of climbing to the A-list and navigating the world as a famous person.\n\nKim is in the game, popping up regularly to dispense advice or give players rewards, acting as a sort of Clarence Odbody for the severely self-interested. She\u2019s our celebrity guardian angel, letting us know when it\u2019s time to get an agent or get a date (a Kim-approved date, as she has a contact list filled with both \u201csporty girls\u201d and \u201cthe artistic kind\u201d).\n\n\u201cKim Kardashian: Hollywood\u201d is cleverly designed to offer us a look behind the curtain. It gives us a glimpse at strategizing conversations with publicists, and it lets us in on some ace talking points for dates (hint: famous authors). We have run-ins with catty paparazzi, and celebrity bloggers are viewed as low-life celebrities themselves.\n\nBut after playing a harangued celebrity for a while, I began to feel empathy for Kim, a person who formerly represented all that can be disdainful about our gossip-obsessed culture.\n\nThat\u2019s because \u201cKim Kardashian: Hollywood\u201d shows us that being a star 24/7 is kind of a drag. The game is a sort of virtual Trojan Horse, where we all realize that despite the glamour and the cash, the Kardashians must live under the microscope or risk obscurity.\n\nMake a seemingly innocent remark, and wait for it to be misinterpreted on the Internet. What to wear, when to text, where to dine and what to tweet become monumental decisions when the game (like the press and social media) is constantly grading your every move as indicator of social status.\n\nIn this sense, the game exaggerates our unfortunate reliance on image and the minute-by-minute quest for attention. It\u2019s a pursuit that\u2019s at the core of our social media age \u2014 the exact infrastructure that keeps, say, Kim Kardashian in daily headlines despite the fact that she rarely generates any real news.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that \u201cKim Kardashian: Hollywood\u201d may just be the most enlightened video game released yet this year for the simple reason that it treats same-sex couples as the norm. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t flirt with that guy at the Brew Palms,\u201d Kim told my female avatar, Kes, early in the game. \u201cNot interested in him, or maybe you\u2019re looking to meet women?\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s smart. When a gossip-monger trashed Kes on the Internet, mocking her relationship with Kim as fake, she did so with the following in-game tweet: \u201cTotal conspiracy! #Illuminati #Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThese topical and progressive flourishes make up for some of the game\u2019s less-becoming traits, namely the pressure to buy in-app purchases (the game may be fun, but you didn\u2019t expect Kim to be altruistic, did you?). You\u2019ll need energy to schmooze because being a star is draining.\n\nAnd if you truly want to ascend from the D-list to the A-list you\u2019ll probably need to buy some energy boosts using the game\u2019s currency \u2014 shiny and silver \u201cK\u201d stars which can be slowly accrued or paid for with real-life cash.\n\nLooking into \u201cKim Kardashian: Hollywood\u201d is to be the Evil Queen peering into a Magic Mirror that\u2019s reflecting a disheartening truth. There\u2019s always someone fairer in a world where our own Twitter feeds and Instagram portraits have twisted our daily lives into small-scale reality shows. And we can\u2019t stop watching.\n\n\u2014 Todd Martens | @Toddmartens | @LATherocomplex\n\nRECENT AND RELATED:\n\n\u2018Valiant Hearts: The Great War\u2019 upends the combat video game\n\nMobile games keep it simple and smart\n\nThe balletic \u2018Bounden\u2019 is a pas de deux with Player 2\n\nNintendo keeps the video game industry weird", "article_metadata": {"description": "THE PLAYER Whether we like it or not, when it comes to Kim Kardashian, we\u2019re all, in a sense, amateur Kardiologists.
