Ted Cruz does. He gets his health insurance from his wife's employer, Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs.\n\nThat means that if Cruz is successful in overturning Obamacare, he'll still be covered even as 11 million others lose their insurance.\n\nThat, apparently, is their problem, not his.\n\nIf you have a consumer question, email me at asklaz@latimes.com or contact me via Twitter @Davidlaz.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Healthcare: Where do members of Congress get their coverage?", "date": "2015-02-18", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Mike saw my\u00a0 recent Ask Laz on whether members of Congress have to pay into Social Security (answer: yes, if elected after 1984).", "title": "Healthcare: Where do members of Congress get their coverage?", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-laz-congress-members-health-insurance-20150218-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54e4feb6/turbine/la-fi-laz-congress-members-health-insurance-20150218", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "consumer, healthcare", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82850716", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "consumer, healthcare", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "What health benefits do members of Congress receive?"}, "article_summary": "The idea was that most members of Congress are a good deal wealthier than ordinary Americans and thus shouldn't qualify for government assistance, which was made available when Congress members were shifted from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\nThis prompted him to ask: \"What kind of health benefits do members of Congress receive?\"\nMike saw my recent Ask Laz on whether members of Congress have to pay into Social Security (answer: yes, if elected after 1984).\nNearly 13,000 members of Congress and staffers are currently enrolled in gold-level Small Business Health Option Program plans on the Washington, D.C., exchange.\nHe gets his health insurance from his wife's employer, Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs."}
