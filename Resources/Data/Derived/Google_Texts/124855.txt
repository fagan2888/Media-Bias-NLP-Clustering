Grieving Father Implicates Denver Courts in Ex-Wife’s Murder of Their Son

A 5-year-old Denver boy’s mother killed him and then herself last week in Montana – all after the boy’s grieving father said he had been warning of this and fighting for his son’s custody for years ever since the couple’s break up.

The courts had evidence of the mother’s erratic behavior, the man alleged through tears in an interview last Saturday, but no actions were taken to grant the man custody over the child – in fact, he claims, he received active pushback and resistance on the matter.

According to local Fox 31 Denver, when the man tried to warn Child Protection Services of this, the female agent he spoke to threatened make sure he would never see his son again if he continued to speak out against the mother:

“And she stood in front of me and pointed at my closet and said, ‘Unless your kid’s being stuck in a closet everyday or beaten everyday, I’m not going to do anything about it, and if you call back, if I hear back from you about this kind of stuff, I’m going to take him from you and her.”
