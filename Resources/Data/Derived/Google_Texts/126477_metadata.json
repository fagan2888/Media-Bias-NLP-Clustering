Her newly-adopted son, Charlie, relies on a ventilator, feeding tube, and other medical equipment to stay alive. The 1-year-old, despite the equipment and Cori\u2019s care, isn\u2019t expected to live.\n\n\u201cHe will die; there\u2019s no changing that,\u201d Cori told the Sheboygan Press. \u201cBut, we can make a difference in how he lives, and the difference for Charlie is that he will be loved before he dies.\u201d\n\nThe heartbreaking sentiment is not a new one for Cori, who worked as a registered nurse and perinatal bereavement specialist at the Hope After Loss Organization (HALO). The organization aims to help families cope with the loss of an unborn or newborn child. Cori sometimes found herself cradling children whose pulses were fading after their parents became too overwhelmed with emotion to hold them. Her work also exposed her to what she called \u201chospice babies,\u201d children with limited or terminal diagnoses whose parents had given them up because of the situation. Cori explained that many of these babies spent their short lives being tube fed, and never removed from their cribs or held.\n\n\u201cThere was no judgement on my part that the parents should just be able to deal with the circumstances,\u201d Cori said. \u201cBut I thought, \u2018wow, I would really like to take those kiddos and care for them.'\u201d\n\nThen, Cori was struck with serious medical problems of her own, battling an autoimmune disorder that led to gastrointestinal distress and multiple surgeries. There were complications, and Cori was left without a job, feeling hopeless. In August 2012, she and her family received a call asking if they would be willing to take care of a new \"hospice baby, \" a two-week-old girl with no name and no one to claim her.\n\nThe child had a grim prognosis \u2014 she had been born without the right or left hemispheres of her brain and had only a brain stem. This left her in a vegetative state, unable to see or hear. Cori brought the girl home anyways, named her Emmalyn, and accepted the \u201cprivilege\u201d of giving the little girl a family.\n\nEmmalyn lived only 50 days, but Cori said she lived more in 50 days than many folks do in a lifetime \u2014 she and her family brought Emmalyn everywhere with them, holding her and hugging her. When the evening came that the baby\u2019s health started to fade, Cori made sure to keep her close, snuggling her into a warm bathrobe and singing to her until she passed.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t suffer, she wasn\u2019t in pain, and she most certainly wasn\u2019t alone,\u201d Cori told Today. \u201cIt was painful initially. Gradually we were able to see the opportunity to hold her through this life and as she entered the next solely as a gift. Emmalyn had left her tiny impression on our lives and, while we were grieving her loss, we eventually began to heal and consider taking in another baby.\u201d\n\nIn October 2014, Charlie came home to the Salcherts with a life-limiting diagnosis of Hypoxic Ischemic Brain Encephalopathy, meaning he experiences neurological impairments because of a lack of oxygen to the brain. Charlie comes with a lot of equipment, and a lot of worry, but Cori plans to do her best.\n\n\u201cAs in Emmalyn\u2019s case, we do everything we can to love Charlie, and we take him on adventures with us everywhere we can,\u201d she said. \u201cWe even got approval for a bed large enough for us to snuggle in with him and cuddle him while he is attached to the tubes and machines that keep him alive.\u201d\n\nCori maintains that it is a gift to be a part of these children\u2019s lives, and be able to ease their suffering even when they aren\u2019t able to give back or even smile.\n\n\u201cWe invest deeply, and we ache terribly when these kids die, but our hearts are like stained glass windows,\u201d she said. \u201cThose windows are made of broken glass which has been forged back together, and those windows are even stronger and more beautiful for having been broken.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "wisconsin, mom, cori, salchert, provides, foster, care, hospice, babies, life, limiting, or", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Cori has adopted two children in addition to her biological kids, but both of them had very special medical issues.", "title": "Wisconsin Mom Adopts Terminal \u2018Hospice Babies\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/wisconsin-mom-cori-salchert-provides-foster-care-hospice-babies-life-limiting-371080", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/27/cori-salchert.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cori has adopted two children in addition to her biological kids, but both of them had very special medical issues.", "title": "Wisconsin Mom Adopts Terminal \u2018Hospice Babies\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/wisconsin-mom-cori-salchert-provides-foster-care-hospice-babies-life-limiting-371080", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/27/cori-salchert.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/27/cori-salchert.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-01-27T12:07:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-27T12:07:18-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Cori has adopted two children in addition to her biological kids, but both of them had very special medical issues."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d8e\"", "article_summary": "Cori Salchert has eight biological children with her husband Mark, but she\u2019s been a mother to more babies than just her own.\nCori brought the girl home anyways, named her Emmalyn, and accepted the \u201cprivilege\u201d of giving the little girl a family.\n\u201cThere was no judgement on my part that the parents should just be able to deal with the circumstances,\u201d Cori said.\nCori explained that many of these babies spent their short lives being tube fed, and never removed from their cribs or held.\nCori sometimes found herself cradling children whose pulses were fading after their parents became too overwhelmed with emotion to hold them."}
