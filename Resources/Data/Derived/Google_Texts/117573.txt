Fox Sports reporter Erin Andrews enjoyed Richard Sherman’s post-game outburst against San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Michael Crabtree, saying over the weekend that she wished athletes would be more like the outspoken Seattle Seahawks cornerback.

“I don’t think it was bizarre, I think it was great,” she said on Fox’s “Media Buzz,” Mediaite.com reported.

“I wish more athletes would be like that,” she said. “We want someone to lose their minds like that. … That’s why it went viral; that’s why people were going bananas over it. You don’t usually see athletes doing that. You see them very composed.”

Sherman drew fire for his victory rant during an interview with Andrews after his team beat the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game.

“I’m the best corner in the game. When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that’s the result you gonna get. Don’t you ever talk about me. […] Don’t you open your mouth about the best or I’m gonna shut it for you real quick.”

Andrews said she flew out to Seattle shortly after her interview with Sherman for a sit-down.

“We hugged. We made fun of a lot of people in their comments and we had a good time,” she said.
