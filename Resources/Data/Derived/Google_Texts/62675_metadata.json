They implemented a chronotype-adjusted shift schedule \u2014 a schedule based on a worker\u2019s sleep patterns. In other words, morning birds were never assigned to work the night shift and vice versa. Those with an intermediate chronotype served as the control.\n\nAfter the new shifts were assigned, researchers measured for sleep duration and quality, social jetlag, well-being, stress, and satisfaction during their time off. And they found working based on individual sleep patterns increased their sleep during the week. Similarly, workers didn\u2019t require as much sleep on their time off, because they were no longer trying to catch up on sleep loss. Study author Till Roenneberg called this a \u201cdouble-win situation.\u201d\n\nWhile morning birds felt more satisfied with sleep during the week, also experiencing a reduction in jetlag and improved general well-being, this wasn\u2019t the case for night owls assigned to the night shift. In fact, their improvements were so slight, researchers concluded working late into the night is hard on everyone.\n\nPrior to this study, research has shown night shift workers are more susceptible to insomnia, diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease, as well as sleep-related accidents, injuries, even fatalities. Social jetlag in particular \u2014 a term used when the body\u2019s internal clock doesn\u2019t match up with an individual\u2019s daily schedule \u2014 has been linked to unhealthy behaviors, including smoking and drinking.\n\nEach person, as Medical Daily previously reported, has its own internal timer influenced by DNA and the surrounding environment. Work schedules aside, studies find a general lack of sleep (as little as 30 minutes every day in the week), which throws off our clock, leads to increased hunger and weight gain among several other health problems.\n\nResearchers of the present study hope to build upon this connection in the future. They\u2019re conducting additional experiments they\u2019ve designed to recreate these findings in laboratory mice, which they hope will eventually influence work cultures and how people manage their time.\n\n\"We know that sleep has important implications not only on physical health but also on mood, stress, and social interactions, so that improving sleep will most probably result in many other positive side effects,\" C\u00e9line Vetter, lead study author, said in a press release.\n\nSource: Vetter et al.
