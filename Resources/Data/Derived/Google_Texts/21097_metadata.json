But that would likely be packaged with repeal of the individual mandate, which suggests the real GOP game plan may be to draw a presidential veto \u2014 allowing Republicans to claim they tried to save all those people\u2019s health insurance, but mandate-crazed Barack Obama wouldn\u2019t let them.\n\nHere\u2019s something that could complicate the GOP blame-game spin: A new issue brief from the American Academy of Actuaries finds that the GOP contingency fix plans could actually result in more disruptions to the insurance markets.\n\nThe group looks at both the idea of a temporary continuation of subsidies, and of the repeal of the individual mandate \u2014 both of which have been discussed as part of various GOP contingency fix plans, such as the one offered by Tea Party Senator Ron Johnson, which is backed by dozens of GOP Senators, including the leadership.\n\nDoing away with the mandate, the group concludes, would \u201cthreaten the viability of the health insurance market.\u201d If the GOP alternative also keeps protections against people with preexisting conditions \u2014 which Republicans generally favor, perhaps because they\u2019re popular \u2014 those with \u201clower cost health care needs\u201d will drop coverage, meaning the average costs of those left behind will be higher. This \u201ccould result in adverse selection that would raise premiums.\u201d\n\nThe group also concludes that \u201ca temporary extension of premium subsidies\u201d might succeed in delaying the disruption of markets. But it notes that if the temporary subsidies are made available only to those who are currently getting them, and not to new enrollees \u2014 an idea that has been circulating \u2014 that, too, could create problems. It would result in \u201clower overall enrollment in the individual market, as some individuals would transition out of coverage, but few would transition in,\u201d causing the \u201crisk profile of the market to deteriorate somewhat.\u201d\n\nAnd at any rate, a temporary extension would only avoid disruption in the short term: \u201cIf the subsidies are ultimately eliminated, potentially millions of individuals will drop coverage and premiums will increase substantially, unless other equally strong mechanisms are implemented.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are seizing on this to point out that Republican contingency fix plans are \u2014 shockingly \u2014 not about improving the law. \u201cI hope that Republicans will stop putting politics first and instead work with us to continue moving our health care system in the right direction for families, with more affordability, more coverage, and higher quality care,\u201d Senator Patty Murray said in a statement.\n\nBeyond the spin wars, some health wonks agree that the GOP contingency fix plans will likely make things worse. Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation emails:\n\n\u201cActuaries\u2019 heads tend to explode over the prospect of an insurance market where people with pre-existing conditions are guaranteed coverage but there are no subsidies or an individual mandate. Without an individual mandate or some other similar mechanism, insurers would have to raise premiums. All people buying insurance in the individual market, not just those receiving subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, would pay more.\u201d\n\nIndeed, this underscores once again that the likely GOP contingency fix \u2014 if Republicans can even pass one \u2014 basically would kick the policy conundrum Republicans have yet to solve down the road. Even if there is a temporary extension of the subsidies, their expiration would again loom, and with it (so the report argues) the prospect of market disruptions and higher premiums later. And that\u2019s not even getting into the damage that would likely be done in the interim by repeal of the mandate, which might be necessary to get enough Republicans to pass the contingency fix in the first place.\n\nThe inability of Republicans to coalesce behind a solution to this conundrum \u2014 how to protect people with preexisting conditions while doing away with the individual mandate \u2014 may be one of the leading reasons we still have no GOP alternative to Obamacare. Even if Republicans could pass a clean temporary extension of the subsidies without repeal of the mandate, that would still end up punting that conundrum into the lap of the eventual 2016 GOP nominee, since what to do next would be heavily litigated in the 2016 election.\n\nTo be fair, some Republicans, such as Rep. Tom Price, want to forget about a temporary fix and pass a GOP health reform alternative instead. But that seems unlikely \u2014 conservatives might oppose plans like his, because they\u2019re not really the sort of free-market reform they want \u2014 and at any rate there\u2019s that Obama veto.\n\nSo for Congressional Republicans, the short-term post-King options are: Participate in passing a real fix, put the political problem of vanished subsidies behind them, and present an Obamacare alternative in the 2016 election. (It is not impossible that both sides could enter into real negotiations over such a fix that result in both sides making realistic concessions.) Or pass a subsidy fix that also repeals the mandate \u2014 which the president would veto \u2014 and blame Obama for nixing their effort to restore subsidies and preserve health coverage for millions. Or pass nothing, and blame Obama for creating a law that resulted in the Court gutting coverage for millions (in an outcome widely cheered on by Republicans), after lulling them into a false sense of security that was then snatched away by his incompetence.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This isn't going to end well.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "This isn't going to end well.", "title": "GOP plans would destroy Obamacare to save it, new study finds", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/28/gop-plans-would-destroy-obamcare-to-save-it-new-study-finds/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/07/03/National-Politics/Images/Supreme_Court-02484-4676.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/28/gop-plans-would-destroy-obamcare-to-save-it-new-study-finds/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, obamacare alternative, tom price, supreme court, king v. burwell, obamacare subsidies, obamacare tax credits", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, obamacare alternative, tom price, supreme court, king v. burwell, obamacare subsidies, obamacare tax credits"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd935d\"", "article_summary": "Without an individual mandate or some other similar mechanism, insurers would have to raise premiums.\nBeyond the spin wars, some health wonks agree that the GOP contingency fix plans will likely make things worse.\nTo be fair, some Republicans, such as Rep.
