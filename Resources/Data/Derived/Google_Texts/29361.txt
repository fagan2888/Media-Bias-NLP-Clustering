A off-duty police officer fired his weapon into the front end of a motorcycle while attempting to stop a rider involved in a road rage incident Sunday.

The officer called 911 to say he was following vehicles involved in a road rage incident on eastbound 6th Avenue, said Golden Capt. Joe Harvey.

The officer then asked if he should attempt to make a traffic stop.

The dispatcher asked if the officer was in a marked unit, but before the question was answered, the officer dropped his phone to confront the motorcycle rider.

That confrontation happened at 19th Street and 6th Avenue in Golden. “The gentleman was off his motorcycle and looked like he was going to start an altercation,” Harvey said.

The motorcycle rider told the officer that he didn’t believe that he was a police officer, and a struggle ensued, Harvey said. As the officer fired, his wife picked up the cell phone and told the dispatcher that her husband had shot someone.

The bullet hit the front end of the bike. The motorcycle rider had minor injuries to his hand from flying debris, Harvey said.

Neither the name of the off-duty officer, nor his agency has been released. The incident is under investigation.
