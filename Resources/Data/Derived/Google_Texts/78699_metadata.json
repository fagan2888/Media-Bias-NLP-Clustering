You can't dwell on it or you'll never be happy.\"\n\nMillions of New Yorkers and tourists are expected to line the streets on Thursday for the parade, more than a week after ISIS released a video showing images of New York juxtaposed with a scene depicting a suicide bomber preparing for an attack.\n\nThe group has claimed responsibility for the simultaneous attacks in Paris on Nov. 13 that killed at least 130 people at a soccer stadium, a concert hall, bars and restaurants.\n\nSome people said on Facebook and Twitter they would skip the parade this year in light of the new threats, 14 years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by al Qaeda that destroyed the World Trade Center in Manhattan.\n\nA school district on New York's Long Island called off a planned December middle-school trip to Manhattan, while Penn State University said it would cancel some student trips to Washington, D.C., and New York.\n\nBut New York City officials have a simple response: Don't be scared.\n\n\"We can't change who we are,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a public event on Thursday, urging people not to alter their daily lives. \"Do we want to play their game? Do we want to give in to them?\"\n\nWhile they haven't given much operational detail, de Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton said thousands of police officers will be out in force on Thursday during the parade, which typically draws millions to the streets of Manhattan.\n\nSecurity efforts will be bolstered by a new counter-terrorism unit, Critical Response Command that includes more heavily armed officers. Another unit created this year to respond to large protests and other incidents requiring more manpower will also assist patrol officers.\n\nBratton said people should feel confident that the department is able to handle any threat. His own grandchildren are visiting New York for the first time next week and will attend the parade, he said.\n\n\"Celebrate, be aware, but do not be afraid,\" he said at a press conference this week to address the Islamic State video. \"The NYPD will protect you.\"\n\nState and transportation law enforcement also stepped up efforts ahead of the parade. Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday announced the launch of an application allowing New Yorkers to report suspicious activity by sending photos or text messages from their mobile devices to the state's division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services.\n\nAnd another 46 Metropolitan Transportation Authority police officers will be added to New York City's busiest public transportation spots, including Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station, to guard against attacks, Cuomo said.\n\nCity officials said the footage shown in the ISIS video is old and that there is no evidence of a \"specific and credible threat\" to New York.\n\nHolly Thomas, a spokesperson for Macy's Inc (M.N), also offered reassurance. \"As with any public event in New York City, security elements are extensive - from the very visible presence of law enforcement officers to wide-ranging behind-the-scenes security operations,\" she said.\n\nSome youth groups headed to New York have sought to reassure parents regarding their children's safety.\n\nOrganizers for the North Hardin band, for instance, have sent parents a note in light of the \"current world situation\" outlining the procedures in place, including chaperones and an emergency texting service.\n\nHuddle said some parents had asked about increased security measures, but that the entire band still planned to travel.\n\nBrad Pollock, the director for the Nogales High School marching band in southern California, said his students were still excited to perform in the parade.\n\n\"We're doing the best we can to keep everybody safe,\" he said. \"It's a very special honor to be able to do it.\"\n\nReporting by Joseph Ax", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "David Huddle and his daughter Megan, a flute player for the North Hardin High School m", "title": "NYPD Vows to Keep Millions Safe from Terror Attack at Thanksgiving Parade", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/25/NYPD-Vows-Keep-Millions-Safe-Terror-Attack-Thanksgiving-Parade", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTS7ETM.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/25/NYPD-Vows-Keep-Millions-Safe-Terror-Attack-Thanksgiving-Parade", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTS7ETM.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "David Huddle and his daughter Megan, a flute player for the North Hardin High School m", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"The main goal of a terrorist attack is to create terror,\" David Huddle said in a phone interview.\nHis own grandchildren are visiting New York for the first time next week and will attend the parade, he said.\nBrad Pollock, the director for the Nogales High School marching band in southern California, said his students were still excited to perform in the parade.\nHuddle said some parents had asked about increased security measures, but that the entire band still planned to travel.\nSecurity efforts will be bolstered by a new counter-terrorism unit, Critical Response Command that includes more heavily armed officers."}
