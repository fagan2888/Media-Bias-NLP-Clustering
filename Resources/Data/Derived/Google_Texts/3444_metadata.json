There were no clear ideas for paying for the gap, and the Legislature did not pass Gov. Peter Shumlin\u2019s recommended payroll tax in the previous session that would have gone toward Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIn the scheme of a $1.5 or $1.6 billion program, to be off about $30 million in one way or another is pretty modest from a forecasting perspective,\u201d said Jim Reardon, the outgoing commissioner of the Department of Finance.\n\nThe projection problems and increased costs come from many sources, including pharmaceutical prices, the cost of serving people with disabilities and changes to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn 2014, when Medicaid was expanded under the ACA, low-income Vermonters who were already being served by the state-created Vermont Health Access Plan moved over to Medicaid. The beneficiaries using the new insurance saw minimal changes, but the administrative change meant the department could no longer use VHAP data to calculate the best budget projections, according to Reardon.\n\n\u201cChanges have caused us to be in a situation where we don\u2019t have the historical data to rely on,\u201d Reardon said.\n\nAdditionally, the state received a waiver from the federal government to keep more people on Medicaid without confirming whether they were qualified, according to Stephanie Barrett, associate fiscal officer for the Legislature\u2019s Joint Fiscal Office.\n\nBecause Vermont Health Connect was experiencing technical problems, the state has been automatically re-enrolling people in Medicaid instead of reassessing their financial situations in January of each year. Budget writers don\u2019t know how many people are being covered by Medicaid who wouldn\u2019t qualify for it if they had to go through the annual review.\n\n\u201cMedicaid has been auto-re-enrolling folks because of the difficulties of the exchange,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cIt makes the forecasting really difficult.\u201d\n\nMore than a dozen other factors contribute to the high number of enrollees, according to paperwork from the Department of Finance. The highest single increase is $8.8 million in fiscal year 2016 and $16.2 million in fiscal year 2017 for a group of elderly Vermonters who receive Medicare benefits and also qualify for Medicaid.\n\nChildless adults will cost $4.9 million; many of those people moved over to Medicaid from VHAP, and the state gets a higher-than-usual match from the federal government to serve those people. Vermonters with developmental disabilities and some mental health issues will cost the state $8.2 million in fiscal year 2017.\n\nA new drug to treat Medicaid patients with cystic fibrosis will cost the state $3.6 million. Costs associated with treating autism will be $2.4 million; payments to accountable care organizations for meeting certain cost-savings goals will be $2.9 million; and it will cost the state $7.4 million to continue paying Medicare Part B for low-income Vermonters.\n\nRep. Paul Poirier, I-Barre, said the House Appropriations Committee, which will discuss rescissions in December, can either figure out how to raise revenue or make cuts to Medicaid.\n\nReardon told the committee the Legislature\u2019s options are more nuanced: \u201cYou could make changes in policy. You could serve the same amount of people but do less.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers begin work on Medicaid deficit", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "Lawmakers begin work on Medicaid deficit", "title": "Lawmakers begin work on Medicaid deficit | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DSC_0556.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-15T10:09:20+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2015/10/14/lawmakers-begin-work-on-medicaid-deficit/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lawmakers begin work on Medicaid deficit", "title": "Lawmakers begin work on Medicaid deficit | VTDigger", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DSC_0556.jpg?fit=1024%2C685", "creator": "@erin_vt", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Mediciaid", "published_time": "2015-10-14T18:13:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-15T10:09:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "mediciaid, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases"}, "article_summary": "A new drug to treat Medicaid patients with cystic fibrosis will cost the state $3.6 million.\nLawmakers have begun planning to address the FY 2016 deficit, which they will deal with as part of the Budget Adjustment Act when they reconvene in January.\nOne-third of Vermonters are on Medicaid right now, and the high number of enrollees will lead to a budget deficit if legislators don\u2019t make changes to the program soon.\nIn 2014, when Medicaid was expanded under the ACA, low-income Vermonters who were already being served by the state-created Vermont Health Access Plan moved over to Medicaid.\nVermonters with developmental disabilities and some mental health issues will cost the state $8.2 million in fiscal year 2017."}
