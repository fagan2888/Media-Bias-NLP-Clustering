It was not. He was suggesting Trump's rise was not the media's fault. The headline was changed.]\n\nIn the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the Nevada Caucuses, many on the right are scrambling to point fingers at who is to blame for his dominance. A common place for blame to fall is the liberal mainstream media for not aggressively looking into his past, something they do as a matter of course for virtually every other Republican.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd washed the media's collective hands on Wednesday evening by claiming the other campaigns could use all the previous media coverage to cobble together into attack ads:\n\n\u201cA common criticism you\u2019ve heard is that Trump's rise is the media's fault, because we have enabled his rise. But, folks, you could argue that the media has also provided all the material that normally a campaign would want to put together an attack against Trump.\u201d\n\nTodd went on to point out inconsistencies in Trump\u2019s statements dating back to 2002, showing the transcript of an episode the Howard Stern Show where Trump was asked if he was for the Iraq War. Trump\u2019s response to Stern was \u201cYeah I guess so.\u201d A position he claims to have never held. Todd also showed a statement from Trump where he criticized Obamacare as a \u201clie,\u201d but he once held the position that single-payer health care \u201cworks in Canada.\u201d\n\nTodd\u2019s analysis feigned objectivity while barely scratching the surface. This kind of coverage of Trump is nothing new. A recent MRC study found that most coverage of Trump has little to do with his old, self-admitted, liberal positions or any vetting of his past of any kind.\n\nA proper vetting is probably something they are waiting to do until after Trump is the GOP presidential nominee \u2013 all the better to assist the Democratic nominee \u2013 a technique that was unitized against past GOP nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney. During the 2012 presidential campaign the media dug into every corner of Romney\u2019s past. They ran story after story about the Romney family dog being caged on the roof of their car during a road trip. The media even dug up a story about a bullying incident from when Romney was in high school.\n\nFor Chuck Todd to insinuate that it\u2019s not the media\u2019s job to dig into a candidate\u2019s past or fully vet a candidate for the public is just plain ridiculous. Todd laid the this duty at the feet of the other candidates stating \u201cFolks, those are all inconsistencies that a normal campaign that was running against Donald Trump would probably put together, into TV ads and try to see if it would leave a mark with voters.\u201d\n\nFor a member of the media to advocate for campaigns alone to do the vetting is an abdication of journalistic duty.\n\nTranscript below:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "On Wednesday\u2019s MTP Daily, MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd washed the media\u2019s collective hands by claiming it\u2019s not the media\u2019s job to vet a candidate because the information is already there for the other campaigns to cobble together into attack ads: \u201cA common criticism you\u2019ve heard is that Trump\u2019s rise is the media\u2019s fault, because we have enabled his rise.
