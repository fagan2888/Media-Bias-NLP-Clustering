Oklahoma: 31%. Vermont: 8.3%. In New York, the figure is 13.5%; in Illinois it\u2019s 23% and in New Mexico it\u2019s a whopping 51%.\n\nInsurance companies are asking state regulators to approve hefty average increases in the premiums Americans must pay for their health insurance, starting in January.\n\nRelated: 'We blame the sick for being expensive': the mother whose baby cost AOL $1m\n\nIn most cases, these rate increases are far larger than those that were sought for 2015, the second year of life for the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. And the icing on the cake? The companies are hitting us as we struggle to cope with the impact of several years in which, if we have been lucky enough to have jobs at all, our earnings have grown at only about the rate of inflation.\n\nOf course, there are crucial products or services whose prices never seem to bear a relationship to what is going on with the broader economy. Boom or recession, the price of college tuition or healthcare only climbs \u2013 and at a rate that always seems to exceed the rate of inflation by at least a factor of two.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing new about that, as any company benefits manager will tell you \u2013 grumpily.\n\n\u201cEmployers deal with it by swallowing the costs and passing some of the higher prices that insurers charge them on to their workers through higher premiums or by making benefits less robust,\u201d said Dan Mendelson, chief executive of Avelere Health, a healthcare advisory company based in Washington DC.\n\nThat trend showed its ugliest side early last year, when AOL chief executive Tim Armstrong blamed unexpectedly higher healthcare costs, due to the birth to two employees of \u201cdistressed babies\u201d, for his decision to cut retirement benefits for the entire company.\n\nThe outrage \u2013 and the fact that AOL clearly had ample profits to absorb the impact of the estimated $2m cost of the distressed babies \u2013 caused Armstrong to reverse his decision.\n\n(As a side note, the mother of one of those \u201cdistressed babies\u201d, novelist Deanna Fei, will have the last word: her memoir of her pregnancy, the birth of her daughter, and Armstrong\u2019s tone-deaf pronouncements will hit bookstores this week.)\n\nRelated: Fact-checking AOL's spurious story about retirement plans and sick babies\n\nBut AOL is far from the only company shifting more of the cost of healthcare to employees with every year that passes, to the extent that I now have at least one friend who says he could do better buying an Obamacare insurance policy on a state exchange than paying the premiums for his company policy.\n\nAnd then there are those of us who have no choice in the matter: we now are legally required to purchase health insurance policies on the open market, sometimes from for-profit enterprises \u2013 and the cost of those insurance policies is going up.\n\nI\u2019m one of the lucky ones, I realize: in Rhode Island, Blue Cross Blue Shield is seeking an average rate increase of only about 11%, and my insurance policy will still be far more affordable than anything I would have been able to purchase in a pre-Obamacare world.\n\nBut it seems that other insurers, or Blue Cross Blue Shield doing business in other states, have done a far worse job of trying to figure out just who would be buying these Obamacare policies, based on the incomplete data they had at their disposal. That means they have been mis-pricing the policies for the last two years \u2013 and losing money on them.\n\nIf an insurance company can go to the state insurance commissioner and prove it paid out more in claims in the last year than it collected in premiums for the plan for which it is now seeking to charge higher rates, well, the odds are pretty good that the request will fall on receptive ears. And no, it doesn\u2019t matter if a company\u2019s other insurance business lines were profitable, says Mendelson: it\u2019s the policy\u2019s specific risk pool that counts.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had to guess about that risk pool and a lot of them guessed wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are those who argue that the big rate increases we are likely to see this year a) won\u2019t be as big as we fear and b) will prove to be a transitory phenomenon.\n\nI\u2019m ready to agree \u2013 to some extent \u2013 with the first point. The second, however, strikes me as being the product of some wishful thinking.\n\nFirst things first. While the magnitude of the requested rate increases in some states have grabbed headlines, overall, the average premium rate increase requested is 12%, according to a survey by HealthPocket, a health insurance research and technology firm. That is still well above the rate of inflation, and higher than last year\u2019s increases, but \u201cthe average American\u201d \u2013 if there is such an individual \u2013 won\u2019t be paying 40% more.\n\nThe more generous your plan is with its benefits, the more likely you are to face a higher rate increase, HealthPocket found. Insurers have requested that regulators approve average premium increases of 14% and 16% for silver and gold plans respectively. These plans have smaller deductibles and more generous benefits, meaning that their policyholders have to pay a smaller share of their healthcare costs out of their own pockets.\n\nInsurers are seeking smaller rate hikes (averaging 9%) for their bronze plans, which have less plentiful benefits and higher deductibles. That means that consumers who want to shield themselves from the full impact of the rate hikes could move from a gold or a silver to a bronze plan, at least until the dust settles.\n\nBut will it? That\u2019s a matter for debate. Mendelson believes the market will become \u201cmore stable\u201d as more and more of the uninsured pick up policies, and it becomes easier for insurance companies to understand what the risks are in the various pools of policyholders, and thus to become better at keeping price increases stable.\n\nStill, even Mendelson acknowledges that healthcare costs remain a wild card. With new drugs and therapies making their way on to the market every month, and scientific breakthroughs promising more to come, how will the costs of such innovations affect the cost of delivering health care \u2013 and, in turn, affect the cost of health insurance?\n\nConsider Tecfidera, a new drug for multiple sclerosis, that can cost upwards of $60,000 a year to provide. It helps patients, but if insurers find themselves with a lot of new MS patients in their risk pool, the rest of us will find ourselves paying higher premiums. New drugs to treat hepatitis C are being blamed for the current run-up in premiums.\n\nThere is no reason to suppose that anything will stop this pattern: pharmaceutical and biotech research won\u2019t halt and patients certainly won\u2019t stop requesting new treatments as they become available.\n\nOdds are that insurers will look for new ways to abide by the letter of the law, which stipulates that they cannot turn anyone away and cannot charge a sick policyholder more because of their illness. That could mean that you\u2019ll see more efforts to limit the number of doctors you can see under your policy, and certainly will see a lot of debate over just what medications or therapies they will be willing to pay for.\n\nRight now, there are so many moving parts that it\u2019s almost impossible to figure out what could hurt or help us. Take the current wave of mergers amongst the health insurance industry, for instance.\n\nOn one hand, it could well leave consumers with fewer insurance plan options to pick from during open enrollment season \u2013 and at the end of the day, walking away from a too-costly plan remains our most powerful weapon.\n\nBut there is at least a case to be made that bigger providers could use their own clout to haggle with providers \u2013 hospitals and physician networks \u2013 to drive down the costs of everything from surgical procedures to, yes, those costly drugs.\n\nAt least the supreme court\u2019s decision upholding the subsidies that make Obamacare policies affordable for about 80% of Americans who buy them removes one large source of uncertainty. But as premiums rise, the cost of those subsidies to the government will rise, too. And how long can that endure?\n\nUltimately, we\u2019re all guinea pigs in a large, ambitious economic experiment. We can devote lots of time to researching the plans we\u2019re offered, changing constantly and even switching our physicians in efforts to contain our costs.\n\nBut there is no guarantee we\u2019ll emerge happier or even healthier \u2013 regardless of how much we fork over in insurance premiums.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "With rates poised to increase, there are more questions than answers in what amounts to a giant economic experiment \u2013 but don\u2019t panic just yet", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Suzanne McGee", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "With rates poised to increase, there are more questions than answers in what amounts to a giant economic experiment \u2013 but don\u2019t panic just yet", "title": "Health insurers push states for premium hikes as Americans play guinea pigs", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2015/jul/12/health-insurers-premium-increases", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436641846417/0d398a21-f22a-4b23-85ee-c598a37dba42-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=0e882aba01fba748b79f4f6f239b009f", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2015/jul/12/health-insurers-premium-increases?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2015/jul/12/health-insurers-premium-increases", "iphone": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2015/jul/12/health-insurers-premium-increases?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436641846417/0d398a21-f22a-4b23-85ee-c598a37dba42-2060x1236.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2015/jul/12/health-insurers-premium-increases?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US personal finance,Healthcare industry,Health,Health insurance,Obama administration,Business,Society,US news,Money", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-07-12T12:00:08.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/suzanne-mcgee", "section": "Money", "modified_time": "2015-07-13T00:45:33.000Z", "tag": "US personal finance,Healthcare industry,Health,Health insurance,Obama administration,Business,Society,US news,Money"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436641846417/0d398a21-f22a-4b23-85ee-c598a37dba42-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=025c217b3ded999d5a46f133e2a7fdd2", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US personal finance,Healthcare industry,Health,Health insurance,Obama administration,Business,Society,US news,Money"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b02\"", "article_summary": "But there is no guarantee we\u2019ll emerge happier or even healthier \u2013 regardless of how much we fork over in insurance premiums.\nThe more generous your plan is with its benefits, the more likely you are to face a higher rate increase, HealthPocket found.\nInsurance companies are asking state regulators to approve hefty average increases in the premiums Americans must pay for their health insurance, starting in January.\nTake the current wave of mergers amongst the health insurance industry, for instance.\nIt helps patients, but if insurers find themselves with a lot of new MS patients in their risk pool, the rest of us will find ourselves paying higher premiums."}
