REUTERS/Larry Downing\n\n4045788\n\nObamacare may have promised health insurance for the masses. But on its first day, it\u2019s left more Americans without coverage than before the law was passed.\n\nMore than 4.7 million Americans had their health insurance canceled as a result of any of the thousand-plus-page law\u2019s new rules, The Associated Press reports, but the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) confirmed Tuesday that between federal and state exchanges, just two million Americans have signed up for Obamacare coverage. (RELATED: Obama administration announces net loss of at least 3 million insurance plans)\n\nThe Obama administration has yet to announce the final tally of full enrollments, which are only confirmed once customers have made their first payment, but Cato Institute health policy expert Michael Cannon warns that not all those who signed up will complete their purchases, potentially leaving the White House with an even lower bottom line.\n\nEven without the full number of enrollments, Obamacare\u2019s current net effect is clearly in favor of cancellations. Millions are already seeing Obamacare\u2019s adverse effects \u2014 largely due to more mandates for more services.\n\nThe health-care law requires that all insurance plans cover 10 \u201cessential benefits,\u201d eliminating millions of plans that don\u2019t fit the bill and boosting costs for consumers that have to purchase coverage for services they may not want or need.\n\nAll plans must include maternity coverage, for example \u2014 including plans for men and post-menopausal women. Even customers without children must purchase plans that cover pediatric services. Other newly established essential benefits include hospitalization, mental-health services and preventive and wellness services.\n\nWhile a grandfather clause allowed plans purchased before Obamacare passed in 2010 to continue, HHS estimated that 40-67 percent of plans would eventually lose their status and cost millions of Americans their insurance plans.\n\nThe Obama administration eventually admitted Obamacare\u2019s role in crushing many Americans\u2019 coverage and has scrambled to belatedly make up for it. President Barack Obama first attempted to reinstate the canceled coverage for just one more year, but many insurers chose not to restart already-canceled plans.\n\nThe latest stopgap, announced just before the deadline to purchase exchange coverage, is to allow those with canceled plans a one-year \u201chardship exemption\u201d from the individual mandate to have medical coverage, but insurance companies didn\u2019t see this as an adequate solution either.\n\n\u201cThis type of last-minute change will cause tremendous instability in the marketplace and lead to further confusion and disruption for consumers,\u201d Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the trade group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, told reporters.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "In the red on day one", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare may have promised health insurance for the masses.
