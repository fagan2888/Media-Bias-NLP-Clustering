Just in time for the New Hampshire primary, we\u2019ll be back to tracking and posting deleted tweets from political figures so that the public can hold them accountable for the statements they make on Twitter.\n\nSince Politwoops first launched in the U.S. in 2012, we\u2019ve documented the impact and importance of being able to track these public statements. From the initial reactions to the Supreme Court\u2019s Affordable Care Act decision to the abrupt change of messaging surrounding the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl by the Taliban, Politwoops offers a unique window into how political officials communicate with the public.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice a few changes to the tool that we\u2019re excited to share. For starters, we\u2019ll be showing you every deleted tweet \u2014 not just the ones we think are important \u2014 made by elected officials and candidates for office. Right now that includes Senate, House and presidential candidates, as well as governors and the D.C. mayor. In the future we hope to expand that to executive branch officials and state legislators. We\u2019re also planning to implement a filtering system to more easily weed out simple errors and typos.\n\nPolitwoops is still a work in progress. That's why we\u2019re looking for feedback on how people use it, and how we can make it more useful. Please email us at twoops@sunlightfoundation.com and share your thoughts. If we\u2019re missing a candidate for public office, or if you think you\u2019ve been added to Politwoops by mistake, let us know.\n\nA big thanks to Twitter, Access Now and Open State Foundation for working with us to bring back Politwoops, as well as everyone who supported the project throughout this process. Consider it an early Valentine\u2019s Day present to you!\n\nNote: The original version of Politwoops was created by Open State Foundation.
