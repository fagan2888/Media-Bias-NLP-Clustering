The music is served in a jubilant ambience recalling the jamming, legendary house parties of the 1920s and \u201930s, where mythic jazz giants like Fats Waller and James P. Johnson entertained party-goers.\n\nVintage jazz -- timeless music created in and celebrating the present moment -- will abound in a variety of early All-American genres. Marking its fifth festive gathering of the partying faithful, Jeff and Joel\u2019s Jazz House Party lets the good times roll as its various sized combos, playing on arrangements invented on the spot, launch into everything from ragtime and New Orleans music to Dixieland and Swing Era styles, riding blue notes and ballads with invocations of iconic figures ranging from Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong to Fats Waller and Benny Goodman.\n\nAbout 15 of the region\u2019s top trad jazz players, including the renowned Vince Giordano, mix and match in various configurations in freewheeling sessions. The action flows in a warm, home-like setting aglow with a sense of camaraderie among the devout listeners and the skilled practitioners.\n\nTrad jazz fests in Connecticut and across the country have died in recent years. The fan base, with notable exceptions, inevitably seems older and grayer, much as it does for jazz in general, classical music, and the shrinking demographics for such imperiled cultural artifacts as newspapers, books, and CDs.\n\nNo gloomy thoughts of the music\u2019s mortality diminish the passion of the true-believing fans who turn out for the house party, a creation of Jeff Barnhart, the noted trad pianist/singer from Mystic, and Joel Schiavone, a well-known developer and flamboyant, banjo-playing vocalist/entertainer from Guilford. Barnhart runs a Connecticut-based record company, and tours throughout the world playing piano and singing in the grand manner of his hero, Fats Waller. Schiavone is a 2005 inductee into the National Four-String Banjo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\nThe party opens on Friday, October 10, with the first of the weekend's four sessions.\n\nBarnhart and Schiavone decided to go small for the chosen venue. Abandoning the mammoth tent notion for trad jazz festivals, they adapted the ancient house party approach. Presenting jazz in a convivial living room setting is an alternative tactic that Barnhart noticed on his continental tours. It\u2019s a smaller, cozier concept, he said, successfully adopted elsewhere in the States.\n\nBeginning in February, 2012, the first of four Jeff and Joel\u2019s Jazz House Party ventures was launched to great success in Schiavone\u2019s 1804 farmhouse in Guilford, the site for the next three parties. Instead of sitting in a cavernous concert hall or giant tent, patrons are right on top of the music, savoring the foot-stomping sounds while having brunch, lunch, or dinner, or drinking a beverage while connecting one-on-one with the musicians.\n\nWith success came excess in the turnouts, increasingly so large and enthusiastic that the house party has outgrown Schiavone\u2019s historic home. With its spirit intact, the house party has been relocated to the VFW Hall in Guilford. As described in a house party press release, the swinging shindig \u201chas moved just down the street to the new pond side venue, which, though small and charming, offers more room for dancing, seating, parking, eating at tables or al fresco dining outside the hall or by the pond. The intimate setting remains the same.\u201d\n\nThe party opens on Friday, October 10, with the first of the weekend\u2019s four sessions, a program billed as a Friday Night Special from 7:00 to 9:00 pm. It features vocalist Molly Ryan and reed player Dan Levinson accompanied by Barnhart on piano, drummer Bill Reynolds and the bassist/orchestra leader Vince Giordano. A multi-talented instrumentalist and singer, maestro Giordano and his highflying Nighthawks Orchestra won a Grammy for their exceptional playing on HBO\u2019s award-winning \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d where they could be heard and sometimes seen performing classic vintage music.\n\nAmong the highlights of the sessions on Saturday, October 11, and on Sunday, October 12, are performances by such outstanding veterans as Noel Kaletsky, a clarinet and saxophone wizard; Fred Vigorito, the great cornetist and leader of Connecticut\u2019s electrifying Galvanized Jazz Band; and Genevieve Rose, a gifted, young bassist from Massachusetts. Barnhart, who handpicked the all-star array, not only sits-in on piano, but is also the organizer of the mixing and matching of the bands in various lineups, an element that\u2019s bound to bring variety to styles and song selections.\n\nIn one of the already predetermined matchups, Kaletsky, who\u2019s noted for his fiery clarinet solos, will be featured on Sunday, October 12, in a \u201ctriple reed\u201d summit meeting with the young twin brothers, Pete and Will Anderson, who double on sax and clarinet.\n\nAmong other seasoned veterans in Barnhart\u2019s brigade are: Bob Ferguson and Lew Green, trumpet; Herb Roselle and Herb Gardner, trombone, with Gardner doubling on piano; Tom Palinko, drums; and the irrepressible Schiavone on banjo and vocals. Sessions on Saturday, October 11, from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm and 5:00 to 10:00 pm; Sunday, October 12, 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. Tickets: $225.00 for all the sessions on Saturday and Sunday; $80.00 per session; and $30.00 for the Friday Night Special. Information: jeffandjoelshouseparty.com.

Kaman Charitable Foundation, the Hartford Public Library\u2019s popular Baby Grand Jazz Series opens its 12th season on Sunday, January 4, at HPL\u2019s atrium at its flagship quarters at 500 Main Street.\n\nIn 2014, the series of 16 free Sunday concerts broke its attendance records with a season high turnout of nearly 5,700. Building on the momentum from its good season in 2013, opening day for the 2014 series drew a record-breaking crowd of 600 to hear violin virtuoso Meg Okura and her Pan Asian Ensemble.\n\nBefore the series\u2019 attendance numbers began skyrocketing just a few years ago, turnouts were routinely sparse for the one-hour shows at 3:00 pm. Now, in dramatic contrast, crowds of 500 or 600 are no surprise.\n\nThe Kaman Foundation funded the series in 2012, 2013, and 2014, years marked by sudden rapid growth in popularity. The foundation\u2019s latest infusion gives the series a welcome three-year lease on life, saving it from having to drum-up support year by year.\n\nMatt Poland, CEO of the HPL, thanked the Kaman Charitable Foundation for the assistance. \u201cWithout their steadfast support,\u201d he said, \u201cthe quality of this series would not be possible. We\u2019re thrilled to be able to continue to provide this free, one-of-a-kind concert series to the public, and continue our work promoting music appreciation and arts literacy for all.\u201d The 2015 season will be announced later this fall.
