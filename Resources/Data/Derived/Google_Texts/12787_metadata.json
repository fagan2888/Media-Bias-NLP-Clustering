It's a clear case of discrimination,\" said Greg Millett, vice president and director of public policy for amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. \"We've heard anecdotal reports about this conduct before, but this study shows a clear pattern of discrimination.\"\n\nHowever, the findings by definition show that three out of four plans are offering HIV coverage at more reasonable rates, said Clare Krusing, director of communications for America's Health Insurance Plans, an insurance industry group. Patients with HIV can choose to move to one of those plans.\n\n\"This report really misses that point, and I think that's the overarching component that is important to highlight,\" Krusing said. \"Consumers do have that choice, and that choice is an important part of the marketplace.\"\n\nThe Harvard researchers undertook their study after hearing of a formal complaint submitted to federal regulators in May, which contended that Florida insurers had structured their drug coverage to discourage enrollment by HIV patients, according to background information in the paper.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, health insurance, preexisting conditions", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "Analysis suggests hiking drug co-pays may help eliminate people with certain illnesses", "title": "Have Insurers Found Way Around Obamacare 'Pre-Existing Conditions' Rule?", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20150128/have-insurers-found-way-around-obamacare-pre-existing-conditions-rule", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/news/healthday/2013/12/aca_logo.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "Analysis suggests hiking drug co-pays may help eliminate people with certain illnesses", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "article_summary": "However, the findings by definition show that three out of four plans are offering HIV coverage at more reasonable rates, said Clare Krusing, director of communications for America's Health Insurance Plans, an insurance industry group.\nWEDNESDAY, Jan. 28, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Some insurance companies may be using high-dollar pharmacy co-pays to flout the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) mandate against discrimination on the basis of pre-existing health problems, Harvard researchers claim.\n\"This report really misses that point, and I think that's the overarching component that is important to highlight,\" Krusing said.\nPatients with HIV can choose to move to one of those plans.\nThe Harvard researchers undertook their study after hearing of a formal complaint submitted to federal regulators in May, which contended that Florida insurers had structured their drug coverage to discourage enrollment by HIV patients, according to background information in the paper."}
