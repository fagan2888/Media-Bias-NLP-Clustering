Rapid City, SD

Jack White surprised Black Hills music fans Friday when he held a last-minute show in Rapid City.



The acoustic show at the Performing Arts Center of Rapid City was the fourth of five the former White Stripes front man says he's hosting in states where he hasn't yet played before he takes a long break from performing live.



White announced the news Friday morning that he would be playing the solo show. Tickets were sold only at the Ernie November music store and hundreds of fans lined up along Main Street for a chance to grab a seat for only $3.



White has already played acoustic shows in Idaho, Wyoming and Alaska. It's rumored that North Dakota could be his last stop.
