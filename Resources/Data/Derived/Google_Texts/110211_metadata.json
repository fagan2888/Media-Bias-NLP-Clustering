Warren says she has no plans to run (which won\u2019t matter if she changes her mind, of course) but Democrats uneasy about Clinton apparently think she\u2019d enter the race with most of Clinton\u2019s advantages, obviously including the \u201chistoric female candidate\u201d merit badge, but less baggage.\n\nAnyone who believes this is dramatically underestimating how weird and ridiculous Warren will appear to an electorate outside of Massachusetts, especially given her propensity to make false claims of American Indian heritage to game the racial spoils system. She\u2019s also the intellectual godmother of Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that!\u201d speech from last year, having become a left-wing YouTube darling by advancing the theory that every nickel of private-sector wealth is the rightful property of the State, because nobody could possibly run any business operation without the vital services provided by government, such as the roads leading into their parking lots. For this reason, no Evil Rich private-sector businessman has any moral standing to object to any tax increase, because the State can reclaim whatever portion of its rightful property it deems necessary to care for the social needs of the Sainted Middle Class and Deserving Poor.\n\nI rather doubt Americans coming out of Barack Obama\u2019s endless recession are going to be hungry for more statist rhetoric, or eager to enjoy the next exciting adventure of the ideology that gave us ObamaCare, but we shall see.\n\nMeanwhile, the other big problem dogging Warren is that she has a very thin skin. Her hard-left wing seeks to consolidate its grip on the Democrat Party, and she\u2019s got an Obama level of comfort with using government power to suppress dissent. That\u2019s something else I don\u2019t think Americans will want to see more of in 2016.\n\nWarren\u2019s ire has been focused into a bit of blue-on-blue fury against a group called Third Way, whose president Jon Cowan and senior VP Jim Kessler wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed critical of the \u201ceconomic populism\u201d of Sen. Warren and New York\u2019s new mayor, Bill de Blasio:\n\nThe political problems of liberal populism are bad enough. Worse are the actual policies proposed by left-wing populists. The movement relies on a potent \u201cwe can have it all\u201d fantasy that goes something like this: If we force the wealthy to pay higher taxes (there are 300,000 tax filers who earn more than $1 million), close a few corporate tax loopholes, and break up some big banks then\u2014presto!\u2014we can pay for, and even expand, existing entitlements. Meanwhile, we can invest more deeply in K-12 education, infrastructure, health research, clean energy and more.\n\nCowan and Kessler really got on Warren\u2019s nerves by daring to touch the third rail of American politics:\n\nSocial Security is exhibit A of this populist political and economic fantasy. A growing cascade of baby boomers will be retiring in the coming years, and the Social Security formula increases their initial benefits faster than inflation. The problem is that since 2010 Social Security payouts to seniors have exceeded payroll taxes collected from workers. This imbalance widens inexorably until it devours the entire Social Security Trust Fund in 2031, according to the Congressional Budget Office. At that point, benefits would have to be slashed by about 23%. Undeterred by this undebatable solvency crisis, Sen. Warren wants to increase benefits to all seniors, including billionaires, and to pay for them by increasing taxes on working people and their employers. Her approach requires a $750 billion tax hike over the next 10 years that hits mostly Millennials and Gen Xers, plus another $750 billion tax on the businesses that employ them. Even more reckless is the populists\u2019 staunch refusal to address the coming Medicare crisis. In 2030, a typical couple reaching the eligibility age of 65 will have paid $180,000 in lifetime Medicare taxes but will get back $664,000 in benefits. Given that this disparity will be completely unaffordable, Sen. Warren and her acolytes are irresponsibly pushing off budget decisions that will guarantee huge benefit cuts and further tax hikes for Gen Xers and Millennials in a few decades.\n\nYou mean the deficit unicorns chained up in the basement of the Treasury won\u2019t be able to poop out rainbow Skittles and dollar bills forever? Heresy! Speak not to socialists of the day their bills will come due, for they will have long since retired to palatial estates by then, offering no refunds to those trapped in the bleak ruins of their false promises and forgotten talking points. The doctrinaire collectivists angling for control of the post-Obama Democrat Party think such criticism sounds positively\u2026 Republican.\n\nWhich means Third Way is going to get treated like a pack of Republicans by hard-left Democrats, who demanded that gubernatorial candidate Allyson Y. Schwartz of Pennsylvania \u2013 who had nothing to do with the WSJ op-ed, and in fact strongly denounced it \u2013 resign her post as honorary co-chairwoman of Third Way. The Washington Times surveyed the political fallout:\n\nThe squabble marks the beginning of a fight over the direction of his party as it prepares for the 2016 elections and a new leader. \u201cThis is the latest in a series of situations that are going to play out in the weeks and months to come as Democrats struggle to figure out how to move forward in the post-Obama era,\u201d said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist. \u201cWhat is definitely going on is the left sees an opening given the current political dynamic for them to try to assert some sort of control on the Democratic Party.\u201d Christy Setzer, a Democratic consultant, said that \u201cthe safety net\u2019s making a comeback.\u201d \u201cPolls show that not only do Americans want to preserve Social Security, they want to see it expanded \u2014 not just in NYC, but in Colorado,\u201d Ms. Setzer said. \u201cThat means that moving to the left is a viable position for Democrats in blue and red states alike.\u201d [\u2026] The Progressive Change Committee, which wants Congress to spend more on Social Security, responded by urging people to call Mrs. Schwartz and warn her that being associated with this \u201cWall-Street funded group that attacks Elizabeth Warren\u201d is not the way to win the Democratic primary. Howard Dean\u2019s Democracy for America said Pennsylvanians already have a governor who supports cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits and they don\u2019t need another one. \u201cIf Allyson Schwartz opposes cutting the benefits that seniors and working families rely on and earn with every single paycheck, now is the time for her to say so publicly and resign from her position at Third Way,\u201d said Jim Dean, chairman of the group.\n\nThe most left-wing President in generations wasn\u2019t left enough for these people, and they\u2019re not about to let the grinding unemployment and horrific Big Government failure he bestowed upon the Republic stop them from making the case that Leviathan needs to pack on a few more pounds. Dissent and disobedience are still possible, so there is more work for the Left ahead.\n\nHere\u2019s what the Third Way writers were responding to:\n\nSpeaking on the floor of the Senate two weeks later [after de Blaiso\u2019s election in New York], Mrs. Warren said that if the nation wants a real middle class then Congress must get serious about the nation\u2019s retirement system because more people than ever are on the edge of financial disaster once they retire. \u201cThat is why we should be talking about expanding Social Security benefits, not cutting them,\u201d she said.\n\nWell, at least it\u2019s nice to see liberals drop all pretense that Social Security is some sort of fabulous government-managed investment program, owned by the people who spent a lifetime pumping money into it. For the hard Left, old people are supposed to be pensioners, loyal clients of the absolute State, which supports them as perpetual dependents through the long sunset years made possible by modern medical technology. The average lifespan has vastly increased since the New Deal, which rational people view as a massive demographic problem, but socialists see it as a gateway to invincible political power, harvesting votes from a vast farm of hapless elderly dependents.\n\nIt\u2019ll work until the money runs out in a decade or two, and then\u2026 off to that fabulous retirement estate, suckers! Liz Warren is a millionaire, just like all the other socialist Men and Women of the People. She won\u2019t be relying on Social Security for her golden years.\n\nWarren jumped in and made a clumsy effort to show Third Way a little of the oppressive government razzle-dazzle that the Tea Party got from Barack Obama\u2019s IRS, as chronicled by Politico:\n\nFrom a senior DC Republican on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): \u201cThe normally savvy Liz Warren may have made a rare misstep \u2026 in response to \u2026 Third Way publishing an op-ed critical of her populist liberal policy positions. Rather than meet the policy arguments head on in the arena of ideas, Warren chose to fire off an intemperate letter to the CEOs of major financial institutions effectively demanding that they disclose all their corporate contributions to policy wonks and think tanks \u2014 implying but not saying that they were stealth underwriters of the op-ed objecting to her own views. \u201cThe Warren letter was a mistake for a number of reasons. First, there is absolutely no evidence beyond feverish conspiracy talk that the banks asked Third Way to write an op-ed critical of Warren. Accusing the banks with no evidence puts Warren in the company of Larouche-like quacks. Second, attacking think tank donors makes Warren look like an opponent of a robust stream of idea development and discussion. This is, to say the least, an odd place for a former Harvard Law School professor to be, and will make even the taciturn pundits at AEI and Brookings very uncomfortable. \u201cThird, Warren\u2019s \u2018give me the names\u2019 edict, sounds uncomfortably like the kind of demand that Joe McCarthy would have made in the 1950s. The response that silenced him ironically came from a Massachusetts lawyer, Joseph Welch \u2014 who simply looked McCarthy in the eye and said \u2018at long last, have you left no sense of decency?\u2019 Indeed.\u201d\n\nIs there anyone who really thinks liberals value \u201ca robust stream of idea development and discussion\u201d any more? They\u2019re all about obedience and submission. They want power, which is diluted by meaningful dissent. They most certainly don\u2019t want to hear anyone linked to Democrat politics puncture the \u201cwe can have it all fantasy\u201d that underlies their entire ideology.\n\nThat\u2019s what Barack Obama\u2019s Big Lie was all about, remember: promising people they could keep their existing insurance plans, that nothing would change for them at all, while ObamaCare showered benefits on a needy and deserving few. In other words, he was pretending that a compulsory program was voluntary. That\u2019s what the fantasy criticized by Cowan and Kessler boils down to, and it\u2019s the secret liberals absolutely cannot tolerate voters learning about their agenda\u2026 not while it\u2019s still possible to vote against them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "The hard Left consolidates its grip on the post-Obama Democrat Party.", "title": "The very thin skin of Elizabeth Warren | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/liz_warren_angry-480x277.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/12/05/the-very-thin-skin-of-elizabeth-warren/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "The hard Left consolidates its grip on the post-Obama Democrat Party.", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/liz_warren_angry-480x277.jpg", "description": "The hard Left consolidates its grip on the post-Obama Democrat Party.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "article_summary": "PoliticsSenator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is shaping up as a left-wing dream alternative to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race.\n\u201cThat is why we should be talking about expanding Social Security benefits, not cutting them,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, the other big problem dogging Warren is that she has a very thin skin.\nThis imbalance widens inexorably until it devours the entire Social Security Trust Fund in 2031, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\nThe problem is that since 2010 Social Security payouts to seniors have exceeded payroll taxes collected from workers."}
