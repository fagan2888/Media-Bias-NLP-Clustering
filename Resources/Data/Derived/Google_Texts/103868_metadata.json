Akash brings a unique perspective to AFP, and specializes in education, health care, tax, and transportation issues.\n\nJust when you thought the unfolding saga of Obamacare couldn\u2019t get any stranger, it does. Witness last week\u2019s bombshell \u2013 a whistleblower alleges American taxpayers are paying workers \u201cto do nothing but sit at their computers.\u201d\n\nFirst reported by KMOV News 4, the whistleblower painted a picture reminiscent of the cult classic \u201cOffice Space,\u201d telling the St. Louis station that employees went weeks literally doing nothing. What were they supposed to be doing? Processing ObamaCare paper applications.\n\nInstead, they were sitting around playing games \u2013 all on the American taxpayer\u2019s dime.\n\nLavonne Takatz worked from October to April at the Wentzville, Missouri facility where the transgressions occurred. She told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: \u201cWe played Pictionary. We played 20 Questions. We played Trivial Pursuit.\u201d\n\nAnother former employee told KMOV management told them to \u201cact like we were working\u201d and \u201clook at the screen as if we were reading things.\u201d Employees were banned from speaking to the media, even after they left the company. The company is called Serco, a British firm awarded a $1.2 billion contract to manage paper applications for President Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nInstead, they were sitting around playing games \u2013 all on the American taxpayer\u2019s dime. Share:\n\nSerco was a boondoggle of its own amidst Obamacare\u2019s disastrous rollout. The former Serco employee explained that there were 1,800 people waiting to get one out of 20 applications that came through.\n\nSince the workload was so light, they were told \u201cto sit at their computers and hit the refresh button\u2026no more than every 10 minutes.\u201d If they refreshed more than that, they were called into a supervisor\u2019s office and told to stop, reported the Post-Dispatch. Takatz says that Serco even provided books to read.\n\nAccording to Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data, throughout October and November only 17 percent of exchange applications were on paper \u2013 far below the one-third rate the Congressional Budget Office projected. And yet at the same time there was a backlog of 50,000 to 60,000 paper applications \u2013 each representing a customer left in the dark about their status.\n\nThe Obama Administration awarded Serco with the contract last summer. Of course, as has been the case with so many recipients of this administration\u2019s generosity, a cloud of insider politics hangs over the award.\n\nSerco spent more than $1 million on lobbying and other political activities, including a donation to the Obama campaign \u2013 presumably common practice for a company that does 90 percent of its business with the federal government.\n\nInterestingly, one of Serco\u2019s hired lobbyists, Mark Hayes, was the central subject of an insider-trading investigation. But Serco\u2019s dark history goes far beyond one lobbyist \u2013 it appears to stretch across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nJust days after Serco was awarded the Obamacare contract, they came under investigation from Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office. An audit discovered that Serco and another company had been overbilling the government by over $80 billion (USD). Serco, Inc. in the United States did not alert the government that their parent company was under foreign investigation, despite being required by law to do so.\n\nIn August, London police investigated allegations that Serco falsified documents on a British government contract. In 2006, they were contracted to provide certain healthcare services in England, but the Guardian found that quality of service had declined drastically as a result. Another contract in 2011 resulted in 400 \u201cclinical incidents.\u201d In March of 2013, Britain\u2019s National Audit Office found that Serco had made \u201cunauthorized changes to performance data\u201d 252 times in six months.\n\nHowever, ineptitude and employee boredom have not been Serco\u2019s only problems. Multiple reports have surfaced of staff being physically and sexually violent at another Serco-run facility, leading the Australian government to join the British in their suspicion of the worldwide corporation.\n\nGiven the seriousness of the various allegations against Serco, the Obama administration must have known about the company\u2019s troubling past, and yet they were awarded the enormous taxpayer-funded contract anyway.\n\nAs Jillian Kay Melchior wrote for National Review, \u201cAny one of these scandals would have been troubling enough, but taken together they make you wonder what the U.S. government was thinking \u2014 as with so much of the rest of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nNow, members of Congress want CMS to respond to questions that should have been answered long ago \u2013 before the rollout, before Serco was awarded the gigantic contract, before Obamacare was passed and signed into law.\n\nUnfortunately, as with many of Obamacare\u2019s expensive consequences, it is too little too late.\n\nLavonne Takatz told the Post-Dispatch she feels like she \u201cwas stealing money from people.\u201d If only the Obama administration shared her concern.\n\nAkash Chougule is a policy analyst at Americans for Prosperity.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
