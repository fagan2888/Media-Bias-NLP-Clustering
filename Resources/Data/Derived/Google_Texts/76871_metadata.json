Fisher said the state had a police officer willing to testify. Daboni\u2019s bond was originally set in late June or early July.\n\nThis information became available after a mistrial requested by the defendant was approved Wednesday and the jury was dismissed.\n\nOn Friday morning, Williams said the state wished to withdraw its motion to revoke bond because they had not been able to substantiate the claims of a threat in the two-day period, and would need more time to substantiate the claims made. Jason Holdren, an attorney from Gallipolis, was appointed as Daboni\u2019s counsel on Wednesday and spoke on behalf of his client during Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\nBefore Holdren was appointed, Daboni\u2019s most recent lawyer was fired Friday, when Byron Lee Potts\u2019 office in Columbus received a phone call from Daboni\u2019s sister at 1:40 p.m. Oct. 9. The sister allegedly told Potts that Daboni had terminated his services. Carson also revealed that Daboni had two prior attorneys whose services he had also terminated. His previous attorneys are listed as Stephen Paul Ames, of Gahanna, and Kerry Robert Toy, of Athens.\n\nHoldren said he and his client had no issue with the state\u2019s request to withdraw their motion to revoke Daboni\u2019s bond.\n\nHe added that he wanted to make sure that his client received a fair and impartial jury at his trial. Judge Carson Crow said he understood Holdren\u2019s concerns.\n\nHoldren also spoke about concerns that his client was not getting the pain medication he was prescribed by Holzer Medical Center after he fell last Tuesday afternoon and was transported to a medical facility, postponing his trial to Oct. 14.\n\nWilliams privately spoke with Maj. Scott Trusell, who then told Crow that he had spoken with Middleport Police Chief Mony Wood, who said he didn\u2019t know about the medication, but that it could be procured. Crow said that with regard to medication in the past, protocol has always been followed and he knows with this update it will continue to be, meaning that Daboni will receive his prescription Ibuprofen.\n\nHoldren had also raised concerns about his client not receiving regular use of the phones within the Middleport Jail, and Trussell said that because of Daboni\u2019s injury he is in a detox area away from the general population where a phone is located. He said that when Daboni needs to make a call, a guard will come and get him and take him to the phone, with deputies helping him in making calls, so it\u2019s all about whether or not there\u2019s enough manpower at the time Daboni wishes to make a call.\n\nThe judge said that while he doesn\u2019t like setting dates in stone, Daboni\u2019s new trial is set for Monday, Nov. 16.\n\nDaboni is currently facing 12 felony charges, according to Fisher. Daboni faces seven counts of fifth-degree felony trafficking, one count of fourth-degree felony trafficking, one count of second-degree felony trafficking, one count of first-degree felony trafficking, one count of second-degree felony engaging a pattern of corrupt behavior, and one count of first-degree felony engaging a pattern of corrupt behavior. Three of the trafficking charges in the fifth degree mention heroin, with the rest of the trafficking charges listed simply as \u201ctrafficking,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nReach Lindsay Kriz at 740-992-2155 EXT. 2555.\n\nhttp://mydailysentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/web1_IMG_4082-001.jpg\n\nBy Lindsay Kriz lkriz@civitasmedia.com\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-OH", "DC.language": "en_US", "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "geo.placename": "Pomeroy", "og": {"site_name": "Pomeroy Daily Sentinel", "description": "POMEROY \u2014 In a motion hearing Friday morning in the Jacque Daboni case, Meigs County Prosecuting Attorney Colleen Williams said the state wants to withdraw its motion to revoke the defendant\u2019s $1 million bond.On Wednesday, Jeremy Fisher, assistant Meigs County prosecuting attorney, said the state wanted to revoke Daboni\u2019s bond after having just received information [...]", "locality": "Pomeroy", "url": "http://mydailysentinel.com/news/2193/motion-to-revoke-dabonis-bond-withdrawn", "image": "http://mydailysentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/web1_IMG_4082-001-300x225.jpg", "title": "Motion to revoke Daboni\u2019s bond withdrawn", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "region": "US-OH"}, "DC.type": "Text", "twitter": {"image": "http://mydailysentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/web1_IMG_4082-001.jpg", "site": "@td_sentinel", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "- Pomeroy Daily Sentinel - mydailysentinel.com"}, "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.contributor": "Pomeroy Daily Sentinel", "DC.publisher": "Pomeroy Daily Sentinel", "DC.identifier": "http://mydailysentinel.com", "DC.relation": "http://dublincore.org/", "theme-color": "#006400", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-10-17T10:47:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-17T10:47:11+00:00", "author": "http://mydailysentinel.com/author/englewoodindependent-2"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "DC.title": "Pomeroy Daily Sentinel, Pomeroy OH - www.mydailysentinel.com"}, "article_summary": "Holdren said he and his client had no issue with the state\u2019s request to withdraw their motion to revoke Daboni\u2019s bond.\nPOMEROY \u2014 In a motion hearing Friday morning in the Jacque Daboni case, Meigs County Prosecuting Attorney Colleen Williams said the state wants to withdraw its motion to revoke the defendant\u2019s $1 million bond.\nDaboni faces seven counts of fifth-degree felony trafficking, one count of fourth-degree felony trafficking, one count of second-degree felony trafficking, one count of first-degree felony trafficking, one count of second-degree felony engaging a pattern of corrupt behavior, and one count of first-degree felony engaging a pattern of corrupt behavior.\nOn Wednesday, Jeremy Fisher, assistant Meigs County prosecuting attorney, said the state wanted to revoke Daboni\u2019s bond after having just received information from the Secret Service that Daboni had allegedly threatened an unknown person sometime between Sept. 28-29.\nDaboni\u2019s bond was originally set in late June or early July."}
