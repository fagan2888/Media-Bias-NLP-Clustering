Sarah Salda\u00f1a can top it.\n\nTo many Republicans in Congress, she\u2019s now the face of an illegal executive amnesty. Morale at the agency she just took over couldn\u2019t drop much lower. To top it off, funding may dry up in two weeks.\n\nThat explains the huge jar of Tylenol on her desk \u2014 a gag gift from a Dallas judge when Salda\u00f1a left her job as U.S. attorney to become director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It\u2019s the nation\u2019s second-biggest investigative agency, and it\u2019s at the center of its most emotional and intractable policy debate.\n\nShe\u2019s happy to engage. Deporting 11 million people who are in the country illegally isn\u2019t feasible, she argues. Every day, prosecutors and police set priorities, focusing finite resources on the worst offenders.\n\n\u201cSomeone has 10 parking tickets \u2014 no, we\u2019re not going to be spending our money trying to run those folks down,\u201d she said last week in her first extended interview since becoming ICE director Dec. 23. \u201cWe don\u2019t have billions of dollars in our budget, billions and billions, to reach out to everybody that\u2019s in the country\u201d illegally.\n\nThe administration and Congress have been deadlocked over funding for the Department of Homeland Security since President Barack Obama issued executive actions in November shielding 5 million people from deportation \u2014 people Salda\u00f1a\u2019s agency would otherwise be tasked with rounding up.\n\nThe new policy makes it a top priority to remove anyone deemed a threat to national security, border security or public safety.\n\nSalda\u00f1a views this as pragmatism, not ideology.\n\nShe spent an hour discussing her new job in her 11th-floor office. The view is uninspiring: A power plant dominates, blocking most of the Washington Monument. Mementos include a Dallas Police Department cap. Her desk is covered in files and paperwork.\n\nThe jar of painkillers is front and center.\n\n\u201cDHS issues are the most contentious thing right now between the administration and Republicans, with the possible exception of Obamacare,\u201d said Edward Alden, an expert on immigration policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. In the midst of this \u201copen warfare,\u201d he added, \u201cit is her piece of it that is the most controversial.\u201d\n\n\u2018Full blast\u2019\n\nSalda\u00f1a, 63, grew up in Corpus Christi and got her law degree at Southern Methodist University. She joined the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Northern District of Texas 11 years ago and became chief federal prosecutor in Dallas in 2011, with support from both Republican Texas senators.\n\nWhen the president tapped her to run ICE, Sen. John Cornyn, the deputy GOP leader, introduced her in glowing terms at her confirmation hearing. Then came the executive actions. Salda\u00f1a\u2019s defense of Obama\u2019s decision cost her the support of Cornyn and most other Republicans.\n\nEven so, she won confirmation in the final hours that Democrats controlled the Senate. She arrived at ICE headquarters on Jan. 6.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been full blast since then,\u201d she said.\n\nShe\u2019s met with ambassadors from Mexico and the Central American countries from which tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors poured into the U.S. last summer. She recently briefed the president on implementation of his executive actions.\n\nBefore the Super Bowl, she held a news conference in Phoenix to warn against counterfeit NFL apparel. The customs part of ICE draws far less controversy for an agency with 20,000 employees and a $6 billion budget. But it\u2019s part of a huge portfolio that includes efforts to halt the smuggling of weapons, people and drugs, and to thwart terrorists.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that I\u2019ve learned in that area, and it\u2019s what makes everybody\u2019s hair gray,\u201d she said.\n\nThe immediate crisis is the budget stalemate.\n\nFunding runs out Feb. 28 for DHS. Senate Democrats have blocked GOP efforts to strip funds related to Obama\u2019s executive actions. With no resolution in sight, Congress began a 10-day recess Friday.\n\nSalda\u00f1a warned of big problems without a resolution.\n\n\u201cI have investigators out there in the middle of investigations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about child pornography. Import-export control. Transnational gangs and criminal activity. Counterfeit products,\u201d including faulty air bags and parts for military aircraft.\n\n\u201cWho manages their budget in an organization \u2014 never mind the size and import of [ICE] \u2014 on a 30-day basis?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a way to do business.\u201d\n\nOther issues\n\nAnd it\u2019s hardly her only headache.\n\nA recent survey of the best federal agencies to work for found ICE tied for last, out of 314. Agents bristle under a patchwork of evolving policies: Young people brought to the country illegally can stay; now, parents of citizens can stay, and so on.\n\n\u201cPeople go into law enforcement because they want to enforce the law, and it makes it very difficult for them to do their job if the law is unclear,\u201d Alden said.\n\nSalda\u00f1a readily concedes the agency faces a huge morale problem. It didn\u2019t help to have an 18-month gap in leadership before her confirmation.\n\n\u201cIf we are able to increase that morale problem \u2014 improve it, I don\u2019t think we can go any lower than what we are!\u201d she said, correcting herself and laughing, \u201cI will consider that a job well done.\u201d\n\nOne way is to get ICE agents on board with the idea that enforcement can and should be aggressive; it just has to be targeted.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of criminals out there that fit the top two priorities under executive action \u2014 terrorists and gangs, and convicted criminals,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to do. \u2026 So I am encouraging folks to focus on that part of it.\u201d\n\nSalda\u00f1a is already feeling heat from Congress, too.\n\nRepublicans have howled over the release in 2013 of 36,007 \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d \u2014 people in the pipeline for deportation who had been convicted of a crime unrelated to immigration. Among these were 193 killers and 303 kidnappers.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has been highlighting that 1,000 of those released were later convicted of new crimes.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be releasing serious criminals, because they\u2019re squarely the No. 1 enforcement priority,\u201d said Marc Rosenblum, who studies U.S. immigration policies at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nSalda\u00f1a said ICE\u2019s hands were tied in most of these cases. Federal courts require release of most detainees after 180 days. Some home countries, such as China or Cuba, won\u2019t take back criminals. At the same time, she said, ICE agents can still detain anyone they deem a threat to public safety.\n\n\u201cThose that go and commit other crimes, we need to get them in custody and then we need to process them and get them out of the country,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of Salda\u00f1a\u2019s earliest acts was to visit a detention center that opened in mid-December in the South Texas town Dilley. The center was designed to house 2,400 people caught crossing the border.\n\nMost are women and children.\n\nImmigrant advocates view Dilley as a prison. They\u2019re dismayed that an administration that purports to have concern for families would open such a massive facility. Salda\u00f1a lauded on-site medical care, modern classrooms and immigration courts to speed the legal process.\n\n\u201cThere is barbed wire,\u201d she acknowledged. But Dilley is \u201csecond to none,\u201d she said, noting those caught at the border must be housed somewhere until a court determines their status.\n\nFollow Todd J.
