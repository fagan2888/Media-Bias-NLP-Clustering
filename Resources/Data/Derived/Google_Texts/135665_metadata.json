Vladimir Putin is reassembling the Soviet Union, and while all that's going on, Obama is filling out his March Madness bracket picks.

On the March 19 edition of Fox News' Special Report, Fox contributor Steve Hayes accused the president of failing to issue a \"serious response\" to a Russian takeover in Ukraine, opting instead to fill out his NCAA bracket:\n\nHAYES: This is a disgrace. The way that the President of the United States and his administration is handling this is so unserious on so many different levels. You heard from the NATO Secretary General that this is a crisis, it's a crisis like we haven't seen in decades. What's President Obama doing? He's filling out his NCAA bracket. He's hosting a film ceremony for Cesar Chavez. This is not a serious response to what is, I think, a real crisis.

And as he does every year, the president decided to play it safe, mostly choosing top-seeded teams and predicting a final matchup between four perennial contenders. It's a bit boring, really, even if Obama's correct prediction in 2009 of a North Carolina championship makes it harder to knock his system. Just as you can expect an Obama prediction on the NCAA every year, you can also expect conservatives to respond with fake outrage over the president taking time from his busy schedule to weigh in on college basketball. The right-wing Obama NCAA bracket freakout is more intense some years than others, but you can always bet that at some point, somewhere, some bored conservative or desperate Republican politician will complain about having a basketball fan as the Commander-in-Chief.
