KAILUA, Hawaii (AP) -- How President Barack Obama spent the eighth day of his family's holiday vacation in Hawaii on Friday:

-- MORNING AT HOME: President Obama stayed at his Kailua vacation home until late morning on a sunny day on Oahu.

-- BEACH TIME: Obama and the first family headed to Bellows Air Force Station to hit the beach for the third day in a row. As the motorcade arrived, several dozen beachgoers and families waved and flashed the "shaka" sign on a breezy day.
