Peter Shumlin (D) called it \u201cone of the most difficult decisions of my public life.\u201d (AP Photo/The Burlington Free Press, Glenn Russell)\n\nVermont Gov. Peter Shumlin (D) has abandoned a years-long push for a universal health-care system in the state after budget analysts said the program would require what he called \u201cenormous\u201d new taxes.\n\nShumlin had proposed what he called the Green Mountain Care plan, which would have put Vermont on track to provide publicly-financed health care starting in 2017.\n\nBut Michael Costa, Shumlin\u2019s deputy director of health care reform, concluded the plan would have required an 11.5 percent payroll tax on all Vermont businesses and an income tax hike of up to 9.5 percent. Those taxes wouldn\u2019t have covered transition costs to the new system, which would have amounted to at least $500 million.\n\n\u201cThese are simply not tax rates that I can responsibly support or urge the legislature to pass,\u201d Shumlin said in a speech Wednesday. \u201cIn my judgment, the potential economic disruption and risks would be too great to small businesses, working families and the state\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nShumlin blamed slower-than-expected economic growth after the recession that forced the state to make steep budget cuts. Federal funding for the transition would have been $150 million less than initially projected, costs the state would have had to absorb.\n\n\u201cPushing for single payer health care financing when the time isn\u2019t right and it would likely hurt our economy is not good for Vermont and it would not be good for true health care reform,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cNow is not the right time to ask our legislature to take the step of passing a financing plan for Green Mountain Care.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s budget officials tried to find ways to pay for the program without the tax hikes, though no one could come up with a solution that prevented the tax hikes.\n\nIn an op-ed released by Shumlin\u2019s office, he called the move to scrap universal care \u201cone of the most difficult decisions of my public life.\u201d\n\nInstead of universal health care, Shumlin said he would pursue other avenues to reduce health-care costs, such as paying for quality of outcomes rather than quantity of services, and improving information technology systems.\n\nRepublicans cheered the decision to abandon the push for a single-payer system. Lt. Gov. Phil Scott (R) called the move \u201ca definitive step in the right direction for Vermonters, Vermont businesses and Vermont\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBusinesses cannot afford an 11.5 percent payroll tax, individuals cannot afford a 9.5 percent income tax, our State cannot afford a $2.6 billion bill, and Vermont cannot afford to continue down this path of uncertainty,\u201d Scott said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve already spent far too much money exploring this idea, and the discussion has paralyzed our business community.\u201d\n\nMore than 41,000 Vermonters were made eligible for Medicaid or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Programs under the Affordable Care Act and another 38,000 had signed up for coverage as of April, according to statistics maintained by the pro-ACA Kaiser Family Foundation. Just 9.3 percent of Vermonters were uninsured before the Affordable Care Act was passed, one of the lower rates in the nation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tax hikes to state businesses and individual would have been necessary to pay for the single-payer program.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Tax hikes to state businesses and individual would have been necessary to pay for the single-payer program.", "title": "Vermont ends push for single-payer health care", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/12/18/vermont-ends-push-for-single-payer-health-care/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/01/Local-Politics/Images/Governor-Vermont-0fedf.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@postreid"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/12/18/vermont-ends-push-for-single-payer-health-care/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "states, health care, affordable care act, obamacare, single payer, Vermont", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "states, health care, affordable care act, obamacare, single payer, Vermont"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc913\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPushing for single payer health care financing when the time isn\u2019t right and it would likely hurt our economy is not good for Vermont and it would not be good for true health care reform,\u201d Shumlin said.\nShumlin had proposed what he called the Green Mountain Care plan, which would have put Vermont on track to provide publicly-financed health care starting in 2017.\nBut Michael Costa, Shumlin\u2019s deputy director of health care reform, concluded the plan would have required an 11.5 percent payroll tax on all Vermont businesses and an income tax hike of up to 9.5 percent.\nJust 9.3 percent of Vermonters were uninsured before the Affordable Care Act was passed, one of the lower rates in the nation.\nPeter Shumlin (D) called it \u201cone of the most difficult decisions of my public life.\u201d (AP Photo/The Burlington Free Press, Glenn Russell)Vermont Gov."}
