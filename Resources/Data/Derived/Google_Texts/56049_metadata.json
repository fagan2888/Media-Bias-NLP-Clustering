(AP) \u2014 Nothing is more important than family.\n\nThat\u2019s what the stoic Hollywood fixer played by Liev Schreiber tells his wife in the second season premiere of \u201cRay Donovan.\u201d While it\u2019s unclear whether his character believes his own words, Schreiber says that principle has shaped his career in recent years.\n\nThe actor has made it a priority to spend time with his two sons with longtime partner Naomi Watts \u2014 6-year-old Sasha and 5-year-old Samuel. He set aside plans to direct again after 2005\u2019s \u201cEverything Is Illuminated.\u201d He let others guide him into roles in theatre and on screen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how insignificant everything else becomes,\u201d Schreiber said of his fatherhood. \u201cIt sounds romantic. But the reality is that you go brain dead for 2 1/2, 3 years and slowly return to the world. \u2026 You kind of lose all ambition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the thing about acting. It\u2019s so easy to follow the career path that\u2019s defined by the options presented to you,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere with directing or producing or writing, there is a lot more self-motivation at play there.\u201d\n\nThe 46-year-old actor looked as if he had mostly emerged from that haze during a recent shoot on the set of \u201cRay Donovan\u201d in a gated neighborhood in Calabasas, the hilly Los Angeles suburb where the Kardashians and many other celebrities live.\n\nSchreiber was directing the episode, his first gig outside of commercials in nine years. Sitting in a high folding chair, he reviewed a script on a MacBook Air, glancing up to watch cameras move into position on a monitor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re good. We\u2019re good. We\u2019re good,\u201d he announced over a wireless microphone to the production crew. There was a pause. One actor was missing. \u201cOh right, that\u2019s me,\u201d he said with a tight smile, hopping up swiftly to take his mark for a scene in which Donovan confronts a music mogul and yells at his teenage daughter.\n\nSchreiber says later he underestimated the difficulty of \u201cpulling double duty\u201d on the much-praised series, which weaves together stories of clergy sex abuse, unconventional family ties, violence, celebrity and Hollywood powerbrokers. The second season starts Sunday on Showtime.\n\n\u201cIn order to do it correctly, you have to watch playback after every take. I just hated stopping \u2026 to see my own performance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hard part is directing without vision, without being able to see.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liev Schreiber balances fatherhood, \u2018Ray Donovan\u2019", "author": "Ryan Pearson", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Liev Schreiber balances fatherhood, \u2018Ray Donovan\u2019", "title": "Liev Schreiber balances fatherhood, \u2018Ray Donovan\u2019", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/12/liev_schreiber_balances_fatherhood_ray_donovan/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/tv-liev-schreiber.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Liev Schreiber balances fatherhood, \u2018Ray Donovan\u2019", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/tv-liev-schreiber.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Liev Schreiber balances fatherhood, \u2018Ray Donovan\u2019", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Liev Schreiber balances fatherhood, \u2018Ray Donovan\u2019", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde50\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s what the stoic Hollywood fixer played by Liev Schreiber tells his wife in the second season premiere of \u201cRay Donovan.\u201d While it\u2019s unclear whether his character believes his own words, Schreiber says that principle has shaped his career in recent years.\nThe second season starts Sunday on Showtime.\nSchreiber was directing the episode, his first gig outside of commercials in nine years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how insignificant everything else becomes,\u201d Schreiber said of his fatherhood.\nBut the reality is that you go brain dead for 2 1/2, 3 years and slowly return to the world."}
