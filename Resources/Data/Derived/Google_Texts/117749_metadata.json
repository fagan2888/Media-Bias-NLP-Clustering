Even more were turned away.\n\nThink about that for a minute. The only way Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz would find themselves amid 10,000 people is if they walked into an NBA game.\n\nOr the next Trump rally.\n\nInside the arena, it was vintage Trump. Passion. Fury. Kicking out protesters and berating the media.\n\nKill Obamacare! Kill the terrorists! Build the wall! I love Hispanics! Bring back water boarding! Or maybe not. No, let's do it. Plus, let's kill the terrorists like they did in the old days \u2014 with bullets that have been soaked in pig's blood.\n\nTrump's speeches are a veritable word salad.\n\nHe goes from topic to topic without segue or sometimes even breath.\n\nA sentence that begins with blistering criticism of an opponent might end with a shout-out to one of his kids.\n\nDonald Trump attacks his opponents and addresses protesters at a packed CFE Arena Thousands filled the CFE Arena in Orlando on Saturday to attend a Donald Trump rally, where the candidate attacked his opponents and addressed protesters.

See more videos\n\nIn the course of about three minutes, Trump professed love for evangelical Christians, touted the size of his hands, dissed Cruz and knocked Rubio for missing Senate votes.\n\nThe crowd liked it all. But perhaps nothing revs up the crowd more than ousting a protester. It happened about a dozen times Saturday.\n\nWhen one is spotted, the crowd begins screaming until they catch Trump's attention.\n\n\"Get 'em out of here!\" he roars.\n\nSecurity does as ordered, and the crowd roars back.\n\n\"Go home to Mommy!\"\n\nThe crowd roars even louder.\n\nAnother piece of standard roar-inducing fare at all Trump rallies is media-bashing. At UCF, Trump asked everyone in the arena to look at the camera operators and then told the silent camera crew: \"You all are the most dishonest group of people.\"\n\nHe then went directly into talking about a \"phenomenal story\" about him in the New York Times.\n\nSome view all members of the Trump army as monolithic nuts. They are not.\n\nI walked in with a fourth-grade teacher and sat with a chiropractor. The crowd is overwhelmingly white, but not completely. Not all of them like Trump's coarse ways. The chiropractor confesses that he wished Trump was more polished.\n\nTrying to pinpoint Trump's appeal is a fool's errand. The reasons are complex.\n\nIt's his celebrity, his strength, his success, his independence, his bravado.\n\nMore than anything else, it's because he's not like everybody else.\n\nI get that.\n\nThere's a lot about Trump I don't like \u2014 including his divisiveness, fear-mongering and the fact that his crude talk and profane language have made many parents scared to let their children watch democracy in action.\n\nI also fear that Trump's discriminatory talk emboldens others to give voice to ugly sentiments that have more to do with prejudices than public policy.\n\nBut I also get why people are so desperate for something different.\n\nAnd savvy Republicans are starting to realize that rather than fight Trump, they should try to work with him; capitalize on the momentum that no other candidate has created and try to make a deal.\n\nAnd Trump will deal. He always has. His shift is already starting on immigration. To the left. To the center. To where Trump \u2014 a life-long supporter of liberal politics and policies \u2014 has always been.\n\n\"I'm changing, I'm changing,\" Trump said during last week's debate in announcing his support for foreign-worker visas.\n\nIt will continue. I've long said the people most angered by a Trump presidency wouldn't be the liberals who hate his guts now. It would be the hard-core conservatives who realize Trump's positions are, as he said last week, \"flexible.\"\n\nOf the GOP guys left, John Kasich strikes me as the most serious, contemplative statesman on stage.\n\nBut this is not the year of the contemplative statesman. It's the year of penis jokes. And Muslim-bashing. And being sick and tired of the people who have been in office all these years.\n\nAnd Trump has captured that.\n\nIf party leaders haven't figured that out yet, maybe they should go to the next Trump rally and see it for themselves.\n\nAnd if they still don't like what they see, well, they can say so. Just be warned: You'll probably get booed and sent home to mommy.\n\nsmaxwell@orlandosentinel.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Memo to GOP bosses: Trump army is here to stay", "Description": "10,000 Donald Trump fans in Orlando provide another reminder to party bosses: The Donald cannot be ignored", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "For months now, GOP party bosses have tried to deny the reality of Donald Trump .", "title": "Memo to GOP bosses: Trump army is here to stay", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-donald-trump-orlando-rally-scott-maxwell-20160305-column.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56db80cb/turbine/os-donald-trump-orlando-rally-scott-maxwell-20160305", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/86123249", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-03-05", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f76\"", "article_summary": "If party leaders haven't figured that out yet, maybe they should go to the next Trump rally and see it for themselves.\nOr the next Trump rally.\nThousands filled the CFE Arena in Orlando on Saturday to attend a Donald Trump rally, where the candidate attacked his opponents and addressed protesters.\nFor months now, GOP party bosses have tried to deny the reality of Donald Trump.\nAbout 10,000 of them filled UCF's CFE arena."}
