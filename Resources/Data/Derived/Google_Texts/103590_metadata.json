These enrollees say they have received little help from overwhelmed insurance companies.\n\nIn order to keep premiums under control and also stay in compliance with the plethora of new Obamacare regulations, big insurance companies have \u201csharply cut the number of doctors and hospitals available to patients in the state\u2019s new health insurance market,\u201d the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nIt\u2019s the limited options and new insurance customers leading to the logjam at the doctor\u2019s office and some hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little early for anyone to know how widespread and deep this problem is,\u201d said California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones told the LA Times. \u201cThere are a lot of economic incentives for health insurers to narrow their networks, but if they go too far, people won\u2019t have access to care. Network adequacy will be a big issue in 2014.\u201d\n\nMore from the report:\n\nExperts have warned for months that the logjam was inevitable. But the extent of the problems is taking by surprise many patients \u2014 and even doctors \u2014 as frustrations mount. Aliso Viejo resident Danielle Nelson said Anthem Blue Cross promised half a dozen times that her oncologists would be covered under her new policy. She was diagnosed last year with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and discovered a suspicious lump near her jaw in early January. But when she went to her oncologist\u2019s office, she promptly encountered a bright orange sign saying that Covered California plans are not accepted. \u201cI\u2019m a complete fan of the Affordable Care Act, but now I can\u2019t sleep at night,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine this is how President Obama wanted it to happen.\u201d\n\nThe consulting firm consulting firm McKinsey & Co. reports that 70 percent of new insurance plans under Obamacare cover less hospital networks compared to many existing insurance plans. It is believed to be a way insurance companies are trying to keep costs down.\n\nThe Covered California state exchange, which began enrollment in October, was not exempt from the frustrating delays and glitch-ridden rollout experienced by most of the country. The problems persisted for weeks, infuriating consumers.\n\nRead the LA Times\u2019 full report here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "People in California who have managed to conquer the glitch-ridden Healthcare.gov website and successfully enroll in Obamacare are now discovering that the headaches only continue at the doctor\u2019s office.
