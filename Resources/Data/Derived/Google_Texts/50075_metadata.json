(Photo: Evan Siegle/Press-Gazette Media)Buy Photo\n\nBrett Favre\u2019s career with the Green Bay Packers will come full circle on Thanksgiving Day when his name and No. 4 are unveiled on the facade of Lambeau Field.\n\nHe will join the ranks of legendary Packers players Don Hutson, Tony Canadeo, Bart Starr, Ray Nitschke and Reggie White, who have had their numbers retired. (Former general manager Ron Wolf, who brought Favre to Green Bay, was honored Nov. 15 when his name was unveiled on the Lambeau facade.)\n\nFavre and Packers fans have come a long way since 2008 when the quarterback retired, then un-retired five months later and was traded to the New York Jets. A year after that he signed with the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nThe sting of the messy departure and eventual signing with a Packers\u2019 rival have faded. Instead, fans focus on how he made Sunday afternoons relevant again in Wisconsin and made Packers games must-see TV. And how he helped bring home the Lombardi Trophy again after a 30-year absence.\n\nThat was evident in July when 67,000 fans packed Lambeau Field to watch Favre\u2019s induction into the Packers Hall of Fame and then gave him a five-minute standing ovation as he exited the players\u2019 tunnel and walked to midfield to address the crowd.\n\nIt\u2019s also a reminder of how lucky Packers fans have been with Favre and now Aaron Rodgers leading the offense. Not many teams have had that caliber of consistency, excellence and success at the quarterback position for over 20 straight years.\n\nWe hope that another legendary Packers quarterback, Bart Starr, can make the Thanksgiving Day game against the Bears. Starr led the Packers to five NFL championships including victories in the first two Super Bowls. That's five championships. Count them. He excellence extended off the field, too, and he has been an excellent ambassador for the team after his playing and coaching days ended.\n\nHe\u2019s scheduled to join Favre and Rodgers for the ceremony at halftime \u2013 a historic gathering of three great quarterbacks. Starr\u2019s family has said he\u2019s been working toward the goal, as he has had to overcome a heart attack, multiple strokes and a lung infection.\n\nFavre will always be remembered for his passion and durability and his infectious enthusiasm that helped revive a proud organization.\n\nRetiring Favre\u2019s number is a fitting end to his career here and we say: Congratulations. Canton awaits.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1jdKkGL", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Adding Favre's name and number to Lambeau facade is an honor former Packers QB deserves", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "Adding Favre's name and number to Lambeau facade is an honor former Packers QB deserves", "title": "A fitting tribute for Favre", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/11/21/fitting-tribute-favre/76091534/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Adding Favre's name and number to Lambeau facade is an honor former Packers QB deserves", "title": "A fitting tribute for Favre", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d2dbef96092ae622092736a3c6450118b71fc6f0/c=247-0-1353-1106&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/20/WIGroup/GreenBay/635835756114784370-FAVRE.jpg", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s also a reminder of how lucky Packers fans have been with Favre and now Aaron Rodgers leading the offense.\nBuy Photo Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre celebrates after a touchdown during the Jan. 12, 2008, playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks.\nFavre and Packers fans have come a long way since 2008 when the quarterback retired, then un-retired five months later and was traded to the New York Jets.\n(Former general manager Ron Wolf, who brought Favre to Green Bay, was honored Nov. 15 when his name was unveiled on the Lambeau facade.)\nWe hope that another legendary Packers quarterback, Bart Starr, can make the Thanksgiving Day game against the Bears."}
