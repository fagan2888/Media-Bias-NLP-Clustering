Carpenter is now in serious condition, her family said in a statement.\n\n\u201cTonya\u2019s family and loved ones are grateful to all who have reached out with thoughts and prayers but are requesting privacy at this time as Tonya recovers,\u201d Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Hospital said in a statement.\n\nCarpenter had posted a Facebook photo from the game earlier in the evening. A longtime friend, Sheila Hokhanson of Charlton, Massachusetts, liked the post and said Carpenter was there with her son and a friend.\n\n\u201cThey were just going to a game,\u201d Hokhanson said in a telephone interview.\n\n\u201cIt was just, if you get a chance to get tickets, you grab them and you go and sit where the ticket happens to be,\u201d Hokhanson said.\n\nThere was a moment of reflection for Carpenter at Fenway Park before Saturday\u2019s game between the A\u2019s and Red Sox. Lawrie was out of the lineup, but manager Bob Melvin said it was because of a back issue, not because of any psychological effects after the incident.\n\nFriday night\u2019s game was halted in the second inning as emergency crews tended to a bloodied Carpenter and wheeled her off the field on a stretcher.\n\nLawrie broke his bat on a grounder and part of it hurtled a few rows into the seats between the backstop and Oakland\u2019s dugout on the third base side.\n\nAlex Merlis, of Brookline, Massachusetts, said he was sitting in the row behind the woman when the broken bat flew into the stands.\n\n\u201cIt was violent,\u201d he said of the impact to her forehead and top of her head. \u201cShe bled a lot. A lot. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything like that.\u201d\n\nThere are signs posted on the low retaining wall facing fans in the front row that read: \u201cBe Alert. Foul Balls and Bats Hurt.\u201d\n\nMerlis said the woman had been sitting with a small child and a man. After she was injured, the man was tending to her and other people were trying to console the distraught child, he said.\n\nAfter the game, Lawrie said he hoped the woman would recover.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen bats fly out of guys\u2019 hands in the stands and everyone\u2019s OK, but when one breaks like that, has jagged edges on it, anything can happen.\u201d\n\nConcerned about a rash of flying broken bats and the danger they posed, Major League Baseball studied the issue in 2008 and implemented a series of changes to bat regulations for the following season.\n\n\u201cI do know that MLB is probably taking a look at the incident last night, as they do with any bat that flies into the stands,\u201d Red Sox manager John Farrell said.\n\nMulti-piece bat failures are down about 50 percent since the beginning of the 2009 season, MLB spokesman Michael Teevan said.\n\n\u201cYou have a ballpark here that\u2019s how old, and it\u2019s close, you have some maple bats that break. I think MLB and the players\u2019 association have talked long and hard about how they can try to keep this from happening,\u201d Melvin said.\n\nThough dozens of fans at big league ballparks are struck by foul balls each season, there has been only one fatality, according to baseball researchers \u2014 a 14-year-old boy killed by a foul line drive off the bat of Manny Mota at Dodger Stadium in 1970.\n\nThe National Hockey League ordered safety netting installed at each end of NHL arenas after 13-year-old Brittanie Cecil was killed by a deflected puck at a Columbus Blue Jackets game in 2002. She died two days later, and her parents eventually settled with the team for $1.2 million, the league and the arena management.\n\nAP Baseball Writer Mike Fitzpatrick in New York and Associated Press Writer Kristen De Groot in Philadelphia, and Sylvia Lee Wingfield in Boston contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boston police: Fan hit by bat at Fenway expected to survive", "title": "Boston police: Fan hit by bat at Fenway expected to survive", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/05/boston-police-fan-hit-by-bat-at-fenway-expected-to-survive/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150606_123301_woman-hit-bat-fenway-park.jpg", "height": 429}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150606_123301_woman-hit-bat-fenway-park.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T00:26:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T21:45:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2633\"", "article_summary": "BOSTON \u2014 A fan hit by a broken bat at Fenway Park is expected to survive after suffering life-threatening injuries during a game between the Oakland Athletics and Boston Red Sox.\nTonya Carpenter was struck in the head by the broken bat of Oakland\u2019s Brett Lawrie on Friday night.\nAlex Merlis, of Brookline, Massachusetts, said he was sitting in the row behind the woman when the broken bat flew into the stands.\nThere was a moment of reflection for Carpenter at Fenway Park before Saturday\u2019s game between the A\u2019s and Red Sox.\nAfter the game, Lawrie said he hoped the woman would recover."}
