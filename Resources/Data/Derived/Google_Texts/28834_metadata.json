Pass the blame, preferably to an industry most Americans already dislike.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what Democrats are doing when it comes to the failure of Obamacare to contain costs. On their side are the insurance companies, hospitals, and pharmaceutical benefit managers that benefit from Obamacare who have organized under the banner of the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) and launched a sophisticated political campaign to scapegoat drug companies. If they succeed, not only will Democrats avoid political accountability for their bad law, but the stage will be set for expanding the intrusive power of government into the pharmaceutical sector with predictably disastrous consequences.\n\nNCHC\u2019s membership boasts a litany of corporate Obamacare beneficiaries like America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, as well as a laundry list of liberal constituencies from the AFL-CIO to the NAACP. Interestingly, the group is run out of the infamous 1825 K Street address that the Washington Post once described as \u201ca clubhouse and clearinghouse for liberal causes. Its most prominent tenants form an abbreviated who\u2019s who of well-funded allies of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nSo the same core coalition that created and passed Obamacare has sprung into action to blast drug companies and shift the blame to them. To head the effort, they turned to John Rother, a former AARP top lobbyist who spearheaded AARP\u2019s surprising support for Obamacare \u2013 despite the fact the group\u2019s own members opposed the bill 14 to 1.\n\nNCHC\u2019s goal is not just to misdirect anger over Obamacare to help Democrats survive the 2016 elections. They intend to actually implement price controls that would pad the profits of their industry allies, but have a potentially devastating impact on the discovery of new cures.\n\nCase in point, NCHC used last week\u2019s hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on the obviously questionable pricing practices of Martin Shkreli\u2019s Turing Pharmaceuticals to make the reckless claim: \u201cShkreli and Big Pharma\u2019s price gouging are one and the same.\u201d\n\nEven Democratic members of Congress know that\u2019s folly. Representative Stephen Lynch, for instance, told Turing\u2019s CCO at the hearing: \u201cYou are trashing the pharmaceutical industry that is doing a great job on a lot of different drugs from organ transplants to cystic fibrosis.\u201d\n\nBut while NCHC\u2019s officially stated goal is simply \u201cto capture the attention of the leaders of the biopharmaceutical industry and invite them to engage with us in a dialogue,\u201d their activities are political: running ads, conducting polls, and hiring on-the-ground political operatives in the early primary and caucus states to blame higher health care costs on prescription drugs. In effect, although they claim to be bipartisan, it is clear that they are fueling Democratic efforts to scapegoat drug companies for the overall rising cost of health care and set the stage for some form of price controls.\n\nThat would be a disaster. As Milton Friedman and 100 of his distinguished peers explained: \u201cDrug price controls are more difficult to remove than other price controls. Controls on oil and other products often tend to be limited or short-lived, as voters eventually object to the resulting shortages and distortions. The effects of drug price controls, however, are far more difficult to observe because they mainly affect medicines that haven\u2019t been invented yet.\u201d\n\nMoreover, price controls will actually have a major negative impact on the federal fiscal outlook, because managing chronic diseases is much more expensive than preventing and curing them.\n\nInstead, genuine health care reform must recognize that heavy government intervention in the health care sector is having a negative impact on affordability and replace Obamacare with real competition and choice, allowing the market to not only maintain, but improve incentives for developing new cures.\n\nPhil Kerpen is president of American Commitment, a free market policy organization based in Washington, DC.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Phil Kerpen", "description": "Democrats are passing the blame for Obamacare's rising costs on to drug companies", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "How do you survive politically when your party\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement is failing to keep one of its central promises?\u00a0 Pass the blame, preferably to an industry most Americans alre", "title": "The Politically-Motivated Assault On Medical Innovation", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/11/the-politically-motivated-assault-on-medical-innovation/", "image": {"width": 576, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/85554700-e1443462159426.jpg", "height": 247}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrats are passing the blame for Obamacare's rising costs on to drug companies", "creator": "@kerpen", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/11/the-politically-motivated-assault-on-medical-innovation/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/85554700-e1443462159426.jpg"}, "title": "The Politically-Motivated Assault On Medical Innovation Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-11 16:39:07", "sailthru.title": "The Politically-Motivated Assault On Medical Innovation", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "prescription drugs,stephen lynch", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "phil-kerpen", "sailthru.description": "How do you survive politically when your party\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement is failing to keep one of its central promises?\u00a0 Pass the blame, preferably to an industry most Americans alre", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/85554700-e1443462159426.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "As Milton Friedman and 100 of his distinguished peers explained: \u201cDrug price controls are more difficult to remove than other price controls.\nThey intend to actually implement price controls that would pad the profits of their industry allies, but have a potentially devastating impact on the discovery of new cures.\nThe effects of drug price controls, however, are far more difficult to observe because they mainly affect medicines that haven\u2019t been invented yet.\u201dMoreover, price controls will actually have a major negative impact on the federal fiscal outlook, because managing chronic diseases is much more expensive than preventing and curing them.\nThat\u2019s precisely what Democrats are doing when it comes to the failure of Obamacare to contain costs.\n4897442How do you survive politically when your party\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement is failing to keep one of its central promises?"}
