If any of the GOP presidential candidates bought health insurance on their own, how much would they have to pay?

A healthcare website crunched the numbers and determined their monthly premiums would range from $271 for Ted Cruz to $620 for Mike Huckabee.

Donald Trump is one of four candidates old enough to qualify for Medicare. For him, the cheapest supplemental policy would cost $115, while the most expensive would come in at $443. As a fellow New Yorker of Medicare age, Hillary Clinton would have to pay the same amount.

Gov. Chris Christie would have to pay $502 a month.

For those candidates not old enough to get Medicare, HealthCare.com used the premium for the cheapest "Silver" plan offered in the candidate's state for someone of that age. The plans included ones sold on and off the federal exchange. The website assumed none of the candidates would qualify for a federal subsidy.

The hypothetical coverage is for individual coverage, not a family plan. Rick Santorum, who has seven children, or Christie, who has four, would obviously pay for more for family coverage.

The numbers show wide state-by-state disparities, as well as differences even within states. For example, both Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee live in Florida, but Bush would have a choice of 102 different plans, while Huckabee's would have only 30 choices.

They also show the effect of age on prices. Under the Affordable Care Act, while insurers can no longer charge women more than men, they can charge older customers more than younger ones.

Those factors led to big differences among the candidates:

Jeb Bush (62, Florida): $615.

Ben Carson (63, Maryland): $522.

Chris Christie (53, New Jersey): $502.

Hillary Clinton: (67, New York; Medicare): $115

Ted Cruz (44, Texas): $271.

Carly Fiorina (61, Virginia): $600.

Lindsey Graham (60, South Carolina): $603.

Mike Huckabee (60, Florida): $620.

Bobby Jindal (44, Louisiana): $319.

John Kasich (63, Ohio): $563.

Martin O'Malley (53, Maryland): $361.

Rand Paul (53, Kentucky): $460.

Marco Rubio (44, Florida): $299.

Bernie Sanders (74, Vermont; Medicare): $71.

Rick Santorum (57, Dallas): $485.

Donald Trump (69, New York; Medicare): $115.

Jim Webb (69, Virginia; Medicare): $54.

Scott Walker (48, Wisconsin): $303.
