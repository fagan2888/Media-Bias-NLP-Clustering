Photo: Jason Reed\n\nA severe thunderstorm has descended on Sydney and other parts of NSW on Christmas afternoon, with heavy rain, hail and damaging wind hitting the city centre shortly after 5pm before moving towards the coast.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology issued the warning about 4.30pm, for the metropolitan, Illawarra and southern tablelands regions, as well as for parts of the south coast, central tablelands, central west slopes and plains, south-west slopes and lower western region.\n\nThe State Emergency Services had received more than 30 phone calls by 5pm, mostly of fallen branches and toppled trees, some which have taken out powerlines. Traffic lights are down in Penrith and Liverpool. Lightning strikes have taken out train signalling systems in Penrith, Bellambi and Bulli, affecting Blue Mountains and South Coast rail services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"[Christmas] dinner looks problematic,\" the bureau's Mick Logan warned, saying a low pressure trough \"could cause severe thunderstorms in the evening\".\n\nAt 4.30pm cracks of thunder could be heard echoing through the CBD. Wollongong, Nowra, Orange, Goulburn, Dubbo and Parkes were likely to take the brunt of the storm and faced the possibility of flash flooding.\n\nChristmas Day has been sticky, hot and humid in Sydney, with a max of 28 degrees in the city and 31 in Paramatta.\n\nMassive lightning strikes over St. Andrews and Campbelltown as the storm smashes through #sydneystorm pic.twitter.com/cBHwiTAei5 \u2014 Aaron Thomas (@azsportza) December 25, 2014\n\n#NSW #storm update: 25mm recorded in 30 mins at Touga (west of Nowra) at 3:15pm http://t.co/kDZjT3WXrq pic.twitter.com/1jEaClfo5t \u2014 ABC Emergency (@ABCemergency) December 25, 2014\n\nThe State Emergency Service advises that people should:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-weather-storm-moves-in-on-christmas-day-20141225-12dqv5.html", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/2/d/p/n/d/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.12dqv5.png/1419489406672.jpg", "site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "title": "Sydney weather: storm moves in on Christmas Day"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/2/d/p/n/d/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.12dqv5.png/1419489406672.jpg"}, "site": "@smh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sydney weather: storm moves in on Christmas Day"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf8e\"", "article_summary": "Christmas Day has been sticky, hot and humid in Sydney, with a max of 28 degrees in the city and 31 in Paramatta.\nThe State Emergency Services had received more than 30 phone calls by 5pm, mostly of fallen branches and toppled trees, some which have taken out powerlines.\nWollongong, Nowra, Orange, Goulburn, Dubbo and Parkes were likely to take the brunt of the storm and faced the possibility of flash flooding.\nLightning strikes have taken out train signalling systems in Penrith, Bellambi and Bulli, affecting Blue Mountains and South Coast rail services.\nSanta lifesaver Scott Williams, 52, takes a picture of friends at south Cronulla beach before the storms came through."}
