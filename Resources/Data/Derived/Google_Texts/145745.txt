After five days on the run, a beaver on display in the Kansas Wildlife Exhibit at Riverside Park returned to his enclosure all on his own.

Chappa, a three-year-old beaver escaped his enclosure on Tuesday, April 7. Over 50 tips from the public came into the Kansas Wildlife Exhibit saying they had spotted Chappa.

Staffers at the exhibit knew that Chappa had made a temporary home near some boat docks near the exhibit and were waiting to see if he would come home or if they could catch him.

Chappa did come home early Sunday morning. He was spotted digging around his enclosure, trying to get back in.

"I was in tears I was so happy and he just kind of follow me back into his house," said Kristen Kelley, a volunteer at the Kansas Wildlife Exhibit.

Kelley opened the gate to let Chappa back into his exhibit, and the beaver followed her, much like a pet, and went back into his exhibit.
