The Kremlin maintains that Crimea was Russian land and its status non-negotiable.\n\nRussian Deputy Finance Minister Alexi Moiseev, who met officials in Beijing on Thursday, also said that China and Russia could reach an accord on common financial infrastructure by year-end.\n\nPANDA BONDS IN RUSSIA?\n\nShvetsov, in his Beijing meetings, also raised the possibility of Russia issuing panda, or yuan-denominated bonds, in China.\n\n\"According to their understanding, it's easier and faster,\" Shvetsov said. \"It\u2019s a new idea and it's necessary to understand what it means.\"\n\nIn December, South Korea became the first government to issue a sovereign panda bond when it sold 3 billion yuan ($463 million) in three-year bonds in China's interbank market.\n\nDiscussions are continuing on creating a link that would facilitate sales of yuan-denominated debt in Moscow that Chinese investors could have access to, said Shvetsov.\n\nIssuing panda bonds in China would be easier and could be accomplished this year, he added.\n\nRussia said last year it was hoping to issue at least $1 billion of the so-called OFZ bonds, which are the main treasury bonds used to finance Russian government borrowing on the domestic market, in yuan in 2016.\n\n\"The idea to place OFZ is to place a benchmark for the further placement of corporate bonds,\" Shvetsov added. \"If the placement is on the Shanghai exchange, of course we can create this benchmark, but I'm not sure our corporate borrowers can follow the way of (Russia's finance ministry) and place panda bonds.\"\n\n(Editing by Richard Borsuk)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/18/Russian-talks-China-finance-links-very-productive", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Russia and China may sign an agreement as early as next month allo", "title": "Russian talks with China on finance links 'very productive'"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/18/Russian-talks-China-finance-links-very-productive", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Russia and China may sign an agreement as early as next month allo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"The idea to place OFZ is to place a benchmark for the further placement of corporate bonds,\" Shvetsov added.\nIssuing panda bonds in China would be easier and could be accomplished this year, he added.\nShvetsov, in his Beijing meetings, also raised the possibility of Russia issuing panda, or yuan-denominated bonds, in China.\nPANDA BONDS IN RUSSIA?\n\"If the placement is on the Shanghai exchange, of course we can create this benchmark, but I'm not sure our corporate borrowers can follow the way of (Russia's finance ministry) and place panda bonds.\""}
