After admitting that \"There's little polling\" on these matters, Steiger found one poll from 2012 that showed the flat tax was 10 points more popular with men than with women.\"\n\nSteiger uses similar polls showing women support a path to citizenship and gun control to show that Cruz's views are somehow harmful to the gender.\n\nNote to Think Progress: Just because you don't agree with someone doesn't mean they are actively trying to hurt you.\n\nWhen it comes to Cruz's foreign policy on Iran and data collection, Steiger really has to stretch. She points to polls showing women being less enthusiastic about the issues than men to support her claim that Cruz is against women.\n\nCruz's popular opinion that Common Core is a terrible policy is also evidence that the Texas senator hates women, according to Steiger. Why? Because even though just 17 percent of Americans approve of Common Core, they're wrong, according to Steiger. And therefore Cruz is wrong. And therefore Cruz hates women. Or something.\n\nYou would think Steiger would have a reasonable left-wing case for Cruz being unpopular with women based on his positions on abortion and same-sex marriage, but not exactly. Steiger admits that just 50 percent of women identify as pro-choice, meaning the other 50 percent either identify as pro-life or don't adhere to labels. And 55 percent of women supporting same-sex marriage isn't exactly a run away loss for Cruz. (Also, abortion and same-sex marriage rarely even register on the list of Americans' top priorities.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The liberal website Think Progress is out with a hit piece claiming Sen.
