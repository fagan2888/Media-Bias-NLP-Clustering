The first reads \u201cHealth Law to Return to High Court\u201d. The second major story is titled \u201cU.S. to Double Force Aiding Iraqis\u201d.\n\nEvidently a conservative group called The Competitive Enterprise Institute has challenged what amounts to 5 words out of the 10,535 pages of Obamacare regulations (approximately 11,588,500 words). The Supreme Court will hear the case. In effect, the 5 words under consideration (most likely an oversight or even perhaps a clerical error), states that subsidies are available only to policies bought on a state exchange.\n\nTwo thirds of the states opted to utilize a federal exchange. Nearly 5 million people have purchased subsidized insurance in states using the federal exchange. If the Supreme Court votes in favor of the challenge, which would mean that the highest court in the country would, in effect, be enforcing the letter of the law, and not it\u2019s intent, then a major underpinning of the law would be ripped asunder and likely cause the whole thing to collapse.\n\nGiven the current lineup in the Supreme Court, odds are quite high they will move to destroy the law.\n\nThe other story discusses a recent Obama Administration decision to send as many as 1,500 troops to Iraq, costing us tax payers as much as $5.6 billion dollars. This is just a short term budget of course, since this move also deepens our commitment to fight the Islamic State. These reinforcements would bring the total U.S. force in Iraq to 3,100. Evidently these troops would not be allowed to engage in combat, therefore they are not technically considered \u201cboots on the ground\u201d. Yea, right.\n\nThe government giveth, the government taketh away. Obamacare, although certainly not perfect (I personally believe that a single-payer system is the only sustainable option). However Obamacare is a start. It has allowed 10.3 million people to get insurance that were previously uncovered.\n\nBut hey, why should our tax dollars be used for something that directly benefits the public (and us tax payers), when it can be used to blow up people, buildings, and assets in some distant land.\n\nWar, war, give us some more,\n\nThat\u2019s what our tax dollars are really for\n\nFor our society, and probably for the world, we\u2019d all be better off taking our IRS tax dollars out to the front curb and lighting them on fire.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3463\"", "article_summary": "War, war, give us some more,That\u2019s what our tax dollars are really forFor our society, and probably for the world, we\u2019d all be better off taking our IRS tax dollars out to the front curb and lighting them on fire.\nBut hey, why should our tax dollars be used for something that directly benefits the public (and us tax payers), when it can be used to blow up people, buildings, and assets in some distant land.\nThe other story discusses a recent Obama Administration decision to send as many as 1,500 troops to Iraq, costing us tax payers as much as $5.6 billion dollars.\nGiven the current lineup in the Supreme Court, odds are quite high they will move to destroy the law.\nThe Supreme Court will hear the case."}
