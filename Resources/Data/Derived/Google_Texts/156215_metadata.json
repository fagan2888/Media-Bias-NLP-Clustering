And Skype your doctor when either happens. That\u2019s the future of medicine on the Main Line and elsewhere, thanks to technological advances, forward-thinking doctors, and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs the ACA approaches its first birthday, much of the ongoing critique will focus on how many people have new or better health insurance. But that\u2019s only part of the analysis of how Obamacare is changing American healthcare and improving patient care. It\u2019s family and primary-care physicians, internists, and pediatricians who make up the front lines of medicine and serve as entry points into the system.\n\nAnd, right now, it\u2019s fair to say that the field of primary care isn\u2019t in the best health. Patients may love their doctors, but they\u2019re often dissatisfied with the way their practices are run. As it turns out, so are doctors. Long waits and short appointments aren\u2019t fun for anyone. There\u2019s also the clearinghouse aspect of managing interaction with specialists. Consider that, according to the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a single primary-care provider typically coordinates with 229 physicians in 117 practices.\n\nAnd primary-care physicians make less money than specialists. A 2013 survey showed that the average annual salary for PCPs (internists, pediatricians and family-medicine practitioners) is $176,000 less than that of specialists. That imbalance is one of the reasons fewer medical students are choosing to go into primary care.\n\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges reports a distinct lack of PCPs in the United States. That shortage will amount to a deficit of 45,400 PCPs by 2020.\n\nDr. Christie Mousaw\n\nAnd yet, primary care is the corner-stone of our healthcare system, says Dr. Christie Mousaw of Brinton Lake Family Medicine in Glen Mills. \u201cI believe we need a broad system in place to provide an entry point to our med-ical system,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are many millions of people who don\u2019t have the privilege of coming into an office regularly, or at all. They go to ERs for care. That has been overwhelming emergency care and disserving patients. They need robust primary-care services that involve preventative screenings and management of chronic diseases.\u201d\n\nThat more Americans now have health insurance means that more of them are getting primary care. Mousaw\u2019s practice has seen an influx of new patients and new insurance policies. Other local doctors report the same thing.\n\nBut adding new patients creates a backlog\u2014hence, the niche urgent-care centers are attempting to fill with walk-in appointments and extended hours. \u201cBut while urgent-care centers can provide adequate remedies for colds, the flu, and basic services like stitches, patients really need those all-important preventative screenings, continuity of care, and long-term management of chronic diseases,\u201d says Dr. John Munshower of Family Physicians at Middletown in Media.\n\nDr. Alan Zweben\n\nBut aren\u2019t appointments with PCPs getting harder and harder to come by? \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with that by changing the processes of managing patients,\u201d says Mousaw. \u201cWe\u2019re restructuring it to have a team-based approach that includes nurse practitioners.\u201d\n\nThat approach also includes hospitalists\u2014internal-medicine physicians who only handle inpatient care. Their rise has transformed primary care over the past five years, according to Dr. Alan Zweben of Internal Medicine Associates in Upland. While his practice does not yet use hospitalists, Zweben explains how they interact with primary care physicians. \u201cIf one of my patients gets sick enough to be hospitalized, I admit him and transfer his care to the hospitalist,\u201d says Zweben. \u201cI\u2019m aware of everything that\u2019s happening, but I don\u2019t go to the hospital to treat him. Hospitalists are there on-site, all day and night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a matter of time, space and economics. \u201cI can\u2019t be in two places at once, and my patients need me in the office,\u201d Zweben says. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t have to interrupt their care to rush to the hospital. These days, most primary-care physicians don\u2019t set foot inside\n\na hospital.\u201d\n\nDr. John Munshower\n\nValue Over Volume\n\nTime, space and economics are also factors in the renewed emphasis on preventative care\u2014a direct result of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThe trend is now from volume to value,\u201d says Munshower. \u201cIn the past, to maintain adequate payments, we\u2019d have to see more people to make more money. But the government now incentivizes physicians to provide value to existing patients, which is what we want to do anyway.\u201d\n\nAs an example, Munshower points to Medicare\u2019s wellness visits. For decades, Medicare didn\u2019t cover annual physicals for people over 65. \u201cThey\u2019re not really physicals, but screenings that help us prevent future medical problems,\u201d Munshower says. \u201cWe give patients questionnaires about their safety at home to prevent falls, a memory test, a depression screening, and other health maintenance. Medicare now covers all of that.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about the government providing more coverage. PCPs have to up their game in order to up their reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid and other insurers. It has to do with certification from NCQA, a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the system by resolving its inefficiencies. Hospitals, physicians and their practices receive NCQA ratings\u2014and the higher the rating, the higher the reimbursements. That incentive has created real change, according to NCQA data. \u201cEvery year for the past five years, these numbers have improved,\u201d states a 2014 report. \u201cHealthcare protocols have been refined, doctors have learned new ways to practice, and patients have become more engaged in their care. Those improvements in quality care translate into lives saved, illnesses avoided, and costs reduced.\u201d\n\nMunshower and his practice have NCQA Level 3 certification\u2014the highest available. They earned it by investing time, creativity and money into improving patient care. Much of that involves the application of technology, from seemingly simple things like emailing patients to having the ability to video-chat with them.\n\n\u201cMeaningful\u201d Technology\n\n\u201cMeaningful use\u201d is Obamacare lingo for technologies that improve patient care and make the system more efficient. And, yes, there\u2019s actually a government-approved list. It includes medical-record and patient-physician email systems that meet HIPAA guidelines and security requirements. As of now, Main Line Health, Nemours Children\u2019s Health System and Crozer-Keystone Health System all use both. \u201cOne of the improvements that I\u2019m most proud of is our email portal,\u201d says Mousaw. \u201cOur patients now email us to ask questions, get referrals, and report their blood sugar. And I respond the same day.\u201d\n\n\u201cTelemedicine\u201d videoconferencing is the next step for Brinton Lake Family Medicine. Doctors can use it to diagnose rashes, monitor medication and screen for depression.\n\nBrinton Lake isn\u2019t the only practice working toward these capabilities. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring a plan to incorporate telemedicine as a service to our patients, offering visits for certain conditions that can be safely handled from the convenience of the home or workplace,\u201d says Grant Gegwich, Crozer-Keystone\u2019s vice president of public relations and marketing.\n\nAt Nemours duPont Pediatrics, physicians who work in the Main Line area can now videoconference with pediatric specialists at Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Del., for instant assistance in potentially life-threatening situations. \u201cIt\u2019s called Nemours CareConnect,\u201d says Chris Manning, Nemours\u2019 senior manager for public and media relations.\n\nThe system is up and running in the emergency departments at Bryn Mawr, Phoenixville and Paoli hospitals, along with the neonatal intensive care units at Bryn Mawr and Phoenixville, and the inpatient pediatrics unit at Bryn Mawr.\n\nDr. Kelli Yacono\n\nThe Medical Maverick\n\nStepping away from one of the Main Line\u2019s largest and most successful primary-care practices wasn\u2019t easy, but Dr. Kelli Yacono realized she could practice medicine better if she did it herself. With a laptop, a phone and a secure Internet connection, Yacono is creating a new model for primary care.\n\nOpened in February 2014, Yacono\u2019s Innovative Medical Associates in Bryn Mawr offers primary care, pharmacist consultations to manage medications, healthy-lifestyle coaching, and nonsurgical cosmetic procedures like microdermabrasion and BOTOX. She accepts health insurance and offers annual memberships that include a variety of medical, lifestyle and aesthetic services.\n\nPerhaps the most unique aspect of Yacono\u2019s practice: Patients can text, videoconference, email or call her. \u201cI decided to structure my practice so patients\u2014who are, in the end, consumers\u2014can have access to their physician,\u201d she says.\n\nYacono has a \u201ctechie guy\u201d and a lawyer who provided guidance about HIPAA compliance and other issues. Still, she created her texting and email portals rather easily\u2014and video chats were a snap.\n\nBut is there ever a problem with Yacono being too available to her patients? \u201cMy friends who are doctors thought patients would be harassing me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now that they know they can get in touch with me, they don\u2019t overuse the system. Patients don\u2019t have to call me three times because their first call is returned.\u201d\n\nAnd if patients are too sick to come to her, Yacono even makes house calls. Nonetheless, she cringes at the newfangled term, \u201cconcierge medicine.\u201d After all, the technology may be modern, but the basis for her practice is quite traditional.\n\n\u201cThe doctor-patient relationship is at the heart of medicine,\u201d says Yacono. \u201cI want patients to have access to me. It improves their health, short-term and long-term\u2014and that\u2019s rewarding for me. It\u2019s why I got into medicine.\u201d\n\nDr. Maureen McMahon\n\nThe Four Biggest Threats to Your Family\u2019s Health (and Ebola Isn\u2019t One of Them)\n\n1. Obesity. It remains at the top of America\u2019s chronic illnesses, and it\u2019s still one of the most deadly. \u201cBeing overweight increases the risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and arthritis,\u201d says Dr. John Munshower. \u201cIt even effects mental health.\u201d\n\n2. Lack of sleep. Dr. Maureen McMahon sees an epidemic of fatigue in her patients. \u201cThe quantity and the quality of sleep create good sleep health, and too many kids don\u2019t have it,\u201d says McMahon, who practices at Nemours duPont Pediatrics, Villanova. \u201cIt plays a huge role in how kids grow, how much they weigh, how they think and behave, and in how they feel about themselves. There\u2019s no videogame, text or TV show that\u2019s more important than kids going to bed at a reasonable hour and getting a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d\n\n3. Putting off screenings. \u201cGuidelines for when people should get screenings [exist] for a very good reason: That\u2019s when the first signs of disease can be detected,\u201d says Munshower. \u201cThe earlier we catch it, the better we can fight it. Please, please get those tests.\u201d\n\n4. All of the above and more, all at the same time. Dr. Alan Zweben sees an unfortunate uptick in patients suffering from a combination of chronic illnesses\u2014many of them caused by lifestyle choices. \u201cI started in practice 30 years ago, and back then, it was unusual to see a 90-year-old woman or an 80-year-old man,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, I may see three of each per day\u2014but they have high blood pressure, diabetes and other diseases. I guess the good news is that people are living longer, in spite of these problems.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Brinton Lake Family Medicine\r\nMain Line Health\r\nBOTOX\r\nDr. Christie Mousaw\r\nNemours Children\u2019s Health System\r\nCrozer-Keystone Health System \r\nObamacare\r\nHealthcare\r\nDR.
