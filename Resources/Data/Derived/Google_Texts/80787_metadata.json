If Democrats are forced by the court to follow the law they wrote, then 36 states that aren\u2019t interested in hosting federal \u201cexchanges\u201d would no longer be forced to do so and, consequently, the American Dream would be shattered.\n\nSo, needless to say, the pending Supreme Court challenge over the Affordable Care Act via King v. Burwell is the most significant decisions since Hobby Lobby or perhaps Citizens United \u2013 or whenever the last time it was the world was going to come tumbling down around us. And while pretending that the legal challenge is laughably weak \u2013 a politically motivated charade that has absolutely no chance of success \u2013 most left-wing pundits who\u2019ve weighed in on the matter feel oddly compelled to urge SCOTUS to contemplate a whole host of factors that have nothing to do with the law.\n\nHere is The Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent laying out the case:\n\nThe reason this matters: Highlighting the potential for such a SCOTUS decision to result in widespread disruptions and dire consequences \u2014 both for millions who might lose coverage and for the insurance and health care industry in these states \u2014 may figure heavily in the government\u2019s strategy for winning the case. Now, it\u2019s possible that expected swing vote John Roberts won\u2019t bother considering such disruptions and consequences in reaching his decision. But who knows \u2014 he just might. And the stakes continue to grow.\n\nWidespread disruptions and dire consequences. Chilling stuff. Obviously, the court isn\u2019t immune from the vagaries of political life. It\u2019s unfortunate, but, no doubt, a permanent feature of any court that\u2019s populated with human beings. Even a number of Republicans and libertarians have argued that a replacement health-care bill would make it easier for the court to act. This may well be true. But there is enormous difference between a justice holding an ideological or legal outlook and one surrendering to the politics day. Liberals are hoping they can make the latter a reality.\n\nMost bothersome, though, is the fact that the Left doesn\u2019t even bother pretending that the Constitution is more important than acts of progressive righteousness. We see it with left-wing groups openly pushing for more executive actions that directly circumvent legislative process. We see it with King v. Burwell, as well. Justice Roberts will have blood on his hands if he undermines progress \u2013 never mind the case. That this is the sort of reasoning that \u201cmight weigh heavily in the government\u2019s strategy for winning\u201d in the case is a depressing commentary on that government\u2019s contempt for the court.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached a point where liberals not only argue that empathy (well, selective empathy, as you might imagine) should play a leading role in legal decisions, but that the Court should avoiding disrupting any laws that are driven by progressive notions of compassion. You know, because of the \u201cconsequences.\u201d And since progressives treat all their reforms as consecrated acts of charity, this would create a rather convenient legal environment for them.\n\nBut, of course, they don\u2019t really want justices to use their own moral discretion. What if, for instance, a majority of justices believed that it was Obamacare that was the most disruptive force in the country today? What if they believed ridding America of the ACA would benefit most Americans? If the justices defused Obamacare, think of all the disrupting taxes and regulations they would be saving citizens from. What if justices reasoned that killing Obamacare was the most compassionate thing to do? Would the Left still argue that that they should worry about consequences \u2013 or would their position become \u201cpolitical\u201d?\n\nIncidentally, where were all these concerns about disruptions and consequences when a fleeting majority unilaterally stuffed a major reform down the throats of all Americans?", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 07 Jan 2015 07:51:42 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The Left doesn\u2019t even bother pretending that the Constitution is more important than acts of progressive righteousness.", "title": "Progressives To SCOTUS: Do The Right Thing And Ignore The Constitution", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/SCOTUS-1024x717.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-07T07:52:07+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/01/07/progressives-to-scotus-do-the-right-thing-and-ignore-the-constitution/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "The Left doesn\u2019t even bother pretending that the Constitution is more important than acts of progressive righteousness.", "creator": "@davidharsanyi", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/SCOTUS-1024x717.jpg"}, "title": "Progressives To SCOTUS: Do The Right Thing And Ignore The Constitution", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,American Dream,Greg Sargent,John Roberts,King v.
