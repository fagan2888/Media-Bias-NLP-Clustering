Florida mom who didn't realize she was pregnant until 3rd trimester delivers 14-pound baby boy.

A Florida woman who delivered a 14.1-pound baby says she didn't know she was pregnant until her third trimester.

Officials at St. Joseph's Women's Hospital in Tampa say Maxxzandra Ford delivered her son, Avery, on Jan. 29. The say the infant is the heaviest born at the hospital, and one of the largest-ever born in the state.

Ford tells television stations WFLA and WFTS that after rapidly gaining weight last fall, doctors confirmed she was 35 weeks into her pregnancy. Ford said she initially thought she was having twins.

After 18 hours of labor, Ford naturally delivered Avery, who remains in neonatal intensive care but is expected to go home soon.

Ford, who also has a 1-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter, says she "just melted" when she finally held Avery.
