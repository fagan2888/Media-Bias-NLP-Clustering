Fire officials are working to determine the exact cause of a fire that destroyed the Camp Aldrich Conference Center in Barton County.

Camp staff reported the fire early Saturday morning. Officials with Barton County Community College said the building was not in use at the time and no injuries were reported.

BCCC Vice President Dr. Penny Quinn thanked firefighters "...who quickly responded and kept the fire contained." President Dr. Carl Heilman says that board of trustees will work quickly to get the camp operating again.

The cause is under investigation, and a damage estimate has yet to be determined. Officials are not sure if the building is salvageable.

The community college-owned camp is about 14 miles northeast of Great Bend.
