Bernie Sanders had forwarded unrealistic proposals on college tuition and healthcare, two key differences between the Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nIn a lengthy speech at a labor union headquarters downtown, Clinton also mocked the behavior of the Republican presidential candidates and asserted that his wife has the best command of both foreign and domestic policy to grasp the job he held for eight years.\n\nThe former president isolated two major points of contention between Hillary Clinton and Sanders, though he referred to Sanders only as \u201cher opponent.\u201d (He praised both candidates \u2014 this time by name \u2014 when he later discussed their reactions to the water contamination in Flint.)\n\nSee the most-read stories this hour >>\n\nSanders has proposed free tuition for everyone attending state colleges and universities, on the grounds that a college education is as necessary now for a good job as a high school diploma once was. Clinton has argued for an income-based plan that would allow students to graduate debt-free but would not allow wealthier families to have their tuition covered by taxpayers.\n\nBill Clinton told campaign volunteers \u2014 with the expectation that they would pass it on to undecided voters \u2014 that Sanders\u2019 plan would not help students at private colleges, including historically black colleges, and would encourage schools to raise tuition knowing that the costs would be borne by taxpayers. He also said it was unfair for wealthy families to be subsidized.\n\n\u201cWe need upper [income] people to step up for the same reason that Willie Sutton robbed the banks: That\u2019s where the money is,\u201d he said. He also repeated the Democratic front-runner\u2019s call for students to be able to refinance past debt, as they would a mortgage, currently forbidden by law.\n\n\u201cThink of what this means. It means you can move out of your parents\u2019 house,\u201d he said to laughter from younger volunteers in the crowd. \u201cIt means if you dream of opening your own bakery, you can go down to the bank and your credit won\u2019t be compromised.\u201d\n\nOn healthcare, Clinton said Sanders\u2019 proposal for a universal, Medicare-for-all system was unworkable because of the Republican hold on Congress \u2014 and that seeking it would undercut Obamacare, which has driven coverage levels up to 90%.\n\n\u201cHer position is, \u2018Hey it\u2019s going to be a lot easier to go from 90 to 100 and tackle the problems that are real,\u2019\u201d he said, citing high costs for drugs, high co-payments and difficulties faced by small businesses as areas needing improvement. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot easier than fighting and scratching and trying to go from zero to 100,\u201d he said.\n\nHe seemed to bridle at Sanders\u2019 criticism of Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan as insufficiently robust.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s 'a little reform' to take Hillary\u2019s position that we can get to 100%,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will work, that\u2019s all there is. That\u2019s a very big piece of business and we should do that.\u201d\n\nClinton did not discuss the issue of trade, which Sanders has made an important part of his campaign in Michigan. Sanders has argued that the North American Free Trade Agreement, one of Bill Clinton\u2019s signature presidential achievements, contributed to the dramatic decline in manufacturing and other jobs in the state and others like it. Sanders has criticized Hillary Clinton\u2019s support of NAFTA and other trade deals.\n\nSee more of our top stories on Facebook >>\n\nThe former president did, however, reiterate his wife's proposal that companies moving offshore be assessed an \u201cexit tax,\u201d whose proceeds would be invested in creating American jobs.\n\nHillary Clinton has also proposed that companies that receive tax breaks from the government be required to pay them back if they try to move out of the country. In commercials running in Michigan, she has cited the case of Johnson Controls, a Midwestern auto supplier that benefited from the auto bailout at the height of the recession but has recently announced plans to move its headquarters to Ireland.\n\n\u201cYou look pretty rich going out there and saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got my hand out, please save my job,\u2019 and now that you have, \u2018I think I will go to Ireland where the tax rate is about a third of what it is here,\u2019\u201d Clinton said. \u201cJohnson Controls would say, \u2018Well, but your corporate tax rate\u2019s so high.\u2019 Maybe, so let them work for corporate tax reform, not run off after we bailed them out.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton family campaign operation will expand Sunday, with daughter Chelsea Clinton arriving in Michigan. The candidate will appear Sunday night with Sanders at a Democratic debate in Flint.\n\nFor political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker .
