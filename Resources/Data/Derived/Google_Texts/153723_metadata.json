I\u2019m pretty happy about my unemployment numbers. They prove I\u2019ve saved America from the Bush recession. I gotta remind my pencil-pushers to keep tweaking unemployment reports so they look even better. And mention the ongoing success of my $900 billion stimulus program. Or was it $1 trillion? Can\u2019t remember exactly.\n\nBig problem for my legacy if sleepwalkers figure out that I shrunk the U.S. manufacturing sector and expanded the number of unemployed or underemployed to 92 million people. I gotta tell Nancy (Pelosi) to make sure everybody practices their talkin\u2019 points about the value of workin\u2019 only 30 hours a week. Yessiree, hard-workin\u2019 Americans deserve more free time to \u201cfind their inner joy,\u201d like takin\u2019 up finger paintin\u2019 or makin\u2019 pots or smokin\u2019 it.\n\nJOBS AND UNEMPLOYMENT:\n\nDear Diary. I ordered my team at the Center for American Progress to draft additional taxation and regulation programs to encourage corporations to move off shore. Then I can deflect responsibility and decry the \u201cunpatriotic\u201d CEOs who desert their country to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. I won\u2019t credit them for furthering my \u201credistribution of wealth agenda\u201d to help other countries and make America an equal partner in making the world a better place for everyone.\n\nHEALTHCARE:\n\nDear Diary. Gruber was right. Americans are too stupid to figure out the truth about Obamacare (I gotta admit, I love the name). Good thing they didn\u2019t catch on to my scam before the law was passed. (Forest Gump was right: \u201cStupid is as stupid does.\u201d) When millions of poor and unemployed citizens, along with millions of illegals, flood into the healthcare system, everybody pays more. It\u2019s the American way.\n\nIt\u2019s gettin\u2019 hard to find time (in between my golf and my vacations) to hit the campaign trail and promote my health care exchanges that funnel citizens into Medicaid. But, on a positive note, long wait times in Medicaid clinics give sick people lotsa time to text friends and play games on their Obamaphones.\n\nI gotta make sure everybody understands the efficiency of computerized medical records and six-minute office visits with foreign-trained doctors or nurse practitioners. And what about those generic drugs from China? Practically free for everybody\u2026 except those high-upkeep old folks. Oh well, no problem there. Bootin\u2019 them out of the system redistributes millions of dollars and creates a whole bunch of shovel-ready jobs!\n\nENTITLEMENTS:\n\nDear Diary. My food stamp program has expanded on target. The price tag of $78 billion taxpayer dollars isn\u2019t a problem, even though middle class folks are grumbling about higher taxes and 30-hour work weeks. I\u2019m tellin\u2019 \u2019um to sign up for welfare, disability, and child care subsidy programs so my government can help pay their bills. No problem paying for additional entitlements. The Fed\u2019ll just print more money.\n\nI\u2019m also thinkin\u2019 it\u2019s the right of all Americans (and foreign-born who come across our borders) to receive college educations, even if most of \u2019um don\u2019t graduate. If everybody applied for college education loans, that might create a financial bubble \u2014 but maybe not. Graduates could come to work for me in government jobs or, if they got the skills, become Starbucks baristas.\n\nRACIAL TENSIONS:\n\nDear Diary. Rev. Al Sharpton is doin\u2019 a bang-up job of keeping racial injustice in the minds of all Americans. Sharpton has convinced me it\u2019s a positive move to protect the New Black Panthers, the military arm of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), even when they instigate riots that cause looting and burning down Ferguson. They\u2019re calling attention to the inequality of opportunity for my black brothers and sisters. CNN and MSNBC are on the job and covering events 24/7. But if the right-wing media continues to harp about \u201crampant criminality\u201d in the black community, and bring up the black-on-black murder toll in Chicago, I\u2019ll just repeat the truth: \u201cIt\u2019s those rascal teens just doing their thing in the \u2019hood.\u201d\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nDear Diary. I got a big speech planned for the teachers\u2019 union. Need to praise \u2019um for keepin\u2019 kids safe and off the streets by warehousing \u2019um in failing schools.\n\nIt\u2019s no big deal that American students, internationally, rank 25th in math, 17th in science, and 14th in reading.\n\nIf the disadvantaged and uneducated youth survive their teen years and become unemployable adults, they can sign up and become career soldiers in my civilian militia.\n\nILLEGAL ALIENS:\n\nDear Diary. It\u2019s patriotic for American taxpayers to cover the cost of education and healthcare for everyone who qualifies for my amnesty program. Even if it costs over $1 trillion a year. No problem. I\u2019ll shift dollars saved from the defense and VA healthcare budgets. And here\u2019s a real plus: If my travel and school records ever see the light of day and reveal my Indonesian citizenship, it won\u2019t be a problem. I\u2019ll be protected under my own amnesty executive order.\n\nBEAUCRATIC ISSUES:\n\nDear Diary.\n\nVeteran Healthcare issues are a pain in the neck. Until I figure out how to blame Bush, or somebody else, I\u2019m tellin\u2019 my media lapdogs to lay off. I\u2019ll stick with my bonus policy for managers who keep false records that delay, deny, and allow vets to die. Besides, like I said, vets oughta\u2019 pay for their own healthcare since they volunteered. I\u2019m just sayin\u2019.\n\nMy National Security Agency (NSA) is doin\u2019 a good job of capturing citizen telephone calls and emails. Like Valerie says, this makes it easy to find my enemies (like Tea Party people and seniors) so I can round \u2019um up in case of a national emergency (which I can create at any time).\n\nThe IRS continues to thwart activities of my political opposition. But there\u2019s a little glitch: Lois Lerner\u2019s uncovered emails. I gotta pass the word along that if she writes a \u201ctell all\u201d book, she\u2019ll pay for it in a special place that offers three hots and a cot (prison).\n\nThe DOJ (Department of Justice) and Eric Holder are gettin\u2019 to be as unpopular as me. Ob-Seuss-ed citizens don\u2019t trust him. Just the other day Valerie showed me a petition that said:\n\nGo away Holder, \u201cThug-I-Am.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t like your radical talk and racial flim-flam.\n\nTake your memory loss, lies, and hatred and scram, scram, scram.\n\nWe don\u2019t trust Holder, \u201cThug-I-Am.\u201d\n\nMaybe I gotta take him off my list of potential Supreme Court nominees. Hillary might like the job since she\u2019s probably not gonna become the Democrat\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nFOREIGN POLICY:\n\nDear Diary. Hillary refuses to fall on her sword and take me off the hook for the Benghazi coverup, or the failure of the Russian reset, or abandonment of Poland\u2019s missile defense system, or friendly overtures to Palestine terrorists, or throwing Israel under the bus, or destabilizing Libya and Egypt. Obviously Princess Pantsuit is strugglin\u2019 to win public approval. I got a feelin\u2019 somebody\u2019s gonna leak damaging information to Americans who don\u2019t like Obamacare. Just wait \u2019til they get a taste of Hillarycare\u2026 Gestapo-lite.\n\nMy current Secretary of State, that doofus John Kerry, continues to follow my orders and demand easing sanctions against Iran. He\u2019s gonna organize a very private welcome-to-the-nuclear-club party for the Ayatollahs. I\u2019ve ordered him to continue yak, yak, yaking about my policies that embolden Muslim terrorists as they seize greater control of the Mid-East. That Massachusetts dinosaur turned out to be the perfect choice to replace Hillary at the State Department.\n\nSINK LIBERTY:\n\nDear Diary. I need to beef up my inner circle and add more liberal twits who always agree with me since Moochelle, Valerie and Susan Rice have lost their credibility. I gotta include more Muslim Brotherhood pals, members, commies, socialists, union leaders and Chicago sewer fighters who walk the walk and talk the Saul Alinsky rules that keep America on track for fundamental transformation.\n\nIt\u2019s time for me to pull the plug on liberty once and for all. I\u2019m gonna order my inner circle to draft up executive orders that make all gun ownership illegal, politically incorrect speech a federal crime, and allow me to seize control of the internet. I\u2019ll adopt the green agenda 100% and launch Cap \u2019n Trade to force more backbreaking taxes on middle class citizens who breathe, own small businesses and farm animals\u2026 especially farting cows.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nSo, dear reader, ask yourself:\n\nAre we the stupid Sam-I-Ams?\n\nA-OK with Barry\u2019s scams?\n\nWill we relinquish freedom\u2019s last stand?\n\nAnd bid adieu to Uncle Sam?\n\nOr, Will We-the-People heed the words of Abraham Lincoln?\n\nHe meant what he said,\n\nAnd said what he meant,\n\nAmerica is liberty\u2019s last best hope\u2026 100%.\n\nP.S.
