He also has vowed to reject any bill imposing additional economic sanctions on Iran.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s 12 veto threats represent a 30-year high. No other president in recent times has signaled the use of his veto pen so often in the early days of a congressional session.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama sets record for veto threats in State of the Union address\n\nMr. Obama set another record last month by pledging during his State of the Union address to veto four bills. No other president has issued so many veto warnings during a speech to Congress.\n\nThe president has maintained that aggressive posture. At a White House meeting last week, he told a group of illegal immigrants that he would stop a Republican-backed bill to partially defund the Department of Homeland Security. The measure would block funding for Mr. Obama\u2019s executive action halting deportations for millions of illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cI want to be as clear as possible: I will veto any legislation that comes to my desk that took away the chance of these young people who grew up here, and who are prepared to contribute to this country, that would prevent them from doing so,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI\u2019m confident I can uphold that veto.\u201d\n\nThe practice of formal veto threats, delivered through White House documents known as \u201cstatements of administration policy,\u201d began with the Reagan White House in 1985. Mr. Obama has issued 11 such statements from Jan. 3 through Sunday, in addition to a verbal threat on proposed sanctions against Iran.\n\nOther presidents in similarly precarious political positions \u2014 with their parties taking huge losses in midterm elections \u2014 have come nowhere close to Mr. Obama\u2019s level of veto threats.\n\nIn 2007, President George W. Bush issued three formal veto threats from Jan. 3 to Feb. 8, according to records compiled by the American Presidency Project and Samuel Kernell, a scholar at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nIn 1995, after Democrats were thrashed in the 1994 midterms, President Clinton issued no veto threats during the first five weeks of the year, though he did issue dozens over the two-year congressional session.\n\nPresident Reagan in 1987 came closest to Mr. Obama\u2019s pace by issuing six veto threats from Jan. 3 to Feb. 8 after Democrats gained seats in the House and captured control of the Senate in the 1986 midterm elections.\n\nBy taking a more hard-line approach than his predecessors, Mr. Obama is trying to prove he won\u2019t go quietly and is seeking to fend off the \u201clame duck\u201d label that is typically attached to presidents during their final two years in office, political analysts say.\n\nRepublicans see a political upside in forcing the president\u2019s hand on a range of issues.\n\n\u201cThe GOP has big incentives to make the point that they are trying to force changes. Obama has big incentives to make the point that he is not going to be rolled over easily. At some point, it\u2019s just a game of chicken,\u201d said John Woolley, a political science professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and co-director of the American Presidency Project, which tracks data on each presidential administration.\n\nRepublicans have expressed public frustration with the White House\u2019s veto threats. In late January, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, said Mr. Obama should learn from Reagan and Mr. Clinton, both of whom worked with the opposing party to secure major legislative achievements.\n\n\u201cOur government is divided. No one gets 100 percent of what they want,\u201d Mr. McCarthy told CBS News. \u201cThe president wants to work with us? We\u2019ve only been here 2 weeks and he\u2019s put seven veto threats [on the table]. I think that\u2019s probably not the best start.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama also has said he will veto legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a measure to change the federal permitting processes for natural gas pipelines and a bill to add restrictions on any taxpayer funding for abortion.\n\nWhile Republicans control both chambers of Congress, it\u2019s unclear whether any of the bills could garner enough votes to override a veto, which requires a two-thirds majority in the House and the Senate.\n\nEven measures with strong bipartisan support, such as the legislation approving Keystone, don\u2019t appear to have enough support to overcome vetoes.\n\nSome political analysts say Mr. Obama, while pursuing a different strategy at the outset of a congressional session, may reduce his veto threats once he feels he has regained some level of control over debates in Washington.\n\n\u201cThere are historically more veto threats in a divided government, but it doesn\u2019t usually come all at once,\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston who has written on presidential leadership. \u201cWhen presidents feel like they\u2019re boxed in politically and when they feel the power of their office is being challenged, they\u2019ll use the veto threat to regain some sort of equilibrium.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama is issuing veto threats at a historic pace, records show, a clear signal to the Republican-controlled Congress that the White House is eager for battle on a variety of fronts.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama is issuing veto threats at a historic pace, records show, a clear signal to the Republican-controlled Congress that the White House is eager for battle on a variety of fronts.", "title": "Obama issues veto threats at historic pace in effort to fend off \u2018lame duck\u2019 label", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/8/obama-issues-veto-threats-at-historic-pace-in-effo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/06/obama-community-collegejpeg-0fa9e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/06/obama-community-collegejpeg-0fa9e.jpg", "description": "President Obama is issuing veto threats at a historic pace, records show, a clear signal to the Republican-controlled Congress that the White House is eager for battle on a variety of fronts.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama issues veto threats at historic pace in effort to fend off \u0335"}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, White House, Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde84\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Obama\u2019s 12 veto threats represent a 30-year high.\nWe\u2019ve only been here 2 weeks and he\u2019s put seven veto threats [on the table].\n\u201cI\u2019m confident I can uphold that veto.\u201dThe practice of formal veto threats, delivered through White House documents known as \u201cstatements of administration policy,\u201d began with the Reagan White House in 1985.\nMr. Obama has issued 11 such statements from Jan. 3 through Sunday, in addition to a verbal threat on proposed sanctions against Iran.\nPresident Obama is issuing veto threats at a historic pace, records show, a clear signal to the Republican-controlled Congress that the White House is eager for battle on a variety of fronts."}
