Mary Landrieu is asking the people of Louisiana to send her back to the U.S. Senate for another six years, and she’s ready to throw President Obama under the bus to do it.

Landrieu, a Democrat, went from critic to cheerleader for the Affordable Care Act following the federal government’s $300 million payment to her state’s Medicaid fund, which became known as the “Louisiana Purchase.” When questioned, she said she would do it all over again, according to The Hill.

“I don’t need this job badly enough — maybe some people do, I don’t — to throw the people of my state under the bus to protect myself politically,” Landrieu said in an impassioned Senate floor speech at the time.

She continued supporting the act as recently as Dec. 5, when she said she would vote for Obamacare all over again if it came up for a vote, according to Baton Rouge’s CBS affiliate, WAFB Channel 9 News. Not only that, she said there was essentially nothing wrong with Obamacare — its only problem was the insurance exchange website.

Now that Landrieu is fighting for her political life, her tune has changed. She claims in a new political TV ad that the Affordable Care Act is seriously flawed, and she asks that the people of Louisiana send her back to Washington so she can fix it.

Incredibly, the ad’s central theme is the president’s oft-repeated but broken promise — that you can keep your preferred health plan. “Sen. Landrieu says President Obama needs to stick to his word,” a voiceover states.

The only problem is that in 2009, Landrieu made precisely the same promise in a speech on the Senate floor, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly reported in November.

I guess that statement that she didn’t “need this job badly enough” was as big a falsehood as “if you like your plan, you can keep it.”

Time for a house — er, Senate — cleaning in Louisiana.
