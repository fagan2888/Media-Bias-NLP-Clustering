Berkshire is a DirecTV\u2019s second-largest shareholder, with a stake of 6.85% at the end of March, according to Capital IQ. Although the position, now worth about $2.9 billion, is small compared to the Omaha, Neb. conglomerate\u2019s stakes in companies such as Coca-Cola and American Express, it\u2019s significant because it\u2019s the two managers\u2019 biggest investment.\n\nIn his 2012 annual letter, Mr. Buffett said that DirecTV was a combined purchase of Messrs. Combs and Weschler and included the holding in Berkshire\u2019s list of stock positions of at least $1 billion. The stock climbed 34% in 2013, and has steadily risen this year as well, although it\u2019s currently trading about 11% lower than the $95-per-share price AT&T has offered for DirecTV.\n\nThe two managers have been building Berkshire\u2019s stake in the satellite TV operator since 2011. Initially, Berkshire owned about 4.3 million shares valued at $180 million, according to FactSet research. At that time, the stock was trading in the $40s, and rose to the $50s over the next two years. The managers continued to build the position until the fourth quarter of 2013, when they owned 36.5 million shares, or nearly 7% of DirecTV, valued at $2.2 billion.\n\nHowever, during the first quarter of 2014, Berkshire sold off two million shares and currently owns 34.5 million shares, according to its most-recent 13F filing. If the deal goes through at $95 a share, Berkshire will get almost $3.3 billion in cash and AT&T stock from the sale. Given that the cost of purchasing those shares was far lower, Mr. Buffett\u2019s two stock-picker prot\u00e9g\u00e9s stand to make a tidy profit for Berkshire.\n\nThe next question for Messrs. Combs and Weschler: will they keep the shares of AT&T? Berkshire shareholders will need to stay tuned to find out.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Warren Buffett\u2019s two handpicked investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, put out a joint statement Monday cheering AT&T Inc.\u2019s $49 billion cash-and-stock deal for satellite TV operator DirecTV.", "title": "Berkshire\u2019s Combs, Weschler Praise Deal for DirecTV, Their Biggest Holding", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/05/19/berkshires-combs-weschler-praise-deal-for-directv-their-biggest-holding/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Berkshire\u2019s Combs, Weschler Praise Deal for DirecTV, Their Biggest Holding", "description": "Warren Buffett\u2019s two handpicked investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, put out a joint statement Monday cheering AT&T Inc.\u2019s $49 billion cash-and-stock deal for satellite TV operator DirecTV.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Anupreeta Das", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Warren Buffett\u2019s two handpicked investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, put out a joint statement Monday cheering AT&T Inc.\u2019s $49 billion cash-and-stock deal for satellite TV operator DirecTV.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-05-19T15:46:33-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/05/19/berkshires-combs-weschler-praise-deal-for-directv-their-biggest-holding/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-21383", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Warren Buffett\u2019s two handpicked investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, put out a joint statement Monday cheering AT&T Inc.\u2019s $49 billion cash-and-stock deal for satellite TV operator DirecTV.", "title": "Berkshire\u2019s Combs, Weschler Praise Deal for DirecTV, Their Biggest Holding", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/05/19/berkshires-combs-weschler-praise-deal-for-directv-their-biggest-holding/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-21383", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-05-19T15:47:09-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd987a\"", "article_summary": "However, during the first quarter of 2014, Berkshire sold off two million shares and currently owns 34.5 million shares, according to its most-recent 13F filing.\nWarren Buffett\u2019s two handpicked investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, put out a joint statement Monday cheering AT&T\u2019s $49 billion cash-and-stock deal for satellite TV operator DirecTV.\nInitially, Berkshire owned about 4.3 million shares valued at $180 million, according to FactSet research.\nThe next question for Messrs.
