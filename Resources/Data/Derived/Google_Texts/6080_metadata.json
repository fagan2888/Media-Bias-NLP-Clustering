ForAmerica is one of the \"largest and most active presences\" in the political sphere on Facebook, the Journal reported.For their efforts, the elder Bozell earned $960,000 in 2012 and 2013, while his son was compensated $114,000 for his involvement, the Journal reported.A video of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz lambasting President Barack Obama's immigration policies on the Senate floor posted by ForAmerica garnered 1.3 million views.\"This is not a fake, make-believe army. This is 7 million people who are active in the political conversation, who are conservatives,\" the elder Bozell told the Journal. \"And without them, you ain't gonna win the primary.\"Brent Bozell, a nephew of the late William F. Buckley, makes clear he has little patience for those who don't meet his yardstick for conservatism.\"If I see one more moderate, I'm going to slam my head against the wall. Jeb Bush cannot win. Chris Christie cannot win. Mitt Romney cannot win,\" he said. \"How many times must the Republicans prove that to themselves?\"ForAmerica is home to \"true believers\" and is distinguished by its unapologetic ultra-conservatism and opposition to \"Republican moderation,\" according to the Journal.The site tosses \"red meat\" to engage grass-roots conservatives: \"Like if you agree Hillary Clinton should NEVER be president,\" for instance, achieved 347,000 \"likes.\"\"What we were trying to do was tie pop culture to the conservative message day in and day out. Make it funny, witty,\" David Bozell said. \"This ain't the Federalist Papers we were trying to sell online.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "facebook, foramerica, Bozell, conservatives, GOP", "pubdate": "2014-12-08T07:27:27", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Brent and David Bozell, a father and son team of \"pure\" conservatives have built a Facebook presence with ForAmerica that they claim has the capacity to mobilize 7 million people to political action, the National Journal reports.", "title": "Bozells Turn Facebook Site Into 7M-Strong Conservative Force", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/facebook-foramerica-Bozell-conservatives/2014/12/08/id/611665/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=2bcd01cd-e42e-4782-911a-eb7f98a9ea4a&SiteName=Newsmax", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/facebook-foramerica-Bozell-conservatives/2014/12/08/id/611665/", "description": "Brent and David Bozell, a father and son team of \"pure\" conservatives have built a Facebook presence with ForAmerica that they claim has the capacity to mobilize 7 million people to political action, the National Journal reports.", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Bozells Turn Facebook Site Into 7M-Strong Conservative Force"}, "epoch": 1418023647, "keywords": "facebook, foramerica, Bozell, conservatives, GOP", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2014-12-08T07:27:27"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/facebook-foramerica-Bozell-conservatives/2014/12/08/id/611665/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Brent and David Bozell, a father and son team of  pure  conservatives have built a Facebook presence with ForAmerica that they claim has the capacity to mobilize 7 million people to political action, the National Journal reports."}, "article_summary": "This is 7 million people who are active in the political conversation, who are conservatives,\" the elder Bozell told the Journal.\n\"\"What we were trying to do was tie pop culture to the conservative message day in and day out.\n\"Brent Bozell, a nephew of the late William F.
