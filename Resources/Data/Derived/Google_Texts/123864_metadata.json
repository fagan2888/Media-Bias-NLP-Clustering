The problem is called a smartphone. Smartphones have taken over, and according to research by Pew Research Center, close to two-thirds of Americans own one.\n\n..\n\nTechnology in phones today is amazing. You can do almost anything from your phone. From online banking to getting an Uber to arming your home-security system, the options are endless. They have certainly changed the way we live and allowed us to access information anytime and anywhere.\n\n..\n\nThe problem isn't necessarily the number of people who own them; the problem is how and where we use them. Let's start with the how.\n\n\n\nA lot of content is pushed out to phones that turns into a notification, making you aware of the new information on whatever applications you have one your phone. It could be breaking news. It could be a Facebook update. It could be someone sending you a LinkedIn invitation. The point is, it immediately distracts you and takes your mind away from whatever you were working on when the notification happened.\n\n..\n\nI realized the severity of this problem the other day when I was in a meeting with several people going over some pretty important information. One of the people in the meeting was glued to their cellphone and not paying attention at all. They were staring at their phone, typing away and even smiling and making expressions based on whatever it was they were reading.\n\n..\n\nI was disappointed and quite surprised this individual was doing this. It was like the meeting was irrelevant, and I found it very unprofessional and disrespectful to the people who were talking and participating in the meeting.\n\n..\n\nUnfortunately, this situation happens all the time in today's business world. People can't put their phones down for an hour and focus on the task at hand.\n\n\n\nAnd that's pretty sad.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the negative impact smartphones can have on business, this issue also carries over into our personal lives. I'll never forget the day my daughter asked me why I always look at my phone when we are having dinner. It was a slap in the face and a lesson I will never forget.\n\n..\n\nAnd believe me, I'm not saying I am not guilty of this myself. I am. I find myself on my phone more than I would like to admit. It's not healthy, and it's something I am aware of and making a conscious effort to change. But it's not easy.\n\n..\n\nSmartphones provide tremendous benefits and make information more accessible for all of us. They can enhance our lives in many ways and also make a lot of things a lot easier. But let's not lose site of the fact that they can be a major distraction and negatively impact a lot of important aspects of our lives.\n\n..\n\nChallenge yourself and others to set boundaries. Put your cellphone away when you are in a meeting. Put your cellphone away when you are spending real, quality time with your family and friends. And once in a while, instead of texting people, remember your smartphone is actually a phone. Try having an actual conversation with someone.\n\n..\n\nChristopher Thompson (cthompson@catch22solutions.com) writes Closing the Deal weekly.\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "We have a problem that exists both in business and in our personal lives.
