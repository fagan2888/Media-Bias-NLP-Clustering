Broadway that practices humane treatment of animals through agriculture and education.\n\n\"All the money goes to keep the farm afloat,\" farm director Michael Montgomery said. \"First and foremost, it goes to animal care, then educational programs and then infrastructural updates.\"\n\nMountain Flower Goat Dairy is one of two nonprofit businesses at Long's Garden. Catherine Long, who owns 25 acres of land, said her family has been in business in Boulder for 110 years and owned this particular property for 99 years.\n\n\"We try to have things that benefit the community,\" Long said. \"Goats are beneficial for their manure, they eat the weeds and turn it into fertilizer, so it is less input for us in making our soil healthier.\"\n\nMountain Flower has been in business for three years. This marks the second spring it has thrown a baby goat shower.\n\n\"We have a lot of partners, so we want to give them exposure,\" Ward said. \"We want to build a community around food.\"\n\nMountain Flower seeks to not only educate people about being consumers, but also teach them that they are essential to the animals' health and wellness.\n\n\"I want to provide an alternative to the industrial food industry,\" Ward said. \"Especially when it comes to animals and show people how to treat them in a humane way.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27941993/no-kid-ding-children-go-baby-goats-at", "sailthru.author": "By Jordan Aleck \n \n  For the Camera", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27941993:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-18T14:40:48-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "A soggy morning blossomed into a  warm and sunny day Saturday as hundreds of people lined up to enjoy a uniquely Boulder event.", "title": "No kid-ding: children go for baby goats at Boulder fete", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27941993/no-kid-ding-children-go-baby-goats-at", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0418/20150418__19dcagoaw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0418/20150418__19dcagoaw~2_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2015-04-18T15:20:53-0600", "endDate": "2025-04-18T14:33:23-0600", "description": "A soggy morning blossomed into a  warm and sunny day Saturday as hundreds of people lined up to enjoy a uniquely Boulder event.", "byline": "By Jordan AleckFor", "pubDate": "2015-04-18T14:44:13-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-18T14:40:48-0600", "sailthru.title": "No kid-ding: children go for baby goats at Boulder fete", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27941993/no-kid-ding-children-go-baby-goats-at", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "A soggy morning blossomed into a  warm and sunny day Saturday as hundreds of people lined up to enjoy a uniquely Boulder event.", "title": "No kid-ding: children go for baby goats at Boulder fete"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0418/20150418__19dcagoaw~2.jpg"}, "article_summary": "(Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer)Other than the baby goats, there were over a dozen adult goats as well as two llamas.\nMountain Flower Goat Dairy in Boulder held a \"baby goat shower' on Saturday.\nA baby goat shower was hosted by Mountain Flower Goat Dairy, and the goat pen seemed to the first stop for all the kids.\nJenna Murray, 7, was among many of the kids excited to play with the baby goats.\nLilli Jendrass, 4, appears to love the attention from the baby goats."}
