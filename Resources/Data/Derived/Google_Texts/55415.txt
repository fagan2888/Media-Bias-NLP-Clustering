Former Texas Congressman Ron Paul has blasted Congress for deferring to President Obama on NSA reform.

In his latest newsletter, Congressman Paul notes the legislative body he once was part of checked the power of the execute branch and protected American’s rights through the Church Committee of the 1970s.

Paul goes on to say that Congress has since then taken a complete 180-degree turn, given the recent monitoring revelations at the National Security Agency (NSA).

“Not only has Congress – with a precious few exceptions – accepted the NSA’s mass spying program on American citizens, it has actually been encouraging the president to continue and expand the program!,” he writes.

Things have gotten so bad that “today the president himself has been even allowed by a complacent Congress to hand pick his own NSA review commission!,” Paul writes.

“Are we really expected to believe that a commission appointed by the president to look into the activities of the president’s intelligence services will come to anything more than a few superficial changes to give the impression of real reform?,” he asks.

Paul then slams Congress for not asserting itself when President Obama has said he we decide what reforms will taken out of the suggestions made by the commission he appointed.

“Real reform begins with the repeal of the PATRIOT Act and of the 2001 Authorization for the use of military force,” Paul writes. “If we keep our eye on that goal and not allow ourselves to become distracted with the president’s phony commissions we might force Congress to listen.”
