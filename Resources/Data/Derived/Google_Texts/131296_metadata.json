(AP) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Wednesday she wouldn\u2019t be where she is today without affirmative action, and that to think that such programs are no longer needed is to be \u201cblind to a reality that\u2019s staring you in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Race) makes a difference in a society, because a society is affected by it at every level,\u201d said Sotomayor, who spoke for more an hour during a moderated chat to University of Tulsa faculty and students.\n\nShe said it may start with many people of color being born in economically challenged circumstances, going to school in districts that lag behind, or even where people go to camp.\n\n\u201cSo many of my lawyer friends, the people that they have as clients are people they met at summer camps. Many minorities never have the opportunity for that experience,\u201d said Sotomayor, the first Hispanic on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe justice - only the third woman on the nation\u2019s highest court - wrote the dissent in April in a 6-2 decision that upheld a state\u2019s right to outlaw the use of race in determining college admissions. She told the audience that when she was a senior in high school, a friend who went to Princeton University called her and urged her to come to the school.\n\n\u201c\u2018You have to go to an Ivy League school,\u2019\u201d Sotomayor recounted him telling her. \u201c\u201dAnd what I said to him was, \u201cwhat\u2019s an Ivy League school?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe did apply, got in and was a good student, the justice said, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t even have known to apply because I came from a world where that wasn\u2019t the expectation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s true of a lot of kids in a lot of communities,\u201d the justice said. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t be where I am today.\u201d\n\nSotomayor was kicking off a three-day speaking tour in Oklahoma. She is scheduled to speak Thursday at Oklahoma City University and Friday in Norman at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nShe spoke on a range of topics, such as judicial ethics, her upbringing and how law schools across the country could improve themselves in how and what they teach to students.\n\nThe questions during the fireside chat included some that had been pre-submitted by either students or faculty members. Members of the media were not allowed to ask questions, either live or submitted beforehand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Wednesday she wouldn't be where she is today without affirmative action, and that to think that such programs are no longer needed is to be \"blind to a reality that's staring you in the face.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Wednesday she wouldn\u2019t be where she is today without affirmative action, and that to think that such programs are no longer needed is to be \u201cblind to a reality that\u2019s staring you in the face.\u201d", "title": "Sotomayor voices support for affirmative action", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/10/sotomayor-to-speak-on-university-of-tulsa-campus/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/10/77d0cea7a51f56235f0f6a7067008a26.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/10/77d0cea7a51f56235f0f6a7067008a26.jpg", "description": "U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Wednesday she wouldn't be where she is today without affirmative action, and that to think that such programs are no longer needed is to be \"blind to a", "card": "summary", "title": "Sotomayor voices support for affirmative action"}, "Author": "JUSTIN JUOZAPAVICIUS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201c\u2018You have to go to an Ivy League school,\u2019\u201d Sotomayor recounted him telling her.\nMany minorities never have the opportunity for that experience,\u201d said Sotomayor, the first Hispanic on the Supreme Court.\n\u201cSo many of my lawyer friends, the people that they have as clients are people they met at summer camps.\nShe is scheduled to speak Thursday at Oklahoma City University and Friday in Norman at the University of Oklahoma.\nThe questions during the fireside chat included some that had been pre-submitted by either students or faculty members."}
