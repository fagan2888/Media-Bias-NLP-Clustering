Ronald Richter, former commissioner of the New York City Administration for Children’s Services New York City Mayor’s Office

Ronald Richter, a family court judge who led the New York City’s Administration for Children’s Services under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has been named chief executive of the Jewish Child Care Association, one of the city’s largest child-welfare nonprofits.

The appointment of Mr. Richter returns a high-profile Bloomberg administration official to the center of work on child welfare in New York. The JCCA serves about 13,000 children and families throughout the five boroughs and is one of five agencies participating in a city-run pilot program on foster care.

“I miss being a part of the child welfare-juvenile justice work in policy and practice,” said Mr. Richter, who was first appointed to the family court by Mr. Bloomberg in 2009, and again in December 2013. “JCCA is a strong agency that’s always stood for quality and really does, I think, transformative work for families and kids.”

Peter Hauspurg, president of JCCA’s Board of Trustees, said Mr. Richter was chosen because he is an “innovative and strategic thinker” with “a deep commitment to improving the lives of the vulnerable children and families we serve.”

Mr. Richter was appointed ACS commissioner by Mr. Bloomberg in 2011 to institute reforms after the 2010 death of Marchella Pierce, a 4-year-old Brooklyn girl who weighed 18 pounds when she died, less than half of a healthy weight for a child of that age.

Mr. Richter is scheduled to start his new job on May 18. He replaces longtime JCCA CEO Richard Altman, who is set to retire this year.
