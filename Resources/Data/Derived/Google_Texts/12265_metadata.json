The Govs struggled taking care of the basketball\u2014they committed a season-high 21 turnovers\u2014and again had trouble scoring.\n\nBut this time the Governors offensive woes came inside the three point line. After making only 2-of-14 three pointers at Jacksonville State, the Governors converted half of their 16 three-point attempts against Tennessee Tech\u2014the first time since the season opener they shot 50 percent or better from behind the arc.\n\nBut it was the Govs shooting inside the arc that contributed greatly to their downfall. APSU finished 10 of 31 (32.3 percent) from two-point territory, including a combined 2-of-9 from post players Chris Freeman, who was held scoreless, and Chris Horton, who had just six points.\n\nAs a result, the inside component from the Govs\u2019 inside-outside component was all but eliminated by the Tennessee Tech continuous double teams and the inside presence of 6-10 Charles Jackson and 6-8 Dwan Caldwell.\n\nIt led to impatience and that impatience turned into 21 turnovers, resulting in just 47 APSU field goal attempts. Tennessee Tech shot only 42 percent from the floor but made seven more field goals in 60 attempts.\n\nThe game was tied 26-26 with 4:47 remaining in the first half but the home team outscored the Govs, 9-4 the rest of the half as the Govs were converted unable to converted four close-to-the-basket shots, making one jump shot and two free throws in closing moments as Tech led 35-30 at intermission.\n\nAPSU cut its deficit to one, 39-38, with 15:25 left in the second half and had two chances to take the lead, but a turnover and a missed layup attempt allowed the Golden Eagles to regain the momentum. They pushed the lead back to seven midway through the half.\n\nAgain the Govs clawed their way to three, 46-43, on two Horton free throws but turnovers on four of the next five possessions allowed Tennessee Tech to increase the lead to 10 and the Governors had no real answer in the final 7:02.\n\nKhalil Davis, who divided his time from the guard and forward spots, led the Govs with 14 points and 10 rebounds\u2014his career\u2019s first double-double.\n\nFreshman guard Josh Robinson came off the bench to add 13, including four of the Govs eight three pointers. Guard Ed Dyson added 13 as well.\n\nJunior guard Torrance Rowe led Tennessee Tech with 18 points while Josiah Moore added 13. Jackson finished with a double-double\u201411 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nBox Score\n\nTennessee Tech 72 (9-8, 1-3) vs Austin Peay 56 (5-11, 0-2) 1 2 Total Records Austin Peay 30 26 56 5-11, 0-2 Tennessee Tech 35 37 72 9-8, 1-3\n\nAustin Peay 56 ## Player FGM -FGA 3FGM -3FGA FTM -FTA OFF -DEF TOT PF TP A TO BLK STL MIN 11 Davis, Khalil 4-7 1-2 5-6 1-9 10 1 14 3 2 0 0 30 24 Dyson, Ed 4-9 2-4 3-4 1-2 3 1 13 3 2 1 0 32 5 Horton, Chris 2-7 0-0 2-2 3-7 10 2 6 1 4 2 2 33 22 Smith, Damarius 1-6 0-1 1-2 0-0 0 1 3 2 6 0 0 16 15 Freeman, Chris 0-2 0-0 0-0 0-2 2 4 0 0 3 0 0 24 4 Robinson, Josh 4-8 4-7 1-2 0-0 0 0 13 0 1 0 1 15 2 Williams, Zavion 2-4 0-0 0-2 1-1 2 3 4 3 1 0 2 18 12 Purvis, Jeremy 1-3 1-2 0-0 0-1 1 0 3 0 2 0 0 22 1 Diop, Assane 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 10 Ivory, Tre 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 20 Budrys, Domas 0-0 0-0 0-2 0-0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 23 Mboup, Serigne 0-1 0-0 0-0 0-0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 TEAM 0-0 0-0 0-0 3-3 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Totals 18-47 8-16 12-20 9-26 35 12 56 12 21 3 5 200 Percentages 38.3% 50.0% 60.0% Tennessee Tech 72 ## Player FGM -FGA FGM3 -FGA3 FTM -FTA OFF -DEF TOT PF TP A TO BLK STL MIN 12 Rowe, Torrance 7-13 3-7 1-2 0-1 1 1 18 1 2 0 3 32 23 Moore, Josiah 5-8 3-4 0-0 4-4 8 1 13 1 1 0 0 29 33 Jackson, Charles 4-9 0-0 3-4 5-5 10 3 11 1 4 6 2 29 00 Thomas, Shirmane 3-6 0-1 0-0 0-0 0 2 6 2 1 0 1 24 32 Caldwell, Dwan 1-10 0-1 4-4 1-3 4 5 6 0 2 0 2 30 01 Johnson, Jordan 3-6 2-4 4-4 1-3 4 1 12 1 0 0 1 14 05 McKay, Javon 1-3 0-1 0-0 0-2 2 1 2 0 0 0 2 7 14 Jugovic, Aleksa 0-3 0-2 2-2 0-1 1 3 2 2 1 0 1 17 35 Morse, Anthony 1-2 0-0 0-0 0-2 2 2 2 1 0 1 0 12 04 Haynes, DeOndre 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 15 Bougher, Josh 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 25 Ramsey, Mason 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 3 TM TEAM 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Totals 25-60 8-20 14-16 11-24 35 19 72 9 12 7 12 200 Percentages 41.7% 40.0% 87.5%\n\nSections\n\nTopics", "article_metadata": {"description": "Austin Peay Sports Information Cookeville, TN - Austin Peay State University men's basketball team fell to 0-2 in Ohio Valley Conference play and remained", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Clarksville, TN Online", "description": "Austin Peay Sports Information Cookeville, TN \u2013 Austin Peay State University men\u2019s basketball team fell to 0-2 in Ohio Valley Conference play and remained winless on the road for 2014-1\u2026", "title": "APSU Governors Basketball commit 21 turnovers in 72-56 loss at Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles", "url": "http://www.clarksvilleonline.com/2015/01/10/apsu-governors-basketball-commit-21-turnovers-72-56-loss-tennessee-tech-golden-eagles/", "image": "http://www.clarksvilleonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/APSUs-Khalil-Davis-145x200.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Austin Peay Sports Information Cookeville, TN - Austin Peay State University men's basketball team fell to 0-2 in Ohio Valley Conference play and remained", "title": "APSU Governors Basketball commit 21 turnovers in 72-56 loss at Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles - Clarksville, TN Online", "image": "http://www.clarksvilleonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/APSU-Governors.jpg", "creator": "@Clarksville_TN", "site": "@clarksville_tn", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "APSU, APSU Athletics, APSU Basketball, APSU Men's Basketball, APSU Sports, Austin Peay State University, Charles Jackson, Chris Freeman, Chris Horton, cookeville TN, Dwan Caldwell, Ed Dyson, Golden Eagles, Governors, Govs, Hooper Eblen Center, Jacksonville State, Josh Robinson, Josiah Moore, Khalil Davis, Ohio Valley Conference, OVC, Tennessee Tech, Torrance Rowe", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-11T05:55:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-11T06:23:55+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "APSU, APSU Athletics, APSU Basketball, APSU Men's Basketball, APSU Sports, Austin Peay State University, Charles Jackson, Chris Freeman, Chris Horton, cookeville TN, Dwan Caldwell, Ed Dyson, Golden Eagles, Governors, Govs, Hooper Eblen Center, Jacksonville State, Josh Robinson, Josiah Moore, Khalil Davis, Ohio Valley Conference, OVC, Tennessee Tech, Torrance Rowe"}, "article_summary": "Tennessee Tech shot only 42 percent from the floor but made seven more field goals in 60 attempts.\nJunior guard Torrance Rowe led Tennessee Tech with 18 points while Josiah Moore added 13.\nIt led to impatience and that impatience turned into 21 turnovers, resulting in just 47 APSU field goal attempts.\nThe Govs struggled taking care of the basketball\u2014they committed a season-high 21 turnovers\u2014and again had trouble scoring.\nAs a result, the inside component from the Govs\u2019 inside-outside component was all but eliminated by the Tennessee Tech continuous double teams and the inside presence of 6-10 Charles Jackson and 6-8 Dwan Caldwell."}
