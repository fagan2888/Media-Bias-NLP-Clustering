It looks like boy bands should think twice before joining the political conversation.

On Wednesday's edition of Live From E!, Catt Sadler, Will Marfuggi and Ali Fedotowsky discussed 'N Sync's controversial tweet that angered more than a few fans.

The boy band thought they were helping their followers out by tweeting: "Love, hate, or just confused by it -learn all you can about the Affordable Care Act which starts enrolling tomorrow! http://www.healthcare.gov"

In reality, the tweet upset a certain group of fans who quickly unfollowed the band and accused them of being "liberal."
