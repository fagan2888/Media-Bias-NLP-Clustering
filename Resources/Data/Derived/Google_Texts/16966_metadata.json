He allowed the Diamondbacks just one run, allowing three hits, striking out four and walking one.\n\nBehind Lyles, the Rockies edged the Diamondbacks 2-1 in a split-squad game at Salt River Fields.\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 other half, including a poor start from Christian Bergman (three innings, eight hits, 6 earned runs), was leading Arizona 8-7 in the eighth inning at Hermosillo, Mexico.\n\nLyles has been the Rockies best pitcher this spring \u2014 with 0.86 ERA in 21 innings.\n\nAfter allowing a double to David Peralta in the first inning, Lyles cruised. He didn\u2019t allow a hit in the next 10 plate appearances.\n\n\n\nHits\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\n* First baseman Justin Morneau hit his second homer of the Cactus League season \u2014 and this one was a doozy. His solo shot off Ruby De La Rosa flew about 425 feet, landing in the desert landscaping beyond the center-field wall.\n\n\n\n* Matt McBride is pushing hard to force the Rockies to find a roster spot for him. He hit two, two-run homers in the game in Mexico, giving him four homers this spring. Blackmon is primarily an outfielder, but he can also catch and play first base.\n\n* His strained oblique healed, infielder Daniel Descalso hit a solo homer to right-center to put the Rockies up 2-1 in the seventh at Salt River Fields.\n\n\n\nMisses\n\n* Right-hander Christian Bergman failed to make a convincing argument for a spot in the rotation with his start in Mexico. He threw two scoreless innings before the wheels came off in the third. He was done after three innings after allowing six runs on eight hits.\n\n* Outfielder Drew Stubbs, whom the Rockies are paying $5.8 million this season, is really struggling at the plate. He struck out three times Sunday, giving him 23 strikeouts in 41 at-bats this spring. He\u2019s hitting .195.\n\n\n\nUp Next\n\nThe Rockies travel to Mesa on Monday to face the A\u2019s at renovated Hohokam Stadium. Right-hander Eddie Butler, trying to lock down a spot in the starting rotation, starts for Colorado. Scheduled to start for Oakland is lefty Drew Pomeranz, the former Rockie.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Christian Bergman,David Peralta,Drew Pomeranz,Drew Stubbs,Eddie Butler,Jordan Lyles,Justin Morneau,Matt McBride", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "While the Rockies are trying to decide who should fill out their rotation, Jordan Lyles continues to show why he's been their most reliable starter this spring.", "title": "Jordan Lyles solid again for Rockies, Christian Bergman struggles in split-squad action", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/03/29/jordan-lyles-solid-again-for-rockies-christian-bergman-struggles-in-split-squad-action/19734/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/03/Jordan-Lyles-495x328.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "While the Rockies are trying to decide who should fill out their rotation, Jordan Lyles continues to show why he's been their most reliable starter this spring.", "title": "Jordan Lyles solid again for Rockies, Christian Bergman struggles in split-squad action", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/03/29/jordan-lyles-solid-again-for-rockies-christian-bergman-struggles-in-split-squad-action/19734/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/03/Jordan-Lyles-495x328.jpg", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "While the Rockies are trying to decide who should fill out their rotation, Jordan Lyles continues to show why he's been their most reliable starter this spring."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca42a\"", "article_summary": "Behind Lyles, the Rockies edged the Diamondbacks 2-1 in a split-squad game at Salt River Fields.\nMisses* Right-hander Christian Bergman failed to make a convincing argument for a spot in the rotation with his start in Mexico.\nLyles has been the Rockies best pitcher this spring \u2014 with 0.86 ERA in 21 innings.\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz \u2014 While the Rockies are trying to decide who should fill out their rotation, Jordan Lyles continues to show why he\u2019s been their most reliable starter this spring.\nThe Rockies\u2019 other half, including a poor start from Christian Bergman (three innings, eight hits, 6 earned runs), was leading Arizona 8-7 in the eighth inning at Hermosillo, Mexico."}
