The City of Sallisaw are taking in proposas for the Old Sallisaw High School rotunda.

For 10 years, the city has owned the property and is are looking for ideas on what to do next with the building.

The Old Sallisaw High School has sat at the intersection of Walnut and Creek since 1940.

Citizens can apply to buy it, ask to fix it or any idea for the property. Once a proposal is in to the city council, people can make a presentation or address the council at its next meeting.

The city council is considering demolishing the building after people continue to vandalize the property. The city has spent more than $50,000 on preserving the old school front.

The building is on the national registry list.

All proposals must be into the city office by Sept. 4 at 5 p.m.
