David Vitter\u2019s attempt to subpoena the D.C. health exchange, dealing a blow to his one-man probe into why Congress is allowed to use the city\u2019s small-business health program although it employs thousands.\n\nMr. Vitter, Louisiana Republican and chairman the Senate Small Business Committee, wanted to force exchange officials to identify the congressional staff who signed forms defining the House and Senate as small employers.\n\nCity officials say they\u2019re bound by privacy laws to black out the names of anyone who applies to use the small-business exchange, or \u201cSHOP,\u201d which lawmakers and staff must use in order to keep subsidies that cover up to 75 percent of their premiums.\n\nThe committee voted 19-5 to reject Mr. Vitter\u2019s subpoena request, with several of his GOP colleagues saying the panel should be focused on other matters, and that they wouldn\u2019t learn much from extracting the unredacted documents.\n\nMr. Vitter accused his fellow senators of struggling to protect a sweetheart health deal for themselves.\n\n\u201cThe message is clear: Congress should be able to lie so that members can get a special Obamacare subsidy unavailable to anyone else at that income level,\u201d said Mr. Vitter, who is running for governor back home.\n\nHe has been trying for more than a year to force Congress to live under stricter Obamacare rules, saying they should follow the letter of the law they wrote for other Americans.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act required members of Congress and their official staffers to buy insurance on the exchanges, but the Obama administration\u2019s Office of Personnel Management decided that if they used the D.C. small-business exchange, they could still get their employer subsidies to cover premiums.\n\nRegular Americans who buy plans through the exchange are restricted from having employers contribute to their premiums.\n\nMr. Vitter would have needed all 10 of the committee\u2019s Republicans to back his subpoena request, and he fell far short as lawmakers said they feared the implications of the move.\n\nSen. Mike Enzi, Wyoming Republican, worried about Capitol Hill staff who could their lose insurance if Mr. Vitter\u2019s probe spoiled Congress\u2018 arrangement with the city exchange.\n\nOthers said the probe wasn\u2019t the committee\u2019s responsibility, and that the exchange probably wouldn\u2019t comply.\n\n\u201cI joined this committee because I wanted to do things for small business,\u201d said Sen. James Risch, Idaho Republican, saying Mr. Vitter\u2019s request would \u201ctake our eye off the ball.\u201d\n\nBoth men voted against the maneuver, joined by Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is running for president and said Congress should instead pass a constitutional amendment to ensure that lawmakers do not exempt themselves from any law it passes.\n\nA top committee aide said every senator except Mr. Paul had been on board with the subpoena at one point, and that GOP defectors were complicit in \u201cfraud\u201d for not digging into Congress\u2018 small-employer status.\n\nAnother Republican candidate for the 2016 nomination, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, backed Mr. Vitter, as did Republican Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nD.C.\u2019s small business exchange applauded the subpoena\u2019s demise.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the bipartisan action of the [committee] and look forward to continuing to serve all our customers \u2014 Congress, small businesses, and residents of the District,\u201d D.C. Health Link Executive Director Mila Kofman said.\n\nLawmakers have taken different approaches to Obamacare\u2019s requirements. Some routed their coverage through their home states to shun the subsidy that constituents cannot get, while others hold insurance from sources unrelated to their jobs.\n\nAmong committee members reached by The Washington Times, Mr. Gardner said he used the Colorado exchange, while Ms. Ernst holds veterans\u2019 coverage known as Tricare.\n\nMs. Fischer and Ms. Ayotte both said they voted \u201cno\u201d because the subpoena did not match the committee\u2019s core mission. They use the D.C. exchange and receive the federal-employer match against their premiums.\n\n\u201c[Ms. Ayotte] has voted numerous times to repeal Obamacare for everyone, and she believes the clearest way to stop the employer health insurance contribution is through legislation,\u201d spokeswoman Liz Johnson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five Senate Republicans voted with Democrats Thursday to reject Sen.
