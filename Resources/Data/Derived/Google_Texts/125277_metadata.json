The company, which manages prescriptions for 90 million Americans, plans to drop coverage for 1,000 drug ingredients commonly found in compounded medications. Express Scripts executives say the move is a cost-saver for employers that will reduce their spending on compounded prescriptions by 95 percent.\n\nThe coverage change has prompted a swift pushback from compounding pharmacists, who argue that such cuts deprive patients of crucial medications that are not available as manufactured drugs. A compounding pharmacy industry spokesman said similar efforts to curb coverage are in the works from several insurers and pharmacy benefit providers. Express Scripts says patients will still be able to get necessary compounded medicines under its plan. Instead, the company's cuts focus on untested topical creams and ointments used to treat pain and other conditions.\n\nIN-DEPTH\n\n-The Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager is dramatically scaling back coverage of compounded drugs, saying most are ineffective or overpriced.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/express-scripts-cuts-payments-customized-drugs-n147466", "site_name": "NBC News", "image": "http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif", "type": "article", "description": "The nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager is dramatically scaling back coverage of compounded drugs, saying most are ineffective or overpriced."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "The nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager is dramatically scaling back coverage of compounded drugs, saying most are ineffective or overpriced.", "title": "Express Scripts Cuts Payments for Customized Drugs - NBC News", "image": {"src": "http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif"}, "creator": "NBCNews", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-03", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/express-scripts-cuts-payments-customized-drugs-n147466", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health,Health Care"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2907\"", "article_summary": "Express Scripts executives say the move is a cost-saver for employers that will reduce their spending on compounded prescriptions by 95 percent.\nExpress Scripts says patients will still be able to get necessary compounded medicines under its plan.\nThe nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, Express Scripts, is dramatically scaling back its coverage of compounded medications, saying most of the custom-mixed medicines are ineffective or overpriced.\nThe company, which manages prescriptions for 90 million Americans, plans to drop coverage for 1,000 drug ingredients commonly found in compounded medications.\nThe coverage change has prompted a swift pushback from compounding pharmacists, who argue that such cuts deprive patients of crucial medications that are not available as manufactured drugs."}
