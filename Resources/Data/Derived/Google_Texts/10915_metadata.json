John Hickenlooper.\n\nActually, it no doubt has happened on every governor\u2019s watch. Prisoners are often dangerous, some are mentally ill, and their sentences do in fact run out. And at that point, the options for holding them are limited.\n\nBut some things can be done to limit the risk, even if Beauprez didn\u2019t mention any.\n\nThe issue is particularly troubling in light of the case involving Evan Ebel, who walked out of prison in January 2013 after making threats to kill and torture correctional officers and others. Ebel went on to murder prisons chief Tom Clements two months after his release.\n\nIn response to Beauprez, Hickenlooper said prisons cannot ethically keep prisoners who have served their sentences. He said his administration unsuccessfully tried to pass a law to make civil commitments easier, but \u201cwe couldn\u2019t get it through.\u201d\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t say is the failed bill contained a controversial proposal to remove the word \u201cimminent\u201d from the law.\n\nColorado is one of a handful of states where people must pose an \u201cimminent danger\u201d to themselves or others before they can be involuntarily committed. That language, however, is an important barrier to civil liberty abuses, and we\u2019re not eager to see it expunged.\n\nStill, Colorado should have broader remedies to prevent the release of an inmate who has expressed a credible threat to do harm.\n\nLawmakers would be wise to reconsider a 2014 bill that gained bipartisan support in the House but was killed in the Senate.\n\nHouse Bill 1114, sponsored by Rep. Mark Waller, R-Colorado Springs, and Rep. Frank McNulty, R-Highlands Ranch, would have given prisons the power to revoke inmates\u2019 earned time.\n\nNow, few prisoners without life sentences serve \u201cstraight time.\u201d \u201cEarned\u201d and \u201cgood time\u201d allow prisoners to trim their sentences for good behavior or for participating in education or behavior programs.\n\nEvery month, the Department of Corrections lets prisoners permanently vest their earned time shortly after they receive it. Waller\u2019s bill would have allowed officials to revoke that time if prisoners violated the penal code.\n\nThe bill likely got hung up because it was sponsored by Sen. Bernie Herpin, R-Colorado Springs, who had become anathema to Democrats for taking over a recalled seat. Parts of it were overly broad, too, such as allowing officials to dock time for Class III violations of the penal code, such as littering or failing to wear name tags.\n\nOther states and the federal prison system allow officials to revoke earned time for misbehavior such as issuing dangerous threats.\n\nInmates can\u2019t be held past their full sentences absent a credible imminent threat of violence, but that doesn\u2019t mean every hour of earned time must be sacrosanct. Officials should enjoy greater discretion when a prisoner appears bent on mayhem.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "The politics of violent inmates", "title": "The politics of violent inmates", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/10/the-politics-of-violent-inmates/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141010__20141013_A11_OP13E_PRISONERSp1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141010__20141013_A11_OP13E_PRISONERSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-10T18:02:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T15:43:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Other states and the federal prison system allow officials to revoke earned time for misbehavior such as issuing dangerous threats.\n\u201cIt\u2019s happened on his watch,\u201d Beauprez said, referring to his opponent, incumbent Gov.\nGubernatorial candidate Bob Beauprez raised a thorny issue during a debate last week when he mentioned a Denver Post article about Colorado prisoners being released after they had made violent threats.\nHouse Bill 1114, sponsored by Rep.
