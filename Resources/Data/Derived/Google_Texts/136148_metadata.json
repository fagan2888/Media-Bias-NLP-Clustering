The movie is a fictionalized adaptation of Robert M. Edsel\u2019s authoritative nonfiction book of the same title, which focuses on an international unit of art experts tasked with preserving priceless works throughout the European theatre. Beginning in 1943, the Monuments Men dutifully retrieved canvases and confiscated heirlooms stashed in salt mines and inconspicuous locations across the continent (and later Japan). Given the inconceivable scope of the cultural upheaval, it\u2019s understandable that one element of the story remains largely overlooked: the precautions taken to protect artworks on American soil.\n\nThe subject is explored in Edsel\u2019s book (but not on screen), and in even sharper relief in Lynn H. Nicholas\u2019 The Rape of Europa, published in 1994. (The book was followed by a powerful documentary in 2006, which is currently streaming on Netflix, as well as a comprehensive website that dovetails with Edsel\u2019s research.) As Nicholas writes, Americans had every reason to fear an invasion: \u201cIf the Japanese had managed to cross thousands of miles of ocean undeterred to turn the huge military complex at Pearl Harbor into a smoking shambles, it seemed quite possible that they could do the same to San Francisco, and the increasing successes of the German U-boat fleet in the Atlantic underlined the vulnerability of the eastern seaboard.\u201d In December 1941, a congressman even proposed painting \u201cgleaming white\u201d monuments in Washington, D.C., gray to make them less obvious targets during potential air raids.\n\nOne trustee at the Chicago Art Institute even pondered the \u201cadvisability of camouflaging the building by smoke screens.\u201d\n\nThroughout December and the capricious months that followed, American museum owners \u201cwith visions of London\u2019s Blitz on their minds\u201d stirred to action. Paintings on the top floor of the Museum of Modern Art were removed each night and hidden in sandbagged storage rooms. Paintings and sculptures from the National Gallery of Art were surreptitiously taken down and transported by train for safekeeping at the Biltmore near Asheville, North Carolina, the largest private estate in the country. By February 1942, 15,000 items from the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u201490 truckloads in all\u2014were stashed in an empty mansion outside Philadelphia. Collections from San Diego and San Francisco were relocated to Colorado Springs.\n\nCurious about whether such maneuvers were confined to the coasts, I recently spoke with Bart Ryckbosch, an archivist at the Art Institute of Chicago. \u201cOur museum most definitely sprang into gear after Pearl Harbor,\u201d he said. Ryckbosch consulted the minutes from meetings conducted by Art Institute trustees between December 1941 and February 1942, which offer a glimpse into the museum\u2019s commitment to the safety of its employees and the public.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Monuments Men\" of Europe weren&#39;t the only ones scrambling to keep priceless works out of Hitler&#39;s reach.", "author": "James Hughes", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The \"Monuments Men\" of Europe weren&#39;t the only ones scrambling to keep priceless works out of Hitler&#39;s reach.", "title": "How American Museums Protected Their Art From the Nazis", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/AP101015036011/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/02/how-american-museums-protected-their-art-from-the-nazis/283689/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Curious about whether such maneuvers were confined to the coasts, I recently spoke with Bart Ryckbosch, an archivist at the Art Institute of Chicago.\nRyckbosch consulted the minutes from meetings conducted by Art Institute trustees between December 1941 and February 1942, which offer a glimpse into the museum\u2019s commitment to the safety of its employees and the public.\nThe subject is explored in Edsel\u2019s book (but not on screen), and in even sharper relief in Lynn H.
