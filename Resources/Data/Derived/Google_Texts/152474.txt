Re: “Vote for candidates who treat immigrant families with respect,” March 6 guest commentary.

Kerry Gutierrez’s column about the struggles for her family after her father’s deportation was well-written and I have great empathy for what they are going through. She blames the government for being cruel and specifically blames conservative politicians for calling for deportations without considering the futures of U.S. citizen children.

I don’t believe our government is cruel. However, Gutierrez is correct that when laws are broken and our legal system hands out punishments, hardships on families are not considered and they shouldn’t be.

We send thousands of U.S. citizens who are also parents to jail every day for breaking the law, and this splits up families and causes great hardship for their children. Why would it be any different for children of illegal immigrants?
