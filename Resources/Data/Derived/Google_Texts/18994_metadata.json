Up the hill, sawmill and dairy workers rest in peace in a cemetery deeded to the church by a founding member.\n\n\u201cWhen I first moved here in the \u201990s, we were still digging the graves by hand,\u201d said Leavitt, 54, a retired U.S. deputy marshal. \u201cIt was kind of a time where you do a little decompressing and a little sharing.\u201d\n\nLeavitt, his wife, Chris, and their five children moved to this Oregon Coast Range community \u2014 40 miles from the Pacific Ocean \u2014 about 15 years ago. They live on forestland dotted with colorful lilies and irises and frequented by black bears and cougars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty remote area, but it\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d said Leavitt, whose backyard overlooks a creek that runs into the Alsea River and serves as a swimming hole for salmon and steelhead.\n\nAmid the beauty of wildflowers and wildlife, the ugliness of violent death gripped the tight-knit people of Alsea in 2009: Three suicides in three months shook the community.\n\n\u201cIt took us to our knees,\u201d Leavitt said.\n\nReporting that story opened my eyes to the hush-hush approach of many Christians toward suicide.\n\nOn the front page of today's New York Times, reporter Jan Hoffman reports on what appears to be a positive trend: more evangelical pastors embracing talk of mental illness:\n\nEAGLE SPRINGS, N.C. \u2014 The pastor\u2019s phone rang in the midnight darkness. A man\u2019s voice rasped: \u201cMy wife left me and I\u2019ve got a shotgun in my mouth. Give me one reason why I shouldn\u2019t pull the trigger.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Matt Brogli, a Southern Baptist pastor scarcely six months into his first job, was unnerved. Gamely, he prayed with the anonymous caller, trying out \u201cevery platitude I could possibly think of.\u201d\n\nEventually the stranger assured Mr. Brogli that he would be all right. But the young pastor was shaken.\n\n\u201cI was in over my head,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI thought being a pastor meant giving sermons, loving my congregation, doing marriages and funerals, and some marital counseling.\u201d\n\nSince that midnight call two years ago, Mr. Brogli, 33, has become the unofficial mental health counselor not just for his church, but throughout Eagle Springs, population 8,500, a fading rural community of mostly poultry and tobacco workers, with five trailer parks and six churches.\n\nIt is no easy task, in large part because from pulpit to pew there is a silence and stigma among conservative Christians around psychiatric disorders, a relic of a time when mental illness was seen as demonic possession or a sign that the person had fallen in God\u2019s eyes.\n\nBut Mr. Brogli and other evangelical ministers are trying to change all that.\n\nGenerally, I find it easier to point out what's wrong with a story than explain what's right. This is one of those cases where I'm tempted to say simply: This is good. Read it. Of course, that may be the Thanksgiving turkey overload (and need for a nap) talking.\n\nWhat's right with this story? For one thing, as evidenced by the compelling lede, it is a story. It's not just a collection of facts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three years ago, I\u00a0traveled to rural Oregon to profile a minister\u00a0who \r\nworked to bring healing\u00a0\u2014 and answers \u2014 to his reeling town after a string \r\nof suicides.\r\n\r\nReporting that story opened my eyes to the hush-hush approach of many \r\nChristians toward suicide.\r\n\r\nOn the front page of today's\u00a0New York Times,\u00a0reporter Jan Hoffman reports \r\non what appears to be a positive trend:\u00a0more evangelical pastors embracing \r\ntalk of mental illness:\r\n\r\n    EAGLE SPRINGS, N.C.\u00a0\u2014 The pastor\u2019s phone rang in the midnight darkness.\r\n    A man\u2019s voice rasped: \u201cMy wife left me and I\u2019ve got a shotgun in my\r\n    mouth.
