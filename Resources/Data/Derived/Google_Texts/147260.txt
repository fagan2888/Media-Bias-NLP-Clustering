QUANTICO, Va. (AP) - The Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, has a new commanding officer.

Col. Joseph Murray took over Friday from Col. David Maxwell in a change-of-command ceremony at the installation 30 miles south of Washington.

Maxwell assumed command of the base in May 2012. He was recently selected for promotion to brigadier general.

Murray recently returned from Afghanistan, where he served as director of logistics for U.S. forces there.
