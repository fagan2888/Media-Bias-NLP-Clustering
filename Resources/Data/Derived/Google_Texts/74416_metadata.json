That grant is to train and hire full-time \"navigators\" who provide in-person education and enrollment assistance for the healthcare marketplace that opens Oct. 1. Brian Burton is directing the $1.3 million navigator grant for the consortium of Area Health Education Centers across Louisiana.\n\n\u201cOur job is to get out there and explain what each one of these plans mean. Through a client-centered approach, we'll gear them toward understanding the nuances of it, but without telling them what to do or what to purchase,\" Burton said.\n\nBurton expects as many as a 500,000 Louisianans will be eligible for tax subsidies with the premiums offered through the federal exchange. He\u2019s now hiring navigators, as is Nathan Bonner across the border in Lufkin. Bonner, business director of the East Texas Behavioral Health Network, expects to hire 24 full-time, salaried navigators with his $1.1 million grant. He says the training that\u2019s underway is very important.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of confusion. There\u2019s even a lot of confusion from the organizations like mine who are out there doing this activity,\" Bonner said. \"But they are doing a very good job with this navigator training. I\u2019m in the middle of taking it, just so I know what everybody else is responsible for.\u201d\n\nBonner's navigators will be fanning out across his 75-county service region. It\u2019s estimated more than 2.5 million Texans will be eligible for financial assistance. Both grant administrators believe their agencies are a natural fit for this grant because their nonprofits help direct people to medical assistance every day.\n\nNavigator Grants piece", "article_metadata": {"category": "Louisiana News", "description": "Two nonprofits based in Lafayette, La.,\u00a0and Lufkin, Texas,\u00a0are among more than 120 to receive a one-year federal grant to help people shop for health", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Latest News", "og": {"url": "http://wwno.org/post/louisiana-and-texas-agencies-staff-navigator-grants", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201310/223064723.png", "type": "article", "description": "Two nonprofits based in Lafayette, La.,\u00a0and Lufkin, Texas,\u00a0are among more than 120 to receive a one-year federal grant to help people shop for health", "title": "Louisiana and Texas agencies staff up with 'Navigator' grants"}, "story_id": 223064707, "twitter": {"site": "@WWNO", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WWNO"}, "author": "Kate Archer Kent", "org_id": 62, "dc": {"title": "Louisiana and Texas agencies staff up with &#039;Navigator&#039; grants"}, "nid": 44047, "datePublished": "2013-09-16", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, obamacare, health care, education, community", "wordCount": 385, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde9c\"", "article_summary": "Brian Burton is directing the $1.3 million navigator grant for the consortium of Area Health Education Centers across Louisiana.\nBonner, business director of the East Texas Behavioral Health Network, expects to hire 24 full-time, salaried navigators with his $1.1 million grant.\nBoth grant administrators believe their agencies are a natural fit for this grant because their nonprofits help direct people to medical assistance every day.\nThat grant is to train and hire full-time \"navigators\" who provide in-person education and enrollment assistance for the healthcare marketplace that opens Oct. 1.\nThere\u2019s even a lot of confusion from the organizations like mine who are out there doing this activity,\" Bonner said."}
