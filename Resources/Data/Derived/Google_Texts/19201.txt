ENLARGE Artist Sarah Sze in New York Philip Montgomery for The Wall Street Journal

Metal rods, fans, plastic buckets and screwdrivers are just some of the items threatening to burst out of "Triple Point," the latest installation from artist Sarah Sze. The work was exhibited at the Venice Biennale last year, where Ms. Sze represented the U.S.

Part of the installation will be on view July 3 through Aug. 24 at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, the commissioning institution for the U.S. Pavilion in Venice.

Ms. Sze is known for her sprawling, site-specific pieces that suspend ordinary objects—cotton swabs, flowers and light bulbs—in midair. The title refers to the balance of temperature and pressure that allows all three phases of a substance (solid, gas, liquid) to coexist. "She models it after a planetarium, which has a spherical form, but it feels like it's solid and breaking apart at the same time," said Carey Lovelace, a commissioner of the Venice pavilion.

Much of "Triple Point" grew out of Ms. Sze's time in Venice, where she stayed for two months before the biennial. She turned to neighborhood shops for materials, picking up sugar packets from cafes and biscotti tins. It is starting to take a life of its own in New York.

"It feels like it's orbiting," said Holly Block, the museum's executive director and a pavilion commissioner. "She's thinking a lot about systems of order and how one builds something."
