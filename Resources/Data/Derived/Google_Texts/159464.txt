It’s been a month since the Seattle Seahawks’ 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX. But Marshawn Lynch has finally spoken about the final play.

At the Patriots’ 1-yard line with 26 seconds remaining and one timeout left, Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson opted to throw instead of handing off the ball to Lynch. The pass, intended for Ricardo Lockette, was picked off by New England rookie Malcolm Butler, sealing the Patriots’ victory.

The call baffled seemingly everyone who watched the game, as well Richard Sherman and many other Seahawks players.

After the game, Lynch told Jim Trotter that he wasn’t surprised he didn’t get the ball on the final play “because we play football. It’s a team sport.” But in an interview with Turkish sports network NTV Spor, he admitted he was among the millions who expected a different outcome:

“To be honest with you, I would be lying if I didn’t tell you that I was expecting the ball. Yes, I was expecting the ball. But in life, these things happen. Like I told a reporter after the game, it’s a team sport. “I had no problem with the decision of the playcalling. I mean, you know … I think it was more of a … how do I say this? When you look at me, and you let me run that ball in … I am the face of the nation. You know, MVP of the Super Bowl … that’s pretty much the face of the nation at that point of time. I don’t know what went into that call. I mean, maybe it was a good thing that I didn’t get the ball. I mean, you know, it cost us the Super Bowl. I mean, I have full … I have full confidence in my teammates to execute that plan because we’ve done it so many more times. But would I love to had the ball in? Yes, I would have. “But the game is over, and I am in Turkey.”
