The Boulder County Sheriff's Office on its Facebook page is trying to find out more information behind the shooting and serious wounding of a dog that occurred on Tuesday night.

The sheriff's posting states that on Tuesday evening, a citizen called to report a two-door red pickup truck was seen driving away from the area of St. Vrain Road and U.S. 36. They had found a stray dog wandering in an empty parking lot, and the animal appeared to have been badly hurt.

Despite its serious injuries, the dog offered an extremely friendly greeting to the deputy who responded to the call. He took the injured dog to Aspen Meadow Veterinary Specialists for lifesaving treatment.

The sheriff's office is hoping to speak with the driver of the red truck and anyone who has information about this dog's injuries.

It was discovered the dog had been shot at close range. The bullet, lodged in his jaw, has fractured the jaw bone in multiple locations. Deputies have named the resilient dog Beefcakes. They report that Beefcakes will require surgery to remove the bullet and reconstruct his shattered jaw.

People can go to the Longmont Humane Society's Facebook page for information on how to help Beefcakes.
