Well, here's a free-speech litmus test: Can a state block candidates from asking for campaign contributions that are themselves legal?\n\nThat's the issue the Supreme Court will face Tuesday in Williams-Yulee v. The Florida Bar. Like most states, Florida elects or retains judges by popular vote. Many of those states prohibit judicial candidates from personally soliciting campaign contributions. This restriction, supporters say, prevents corruption, bias and the appearance of bias.\n\nIt's hard to see how. Florida's law allows contributions of up to $1,000 to judicial campaigns, and that limit cannot be significantly lowered (much less banned) without violating the First Amendment. Florida's law allows judicial candidates to learn who their contributors are and to ask for other kinds of campaign support, including volunteer work and service on their campaign committees.\n\nLike this column?Get more in your e-mail inbox\n\nBut a judicial candidate cannot post a request for support on the campaign website, cannot appear before a local civic group to request contributions, and cannot sign a fundraising letter asking for support. In other words, a candidate can accept contributions, just cannot solicit them. But solicitation is just speech.\n\nThat last restriction is the one that bit Lanell Williams-Yulee, a public defender and first-time candidate seeking election to a county court. She made the mistake of signing a letter announcing her candidacy and asking friends to contribute whatever they could. For that, she was reprimanded and fined by the Florida Supreme Court.\n\nLike most campaign-finance restrictions, the speech ban on solicitation places another burden on challengers running for office \u2014 particularly those who lack the wealth to finance their own campaigns.\n\nEven if Williams-Yulee had been elected, what would have been the harm of her asking for contributions?\n\nQuid-pro-quo arrangements are already illegal. It is also illegal to fail to disclose contributions, so there's no possibility of under-the-table dealing. And the Supreme Court has recognized that large expenditures in a judicial election \u2014 even if they're made independently, without any contribution to a campaign \u2014 can create an appearance of bias that requires a judge to recuse herself in cases involving the spender.\n\nSo the Florida law's sole purpose is to ban certain political speech. That's something to keep in mind the next time self-appointed campaign-finance reformers \u2014 whose legal briefs unanimously support the Florida law \u2014 tell us that their proposed restriction won't impact our First Amendment freedoms.\n\nDavid B.
