As a former inmate myself, I call bullshit on that. It\u2019s not humanizing, it\u2019s not realistic, and it\u2019s not a step forward.\n\nSee, I know a thing or two about what real prison is like. In 2010, I was arrested on drug charges, and I went on to serve 21 months behind bars, first in county jail and then in state prison. I\u2019d grown up in an upper-middle class family and, as of the day I got arrested, I knew nothing about the prison system. I didn\u2019t even understand the semantic distinction between jail (typically a county-run facility used for shorter sentences) and prison (typically a state or federal facility used for longer sentences). One thing I did understand was that I should be scared. I knew from the start that I\u2019d eventually be going to state prison, and that sounded terrifying.\n\nThe thing is, prison is scary in some ways \u2013 for example, the omnipresent threat of solitary confinement is terrifying \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t scary in any of the ways I expected. I wasn\u2019t in constant fear of being raped or beaten up. In fact, I met some wonderful people. That was not what I\u2019d been led to believe I should expect in prison. Without any better frame of reference, I\u2019d bought into popular beliefs about what prisoners are like. Incidentally, they are not \u201cas seen on TV.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d the problem begins with Piper. She\u2019s not exactly the main character in the series, but it\u2019s fair to say that she\u2019s the anchor character, the one to which the rest of the story is tied. Over the course of the first three seasons, we come to learn that she\u2019s a pretty horrible person. At the start of the series, she\u2019s timid and polite and seems like a nice lady. Soon enough, she starts cheating on her fianc\u00e9. And season one ends with her beating the crap out of another inmate (admittedly a very annoying one.) In season two she rats out girlfriend Alex in order to get her sent back to prison, and by the end of season three she sets up her new love interest Stella, getting her sent to solitary just days before her scheduled release date \u2013 all in the interest of protecting a panty-smuggling ring.\n\nWhat causes Piper\u2019s transformation? In season one, during her off-the-cuff \u201cScared Straight\u201d speech, she tells aspiring badass Dina that the scary part of prison is \u201ccoming face-to-face with who you are.\u201d It seems that Piper\u2019s character transformation throughout the series is not because prison changed her, but because it helped her find who she always was \u2013 which is not a good person. The hidden message here is that if you think you know an inmate who\u2019s a decent person, then you just don\u2019t know them well enough. They\u2019ve probably always been bad all along. That\u2019s basically the opposite of humanizing.\n\nOf course, most of the \u201cOITNB\u201d characters just aren\u2019t decent people in the first place. There are some exceptions \u2013 SoSo, Yoga Jones, Taystee \u2013 but for the most part, the show is populated with some pretty hate-able characters and caricatures, from Vee to Boo to Mendoza to Red. That\u2019s not realistic and it makes a mockery of the idea that the show humanizes its inmates. Yes, there are some really horrible, nasty people in prison, but there are also some absolutely wonderful women there. I met plenty who I\u2019ve stayed in touch with since my release and am proud to call my friends. (I just wish we could\u2019ve met somewhere other than prison.)\n\nTo be sure, some of my prison friends have gone back to drug use and ended up back behind bars. But some are out changing the world with prison reform efforts, going to college, working and paying taxes, or raising families. Even those who did end up back behind bars aren\u2019t necessarily bad people. This is a crucially important point, but one that many Americans categorically reject, and that rejection has real-world consequences. And \u201cOITNB\u201d isn\u2019t helping.\n\nThe problems go deeper than that. Overwhelmingly, the show \u2013 and especially season three \u2013 depicts the women of Litchfield as horrible mothers. Admittedly, just as it\u2019s true that there are some terrible people in prison, there are some terrible mothers in prison. There are women who have committed unspeakable crimes in which their own children were the victims. That happens, and I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t. However, it\u2019s not realistic to paint all prison moms with the same brush, because they\u2019re not all horrible mothers. Some women are doing time for killing their abusers, in some cases to protect their children. Some women just made mistakes, and some women are actually innocent. Some women were bad mothers while they were using drugs, but once they sober up they no longer resembled the incompetent, mean, and uncaring parents shown in \u201cOITNB.\u201d\n\nTo choose one particularly galling example, a Mother\u2019s Day event in season 3 is basically a carnival of bad parenting. We see everything from a mother losing track of a kid to a mother abandoning her baby to get high on drugs smuggled in through the baby\u2019s diaper. They aren\u2019t able to handle basic parenting skills like dealing with a dirty diaper. They tell their children how unwanted they are. These things might, indeed, all happen, but there is a dearth of counterexamples than makes the show\u2019s depiction of prison mothers one-sided, and perniciously so. Although there are probably some competent mothers at Litchfield, what the show chooses to focus on is primarily the terrible ones.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A former inmate shatters the damaging illusions that \"Orange is the New Black\" promotes about life in prison", "author": "Keri Blakinger", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A former inmate shatters the damaging illusions that \"Orange is the New Black\" promotes about life in prison", "title": "Don\u2019t believe the \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d hype: How the Netflix series misrepresents life behind bars", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/11/dont_believe_the_orange_is_the_new_black_hype_how_the_netflix_series_misrepresents_life_behind_bars/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/orange_is_the_new_black5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A former inmate shatters the damaging illusions that \"Orange is the New Black\" promotes about life in prison", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/orange_is_the_new_black5.jpg", "title": "Don\u2019t believe the \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d hype: How the Netflix series misrepresents life behind bars", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Don\u2019t believe the \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d hype: How the Netflix series misrepresents life behind bars", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Feminism, Media Criticism, Netflix, orange is the new black, Prison, Prison Reform, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Feminism, Media Criticism, Netflix, orange is the new black, Prison, Prison Reform, TV, Media News, Entertainment News, Politics NewsSince its debut in 2013, the Netflix series \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d has been hailed as a humanizing portrait of female inmates.\nAt the start of the series, she\u2019s timid and polite and seems like a nice lady.\nThese things might, indeed, all happen, but there is a dearth of counterexamples than makes the show\u2019s depiction of prison mothers one-sided, and perniciously so.\nHowever, it\u2019s not realistic to paint all prison moms with the same brush, because they\u2019re not all horrible mothers.\nAdmittedly, just as it\u2019s true that there are some terrible people in prison, there are some terrible mothers in prison."}
