Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz took turns hammering at billionaire Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump at the CNN debate in Houston.\n\nRubio repeatedly brought up the downsides of Trump\u2019s business record: starting a \"fake university,\" declaring bankruptcy four times and employing undocumented immigrants to work on Trump projects.\n\n\"He hired workers from Poland, and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment,\" Rubio said. \"That\u2019s a fact. People can look it up. I\u2019m sure people are Googling it right now, \u2018Trump Polish workers.\u2019 You\u2019ll see $1 million for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did.\"\n\nWe Googled \"Trump Polish workers\" and found Rubio\u2019s claim to be Half True .\n\nIn 1980, Trump\u2019s contractor \u2014 not Trump himself \u2014 hired 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish a building to make room for Trump Tower in Manhattan. Trump said he didn\u2019t know.\n\nThe lawsuit sought $1 million in damages, and a judge ruled that Trump had to pay $325,000. But the case was appealed and before it was retried, Trump settled out of court. So it\u2019s unclear how much he ended up paying.\n\nTrump forgets his own video blog\n\nCruz hit Trump on foreign policy, saying Trump agreed with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on toppling the Muammar Gaddafi regime in Libya. But Trump begged to differ.\n\n\"He said I was in favor in Libya,\" Trump said, sounding perplexed. \"I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gaddafi would be in charge right now.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s never-discussed-that line rates Pants on Fire !\n\nTrump discussed the subject at length in his own 2011 video blog (hat tip to BuzzFeed\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski) before the U.S. intervention.\n\n\"But we have go in to save these lives; these people are being slaughtered like animals,\" Trump said in 2011. \"It\u2019s horrible what\u2019s going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives.\"\n\nTrump and socialized medicine? So yesterday\n\nCruz also tried to hit Trump over his past stated support for a single-payer health care plan that covers all Americans. But Cruz went too far in describing Trump\u2019s recent views.\n\n\"For decades, Donald has been advocating socialized medicine,\" Cruz said. \"What he said is the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care. And in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you\u2019re heartless.\"\n\nDid Trump actually say that about socialized medicine? In a Republican debate?\n\nNo. Pants on Fire !\n\nTrump did not say those words, or anything like them, in any recent debate. He advanced the idea of more competition among private insurance companies, and he said that government should take care of those who can\u2019t afford insurance.\n\nWe asked the Cruz campaign for their sources and didn\u2019t hear back. But in an interview on CBS News\u2019 60 Minutes in September 2015, Trump did say, \"Everybody's got to be covered.\"\n\nHowever, in context he was talking about people who don\u2019t make enough money to pay for insurance. Asked what he would do and who would pay, Trump said, \"I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people (and) the government's gonna pay for it.\"\n\nIt\u2019s clear from the full interview that Trump did not say that the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care. He made that point again in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on Jan. 31, 2016, saying that Cruz\u2019s attacks showed \"maybe he\u2019s got no heart.\"\n\nThat doesn\u2019t at all amount to Trump supposedly saying, \"If you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you\u2019re heartless.\"\n\nTrump didn\u2019t open up immigration debate\n\nThe debate started with a discussion of illegal immigration, and Trump was quick to remind everyone that it\u2019s his signature issue.\n\n\"If it weren\u2019t for me \u2026 (illegal immigration) wouldn\u2019t even be a big subject,\" he said.\n\nWe found roughly the same amount of articles in major newspapers discussing the topic in the 51 days before Trump\u2019s announcement on June 16, 2015, and the 51 days that followed.\n\nTrump\u2019s talk about building a wall -- and making Mexico pay for it -- certainly has made headlines. But debate about America\u2019s immigration system and proposed changes preceded the billionaire businessman\u2019s candidacy for president.\n\nWe rated his claim False .\n\nRubio on an Obamacare \u2018bailout fund\u2019\n\nRubio also knocked Trump for his lack of policy specifics and knowledge.\n\n\"You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don't follow this stuff very closely, but here's what happened,\" he said. \"When they passed Obamacare, they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. ...We led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.\"\n\nWe rated Rubio\u2019s statement Mostly False .\n\nThe \"bailout fund\" he mentioned is actually a provision in the Affordable Care Act called risk corridors. This program was designed to temporarily aid insurers as they adjusted premiums to cover sicker enrollees.\n\nBy October 2015, it became apparent the risk corridors program didn\u2019t work so well in the first year. CMS announced the program took in $362 million in user fees for 2014 , while less successful insurers asked for a total of $2.87 billion, leaving a $2.5 billion shortfall CMS can\u2019t pay.\n\nRubio argues he \"wiped out\" the risk corridors program by pushing language in a spending bill to prevent the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from being able to cover expenses for risk corridors from its own budget (rather than from fees taken in by the risk corridors program).\n\nBut experts have said Rubio is wrong to call the program a bailout, because the program is supposed to pay for itself through fees from insurers. Furthermore, the program hasn\u2019t been \"wiped out.\" At best, Rubio and Congress have temporarily limited one potential way CMS could have covered insurance companies' losses. We\u2019ll have to see what happens when the program expires after 2016 -- then any outstanding bills will be due, one way or another.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trailing in the polls, Sens.
