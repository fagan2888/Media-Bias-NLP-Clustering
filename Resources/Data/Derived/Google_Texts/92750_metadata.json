He arrives in a truck painted with marijuana leaves declaring: \u201cYes on legalization.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s health advocates opposed to legalization said Buddie is reminiscent of Joe Camel, the cartoon dromedary proven so effective at marketing cigarettes to teenagers in the 1990s that R.J. Reynolds was forced to retire his image. They said the pot mascot makes light of a dangerous illegal drug in a manner appealing to kids.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t believe it when we saw the photos. We were pretty shocked,\u201d said Nick Lashutka, president of the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospitals Association that\u2019s involved in fighting the legalization effort. \u201cThis is nothing less than a ploy to market to children.\u201d\n\nResponsibleOhio, the campaign seeking in November to legalize marijuana for medical and recreational use, said Buddie is nothing like Joe Camel. Executive Director Ian James said the mascot is not marketing marijuana but asking for votes - and speaking exclusively to voting-age students.\n\n\u201cBuddie only addresses people that are 18 and older, and Buddie works specifically with voters,\u201d James said. \u201cBuddie has no connection with anybody under 18 because anybody under 18 can\u2019t vote.\u201d\n\nAlso, James said, Joe Camel\u2019s tobacco product was legal whereas anyone selling marijuana in Ohio today \u201cwould go to jail.\u201d\n\nLashutka said he has children, and it is the younger ones who find superheroes most appealing.\n\n\u201cAs someone who has a recent college graduate in the family, he\u2019s not playing with superheroes or watching cartoons, but my younger kids are,\u201d Lashutka said.\n\nThe legalization question is fiercely dividing the state. It would make Ohio a rare state to move from total prohibition to total legality for those 21 and older. The measure also sets up a network of 10 authorized growing sites in the state.\n\nRepublicans who control the state Legislature believe the growing network to be a monopoly, oligopoly or cartel. They\u2019ve placed a separate issue on the ballot barring such economic arrangements from Ohio\u2019s constitution without two separate votes of the people.\n\nAmid the intense and expensive fight emerged Buddie.\n\n\u201cThey need an attention grabber,\u201d said Casey Newmeyer, an assistant marketing professor at Case Western Reserve University\u2019s Weatherhead School of Management. \u201cThey need something that\u2019s going to catch young people\u2019s attention to come over and talk to them. Just one or two random people standing on a campus passing out fliers isn\u2019t going to do that.\u201d\n\nNewmeyer said she agrees with critics that merging superhero imagery with marijuana is \u201ctowing the line.\u201d But she said Buddie differs from Joe Camel.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not on billboards, he\u2019s not on clothing, he\u2019s not available for children to see,\u201d Newmeyer said. \u201cThey\u2019re not marketing him to the masses.\u201d\n\nChris Pullig, professor and chair of Baylor University\u2019s marketing department, said Buddie is \u201ccloser to Tony the Tiger than Joe Camel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe legalization group has paid close attention to what many mainstream marketers have done to create an effective personification of their brands. Tony the Tiger, Ronald McDonald, the Nesquik Bunny, Jack from Jack in the Box - the list goes on,\u201d Pullig said. \u201cAlso, it is obvious that many of these characters endorse products that are not always good for consumers. They also are targeted to younger consumers.\u201d\n\nJames said ResponsibleOhio is seeking the youth vote and Buddie is a way to get it.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the millennial voters, they are the least likely to vote in an off-off-year election, but the most likely to appreciate a goofy, off-the-wall, irreverent character, and so we provided them one,\u201d James said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A caped green superhero stumping for marijuana legalization votes at college campuses and bars in Ohio has sparked debate over its impact on children.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A caped green superhero stumping for marijuana legalization votes at college campuses and bars in Ohio has sparked debate over its impact on children.", "title": "Caped superhero is pushing marijuana legalization in Ohio", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/7/caped-superhero-is-pushing-marijuana-legalization-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/07/c308aa873fed5b28810f6a706700b9f2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/07/c308aa873fed5b28810f6a706700b9f2.jpg", "description": "A caped green superhero stumping for marijuana legalization votes at college campuses and bars in Ohio has sparked debate over its impact on children.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Caped superhero is pushing marijuana legalization in Ohio"}, "Author": "JULIE CARR SMYTH", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1c3\"", "article_summary": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - A caped green superhero stumping for marijuana legalization votes at college campuses and bars in Ohio has sparked debate over its impact on children.\nExecutive Director Ian James said the mascot is not marketing marijuana but asking for votes - and speaking exclusively to voting-age students.\nWe were pretty shocked,\u201d said Nick Lashutka, president of the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospitals Association that\u2019s involved in fighting the legalization effort.\nIt would make Ohio a rare state to move from total prohibition to total legality for those 21 and older.\n\u201cBuddie\u201d is a fuzzy, ever-smiling pot bud in a bulging white muscle suit with green trunks, gloves and boots."}
