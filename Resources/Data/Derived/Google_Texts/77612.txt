Less than a month after Dictator Kim Jong-un claimed that North Korea had developed a hydrogen bomb, tremors were detected near a North Korean nuclear testing site early Wednesday morning.

Alarms were raised when China, South Korea, and the United States Pacific Command all confirmed artificial tremors just a short time ago.

If it is true that North Korea does has the ability to create and operate a hydrogen bomb, it will erase the much speculated news that the country's nuclear arsenal was in decline.

Hydrogen bombs are much more sophisticated and cause much more damage than conventional plutonium bombs.
