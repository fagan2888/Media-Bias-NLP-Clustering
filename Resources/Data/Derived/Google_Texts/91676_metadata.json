The land was originally donated by Lanier Land Co., but was later acquired by Butler Property and donated again to the school district.\n\nBrosky said it\u2019s common for development agreements to stipulate developers provide land for schools.\n\n\u201cIt behooves (the developers) because it\u2019s a draw to sell homes, and it behooves us because it\u2019s land that we\u2019re not paying for to build a school,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said the district looked at several properties that were offered, and found the one on Millside Parkway met Department of Education guidelines.\n\nAdrian Niles, maintenance and operations director for the school district, said the current plan is to build a kindergarten-through-fifth-grade school similar in size and scope to Fair Street International Baccalaureate World School, which opened in 2013.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to just as sharp a building as the Fair Street building,\u201d Niles said.\n\nHe also said the new school is slated to have a playground and will possibly have recreational fields, and that plans have not yet been made for classrooms and other\n\nindoor facilities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of making application to the state,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to design with an architect after the application is approved.\u201d\n\nHe said the Department of Education accepts applications based on a needs assessment, and added the district\u2019s current facilities are in good shape, but a new school is needed due to growth in enrollment.\n\n\u201cAs a school district, our system is solid,\u201d he said. \u201cOur buildings are maintained very well and up-to-date.\u201d\n\nPlans are to use special purpose local option sales tax funds for the project.\n\n\u201cIt will be on our next SPLOST,\u201d Niles said.\n\nCreel said the the type of curriculum to be offered at the school will be determined later by a school governance committee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/102246/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With two elementary schools near capacity, Gainesville City Schools is going forward with plans to build a new elementary school in the Mundy Mill neighborhood.", "title": "Plans for new school in Mundy Mill neighborhood still on track"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Plans for new school in Mundy Mill neighborhood still on track"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a3e\"", "article_summary": "With two elementary schools near capacity, Gainesville City Schools is going forward with plans to build a new elementary school in the Mundy Mill neighborhood.\n\u201cAs a school district, our system is solid,\u201d he said.\nThe land was originally donated by Lanier Land Co., but was later acquired by Butler Property and donated again to the school district.\nCreel said the the type of curriculum to be offered at the school will be determined later by a school governance committee.\nAdrian Niles, maintenance and operations director for the school district, said the current plan is to build a kindergarten-through-fifth-grade school similar in size and scope to Fair Street International Baccalaureate World School, which opened in 2013."}
