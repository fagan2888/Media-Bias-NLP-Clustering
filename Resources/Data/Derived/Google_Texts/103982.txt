WATFORD, England (AP) - Watford and Southampton drew 0-0 Sunday as both teams continued to search for a first Premier League win of the season after a scrappy draw at Vicarage Road.

Odion Ighalo and Etienne Capoue each had an excellent chance to snatch all three points for the newly promoted Hornets but both failed to convert from close range as the teams were forced to settle for a point.

Southampton duo Sadio Mane and Victor Wanyama, linked with moves away to Manchester United and Tottenham respectively, started the fixture but Mane left the field through injury just 25 minutes into the first half.

Watford has now drawn all three of its opening matches of the campaign while Southampton finds itself in the relegation zone after two draws and a defeat.
