He pulls this same stunt whenever there\u2019s discussion of America taking significant military action somewhere in the world.\n\nIt\u2019s all political theater based on the false notion that the only people in the military are uneducated people with no other opportunities.\n\nAs we remember 9/11 anniversary, we must also not forget that more than 6,600 paid ultimate sacrifice in Iraq/Afghanistan. \u2014 Charles Rangel (@cbrangel) September 10, 2014\n\nLess than 1% are in US service. With draft America would be forced to rethink about involvement in wars. http://t.co/LoZZWZvy1r \u2014 Charles Rangel (@cbrangel) September 10, 2014\n\nIt\u2019s all volunteer and the best military in the world.
