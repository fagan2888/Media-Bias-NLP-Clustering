Rep. Jeremy Durham and colleague Sen. Brian Kelsey think they've figured out why the media "attacked" Durham.

From the Ledger via Woods at Pith:

Earlier in the session’s first day, several hours before the caucus meeting, state Sen. Brian Kelsey predicted Durham would “survive” and keep his whip post.



“I think that his colleagues will see through a personal attack on him for his strong stand against Obamacare,” says Kelsey, who was the best man in Durham’s wedding.



Asked if he thought it was a media attack or came from within the Republican Party, Kelsey, a Germantown Republican, says, “It was clearly instigated by the liberal media, who is in favor of expanding Obamacare in Tennessee.”



Kelsey points out Durham sponsored the legislation in the House requiring a legislative vote on Haslam’s Insure Tennessee plan. The General Assembly had asked Haslam to come up with a proposal to provide more people with a Tennessee plan after the Affordable Care Act passed Congress.



Of course, neither the media nor the Senate Republican Caucus went after Kelsey, who sponsored the measure in the Senate. Maybe they couldn’t find anything to make him look bad. Then again, maybe he’s just standing up for a friend.
