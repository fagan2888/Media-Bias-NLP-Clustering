Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) is declaring that the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold ObamaCare last week is “not the end of the fight” against the healthcare law.

Bush, one of the GOP’s frontrunners for 2016, on Monday offered a new glimpse into his plan to replace ObamaCare days after the court decision that further cemented the law’s legacy.

In a blog post on Medium, Bush pledged to “empower states,” offer “tax relief” to help people pay their premiums and give employers the chance to “offer more innovative benefit designs.”

“I don’t believe we should have employer mandates, employee mandates or healthcare mandates that make healthcare insurance so extraordinarily expensive,” he said in a video.

The blog post marks his first public comments, beyond a short statement on Thursday, since the court ruled to uphold subsidies in the healthcare law in King v. Burwell.

His ideas — many of which are already popular within the Republican party — are just a few specifics in what will need to be a comprehensive replacement plan before the 2016 election.

The GOP’s defeat in King v. Burwell last week puts more pressure on candidates to come up with plans to replace the law after President Obama leaves office.

Top Republicans in Congress have cast the court decision as an opportunity for 2016 hopefuls to double down on their ObamaCare planning.
