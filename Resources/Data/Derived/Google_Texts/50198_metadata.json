A Health Giant CEO", "article_keywords": ["hemsley", "coops", "room", "emergency", "ceo", "work", "obamacare", "giant", "whos", "health", "promised", "sorry", "unitedhealth", "care"], "article_url": "http://spectator.org/articles/64844/who%E2%80%99s-sorry-now-health-giant-ceo", "article_text": "America\u2019s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group Inc., is losing so much money on the Affordable Care Act exchange policies it sells in 34 states that CEO Stephen Hemsley apologized to investors in New York on Tuesday. \u201cIt was for us a bad decision,\u201d Hemsley said, according to Bloomberg News. UnitedHealth stayed out of the Obamacare market in its first year. \u201cIn retrospect, we should have stayed out longer,\u201d Hemsley added. UnitedHealth may get out of the individual market in 2017.\n\nUnitedHealth spokesman Tyler Mason wanted to be clear that Hemsley was not trashing Obamacare; he simply was describing one provider\u2019s experience.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi likes to say that Obamacare is under assault from Republicans who want to destroy the health care program, but it looks as though the program itself \u2014 written by Democrats and passed without a single Republican floor vote \u2014 is sinking under its own weight.\n\nThis is where I would expect some readers to shake their heads and mutter about conservatives not wanting the Affordable Care Act to work. Actually, conservatives understood from the get-go that what President Obama promised would not work. You can\u2019t lower the typical family\u2019s premiums by $2,500 annually, as Obama promised in 2007, and let people keep their old health plans and let consumers keep the doctors they like, too. As it turns out, none of those three promises was kept.\n\nThe really big lie was Obama\u2019s assertion that he could fund near-universal health care by reducing emergency room visits. \u201cWhat happens is, you don\u2019t have health insurance, you go to the emergency room. You weren\u2019t getting a checkup; something that might have been curable with some antibiotics isn\u2019t caught, but by the time you get to the hospital, it\u2019s much more expensive,\u201d he said in 2010.\n\nIt turns out that emergency room visits are up, not down, since the requirement to have health coverage took effect, according to a recent poll by the American College of Emergency Physicians.\n\nAs I write, I can see some readers concluding that a single-payer plan could work better as it would focus on serving patients, not increasing insurance company profits. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, was ready to implement single-payer \u2014 and then had to admit his plan \u201cmight hurt our economy.\u201d Twelve out of the original 23 nonprofit co-ops largely funded by Obamacare will no longer offer policies after this year. With about a third of the co-ops having closed, some half a million Americans have had to scramble for new health care plans. The co-ops claimed they didn\u2019t receive the promised federal support.\n\nIn other boardrooms, the news is grim. \u201cAll the other big insurers are signaling the same problems,\u201d Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners, told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nI\u2019ve never understood how so many smart people could believe the claim that the government could provide more health care to more people \u2014 for less money \u2014 as Pelosi claimed in 2012 when she told Meet the Press, \u201cEverybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\u201d It was magical thinking, and the results are anything but magical.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "article_summary": "The really big lie was Obama\u2019s assertion that he could fund near-universal health care by reducing emergency room visits.\nWith about a third of the co-ops having closed, some half a million Americans have had to scramble for new health care plans.\n\u201cWhat happens is, you don\u2019t have health insurance, you go to the emergency room.\nIt turns out that emergency room visits are up, not down, since the requirement to have health coverage took effect, according to a recent poll by the American College of Emergency Physicians.\nUnitedHealth spokesman Tyler Mason wanted to be clear that Hemsley was not trashing Obamacare; he simply was describing one provider\u2019s experience."}
