The financial-research firm forecasts that 90 percent of Americans who now have employer-sponsored coverage will lose it by 2020 \u2014 and have to turn to government exchanges for policies.\n\nThe Obama administration has long denied that its health-reform law would cause companies to stop providing insurance. But thanks to an ObamaCare-fueled increase in health costs, employer-sponsored coverage may soon become a thing of the past.\n\nThe S&P report comes three years after the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. suggested that 30 percent of employers would dump workers into exchanges to save money.\n\nDemocrats weren\u2019t convinced. The White House attacked the McKinsey report as \u201cflawed\u201d; Senate Finance Committee then-Chairman Max Baucus blasted its \u201cfaulty analysis and misguided conclusions.\u201d\n\nObamaCare\u2019s defenders even argued that more employers would provide health insurance once the law went into full effect. Recent history hasn\u2019t borne them out.\n\nHealth-benefits consultants around the country report that businesses are considering dumping their least-healthy employees onto the exchanges. By doing so, they can lower their own premiums \u2014 and stick taxpayers with the tab for covering their most costly workers.\n\nNorth Carolina benefits consultant Todd Yates recently told Kaiser Health News about this trend, saying that \u201cemployers are inquiring about it and brokers and consultants are advocating for it.\u201d\n\nOffloading workers onto the exchanges could pay huge dividends. According to the S&P Capital IQ report, if all employers with more than 50 workers adopted this strategy, they\u2019d collectively save $3.25 trillion. Among 500 of the country\u2019s biggest companies, the total savings could amount to $700 billion over 10 years.\n\nFirms will be hard pressed to leave these savings on the table \u2014 especially as their costs shoot up.\n\nAccording to a recent study from the American Health Policy Institute, ObamaCare will saddle large firms \u2014 those with more than 10,000 employees \u2014 with an added $163 million to $200 million apiece in new costs over 10 years. That\u2019s equivalent to $4,800 to $5,900 per worker.\n\nBrokers in Nevada are already reporting premium spikes of 35 to 120 percent for businesses in the state renewing their policies this year.\n\nRate hikes of this magnitude could put 90,000 employer policies in the state at risk of cancellation, according to William Wright, head of Las Vegas-based Chamber Insurance and Benefits.\n\nThe IRS is trying to stop employers from dumping their workers in the exchanges by threatening fines of up to $36,500 per worker. But that fine only applies if an employer tries to subsidize his worker\u2019s exchange coverage with untaxed income.\n\nSo firms can still offload their employees onto the exchanges \u2014 and even cover a portion of their premiums, as long as they do so with income that\u2019s taxed like regular wages.\n\nThe IRS may not want employers to dump their workers into the exchanges. But the law\u2019s architects seem to want them to.\n\nFormer Obama health adviser Ezekiel Emanuel predicts that within the next three years, \u201ca few big, blue-chip companies will announce their intention to stop providing health insurance. . . Then the floodgates will open.\u201d\n\nBy 2025, he estimates, fewer than one in five Americans will get insurance through work.\n\nAnother Obama ally, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, recently admitted that employer-sponsored insurance isn\u2019t long for this world, calling it \u201ca crumbling building.\u201d\n\nAs the employer insurance marketplace starts to crumble, President Obama continues to say of ObamaCare, \u201cthis thing is working.\u201d\n\nTens of millions of employees will soon find out what \u201cworking\u201d really means when they are kicked off the health plans they were promised they could keep.\n\nSally C.
