However, \u201cthe largest fine would be against Planned Parenthood,\u201d the Island Packet reports.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, \u201c[violations] include paperwork issues and fetuses being sterilized with steam and taken to a landfill, rather than incinerated as required by law\u2014issues also cited in the clinics\u2019 suspensions.\u201d\n\nJenny Black, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said in a Nov. 12 statement that the organization\u2019s officials \u201cwere surprised and dismayed\u201d to learn of \u201ca monetary penalty we knew nothing about.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is more important to us than the health and safety of our patients,\u201d Black said in the statement supplied to The Daily Signal, using an often-deployed Planned Parenthood phrase. She added:\n\nWe hold ourselves to high standards and take swift action to address any shortcomings. For this reason, we have and will continue to cooperate fully with DHEC [the state Department of Health and Environmental Control] to ensure that our Columbia health center meets and exceeds all state standards.\n\nThe Daily Signal previously reported that South Carolina\u2019s health agency suspended two of the state\u2019s three abortion facilities after an investigation ordered by Gov. Nikki Haley uncovered violations of state laws and regulations.\n\nHaley, a Republican, ordered the investigation after the Center for Medical Progress released undercover videos of Planned Parenthood executives describing the sale of body parts from aborted babies. Planned Parenthood has denied illegal conduct.\n\nThe suspensions were to last until proof of corrections was provided. DHEC lifted the sanctions against the Greenville Women\u2019s Clinic in September, AP reported\n\nPlanned Parenthood said the agency lifted the sanctions against its Columbia clinic earlier this month.\n\nA third clinic, the Charleston Women\u2019s Medical Center, was not suspended and faces the lowest fines.
