And yet no one seems concerned enough to do that. It\u2019s a classic example of a TV show casually glossing over the one plot twist that would resolve all of its problems.\n\nIn last week\u2019s episode, poor Ansel was suffering not merely from conditions internal (voices in his head primary among them) but from problems anyone in the world would have noticed. His teeth had become jagged fangs and his eyes weren\u2019t just bloodshot but red. But his wife, rather than directing her husband toward the authorities who\u2019d been already studying the jetliner tragedy, just took her kids and left for a while, presuming perhaps that it\u2019d all get sorted out. When she returned, last night, to find her husband having chained himself up to avoid further damage beyond the dogs he\u2019d already killed out of blood lust, she fed her husband the nosy neighbor. It was a cute twist \u2014 but come on, lady, even if you have no hope your husband will get better, aren\u2019t you at least curious about whether his case can help others? At no point did you think that calling a hospital on a man who was normal before a flight on which he turned into a bloodsucker might be a good idea? Not when he came downstairs with bright-red eyes? Not when you saw the dogs he\u2019d killed in the backyard? Maybe the doctor couldn\u2019t have prevented the imminent global plague, but wouldn\u2019t you like an answer to your husband\u2019s overnight transformation more satisfying than \u201cYikes!\u201d?\n\nFrom the jump, all four of the survivors were weirdly resistant to medical care, even despite the facts that a) they were the only ones who\u2019d made it out alive of a shocking mass death unprecedented in history, and b) they were showing horrifying symptoms. Gabriel, the \u201crock musician,\u201d saw his penis fall off in episode 3 and didn\u2019t see a real problem. Perhaps he was too far gone on the road to full-on vampirism to even care about getting help. But what about the people around him who saw him bite a woman\u2019s neck early in the season? We were told then that such a violent act was out of character even for this Marilyn Manson type; shouldn\u2019t someone have put the pieces together?", "article_metadata": {"description": "If my eyes went bloodshot and my teeth became fangs, I'd probably head over to my local healthcare professional", "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If my eyes went bloodshot and my teeth became fangs, I'd probably head over to my local healthcare professional", "title": "Why does \u201cThe Strain\u201d distrust doctors so much?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/04/why_does_the_strain_distrust_doctors_so_much/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/the_strain.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If my eyes went bloodshot and my teeth became fangs, I'd probably head over to my local healthcare professional", "creator": "@dpd_", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/the_strain.jpg", "title": "Why does \u201cThe Strain\u201d distrust doctors so much?", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why does \u201cThe Strain\u201d distrust doctors so much?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Corey Stoll, FX, Television, the strain, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef24\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s a classic example of a TV show casually glossing over the one plot twist that would resolve all of its problems.\nBut what about the people around him who saw him bite a woman\u2019s neck early in the season?\nTopics: Corey Stoll, FX, Television, the strain, TV, Entertainment NewsIt seems like an easy solution to the premise FX\u2019s \u201cThe Strain\u201d has set for itself: The four survivors of the airline flight that brought on the vampirism plague should maybe just go to the doctor\u2019s office to get their general malaise and grodiness checked out.\nGabriel, the \u201crock musician,\u201d saw his penis fall off in episode 3 and didn\u2019t see a real problem.\nPerhaps he was too far gone on the road to full-on vampirism to even care about getting help."}
