The Tucson Police Department has identified a 6-year-old boy who was stuck and killed by a UPS truck while riding his bicycle Friday afternoon as Daylin Garcia Enos.

The accident happened just before 4 p.m. when, according to police, the driver of a UPS truck was making deliveries in an apartment complex in the 6200 block of South Campbell Avenue.

The driver pulled into the parking lot and prepared to back the vehicle into a parking space by checking the backup camera and mirrors and honking the horn, according to TPD. Daylin had been riding his bicycle behind the truck and was struck when the driver began backing.

TPD and the Tucson Fire Department both responded, but Daylin was pronounced dead on the scene. He was not wearing a helmet, and the man who was driving the UPS truck stayed at the scene and cooperated with investigators. No citations were issued.

Reached in Atlanta, UPS spokesman Natalie Norrington said, "We are cooperating with the investigation."
