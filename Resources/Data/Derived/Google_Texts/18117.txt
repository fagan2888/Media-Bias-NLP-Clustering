Today First Lady Michelle Obama is hosting a healthy Kids' State Dinner at the White House with 54 budding chefs. The children, representing all 50 states and jurisdictions, were the winners of Epicurious' Healthy Lunchtime challenge. The kids teamed up with parents to whip up a healthy lunch and some of the winning recipes will be served at today's luncheon.

Esther Matheny of Maryland and Max Wix of the District dropped by WAMU with their winning recipes. Esther prepared Chesapeake fish tacos with mango and salsa topping, and Max served up "Greens and Grains": a tasty mash of squash, quinoa, kale, couscous, apples, and chorizo.

Both kids are thrilled to be going to the White House to meet the First Lady and get a tour of the vegetable gardens. Esther and Max say they were pretty shocked to hear they won, and both credit a parent for their budding cooking skills.

"Well, my dad has loved cooking and I've been around him a lot helping him out," says Max, and Esther chimes in, "My mom cooks dinner almost every night, and I started helping out every now and then and really enjoyed it so I started doing it more often."

Epicurious editor Nilou Motamed says she was impressed with the adventurous ingredients used by all the kid-testants. "I can only imagine what all these mini-foodies will eat when they are adults when they have this solid a foundation at 10," Motamed says.
