TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - A Ponte Vedra man won $500,000 from the Monopoly Millionaire scratch-off game exactly one year after the game launched, a Tallahassee news release said.

Anthony Stratton, 30, bought his winning ticket from Cornwell's Market, located at 6810 US Highway North 1 in St. Augustine. He paid $20 for his ticket.

"My family has been playing Lottery games since it was created," Stratton said in a news release. His mother won $10,000 playing another scratch-off game 15 years ago.
