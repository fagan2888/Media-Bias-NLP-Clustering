Nathan Deal\u2019s office.\n\nThey were protesting Deal\u2019s decision not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAmong the ten arrested include state Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta. Fort and the others were hauled off to Fulton County Jail and charged with the misdemeanor of \"preventing or disrupting a General Assembly session.\"\n\nThe progressive coalition Moral Monday Georgia organized the protest. They want Deal to change his mind and accept federal funds to expand Medicaid.\n\nProtester Laura Bordeaux of Decatur stressed hundreds of thousands of Georgians would gain health coverage. She said Deal is playing politics with people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cThis is just not right. This is a moral imperative and Governor Deal knows that. He knows that. This is election year posturing is what it is,\u201d said Bordeaux.\n\nDeal has said repeatedly the state can\u2019t afford the expansion, despite the federal government covering nearly its full cost.\n\nDeal\u2019s office declined comment about the arrests.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "A group of ten demonstrators were arrested Monday after refusing to leave the lobby of Gov.
