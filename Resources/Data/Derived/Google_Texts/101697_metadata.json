In a moment whose irony he noted, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) told a bunch of rich Republicans gathered by the Brothers Koch this year that those doing well in America were \u201cthe top 1 percent, the millionaires and billionaires the president loves to demagogue, one or two of whom are here with us tonight\u201d while the \u201cpeople who have been hammered for the last six years are working men and women.\u201d\n\nAnd on it went through the country\u2019s top Republicans. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) stressed \u201copportunity inequality\u201d and Mitt Romney, in another ironic turn, charged that \u201cunder President Obama, the rich have gotten richer.\u201d\n\nIt would be wonderful if conservatives really wanted to deal constructively with the predicament they so passionately describe. But thanks to the House and Senate GOP budgets, we now know that conservatives and Republicans (1) aren\u2019t serious about the plight of working-class and lower-income Americans and (2) would actually make their situations much worse.\n\nTheir spending plans fail even on conservative terms: They are not fiscally responsible. Instead, they rely on all sorts of magic tricks that shove choices and problems down the road.\n\nOne heartening sign is that at least some conservatives find these budgets ridiculous. For example, James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute headlined his commentary for The Week: \u201cThe disappointing unseriousness of the House GOP\u2019s budget.\u201d\n\nPethokoukis wrote: \u201cHouse Republicans say they want to balance the federal budget and eventually eliminate the federal debt. They do not have a plan to do so. Oh, to be sure, they have a plan! Just not a realistic one that will actually accomplish their goals.\u201d\n\nHe noted that of the $5.5 trillion in cuts from planned spending, $2 trillion would come from \u201crepealing the ObamaCare insurance subsidies and Medicaid expansion and replacing them with . . . well, nothing right now.\u201d\n\nThe wholesale assault on efforts to provide lower-income Americans with health insurance is the clearest sign that Republicans don\u2019t want to deal with inequality. The inability to get health insurance is one of the biggest burdens on low-income families, particularly those working for low wages and few or no benefits.\n\nObamacare has helped 16.4 million Americans get health insurance. Where would they turn? And Republicans would compound the damage: The Senate proposes cutting an additional $400 billion from Medicaid over a decade, the House more than double that. Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes that on other low-income programs, the Senate budget cuts even more than the House\u2019s. The vagueness of these plans makes it hard to tally how much damage would be done to food stamps, Pell Grants for low-income college students and the like, but Greenstein estimates that about two-thirds of the cuts in both plans come \u201cfrom programs for the less fortunate, thereby exacerbating poverty and inequality.\u201d\n\nGreenstein concludes that under such proposals \u2014 here\u2019s hoping President Obama is relentless in blocking them \u2014 \u201cours would be a coarser and less humane nation with higher levels of poverty and inequality, less opportunity\u201d and an \u201cinadequately prepared\u201d workforce.\n\nAnother bit of hypocrisy: These budget writers care so much about national security that they\u2019re not willing to raise a dime in taxes to cover their sharp increases in defense spending. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called out his conservative colleagues for how differently they treat defense and social spending.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always telling us the deficit is so bad we\u2019ve got to cut programs for the elderly, for the sick and for the poor,\u201d Sanders said, \u201cand suddenly, all of that rhetoric disappears.\u201d\n\nBudgets are, by their nature, boring. That\u2019s why those who assemble these long columns of numbers figure they can assail the well-being of the least privileged people in our society even as they profess to care about them so much.\n\nI\u2019d respect these folks a lot more if they said what they clearly believe: They think more inequality would be good for us. It almost makes you nostalgic for the candor of the Mitt Romney who spoke about the \u201c47 percent\u201d and the Paul Ryan who once divided us between \u201cmakers\u201d and \u201ctakers.\u201d Honesty beats saccharine words about the struggles of working people any day.\n\nRead more from E.J.
