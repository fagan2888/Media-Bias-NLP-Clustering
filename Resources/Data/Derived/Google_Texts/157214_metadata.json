The second came on a gutsy, fourth-and-2 call from the Navy 13-yard line. With the Falcons expected to run, Pearson delivered a strike to receiver Garrett Brown, who was wide open in the end zone. It was Brown\u2019s second touchdown of the game and iced the victory with 35 seconds left.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be a touchdown if we could get the pass off,\u201d Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said. \u201cThat\u2019s because of how many guys the Navy defense was bringing. But we had to get the pass off.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a great call,\u201d Pearson said.\n\nThe Falcons (4-1) never trailed, but it took some special heroics late to secure the victory that ended Navy\u2019s two-game winning streak over Air Force and put the Falcons in position to win the trophy for the first time since 2011. Air Force can claim the trophy by winning Nov. 13 at Army.\n\nThe Midshipmen didn\u2019t surrender their grip on the trophy easily. After a 22-yard field goal by Will Conant put the Falcons ahead 24-14 with 4:27 left in the game, Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds rallied his team with a 40-yard touchdown pass to DeBrandon Sanders and suddenly Air Force\u2019s lead was down to three with 2:14 remaining.\n\nNavy coach Ken Niumatalolo called for an onside kick, but Air Force\u2019s Jalen Robinette went up like he was going for a rebound, fielded the high bounce and returned it 13 yards to the Navy 32-yard line. The clinching touchdown followed.\n\n\u201cIt was a perfect bounce,\u201d said Robinette. \u201cI jumped up and got it, saw the hole and tried to get some yards.\u201d\n\nRobinette also was the catalyst on a trick play in the first half that resulted in a 54-yard touchdown pass to Brown. Robinette took a lateral from Pearson before finding Brown down the sideline.\n\nThe Falcons settled down in the second half after a rash of penalties in the first half. They were tagged with three unnecessary roughness calls, one calling back a touchdown on an interception and ejection of cornerback Justin DeCoud for striking with his elbow.\n\n\u201cTo play this game you have to be passionate,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cBut I think in the first half, we let the fire play us.\u201d\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Air Force Falcons toss 4 TD passes to defeat Navy", "title": "Air Force Falcons toss 4 TD passes to defeat Navy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/04/air-force-falcons-toss-4-td-passes-to-defeat-navy/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141004_050333_air-force.jpg", "height": 488}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141004_050333_air-force.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-04T17:00:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T13:30:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Air Force Academy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc60e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI thought it would be a touchdown if we could get the pass off,\u201d Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said.\nAir Force can claim the trophy by winning Nov. 13 at Army.\nThe Falcons settled down in the second half after a rash of penalties in the first half.\nPearson connected on a 32-yard strike to tight end Garret Griffin, completing a 15-play, 75-yard drive that opened the second half and pushed Air Force to a 21-14 lead.\nAIR FORCE ACADEMY \u2014 After playing as if they were a band of roughnecks in the first half, the Air Force Falcons discarded the extra stuff and turned to solid football in the second half, earning a hard-fought 30-21 victory over Navy on Saturday at Falcon Stadium."}
