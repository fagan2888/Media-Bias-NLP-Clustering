After that, it gradually phases down to a permanent matching rate of 90 percent in 2020.\n\nSavings identified\n\nCurrently, Kansas spends nearly $30 million a year to cover a portion of the losses sustained by hospitals, clinics and mental health centers for care provided to uninsured patients. And it spends nearly $87 million annually to provide health care to prison inmates and mental health services to uninsured Kansans. Much of that spending, Bachrach said, would no longer be necessary if Kansas expanded eligibility for its Medicaid program \u2014 known as KanCare \u2014 to adults earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $16,105 annually for an individual and $32,913 for a family of four.\n\nThe analysis says expansion also would reduce the number of Kansans seeking disability determinations, which would save millions more. Disability determinations in Oregon dropped from 7,000 to 1,400 in the first year after it expanded eligibility for Medicaid.\n\nIn addition, expanding KanCare would increase the $47 million generated by a privilege tax levied on the managed care organizations that operate the state Medicaid program since it was privatized in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe potential benefit to the state budget alone indicates that legislators can no longer afford to simply say \u2018no\u2019 to KanCare expansion,\u201d the foundation members of Kansas Grantmakers in Health said in a letter sent to Kansas legislators with a copy of the analysis.\n\nThe letter criticized Gov. Sam Brownback and legislative leaders for paying millions to a consultant to identify savings and efficiencies while ignoring Medicaid expansion, which they said \u201ccould be saving the state millions of dollars right now, while providing more than 150,000 uninsured Kansans health coverage.\u201d\n\nTom Bell, president and CEO of the Kansas Hospital Association, said the new analysis corroborates studies done by his organization.\n\n\u201cIt says that not only does expansion pay for itself, it could actually help the state budget,\u201d Bell said.\n\nA group that produces the state\u2019s official revenue estimate, which the governor and Legislature are required to use in the budgeting process, recently lowered its projections for the 2016 budget year by $159 million, even though lawmakers passed the largest tax increase in state history in the 2015 session.\n\nWhen the state closed the books on November, tax receipts topped the revised estimate by $7.7 million.\n\nExpansion bill in the works\n\nBell said KHA is working with select legislators to write a Medicaid expansion bill for the 2016 legislative session.\n\n\u201cWe want to get something introduced early in the session that is based on plans that have been adopted in other red states \u2014 states with Republican governors,\u201d he said.\n\nIndiana's expansion plan, approved by federal officials in January, requires beneficiaries to help pay for private coverage by contributing to a Personal Wellness and Responsibility, or POWER, account. The state also contributes to the account, which beneficiaries can use to cover out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nThe amount that beneficiaries are required to pay toward their coverage varies based on their income and is limited to no more than 2 percent of their income.\n\nThe recent closure of Mercy Hospital in the southeast Kansas community of Independence has prompted some legislative opponents of expansion to take a second look at the issue. However, Brownback and many Republican leaders remain strongly opposed, in part because they say they don\u2019t want to extend coverage to non-disabled adults until support services that help Kansans with disabilities to live independently are provided to all who need them.\n\nKansans with disabilities currently receive health care through KanCare, but thousands are on waiting lists for support services.\n\nIn October, Melika Willoughby, Brownback\u2019s deputy communications director, detailed the governor\u2019s opposition to expansion in an email to supporters. She wrote that the governor believes it would be \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d for the state to provide health coverage to low-income Kansans \u201cwho choose not to work\u201d before providing support services to all of the disabled Kansans now on waiting lists.\n\nRep. Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican who chairs the House Health and Human Services Committee, is among those opposed to any expansion plan that doesn\u2019t also clear the waiting lists.\n\n\u201cThe state has a responsibility to provide a health care safety net for the poor, disabled and elderly,\u201d Hawkins recently wrote in the House Republican Caucus blog. \u201cMy concern begins when we expand that to able-bodied adults.\u201d\n\nThe Kansas Department of Health and Environment, the state\u2019s lead Medicaid agency, has estimated that eliminating the waiting lists for Kansans with disabilities will cost the state about $1 billion over 10 years, more than can be covered by the savings estimated in the Manatt analysis.\n\nBell and other expansion advocates say the governor\u2019s insistence that any expansion plan sent to his desk also eliminate the waiting lists is a diversionary tactic intended to derail a discussion that is starting to gather momentum.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see that as a separate issue,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Manatt report cost approximately $50,000.
