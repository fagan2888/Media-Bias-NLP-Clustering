Ronnie Hillman and C.J. Anderson combined for 18 carries and 62 yards against Pittsburgh last week. Those numbers aren\u2019t terrible, but with the Broncos up big in the first half, that\u2019s the time to run the ball well and they couldn\u2019t do it. Brock Osweiler threw 44 passes, way too many. Cincinnati has the NFL\u2019s fifth-best run defense \u2014 led by tough-to-block tackle Geno Atkins, who is having a great year.\n\nEdge: Bengals\n\nWhen the Bengals run:\n\nDenver, which has the best run defense in the league, held Pittsburgh tailback DeAngelo Williams to 26 yards on 14 carries. The expected return of safety T.J. Ward from an injury should make Denver\u2019s defense even better. Cincinnati plays two tailbacks, Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard, but neither has contributed much on the ground this year.\n\nEdge: Broncos\n\nWhen the Broncos pass:\n\nOsweiler looked like a Pro Bowl quarterback during the first half of the Pittsburgh game, accounting for four touchdowns. But in the second half, he was only 7-of-26 passing for 82 yards and an interception. Emmanuel Sanders\u2019 performance helped produce the offense\u2019s big first half. The Broncos need that type of production for four quarters. Bengals safety Reggie Nelson leads the NFL with eight interceptions and cornerback Adam Jones is playing the best football of his career.\n\nEdge: Bengals\n\nWhen the Bengals pass:\n\nFor the first time in six starts, Osweiler will have more experience than the opponent\u2019s starting QB. Cincinnati\u2019s AJ McCarron will be making only his second start \u2014 and he could be without Tyler Eifert, who leads NFL tight ends with 12 touchdowns. Denver\u2019s pass defense had a rough outing at Pittsburgh but should bounce back Monday.\n\nEdge: Broncos\n\nSpecial teams:\n\nAdam Jones is more than a veteran cornerback. He also is the Bengals\u2019 best specialist. Jones is averaging 11.2 yards per punt return and is a threat to score every time he touches the ball. Broncos punter Britton Colquitt has struggled most of the season, giving opponents great field position at the worst time. Colquitt\u2019s average of 43.6 yards per attempt is fifth-worst among NFL punters. Cincinnati\u2019s Mike Nugent and Denver\u2019s Brandon McManus have been solid place- kickers all season.\n\nEdge: Bengals\n\nWho steps up?\n\nLast week at Pittsburgh, it was Emmanuel Sanders with a career-high 181 yards receiving for the Broncos. But most of his production came during the first half, and there wasn\u2019t anyone to help carry the load. It can\u2019t all be on Brock Osweiler. Sanders, Demaryius Thomas, Vernon Davis, C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman all need to step up and contribute to get the Denver offense playing better. Monday\u2019s game in Denver probably will be decided by which team has the most playmakers step up and contribute.\n\nPlay four quarters\n\nThe Broncos looked like a Super Bowl team in the first half of the Pittsburgh game, but for the third consecutive week laid an egg in the second half. They have been outscored 36-0 in the second half of the past three games, losing two. Coach Gary Kubiak says he will make different halftime adjustments, but it\u2019s about the players on the field. The offense can\u2019t take its foot off the pedal and expect the defense to bail it out.\n\nMission on D: Stop A.J.\n\nPittsburgh wide receivers burned Denver\u2019s secondary. Poor tackling and penalties hurt the Broncos\u2019 coverage. The big threat this week is Cincinnati star A.J. Green, a 6-foot-4, 207-pound wide receiver who ranks sixth in the NFL in yards receiving. Denver cornerback Aqib Talib probably will draw the bulk of the snaps against Green. Tyler Eifert, Cincinnati\u2019s Pro Bowl tight end, may not be able to play because of a concussion.\n\nBengals at Broncos: 6:30 p.m. Monday; ESPN, KTVD-20; 850 AM, 94.1 FM, 103.5 FM", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos vs. Bengals Week 16: Who has the edge?", "title": "Broncos vs. Bengals Week 16: Who has the edge?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/26/broncos-vs-bengals-week-16-who-has-the-edge/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151226__BN20151227_Z00_BNSP28GAMEPLANp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151226__BN20151227_Z00_BNSP28GAMEPLANp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T15:10:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:14:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Edge: BroncosWhen the Broncos pass:Osweiler looked like a Pro Bowl quarterback during the first half of the Pittsburgh game, accounting for four touchdowns.\nThe expected return of safety T.J.
