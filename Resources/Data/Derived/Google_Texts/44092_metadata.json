Any exposure to the health care system can get you in trouble.\n\nIt\u2019s especially scary when healthy people enter the system \u2013 often in the name of prevention. Remember that the most likely outcome of a medical intervention in a person without complaints is harm. How can we make a person who says he is well any better?\n\nThe newest scourge is the treatment of risk factors \u2013 not diseases. It\u2019s routine for me to see people admitted to the hospital because of side effects from drugs or procedures used to treat risk factors.\n\nThis morning, thanks to my friend Dr. Richard Lehman (University of Oxford), I found this trove of writing from Iona Heath. Dr Heath, a former president of the Royal College of General Practitioners, has written beautifully and extensively about the harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.\n\nI loved her 15-minute Plenary Lecture here:\n\nAnd her PowerPoint below addresses the ethical implications of excessive prevention, including the inconvenient truth of cancer screening. Pay attention to the image of how the creation of fear is like a stain in clear water\u2013it can never be removed.\n\nEthical implications of excessive prevention\n\nHer words inspire me to think differently, to think deeply. I hope they do the same for you.\n\nPhoto: Flickr user B\u00f9i Linh Ng\u00e2n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Remember that the most likely outcome of a medical intervention in a person without complaints is harm.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Remember that the most likely outcome of a medical intervention in a person without complaints is harm.", "title": "Overdiagnosis via data and greed: One doctor\u2019s view of a malevolent downside in medical technology", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/elderly_flickr_B\u00f9iLinhNg\u00e2n.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-19T07:50:10-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2016/01/overdiagnosis-medical-harm/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/elderly_flickr_B\u00f9iLinhNg\u00e2n.jpg", "creator": "@drjohnm", "description": "Remember that the most likely outcome of a medical intervention in a person without complaints is harm.", "card": "summary", "title": "Overdiagnosis through data and greed (video)"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Iona Heath, overdiagnosis, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Hospitals", "tag": "overdiagnosis", "published_time": "2016-01-18T09:20:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-19T07:50:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf4e3\"", "article_summary": "Dr Heath, a former president of the Royal College of General Practitioners, has written beautifully and extensively about the harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.\nI loved her 15-minute Plenary Lecture here:And her PowerPoint below addresses the ethical implications of excessive prevention, including the inconvenient truth of cancer screening.\nEthical implications of excessive preventionHer words inspire me to think differently, to think deeply.\nThis morning, thanks to my friend Dr. Richard Lehman (University of Oxford), I found this trove of writing from Iona Heath.\nRemember that the most likely outcome of a medical intervention in a person without complaints is harm."}
