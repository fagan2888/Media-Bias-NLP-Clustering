Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, SD

The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe is the first tribe in South Dakota to ban smoking in indoor public spaces.

The Smoke-Free Air Act bans smoking cigarettes inside restaurants, workplaces, and tribal offices. The act also requires that cigarette smoke be kept at least 50 feet away from building entrances. Electronic cigarettes are also banned from these spaces.

Fifty-one percent of Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe members smoke, compared to a 19 percent national average. Smokers and non-smokers in the tribe agreed, however, that public air should be protected from secondhand smoke.

The act received overwhelming support from tribal members.

The state of South Dakota passed a similar ban in 2010.
