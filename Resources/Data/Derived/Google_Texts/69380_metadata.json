For his 9/11 tribute this year, comedian Anthony Atamanuik, a \u201c30 Rock\u201d regular, made \u201cThe Tony Show,\u201d an artificial re-creation of a show from Sept. 4, 2001, complete with silly blather about George W. Bush, Gary Condit, shark attacks and Andrea Yates.\n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s performance at the Upright Citizens Brigade East, we talked with him about pre- and post-9/11 comedy. Edited excerpts:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal: What\u2019s it like digging into the past to remember what we were talking about that week?\n\nMr. Atamanuik: First you\u2019re just like, oh, Aaron Brown! I remember him! But after that, you realize: It\u2019s so hard. That\u2019s the crazy thing. You can\u2019t even find Connie Chung\u2019s interview with Gary Condit. Even when people talk about something that happened beforehand, they only do that in the context of \u201cpre-9/11.\u201d\n\nWhat struck you the most?\n\nWe were in such a navel-gazing malaise of riches. Nothing was happening. The stories were \u201cWhat is Bush going to do with the surplus?\u201d And Michael Jordan, this basketball legend, coming back to the sport. And the NYPD being strained by a Michael Jackson concert. And Britney Spears. And George Clooney. I mean, we had two Americans kidnapped in Afghanistan, and that was like the fifth page of the newspaper. Nobody cared.\n\nThere\u2019s a moment where you mention the Taliban, and you describe them as \u201cthe people who blew up the twin\u2026Buddha statues.\u201d I had totally forgotten about those.\n\nIt\u2019s so, so, so, so easy to forget. It\u2019s easy to remember \u201cnever forget\u201d because that\u2019s a short little phrase. But to actually never forget is hard. Look back at the covers of Time magazine. It was \u201cthe summer of the shark\u201d because, like, a guy got bit in Florida or South Carolina.\n\nYou had one sketch that was very on-the-nose, a fake audition you did for \u201cMADtv\u201d about a cartoonishly evil Arab who wants to learn how to fly a plane but not how to takeoff or land.\n\nWe did that because it could\u2019ve been on the air. That\u2019s how na\u00efve we were. We would make jokes. It was almost tempting fate.\n\nLike that eerie ad about how the Twin Towers could withstand a plane crash.\n\nExactly.\n\nYou worked on \u201c30 Rock,\u201d which brilliantly satirized the post-9/11 mentality in a season-two episode. It\u2019s not as if 9/11 can\u2019t be funny, that you can\u2019t find the humor around it. So why avoid it?\n\nI was going to do just a normal show. You know, our whole thing here is we do a different show every week. Last week was all about Syria. Next week is about weed. The week after that is a \u201cSleep No More\u201d-style retelling of \u201cTootsie.\u201d But I feel like we\u2019re in that same malaise. The president is just beating the drum on Syria, and we\u2019re using Facebook and Twitter to talk about twerking. It\u2019s sort of like how Columbine feels like it was generations ago. So that\u2019s how we get these new disasters.\n\nCreatively, it must be hard to think of a new approach to 9/11 every year. It\u2019s sort of like, well, how many different ways are there to do Mother\u2019s Day or Thanksgiving?\n\nThis is going to sound sick, but I enjoy 9/11 in this way: In the footage, you hear in the reporters\u2019 voices the fear, but also the excitement and adrenaline. There\u2019s something big and fiery. And literally they\u2019re replaying the footage within 20 minutes. If we really didn\u2019t like 9/11, if it really traumatized us that much, we wouldn\u2019t rebroadcast that footage for four hours. It\u2019s \u201cShark Week\u201d now. And, look, I had a family friend in one of the towers. It shouldn\u2019t be \u201cShark Week.\u201d It deserves better.\n\nCorrections & amplifications: An earlier version of this blog post called Anthony Atamanuik a writer on \u201c30 Rock.\u201d He portrayed a writer on the program.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "For his 9/11 tribute this year, comedian Anthony Atamanuik, a \"30 Rock\" regular, made \"The Tony Show,\" an artificial re-creation of a show from Sept. 4, 2001, complete with silly blather about George W.
