John Kasich.\n\nIn the middle of a 14-minute screed against governors who have rejected Obamacare expansion, \u201cLast Week Tonight with John Oliver\u201d featured a clip of pro-expansion Kasich talking with CNN host Jake Tapper in May.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t support Obamacare, I want to repeal it, but I did expand Medicaid because I was able to bring Ohio money back home to treat the mentally ill, the drug-addicted, and to help the working poor get health care,\u201d Kasich said.\n\n\u201cBecause you oppose Obamacare doesn\u2019t mean when you have an opportunity to bring these $14 billion of Ohio money back to Ohio \u2014 that\u2019s not Obamacare, that\u2019s Medicaid,\u201d Kasich continued.\n\n\u201cGood for him! Good for him,\u201d Oliver said, after describing Kasich and three other Obamacare expansion supporters as \u201cfiscally conservative Republican governors\u201d and \u201cfirm opponents of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nShared by Time, The Washington Post, New York Magazine, The Week, Rolling Stone and a bevy of left-wing blogs, the YouTube video of Oliver\u2019s \u201cMedicaid Gap\u201d segment had 1.8 million views within four days.\n\nContrary to what Kasich said in the clip promoted by Oliver, Obamacare expansion is paid for with new federal spending. Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion is not paid for with \u201c$14 billion of Ohio money.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Research Service has confirmed Obamacare expansion is paid for with money taken from federal taxpayers across the country, not some stockpile of state money governors can opt to \u201cbring home.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has repeatedly clarified Obamacare costs federal taxpayers more with every state that implements the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion; there is no predefined pot of funding being divvied up.\n\nNone of this stopped Oliver and his writers from using presidential candidate and \u201cfiscally conservative Republican governor\u201d Kasich\u2019s refuted rhetoric against Obamacare expansion opponents.\n\n\u201cThe frequent argument for states refusing the expansion is that they couldn\u2019t bear the increased costs,\u201d Oliver said when introducing the Kasich clip Sunday night.\n\nKasich\u2019s decision to put working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities on Medicaid under Obamacare has already cost federal taxpayers more than $5 billion. Ohio taxpayers will be on the hook for at least $20 million per month starting in 2017.\n\nThe governor\u2019s complete May interview with Tapper is available on CNN\u2019s website, posted under the headline, \u201cKasich says he\u2019s not an Obamacare hypocrite.\u201d\n\nTapper\u2019s reaction, seen in the clip used for the \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d segment, reflected his shock at Kasich insisting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is separate from Obamacare.\n\nSince first telling state lawmakers Obamacare expansion would be paid for with \u201cOhioans\u2019 federal tax dollars\u201d in 2013, the Kasich administration has failed to respond to questions about the claim.\n\nBefore popping up Sunday on HBO, Kasich\u2019s \u201c$14 billion in Ohio money\u201d talking point hadn\u2019t appeared in the press for months. Kasich seems to have stopped repeating the line when asked about Obamacare on the campaign trail.\n\nStephen Colbert, who worked with Oliver on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d on Comedy Central, will interview Kasich later this week; Kasich is scheduled for an appearance with Colbert on CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show\u201d Friday night.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HBO comic John Oliver attacked critics of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion Sunday night, with help from Ohio Gov.
