Vice President Joseph R. Biden waded into the controversy over the New England Patriots‘ allegedly using deflated footballs during their win in the AFC Championship Sunday, saying that as a former receiver, he prefers a softer ball.

“Having been a receiver, I like a softer ball — that’s all I can tell you,” he said when asked about it on “CBS This Morning.”

ESPN reported early Wednesday that the NFL found 11 of the 12 Patriots game balls were inflated significantly less than the league requires; the Patriots have indicated they’re cooperating with the investigation.

Deflated footballs can be easier to handle and catch, and there were rainy conditions during Sunday’s game, which the Patriots won 45-7 over the Indianapolis Colts.
