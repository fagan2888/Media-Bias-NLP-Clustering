Accenture Buys VC-Backed Cloud Sherpas, Joins Growing Group of Buyers

Other strategic buyers that have acquired cloud services recently include Amazon Web Services and Perfect Commerce

Business consulting firm Accenture plc (NYSE: CAN) is acquiring venture capital-backed Cloud Sherpas for an undisclosed amount.

Cloud Sherpas, based in Atlanta and founded in 2007, helps organizations integrate cloud services such as Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE: CRM) and ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE: NOW). The target has VC backing from Columbia Capital, Delta-v Capital, Greenspring Associates and Queensland Investment Corp.

Accenture chief technology officer Paul Daugherty says the acquisition of Cloud Sherpas has good timing because more of the companyâ€™s clients are using cloud-based software in their respective businesses.

The purchase of Cloud Sherpas continues a dealmaking spree for Accenture. In August, the company acquired Schlumberger Business Consulting and Total Logistics and in July, Accenture bought PacificLink Group.

Meanwhile, cloud-based software companies continue to attract buyer interest. Some other recent deals include Amazon Web Services Inc. (AWS) buying Elemental Technologies Inc. and Perfect Commerce closing a deal for a controlling stake in Hubwoo SA.

Goldman Sachs & Co. (NYSE: GS) and Kirkland & Ellis LLP are advising Accenture.
