A clinic aimed at providing health care to an underserved population – one of the hallmarks of the Affordable Care Act or “Obamacare” – was opened yesterday inside the ShopRite supermarket on Liberty Heights Avenue in Howard Park.

The Park West QCare Health Clinic will be open seven days a week to provide primary and preventative care to persons of all ages regardless of their ability to pay.

The clinic is one of the first Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) convenient care clinics in Maryland.

The federally-subsidized program was started in 2000, but was greatly expanded following the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which set aside $11 billion nationwide to expand the FQHC system to “medically underserved populations” in urban and rural areas.

Getting a health clinic to the Northwest Baltimore community has been a top priority of the Howard Park Civic Association, said its president, Preston Greene. The opening of the mega-sized ShopRite in July ended the community’s status as a local “food desert.” Yesterday, the store was packed with customers.

The clinic’s opening was attended by 5th District Councilwoman Rochelle “Rikki” Spector, who said she also represented Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake “who’s busy providing pitching advice to the Orioles,” and State Del. Samuel I. “Sandy” Rosenberg (41st).
