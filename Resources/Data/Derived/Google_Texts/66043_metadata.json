Nothing beats a hot shower, followed by settling into a freshly made bed in a terrycloth robe to watch mediocre television with a glass of wine. No one bothers you and for an exquisite moment in time, you have nary a care in the world.\n\nThen the realization hits. You\u2019ve forgotten your toothbrush at home! You\u2019re going to have to call the snooty concierge. You\u2019re going to have to smile and tip and say thank you. You\u2019ll have to deal with people.\n\nRelated: The Rise of Robots and the Decline of Jobs Is Here\n\nThis conundrum is soon to be extinct, though, if Starwood hotels\u2019 latest idea catches on.\n\nThe chain of hotels has introduced the Botlr (the name is a cringe-worthy hybrid of \u2018robot\u2019 and \u2018butler\u2019), a three-foot tall service robot designed by California startup Savioke. Designed to evoke the tux-wearing butlers of old, this high-tech helper is dispatched by a human bellman after a customer calls the front desk. It then navigates its way through the hotels\u2019 maze of corridors and elevators to bring critical sundries to your door. Crisis averted.\n\nSLIDESHOW: 12 Jobs We're Losing To Robots\n\nLike the pizza drone and the Dutch gas pump jockey before it, this newest tech wonder looks to be another item in a long list of robots that threatens to crush jobs and wreak poverty among workers, only to become a minor marketing gimmick.\n\nEven Starwood execs are remaining somewhat reserved on the matter: \u201cIt is certainly not replacing our staff, but it is augmenting our ability to service our customers,\u201d Brian McGuinness, senior vice president for Starwood\u2019s Aloft line of hotels, told CNBC, adding that he only foresees one or two Botlrs at most per hotel.\n\nLooking a little more threatening, though, is the new unnamed burger-bot from Momentum Machines. Supposedly able to produce an entire burger from prep to finish, this robot stamps out the patties, slices tomatoes and onions, cooks the patties in a specialized oven, then bags the finalized burger \u2013 all in record time.\n\nRelated: Millennials vs. Robots\u2014Who Will Win the Jobs?\n\nSounds complicated. But perhaps not as difficult as the robotic Sushi chefs that have become the darlings of a chain of fast food sushi restaurants in Japan.\n\nThe creators of this burger-bot estimate that this machine can get through about 360 burgers an hour, according to a press release from its creator \u2013 far more than the average minimum-wage fast-food worker eyeing the clock before break time.\n\nThere\u2019s no beat-around-the-bush PR with this one, either. Momentum co-founder Alexandros Vardakostas intends to take over the entire fast food world. As he told Xconomy: \u201cOur device isn\u2019t meant to make employees more efficient\u2026 It\u2019s meant to completely obviate them.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see.\n\nFor now, though, check out this list of other jobs robots are stealing from us (with varying degrees of efficiency).\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Hotel rooms for the introverts among us are an anti-social haven.", "title": "From Bellhops to Burger Flippers, Robots Look to Steal Even More Jobs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/13/Bellhops-Burger-Flippers-Robots-Look-Steal-Even-More-Jobs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08142014_Botlr_2.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/13/Bellhops-Burger-Flippers-Robots-Look-Steal-Even-More-Jobs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08142014_Botlr_2.PNG", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@lumbology"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Hotel rooms for the introverts among us are an anti-social haven.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec47\"", "article_summary": "For now, though, check out this list of other jobs robots are stealing from us (with varying degrees of efficiency).\nRelated: The Rise of Robots and the Decline of Jobs Is HereThis conundrum is soon to be extinct, though, if Starwood hotels\u2019 latest idea catches on.\nThe chain of hotels has introduced the Botlr (the name is a cringe-worthy hybrid of \u2018robot\u2019 and \u2018butler\u2019), a three-foot tall service robot designed by California startup Savioke.\nAs he told Xconomy: \u201cOur device isn\u2019t meant to make employees more efficient\u2026 It\u2019s meant to completely obviate them.\u201dWe\u2019ll see.\nNo one bothers you and for an exquisite moment in time, you have nary a care in the world."}
