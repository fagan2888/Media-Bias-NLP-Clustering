Brian Sandoval, who may well be on his way to coasting to re-election in 2014.\n\nThe lack of a challenger makes for insider-type gossip about whom the Democrats might choose, but that chatter ignores another possibility: Democrats might choose to back nobody against Sandoval.\n\nIf they have made the calculation that beating Sandoval is too difficult, backing no candidate for governor could keep an unexcited Republican electorate at home. After all, there\u2019s no U.S. Senate race and no presidential race in 2014 to entice Republicans to vote.\n\nSo if the only marquee race is for governor, and there is no competition, then there\u2019s no compelling race.\n\nThat scenario might make the election a bit of a snoozer. But it could help Democrats, who believe they have a better organization and a superior ability to turn out voters on Election Day. Democrats have about 100,000 more registered, active voters than Republicans in Nevada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting concept because there is an argument to be made that if there\u2019s no top-of-the-ticket race, then the election for the down-ballot races comes down to who has the better infrastructure and better organization,\u201d one Democratic operative said.\n\nDemocrats could then focus on keeping a majority in the state Senate and electing a Democratic lieutenant governor, which would throw a wrench into any possibility that Sandoval would run for U.S. Senate in 2016 or take a Cabinet appointment under a Republican president because Sandoval would have to vacate the governor\u2019s office and hand the keys to a Democratic lieutenant governor.\n\nSo backing no Democrat makes some sense to some political followers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always been an interesting dilemma and an interesting debate,\u201d said Billy Vassiliadis, a top Nevada political consultant and CEO at R&R Partners, a Las Vegas advertising agency. \u201cI think the consultants probably come down 50-50 and the pundits come down 50-50 (on that scenario).\u201d\n\nAlthough some Democrats may scoff at the scenario and demand a more liberal governor, others may have conceded that living with a moderate Republican who embraced key aspects of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law isn\u2019t so bad.\n\nIn addition, Nevada\u2019s governor shrugs off scandals, exudes optimism and polls well among Nevadans. His re-election campaign has secured funding from Nevada\u2019s powerful mining and gaming industries.\n\nFew Democrats want to get steamrolled as the Sandoval re-election train rolls toward the Nov. 4, 2014, election.\n\nBut Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said the race should be competitive. Asked whether the Nevada Democratic Party will back a candidate for governor in 2014, he said: \u201cSure. Why wouldn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nThe downside to the strategy of running nobody is that it assumes Sandoval will stay silent and not get involved in the lieutenant governor\u2019s race and in state Senate races.\n\n\u201cThe fear that you see on the Democratic side when you talk about that scenario is that it allows him to spend all the money and spread all the money around,\u201d said a Nevada political operative doing work with Democrats. \u201cEven if it\u2019s noncompetitive, still he can expend all of those resources, and that would mean donating to other Republicans.\u201d\n\nWhat Democrats do largely depends on the decision of one man.\n\nClark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak has been publicly mulling a bid to challenge Sandoval but has said it\u2019d be an uphill battle.\n\nHe\u2019s not up for re-election in 2014. He has money left over from his commissioner campaign that he could pour into a race for governor. And operatives assume he\u2019d be able to raise money from people who want to stay on the good side of the chairman of the Clark County Commission.\n\nBut if he sees no path to victory, he might decline to enter the race.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the kind of guy to run to send messages,\u201d Vassiliadis said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very calculating, very deliberative guy. I would assume he\u2019s waiting to see how this unfolds.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s running out of time, however.\n\nFew political consultants see any benefit in launching a statewide campaign during the holiday season. So any potential candidate would likely launch a campaign in January or February. The deadline to file for election is March 14.\n\nSome big names have ruled out bids for the office.\n\nDemocratic Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto and Secretary of State Ross Miller, who is running for attorney general, aren\u2019t seeking to be the next governor.\n\nRepublicans are still preparing Sandoval\u2019s re-election campaign. \"We fully expect an opponent,\u201d said Jeremy Hughes, campaign manager for Sandoval.\n\nThere will be at least one other person on the ballot. A Democrat named Chris Hyepock has said he\u2019s running for governor. But Reid did not mention Hyepock when talking about the governor\u2019s race. He said the party has \u201cpretty well combed over everyone\u201d and that Sisolak and state Sen. Tick Segerblom \u201care the two names that have come out.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody is going to file,\u201d Vassiliadis said. \u201cDoes anybody credible file? Honest to God, I think it\u2019s a week-by-week thing.\u201d\n\nAsked who the perfect candidate would be, Reid said, \u201cRobert Redford at age 40.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Everybody expects an election to feature a Republican fighting a Democrat.
