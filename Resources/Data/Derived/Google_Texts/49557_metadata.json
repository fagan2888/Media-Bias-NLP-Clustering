In Illinois you have 90 days to transfer your license once you move from another state. Cavallari has been in Illinois for longer than 90 days so technically she broke the law.\n\nThe Hills star did point out, however, that she still owns property in California and is still considered a resident of that state.\n\nCavalarri writes on Twitter: \u201cWho knew having a California drivers license in Illinois was a CRIME to be escorted to the police station to post bail?!! What a morning. FYI\u2026I still have an apartment in LA so I\u2019m a resident of California\u201d\n\nEvanston Police Department spokesman Cmdr. Jay Parrott said that he could have taken Cavalarri\u2019s license, if it was a valid Illinois license, to make sure that she paid the $120 speeding ticket. But since her license was from out of state he had to take her into the station for her to post bond.\n\nKristen Cavalarri said earlier this year that she was enjoying her new mid-western lifestyle in Chicago. Do you think her run in with the Evanston police department has changed her mind?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kristin Cavallari was arrested today for driving with an invalid license.
