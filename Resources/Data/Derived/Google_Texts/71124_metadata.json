Jack Donahue, a Mandeville Republican, would lock in the TOPS payment rate at next year\u2019s tuition level, unless lawmakers vote to raise payments.\n\nThat could cost students more if tuition grows larger but lawmakers don\u2019t boost TOPS payments.\n\nSenators voted 36-0 Wednesday for the bill without debate. The Legislature passed the same measure last year, but then-Gov. Bobby Jindal vetoed it. Gov. John Bel Edwards supports it.\n\nDonahue\u2019s proposal goes to the House for consideration.\n\nTOPS is estimated to cost nearly $300 million in the upcoming school year. But it\u2019s unclear if the program will get full funding because of state budget problems.\n\nTo sign up for free CityBusiness Daily Updates, click here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A proposal to restrict the growth of Louisiana's TOPS free college tuition program has sailed through the Senate.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "The Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "New Orleans CityBusiness", "description": "A proposal to restrict the growth of Louisiana's TOPS free college tuition program has sailed through the Senate.", "title": "Louisiana Senate backs cost containment for TOPS tuition program", "url": "http://neworleanscitybusiness.com/blog/2016/04/14/louisiana-senate-backs-cost-containment-for-tops-tuition-program/", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Louisiana Senate backs cost containment for TOPS tuition program New Orleans CityBusiness", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "fb": {"admins": "julie.a.bernard.3"}, "keywords": "louisiana senate,tops", "google-site-verification": "gdVCBUJ4QW9g1rkIcelpdnM2HXBV63rmk4-TkUk6Zik", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1985\"", "article_summary": "A proposal to restrict the growth of Louisiana\u2019s TOPS free college tuition program has sailed through the Senate.\nThat could cost students more if tuition grows larger but lawmakers don\u2019t boost TOPS payments.\nThe measure by Sen.
