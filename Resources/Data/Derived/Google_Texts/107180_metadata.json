TLC\n\nA woman in Clarksville, Tenn. wound up in the emergency room after allowing her boyfriend to melt a giant gummy bear on her chest during sex.\n\nBecause the sugary ingredients of the gummy bear burn and stick easily, and are clearly not the same as candle wax, the woman quickly discovered that melting that concoction on her skin was a terrible mistake.\n\nBack in March 2011, the couple, known as \u201cMichael\u201d and \u201cJosi,\u201d decided to spice up their bedroom life after 25-year-old Michael gave his girlfriend a giant gummy bear and it sparked an idea. \u201cYou know what\u2019d be hot?\u201d Josi, 24, remembered telling Michael. \u201cLet\u2019s eat this gummy off me. Oh! Let\u2019s melt it and eat it off me. Yeah, that\u2019d be a super hot idea.\u201d\n\nMichael placed the giant gummy bear \u2014 which was almost as big as his head \u2014 into a bowl in the microwave until it was reduced to steaming hot goo. \u201cI\u2019m waiting all excited [thinking], \u2018This is gonna be so much fun,\u2019\u201d Michael recalled.\n\nApparently Josi assumed the melted gummy would cool off immediately once it touched her skin, like melted candle wax. She was wrong. Her skin actually burned so badly that it peeled off. \u201cMy chest was on fire,\u201d she said. They struggled to get the gummy bear off her chest with ice, water, and even butter \u2014 and finally went to the ER. Despite the incident, the couple is now engaged.\n\nTheir story will be featured on the TLC series, \u201cSex Sent Me To The E.R.,\u201d which re-enacts stories of couples who\u2019ve done something pretty stupid during sex that gets them sent to the emergency room.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "gummy bear sex, sex sent me to the er, melted gummy bear sex", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Tennessee woman thought it would be sexy to let her boyfriend melt a giant gummy bear on her chest during sex, but instead it led to a trip to the ER.", "title": "Gummy Bear Sex Sends Couple To ER [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/couple-melts-giant-gummy-bear-during-sex-woman-sent-er-third-degree-burns-276238", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/12/gummy-bear-sexy-time.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Tennessee woman thought it would be sexy to let her boyfriend melt a giant gummy bear on her chest during sex, but instead it led to a trip to the ER.", "title": "Gummy Bear Sex Sends Couple To ER [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/couple-melts-giant-gummy-bear-during-sex-woman-sent-er-third-degree-burns-276238", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/12/gummy-bear-sexy-time.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/12/gummy-bear-sexy-time.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-04-12T16:07:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-12T16:07:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Tennessee woman thought it would be sexy to let her boyfriend melt a giant gummy bear on her chest during sex, but instead it led to a trip to the ER."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2371\"", "article_summary": "TLCA woman in Clarksville, Tenn. wound up in the emergency room after allowing her boyfriend to melt a giant gummy bear on her chest during sex.\nThey struggled to get the gummy bear off her chest with ice, water, and even butter \u2014 and finally went to the ER.\nA Tennessee woman thought it would be sexy to let her boyfriend melt a giant gummy bear on her chest during sex, but instead it led to a trip to the ER.\nYeah, that\u2019d be a super hot idea.\u201dMichael placed the giant gummy bear \u2014 which was almost as big as his head \u2014 into a bowl in the microwave until it was reduced to steaming hot goo.\nBack in March 2011, the couple, known as \u201cMichael\u201d and \u201cJosi,\u201d decided to spice up their bedroom life after 25-year-old Michael gave his girlfriend a giant gummy bear and it sparked an idea."}
