UNLV\u2019s 1990 championship team beat Duke in the title game 103-73, a record margin of victory that still stands.\n\n\u201cJerry\u2019s Runnin\u2019 Rebels, with their national championship and exciting play, put UNLV and Las Vegas on the map, and their impact isn\u2019t going away any time soon,\u201d Reid said yesterday in a statement, mentioning that Tarkanian\u2019s impact off the court was just as important as the on-court results.\n\nTarkanian saw the potential in players who had been passed on by other colleges because of weak academic records, and feuded with the NCAA throughout his career about rule infractions. After leaving UNLV, Tarkanian and his wife, Lois, sued college sports\u2019 governing body for unfairly targeting him, and the NCAA in 1998 settled the case for $2.5 million.\n\n\u2018Brutal NCAA\u2019\n\n\u201cJerry\u2019s mark on American athletics is significant not only because of his coaching ability, but also his fearlessness in taking on the brutal NCAA,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThey controlled, bullied and tried to embarrass him, but he never stopped fighting until they cried uncle. Jerry was finally inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2013, which was long overdue.\u201d\n\nTarkanian\u2019s death came four days after Hall of Fame college basketball coach Dean Smith passed away at the age of 83. Smith coached the University of North Carolina for 36 years and won two national titles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost two icons in the same week,\u201d said University of Kentucky basketball coach John Calipari, who remembered Tarkanian as a \u201cgreat friend\u201d on Twitter. \u201cSad week for all who love this great game.\u201d\n\nOthers throughout the sport of basketball weighed in on Tarkanian\u2019s passing and impact on the game:\n\nUNLV current men\u2019s basketball coach Dave Rice, who was both a player and a coach under Tarkanian:\n\n\u201cThe qualities that make UNLV a great university -- opportunity, self-determination and equality -- are the same qualities that coach Tarkanian ingrained in his teams. The impact of coach\u2019s contributions to our university, our community, his players and all of college basketball, is immeasurable.\u201d\n\nUNLV Athletic Director Tina Kunzer-Murphy:\n\n\u201cHe was a fighter, and his teams reflected that same intensity and fighting spirit. He was never afraid to stand up for a cause, or a person, he believed in -- and nothing was more important to him than fairness. He valued loyalty and dedication above all else, and returned it in equal measure. He coached with intensity, but lived a life defined by generosity.\u201d\n\nDanny Tarkanian, Jerry\u2019s son:\n\n\u201cCoach Tark, my father, the greatest man I have ever known, passed today, to take his place in heaven. I will miss him every day of my life.\u201d\n\nReggie Miller, former NBA All-Star and current NBA commentator:\n\n\u201cHeaven is fielding an unbelievable coaching roster. RIP Coach Jerry Tarkanian, one of the best.\u201d\n\nGeorge Karl, who ranks sixth in NBA history in career coaching victories:\n\n\u201cThe basketball world lost another giant today. May you rest in peace, coach Tarkanian.\u201d\n\nChris Webber, former NBA All-Star who helped the University of Michigan reach the NCAA championship game in 1992 and 1993: \u201cYou inspired many,\u201d said Webber, who posted a photo of himself on Twitter with a towel in his mouth in memory of Tarkanian. \u201cYou believed in kids that the world discarded. The hood will never forget you.\u201d\n\nDonyell Marshall, former NBA player:\n\n\u201cYou made us all fall in love with UNLV. Hopefully heaven has your towel waiting for you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Erik Matuszewski", "twitter": {"description": "Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Cher and Celine Dion couldn\u2019t entertain crowds in Las Vegas the way Jerry Tarkanian and his UNLV Runnin\u2019 Rebels basketball team did, Nevada Senator Harry Reid said after the towel-chomping coach\u2019s death at the age of 84.", "title": "Tarkanian Death Follows Smith in Basketball\u2019s \u2018Sad Week\u2019", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-11/tarkanian-death-follows-dean-smith-in-sad-week-for-basketball", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iD0pF6ZtKlMo/v7/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Erik Matuszewski", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Nevada,NCAA,Harry Mason Reid,Dean Martin,Las Vegas", "news_keywords": "Nevada,NCAA,Harry Mason Reid,Dean Martin,Las Vegas", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-11/tarkanian-death-follows-dean-smith-in-sad-week-for-basketball", "parsely-title": "Tarkanian Death Follows Smith in Basketball\u2019s \u2018Sad Week\u2019", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-11T22:19:48.227Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Cher and Celine Dion couldn\u2019t entertain crowds in Las Vegas the way Jerry Tarkanian and his UNLV Runnin\u2019 Rebels basketball team did, Nevada Senator Harry Reid said after the towel-chomping coach\u2019s death at the age of 84.", "parsely-tags": "Nevada,NCAA,Harry Mason Reid,Dean Martin,Las Vegas,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-02-11T22:19:48.227Z", "parsely-section": "culture", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Cher and Celine Dion couldn\u2019t entertain crowds in Las Vegas the way Jerry Tarkanian and his UNLV Runnin\u2019 Rebels basketball team did, Nevada Senator Harry Reid said after the towel-chomping coach\u2019s death at the age of 84.", "title": "Tarkanian Death Follows Smith in Basketball\u2019s \u2018Sad Week\u2019", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-11/tarkanian-death-follows-dean-smith-in-sad-week-for-basketball", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iD0pF6ZtKlMo/v7/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Cher and Celine Dion couldn\u2019t entertain crowds in Las Vegas the way Jerry Tarkanian and his UNLV Runnin\u2019 Rebels basketball team did, Nevada Senator Harry Reid said after the towel-chomping coach\u2019s death at the age of 84."}, "parsely-post-id": "NJMMIZ6VDKHU01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iD0pF6ZtKlMo/v7/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf03\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost two icons in the same week,\u201d said University of Kentucky basketball coach John Calipari, who remembered Tarkanian as a \u201cgreat friend\u201d on Twitter.\nJerry was finally inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2013, which was long overdue.\u201dTarkanian\u2019s death came four days after Hall of Fame college basketball coach Dean Smith passed away at the age of 83.\nAfter leaving UNLV, Tarkanian and his wife, Lois, sued college sports\u2019 governing body for unfairly targeting him, and the NCAA in 1998 settled the case for $2.5 million.\nRIP Coach Jerry Tarkanian, one of the best.\u201dGeorge Karl, who ranks sixth in NBA history in career coaching victories:\u201cThe basketball world lost another giant today.\nUNLV\u2019s 1990 championship team beat Duke in the title game 103-73, a record margin of victory that still stands."}
