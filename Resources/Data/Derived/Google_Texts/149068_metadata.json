They get the prestige, obviously, of being a teaching hospital. They get the manpower because they have some folks there that can do services for the patient; often at a lower rate. And it\u2019s part of the mission.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilvers says the plan could be a simple contract with a teaching hospital. Beyond that, it might have to legally be separate from the university.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re engaged in a joint venture where they\u2019re going to make investments -- and there\u2019s something more to it than that -- then there are regulations at the state level about how much a state institution can do with private institutions. There clearly are partnerships but they have to follow the rules.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilvers notes that Northeast Ohio has several teaching hospitals, including University and Metro Hospitals in Cleveland, plus Akron Children\u2019s Hospital.
