But Bell, a middle school social studies teacher, had no experience working with drug addicts when he walked into Croy\u2019s office more than three decades ago.\n\n\u201cAll the job candidates came in wearing shiny black shoes but Chet\u2019s shoes were functional and utilitarian, which is my kind of style,\u201d Croy recalled. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have much experience in the arena, but he struck me as engaging and bright and a real compassionate person who could navigate the courts and justice system.\u201d\n\nBell, 60, was recognized last week for his 35 years of leadership in mental health and substance abuse services in Volusia County and across the state. Bell\u2019s Dec. 31 retirement as the CEO of Stewart-Marchman-Act Behavioral Healthcare marks the beginning of a new chapter for the $40 million organization that provides substance abuse treatment and related behavioral services to 21,000 people each year in Volusia and Flagler, Putnam and St. Johns counties.\n\nAs a tribute to his legacy, Stewart-Marchman will rename its Pine Grove Crisis Center after Bell and establish a scholarship fund in his honor, board members announced during a reception Wednesday for Bell at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n\n\u201cTo have my name associated with that facility that helps people in crisis, it\u2019s just an honor,\u201d Bell said.\n\nThose who worked with Bell recall his ability to earn the trust and respect of clients, employees and community leaders as well as his persistence to streamline treatment programs and maintain funding levels during the recession. He also had an open-door policy with clients and found ways to incorporate his philosophy into the most menial tasks, such as emails.\n\nAfter moving to Daytona Beach from Ohio in 1980, Bell was looking to make a career change and responded to a job ad to help coordinate a new program that gave inmates with drug addictions the option of going to rehab as part of their sentence. Croy said this was the first drug court in Volusia County and required the help of former Volusia Circuit Judge James Foxman, who supported the initiative.\n\nBell was in charge of screening inmates to determine if they would be good candidates for rehab. Bell said the job came with a huge learning curve, but he liked having a role in changing the status quo. At the time, the justice system and drug treatment agencies \u201cdid not have a good relationship,\u201d Croy said.\n\n\u201cChet was really valuable as a liaison who worked with the courts,\u201d Croy said. \u201cIt was important for both systems to be able to work together, and I think he helped set the stage for improving treatment in our community and across the state.\u201d\n\nBell said Croy was one of his most important mentors and taught him the importance of being persistent, yet remaining patient.\n\nAfter six years working for Daytona Beach-based Act Corp., which merged with the Volusia County Drug Council in 1982, Bell took a position with the Volusia-Flagler Safety Council for three years. In 1989, Stewart-Marchman Center CEO Ernest Cantley recruited Bell to work as assistant director for the organization.\n\n\u201cHe had a lot of experience in the realm of human services and was very committed to his family,\u201d said Cantley, who retired in 2005. \u201cHe encompassed the family values that we had at (Stewart-Marchman) and was very dedicated to the community.\u201d\n\nAfter Bell became CEO of the Stewart-Marchman Center in 2005, he helped identify a way to streamline services.\n\nClients who struggled with drug addiction often had a history of mental illness, but mental health services and drug treatment were disjointed. Despite sharing office space with Stewart-Marchman, Act. Corp operated separately.\n\nBell helped guide the two agencies through a merger in 2008.\n\nCircuit Judge David Hood served as legal counsel at the time and said Bell put aside his own ambitions to help improve mental health and drug treatment services. The merger meant Bell took on more responsibility as CEO.\n\n\u201cBefore we had personalities in places and no one was willing to compromise, but Bell was the epitome of doing what was best for the community,\u201d Hood said.\n\nBell said the merger not only streamlined care, but it significantly reduced administrative costs. And while he couldn\u2019t predict the housing market crash in 2007, the merger helped preserve programs while many other social service agencies grappled with funding cuts and loss of donations. By lobbying lawmakers, Bell helped maintain state funding levels through the recession.\n\nIvan Cosimi, who has served as chief financial officer for Stewart-Marchman since 1998, stepped in as CEO on Jan. 1. He said Bell has taught him how to lead with his heart.\n\n\u201cChet had his head in (Stewart-Marchman-Act) but he also had his heart in it,\u201d Cosimi said. \u201cThat funnels down through the ranks. It\u2019s contagious. I caught it, too.\u201d\n\nWhile programs have improved, the demand for services is still the agency\u2019s biggest challenge. Most programs have wait lists and clients who need substance abuse treatment or mental health counseling usually can\u2019t afford to wait for care, said Bell, who will remain as a consultant and write grants to expand programs.\n\n\u201cWe have to continue to work so we can be in a position to better serve those who need behavioral health care, and we are nowhere near that at this time,\u201d Bell said.\n\nStewart-Marchman-Act Foundation Chairman John Greaves said Bell never kept a distance between himself and his clients and infused his work philosophy into everything he did.\n\nPerhaps Bell\u2019s mantra was summed up best in his email tagline: \u201cWork hard, work smart, have fun and make a difference one day at a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I could do that every day, I knew I could make a difference,\u201d Greaves said. \u201cWhen you measure the quality of a man\u2019s life, (Chet) is as good as they come.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chet Bell wasn't the most qualified candidate to lead the county's first drug court program when he interviewed for the position in 1980, but it was his well-worn work boots that caught Randy Croy's attention.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-3CE8847B-064E-4103-9541-E5B6F8674941-pubDN"}, "og": {"site_name": "News-JournalOnline.com", "description": "Chet Bell wasn't the most qualified candidate to lead the county's first drug court program when he interviewed for the position in 1980, but it was his well-worn work boots that caught Randy Croy's attention.", "title": "Stewart-Marchman\u2019s Bell honored for 35 years of service in Volusia", "url": "http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20150307/news/150309539", "image": "http://G52-DNweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=DN&Date=20150307&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=150309539&Ref=AR&imageVersion=Teaser", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dbnewsjournal", "card": "summary"}, "publishdate": 20150307, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-150309539-pubDN"}}, "keywords": "Feature,  Coastal Volusia,  Southeast Volusia,  West Volusia,  Flagler,  Feature,  Coastal Volusia,  Southeast Volusia,  West Volusia,  Flagler"}, "article_summary": "By lobbying lawmakers, Bell helped maintain state funding levels through the recession.\nBell helped guide the two agencies through a merger in 2008.\nClients who struggled with drug addiction often had a history of mental illness, but mental health services and drug treatment were disjointed.\nAt the time, the justice system and drug treatment agencies \u201cdid not have a good relationship,\u201d Croy said.\nCircuit Judge David Hood served as legal counsel at the time and said Bell put aside his own ambitions to help improve mental health and drug treatment services."}
