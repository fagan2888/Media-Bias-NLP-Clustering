The decision will be made in the fall, the spokesman said.\n\nMara Keisling, the executive director of the National Center for Trans Equality, said OPM\u2019s treatment of transgender health insurance coverage \u201chas been a frustrating area\u201d for the group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not OK for an employer to say to insurance companies, \u2018We don\u2019t care if you discriminate against our employees,\u2019\u201d Keisling told BuzzFeed News. \u201cIt is just straight-up discrimination, and they can fix it any time they want.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the Obama administration, protections for transgender workers \u2014 including federal employees \u2014 have expanded dramatically. Transgender health care, however, has regularly lagged behind other protections.\n\nIt was only last June when OPM lifted the blanket exclusion that prevented any federal employee health plans from covering transgender health services, including surgery.\n\nThe letter that lifted that blanket exclusion did not, however, mean that federal employee health insurers had to cover transition-related care \u2014 and only a handful did.\n\n\u201cFor 2015, there is at least one [Federal Employee Health Benefit] plan available in every state that provides coverage for a broad range of gender transition related services, including hormone therapy, counseling, and surgery,\u201d OPM spokesman Edmund Byrnes told BuzzFeed News.\n\nOPM, however, allowed many of the plans to continue the exclusion.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act bans sex discrimination in health programs that receive federal funding. In several other contexts \u2014 from employment to education \u2014 the Obama administration has interpreted anti-transgender discrimination as being covered under sex discrimination bans.\n\nIn March, a federal judge in Minneapolis provided the first court interpretation of the Affordable Care Act provision, finding that section 1557 of the health care law \u201cplausibl[y]\u201d covers anti-transgender discrimination under the sex-discrimination ban.\n\nAn OPM spokesperson said he would look into whether OPM viewed that section of the law as barring transition-related care exclusions.\n\nBuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith asked President Obama whether federal employees\u2019 plans should cover such services \u2014 prompted by a question from a transgender federal employee, Emily Prince \u2014 in an interview earlier this year.\n\nObama responded that he hadn\u2019t \u201clooked at that policy,\u201d but he did say, \u201cMy general view is that transgender persons, just like gays and lesbians, are deserving of equal treatment under the law. And that\u2019s a basic principle.\u201d\n\nIn a March letter calling for proposals for next year\u2019s federal employee health plans, OPM explained that the 2014 letter\u2019s treatment of transgender health coverage \u2014 allowing plans to \u201cretain the general exclusion\u201d \u2014 was only \u201c[d]ue to the short timeframe for network development and benefit design\u201d between when the exclusion was lifted and the proposals were due.\n\nAnd yet, Bynes told BuzzFeed News that OPM has not yet decided whether such generalized exclusions will be allowed to continue into the 2016 plans.\n\n\u201cBefore any decisions are made, we need to review carrier proposals and services. Final decisions will be made in the Fall,\u201d he told BuzzFeed News. \u201cOPM removed the [Federal Employee Health Benefit] general exclusion language, but we will not know details of what care and services plans are covering for 2016 until we finalize our benefits [in the] fall.\u201d\n\nThe discussion in the March 13 carrier letter was listed under an \u201caccess to care\u201d section \u2014 which stated that \u201cOPM strongly encourages plans to reassess their benefit offerings as the needs of our population evolve\u201d and noted that other recent coverage expansion included same-sex spouses.\n\n\u201cFor 2016,\u201d OPM stated, \u201cplans may propose services for members with gender dysphoria as they do for all other medical conditions.\u201d Benefit and rate proposals are due to be submitted by May 31.\n\nIn technical guidance provided in a March 17 follow-up carrier letter for health maintenance organizations, OPM was even more specific.\n\n\u201cBeginning with 2016 brochures, Plans should describe their covered benefits for gender transition along with any excluded services, and list any applicable prior authorization requirements or age limits,\u201d the carrier letter states.\n\nKeisling noted that the policy is more than a hypothetical discussion, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s an odd position they have themselves in, but it\u2019s a horrible position they have their trans employees in.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the OPM carrier letters were brought to BuzzFeed News\u2019s attention by Emily Prince, who wrote about them on April 22 \u2014 the same day she was told by her current [Federal Employee Health Benefit] plan provider that it would not cover her gender reassignment surgery.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3759961, "userid": 315836}, "description": "The Office of Personnel Management \"strongly encourages,\" but is not requiring, transition-related coverage to be included in insurance...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
