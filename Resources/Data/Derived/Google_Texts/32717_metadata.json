Nonetheless, I am confident that when Staten Islanders go to the polls this November, they will vote for the only candidate with the dedication, the passion, and the qualifications to be our next district attorney.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "michael-mcmahon, news", "title": "Conservatives support Michael McMahon in race for D.A.", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Conservatives support Michael McMahon in race for D.A.\", \"link\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/06/conservatives_support_michael.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/18007812-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16204335\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-06-05T01:43:02Z\", \"author\": \"Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com\", \"tags\": [\"@elections\",\"@mobile\",\"@pol-newsletter\",\"@politics\",\"@river\",\"michael-mcmahon\",\"news\"] }", "twitter": {"creator": "@Writingrachel", "description": "Democrat Michael McMahon picked up Conservative Party support Thursday evening over Republican Joan Illuzzi.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SIAdvance"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, June 09, 2015,  1:18 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.silive.com/latest_news/photo/nws-mcmahon-92f45b18ea3b4c9e.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"rachelshapiro\", \"author_nickname\": \"Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com\", \"author_id\": \"12017825\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Staten Island Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "SILive.com", "description": "Democrat Michael McMahon picked up Conservative Party support Thursday evening over Republican Joan Illuzzi.", "title": "Conservatives support Michael McMahon in race for D.A.", "url": "http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/06/conservatives_support_michael.html", "image": "http://imgick.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/18007812-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "SILive.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, June 04, 2015,  9:34 PM", "article_author": "Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com", "Description": "Democrat Michael McMahon picked up Conservative Party support Thursday evening over Republican Joan Illuzzi."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbf0\"", "article_summary": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Democrat Michael McMahon has secured Conservative Party backing in the district attorney's race against Republican Joan Illuzzi.\nThe committee's leadership had interviewed both Ms. Illuzzi and McMahon last week in considering which to support in the race.\n\"I'm joyful tonight, but I'm also deeply concerned about conditions as we find them on Staten Island,\" he said.\nIn 2008, Brooklyn Conservatives supported Timothy Cochrane and in 2010 they supported Michael Grimm, leading the state party chairman to decide to support the Brooklyn candidates against McMahon for the ballot line.\nHe received support from Island Conservatives in his 2008 and 2010 runs for Congress but because the congressional district is split between Staten Island and Brooklyn, Brooklyn support for other candidates meant he didn't get the party line on the ballot."}
