Answer: The White House.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has called for an increase in the U.S. minimum wage. And yet his administration expects hundreds of young people each year to work at the White House for an hourly wage of zero.\n\nAccording to a White House website, White House interns are expected to work \u201cat least Monday-Friday, 9 am-6pm.\u201d Nice touch \u2014 \u201cat least.\u201d\n\nIn return for a full week\u2019s worth of work and possible overtime, the White House provides its interns with no pay and no housing help. The latter is significant, because the Washington, D.C., metro area has among the highest costs in the U.S.\n\nThe problem with the unpaid internship program, which Obama inherited from previous Oval Officers and which has continued, is not sweatshop exploitation \u2014 it\u2019s blatant class discrimination.\n\nWhile colleges and other institutions sometimes fund unpaid internships, their major beneficiaries are rich kids. According to BuzzFeed:\n\nInterns living in Washington, one of America\u2019s most expensive cities, told BuzzFeed they wouldn\u2019t be able to do it without serious financial help from the home front. One intern working in the executive branch on foreign policy and law-related issues said he pays his bills \u201cthrough a mix of financial aid and parental support.\u201d (He asked to remain anonymous in case his candor would upset his bosses.) The intern, a 24-year-old third-year law student at UCLA \u2014 a school that offers a small stipend to students with public service internships \u2014 says he\u2019s enjoying his time in D.C. thanks in large part to checks from his parents.\n\nIt gets worse. In many cases, the interns are not only unpaid, but they (or rather their rich parents) are actually subsidizing the White House.\n\nCNN reported on one former White House intern who recounted the costs she paid, in addition to foregone salary income:\n\nAs Emily Jane Fox, a former unpaid White House intern herself, reports for CNNMoney, the White House is coming under pressure from groups like the Fair Pay Campaign to pay the college students who work 9-to-6 jobs (at least) for no money. Fox told me it cost her \u201ca couple thousand dollars\u201d to take a White House internship in 2010. \u201cThink about it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re there for three months. You\u2019re relocating to a new city. You have to pay rent. You have to pay transportation costs to and from the White House.\u201d Plus: She had to buy a suit.\n\nThe Obama administration, like previous administrations, allows rich parents in effect to buy r\u00e9sum\u00e9-enhancing jobs in the public sector for their upper-class offspring. The sale of public offices to rich families was one of the abuses of the Ancien R\u00e9gime that helped to inspire the French Revolution. Like that corrupt premodern practice, unpaid internships are an inherently aristocratic institution. If you are in your late teens or early twenties, and you don\u2019t have a personal trust fund or rich parents who can fund your living expenses as an unpaid intern in Washington, D.C., New York or San Francisco, then you are out of luck.\n\nWhen I say rich kids, I mean really rich kids. We\u2019re talking One Percenters. Even many upper-middle-class parents with professional jobs might not be able to subsidize children with unpaid internships at the White House, Washington think tanks or New York publications and media enterprises.\n\nBecause my own parents were not rich, in my twenties I could never have afforded a job as an unpaid or poorly-paid intern at any of the magazines for which I once worked in my thirties as a writer or editor \u2014 the New Republic, Harper\u2019s Magazine or the New Yorker. Indeed, it was my unscientific impression that the interns at these publications were much richer, in their twenties, thanks to family wealth, than most of the middle-aged editors and writers. An intern at one magazine had a party for the magazine staff at her two-story Midtown Manhattan apartment.\n\nUnpaid internships have the effect, if not the intent, of providing the children of the super-rich with major advantages over the children of the lower 99 percent in the job market after college. Imagine what a benefit a White House internship is on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Too bad that benefit is not available to poor, working-class, middle-class or even upper-middle-class Americans, unless they are lucky enough to find an outside sponsor to pay the wages that the Obama administration refuses to pay.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that elite institutions like magazines and think tanks ration opportunity by discriminating in favor of the sons and daughters of the One Percent by means of unpaid internships. A president who engages in this practice sends a signal to all other employers in the United States: As long as you call a job an \u201cinternship\u201d you are free to discriminate against the majority of Americans who were not born into the upper class.\n\nMikey Franklin, one of the founders of the Fair Pay Campaign, has called on the White House to end the unpaid internship program:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The White House engages in blatant class discrimination by allowing One Percenters to subsidize it", "title": "How the young elite rise in Washington, D.C.", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The White House engages in blatant class discrimination by allowing One Percenters to subsidize it", "title": "How the young elite rise in Washington, D.C.", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/19/how_the_young_elite_rise_in_washington_d_c/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/white_house_money.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The White House engages in blatant class discrimination by allowing One Percenters to subsidize it", "title": "How the young elite rise in Washington, D.C.", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/white_house_money.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Lind", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, class, Editor's Picks, Intern, unpaid interns, White House", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And yet his administration expects hundreds of young people each year to work at the White House for an hourly wage of zero.\nFox told me it cost her \u201ca couple thousand dollars\u201d to take a White House internship in 2010.\nImagine what a benefit a White House internship is on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nIt\u2019s bad enough that elite institutions like magazines and think tanks ration opportunity by discriminating in favor of the sons and daughters of the One Percent by means of unpaid internships.\nAccording to a White House website, White House interns are expected to work \u201cat least Monday-Friday, 9 am-6pm.\u201d Nice touch \u2014 \u201cat least.\u201dIn return for a full week\u2019s worth of work and possible overtime, the White House provides its interns with no pay and no housing help."}
