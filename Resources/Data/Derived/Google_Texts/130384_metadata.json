His signature healthcare initiative is but a likely Supreme Court loss away from elimination, and a 2016 victory by a Republican likely could spell the end of his misguided financial reform legislation as well. His second midterm shellacking in 2014 means there will be no coattails, no legislative program that survives his term.\n\nUtterly unable to convince Congress to go along with his programs, he is attempting to build the legacy with administrative actions on immigration, the environment and elsewhere. But these also are unpopular, perhaps even illegal and quickly undone by a Republican president.\n\nBut there is one area in which this president has excelled, and sadly, future presidents likely will study his work and emulate it. That area is scandal management.\n\nHis approach is raw and brutal, but effective. Subpoenas are for suckers, court orders for losers. Ignore the question, tell a little lie. Don\u2019t be afraid to deny or defy. Ignore. Obfuscate. Give up nothing. Then, when the investigations continue to flail, label them as partisan witch hunts and count on your friends in the media to amplify the message.\n\nFrom the early days of Fast and Furious through last week, his administration has remained largely untouched\u2014though hardly untainted\u2014by scandals far and wide. There is Benghazi, the IRS, the EPA email scandal, monitoring of reporters\u2019 communications, and Operation Choke Point.\n\nThere are many more as well. But what they all have in common is we have not come close to getting to the bottom of them and are not likely to before President Obama leaves office.\n\nThe reason in virtually every case is an iron fist policy in which the \u201cmost transparent administration in history\u201d refuses to provide information, thumbs its nose at court orders, and ignores the powers of its supposedly co-equal branches of government.\n\nConsider just two of the scandals. In 2012, a court ordered then-EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson to turn over 12,000 emails that had gone to her through an email account that had been set up for a fictitious employee named Richard Windsor, frustrating efforts to obtain her correspondence, e.g., via FOIA.\n\nJackson announced her resignation once that order was handed down, to take effect the week her emails began to be made public. When the first of what were to be four tranches of emails were turned over moments before the court-ordered deadline, it contained about a third fewer emails than the court ordered be released, and even those largely consisted of pages upon pages of news clippings of stories written about the agency.\n\nOther than that, at least 80 percent of the material was redacted.\n\nFOIA allows for redaction only of specific information, the most abused of the nine exemptions being for pre-decisional communications\u2014essentially bureaucrat/client privilege. And these withholdings were at least typically abusive of that exemption.\n\nIn one email, Jackson\u2019s press officer tells her she has an interview with a reporter and provides a list of questions she should expect. The questions are redacted, and the exception cited is because they were pre-decisional.\n\nInterestingly, in one email that did slip through the censors, Jackson asked an aide what was EPA\u2019s position on this fracking thing that everyone\u2019s talking about.\n\nIn all, the EPA would turn over fewer than 9,000 of the 12,000 documents, and the court, faced with sorting through massive withholdings of records in full or part, concluded the huge amount of blacked out material could remain secret.\n\nJackson\u2019s successor, Gina McCarthy, appeared to learn from this and began communicating through text messages, seemingly comfortable in the knowledge they would be impossible to discover. And when she was ordered to produce them, she claimed, like the IRS regarding Lois Lerner\u2019s emails, the correspondence had all disappeared.\n\nThe distinction was McCarthy, through counsel, said she had indeed deleted them all but that was because they were all \u201cpersonal.\u201d Every single one of 5,932 texts on her EPA phone over three years was, according to her attorney, \u201cpersonal.\u201d\n\nAs the threat of punishment for destroying what are presumably federal records appears possible, the question is whether the texts will, like Lerner\u2019s emails, be mysteriously discovered. That issue remains pending before a federal court in Washington.\n\nThose trying to get at the truth behind Lerner and the IRS targeting of conservative and pro-Israel groups can identify. So can Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.\n\nGowdy is chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. The committee\u2019s third hearing, held this week, erupted into a partisan shouting match when Gowdy, a former prosecutor who seems dedicated to fairness, finally blew his top about White House obfuscation.\n\nA State Department bureaucrat called to explain the agency\u2019s delays in turning over documents and making witnesses available said it would be easier if Gowdy would let them know the direction he wants to take the investigation. He said he can\u2019t determine this until the State Department turns over the information.\n\nKathleen Sebelius was gone from Health and Human Services before anyone got to the bottom of why she was strong-arming companies that do business with the government for \u201ccontributions\u201d for the Obamacare website. Attorney General Eric Holder will be long gone before anyone gets to the bottom of Fast and Furious.\n\nGina McCarthy is never going to turn over those text messages or the results of the studies that underpin most of our Clean Air Act regulations\u2014even though she solemnly vowed to do so during her confirmation hearing.\n\nAnd nobody will ever get a decent explanation of what made the government think it could tap James Rosen\u2019s phone or monitor Sharyl Attkisson\u2019s computer.\n\nCourts won\u2019t enforce their own orders. Congress won\u2019t enforce its legitimate and legally binding information requests.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s working. President Obama has not figured out how to lead the country to prosperity, but he and his minions have figured out how to get away with virtually anything.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "There is one area in which this president has excelled, and sadly, future presidents likely will study his work and emulate it.", "title": "Obama\u2019s legacy: Obfuscator-in-Chief | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/459299446-480x320.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2015/02/11/obamas-legacy-obfuscator-in-chief/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "There is one area in which this president has excelled, and sadly, future presidents likely will study his work and emulate it.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/459299446-480x320.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "There is one area in which this president has excelled, and sadly, future presidents likely will study his work and emulate it."}}, "article_summary": "President Obama has not figured out how to lead the country to prosperity, but he and his minions have figured out how to get away with virtually anything.\nSubpoenas are for suckers, court orders for losers.\nUtterly unable to convince Congress to go along with his programs, he is attempting to build the legacy with administrative actions on immigration, the environment and elsewhere.\nJackson announced her resignation once that order was handed down, to take effect the week her emails began to be made public.\nBut what they all have in common is we have not come close to getting to the bottom of them and are not likely to before President Obama leaves office."}
