Where other Native Americans dance or celebrate in ceremony for the good of the people, the Hopi run.\n\nWhen Hopi High School in Keams Canyon, Ariz. hired Rick Baker as a physical education instructor back in 1987, school administrators asked him to start a cross-country program. Baker, 56, who grew up in the Hopi village of Tewa and ran cross-country 80 miles away from his home at Winslow High, didn\u2019t just build a program - he built a dynasty.\n\nThe Hopi Bruins won their first Arizona state cross-country championship in 1990 and haven\u2019t lost one since. Their streak of 26 consecutive titles is the longest in the nation for cross-country and the fourth-longest active run for any high school sport, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations.\n\n\u201cRunning isn\u2019t just an exercise in Hopi culture, we\u2019ve been doing it for thousands of years,\u201d Baker told ICTMN. \u201cWe have kids that really want to run. Since we have this tradition of running, they all want to be a part of it. They\u2019re willing to come out and put their heart into it and do everything we ask of them. They don\u2019t want to be the team that breaks the streak, so that\u2019s kind of motivation for us.\u201d\n\nThe streak has had its special moments, including the 1999 race when Hopi posted a perfect score, placing the top five runners. Two runners have gone on to get a college education and become NCAA All-Americans at Northern Arizona University. Now Hopi High is starting to see a new evolution within the program, bringing even closer past ties to present lives.\n\nJuwan Nuvayokva (1993-96) and Devan Lomayaoma (1996-99) are two of the most prominent runners to come through Baker\u2019s program. They combined for five individual state titles in eight years and went on to become college All-Americans at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Nuvayokva, 37, teaches P.E. at the junior high school and is Baker\u2019s assistant.\n\nLomayaoma was the leader in the perfect score in his final race for Hopi High. He, along with Ralston Lamson, Evan Horace, Delwyn Takla and Christopher Lowe finished 1-through-5, respectively Lomayaoma, 33, is now a physical education instructor and coach at Second Mesa Elementary school and preparing young runners for what they will see at the high school level.\n\nBoth Nuvayokva and Lomayaoma grew up listening to stories of legendary Hopi runner Louis Tewanima, a two-time Olympian who was the silver medalist in the 10,000-meter race at the Stockholm Games in 1912.\n\nBoth trained at 6,000 feet above sea level on the 12-village Hopi reservation, which is surrounded by Navajo land. They were always within sight of Humphreys Peak and a mountain range sacred to the Hopi. They took those constant reminders of their heritage and culture with them wherever they went. Now they are back home, helping Hopi High improve on its dynasty one step at a time.\n\nNuvayokva remained humble in his explanation of Hopi running and the culture in an interview with the New York Times. Yes, there is a competitive nature to the sport. But there is also purpose to running that goes far beyond racing to win. Running is as much spiritual as it is physical. Dances involve running. They run for rain, they participate in the cultural runs, running is ingrained into all aspects of their lives. \u201cIt\u2019s different than the Anglo culture, where you run and it\u2019s every man for himself,\u201d Nuvayokva told the Times. \u201cWhen I competed in the NCAA, you\u2019re trying to beat others. Here, you do it for others.\u201d\n\nTheir Hopi High running tradition has come full circle. \u201cThe boys that are running on Rick Baker\u2019s current team actually ran for me a couple of years ago at the elementary level,\u201d Lomayaoma said.\n\nESPN is expected to air a documentary on the Hopi High School running tradition sometime in the spring.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The proud tradition of Hopi runners goes a long distance!", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "vincentschilling", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/01/16/hopi-high-school-cross-country-team-carrying-proud-tradition-163099", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/ap_photo-felicia_fonseca_hopi_high_school_athletes_go_on_a_training_run_in_this_2013_picture.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Hopi High School Cross-Country Team Carrying On Proud Tradition"}, "abstract": "The proud tradition of Hopi runners goes a long distance!", "dc": {"title": "Hopi High School Cross-Country Team Carrying On Proud Tradition"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/01/16/hopi-high-school-cross-country-team-carrying-proud-tradition-163099", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Hopi, Running, Long Distance Running, Rodney Harwood", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2016-01-16T17:20-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Hopi High School Cross-Country Team Carrying On Proud Tradition"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6a9\"", "article_summary": "ESPN is expected to air a documentary on the Hopi High School running tradition sometime in the spring.\nTheir streak of 26 consecutive titles is the longest in the nation for cross-country and the fourth-longest active run for any high school sport, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations.\nHere, you do it for others.\u201dTheir Hopi High running tradition has come full circle.\nWhen Hopi High School in Keams Canyon, Ariz. hired Rick Baker as a physical education instructor back in 1987, school administrators asked him to start a cross-country program.\nNow they are back home, helping Hopi High improve on its dynasty one step at a time."}
