If that doesn\u2019t sound like a funny premise for a 30-minute episode of Comedy Central programming, this probably isn\u2019t the TV show for you.\n\nThe new episode, \u201cObamascare,\u201d takes place as that the President is coming to Brickleberry National Park to present Steve (David Herman) an award. Steve dreads meeting the democratic president, but that ends up being the least of his issues as he needs to be sewn together with Woody (Tom Kenny) so they can share a liver until Obamacare lets Steve get a new one of his own. Hey, at least they decide they\u2019re friends by the end of the episode.\n\nThe antics spiral into crassness from there, but it turns out Obama has a bit of an infatuation with Connie (Roger Black), much to Ethel\u2019s (Natasha Leggero) disbelief. Meanwhile, Bobby (Waco O\u2019Guin) and Bodean (Roger Black) discover that there actually are some perks to being on Obamacare, and that health care can be shared due to marriage. The gay marriage at the end of \u201cObamascare\u201d might be the single great moment of the whole episode.", "article_metadata": {"description": "&quot;Brickleberry&quot; is back with a Season 3 premiere that turns President Obama into a sex-crazed man who considers lesbians a &quot;challenge&quot; and likes sending people pictures of his penis.
