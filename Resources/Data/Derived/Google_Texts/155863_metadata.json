The eminent health care economist and health reform architect is annoyed at Casey Mulligan\u2019s latest, which misrepresents Gruber\u2019s views; mine too.\n\nGruber is right to be mad: that was a disgraceful, deceptive column. But I think you also want to put it into a larger picture: the enduring myth of the stupid progressive economist.\n\nSo about Mulligan: As Gruber documents, he pulls multiple fast ones, asserting things that he says are conclusions of the CBO report when they aren\u2019t \u2014 they\u2019re his own views, pulled out of, um, thin air, or maybe someplace else, which he is projecting onto the budget office to make them seem authoritative.\n\nBeyond that, Mulligan tells his readers that both Gruber and I are too dumb or craven to admit that the disincentives to work created by some aspects of the Affordable Care Act impose economic costs. One suspects that Mulligan didn\u2019t actually read either of the pieces he links to. If he had, he would have found this from Gruber:\n\nBut the likelihood of voluntary reductions in work is not the only issue. The CBO also projects work reduction by individuals who cut back on hours or avoid moving up the job ladder because they don\u2019t want to lose Medicaid eligibility, or because they don\u2019t want to make so much in wages that they would lose tax credits to help pay insurance premiums. Unlike voluntary job leaving, this second kind of work reduction would entail real economic distortions and be a cost, not a benefit.\n\nAnd this from me:\n\nJust to be clear, the predicted long-run fall in working hours isn\u2019t entirely a good thing. Workers who choose to spend more time with their families will gain, but they\u2019ll also impose some burden on the rest of society, for example, by paying less in payroll and income taxes. So there is some cost to Obamacare over and above the insurance subsidies. Any attempt to do the math, however, suggests that we\u2019re talking about fairly minor costs, not the \u201cdevastating effects\u201d Mr. Cantor asserted in his next post on Twitter.\n\nSo both of us acknowledge that there are incentive effects and that they have a cost; but both of us argue on quantitative grounds that the cost isn\u2019t large. Hardly the doctrinaire liberalism Mulligan thinks he sees.\n\nOh, and bonus misrepresentation: Mulligan:\n\nPaul Krugman goes even further and calls it \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d to interpret the marginal tax rate provisions of the Affordable Care Act as destructive.\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I called talk about \u201c2 million jobs destroyed\u201d a misrepresentation, because it is. Who says so? The CBO itself.\n\nOn to the broader point. What one sees in this particular Mulligan piece is something I encounter all the time, in many contexts: the myth of the stupid progressive economist.\n\nIt works like this: Conservatives in general, and conservative economists in particular, often have a very narrow vision of what economics is all about \u2014 namely supply, demand, and incentives. Anything that interferes with the sacred functioning of markets or reduces the incentive to produce must be a bad thing; any time a progressive economist supports policies that don\u2019t fit neatly into this orthodoxy, it must be because he doesn\u2019t understand Econ 101. And conservative economists are so sure of this that they can\u2019t be bothered to actually read what the progressives write \u2014 at the first hint of deviation from laissez-faire, they stop paying attention and begin debating with the stupid progressive in their mind, not the real economist out there.\n\nAs a result, many conservatives seem utterly unable to take on board the notion that people like Jon Gruber or yours truly might understand Econ 101, but also believe with good reason that you need to go beyond that point.\n\nOn the health care issue: yes, there are incentive effects \u2014 as there are with all insurance, by the way. But there\u2019s also good reason to believe that there\u2019s a major market imperfection in the form of job lock, and that even aside from this, there are important benefits to expanding health insurance that must be weighed against any costs. All of that is, in brief, in both of the pieces Mulligan denounces, and there at much greater length in our other writings; but as so often happens, conservatives develop problems of reading comprehension whenever such issues come up.\n\nI\u2019ve encountered similar responses on many other issues. You say that deficit spending is helpful in a depressed economy? You must be saying that deficits and bigger government are always good, which is stupid hahaha. You say that increasing unemployment benefits in a demand-constrained economy can create jobs? But you also said once upon a time that unemployment insurance can raise the natural rate of unemployment, so you\u2019re stupid hahaha.\n\nWell, somebody\u2019s being stupid, anyway.\n\nI can\u2019t resist going back to the 2009 debate over stimulus, when one after another, prominent conservative economists dismissed calls for a temporary increase in spending as being clearly stupid and/or corrupt, because accounting identities, or maybe the effect of expected future taxes, clearly showed that stimulus made no sense. Along the way these notables reinvented classic conceptual errors from 80 years ago and added a few new howlers too; yet their faith in the proposition that progressive economists must be idiots never wavered.\n\nBut then John Stuart Mill knew all about this.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140214073944, "BN": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 14, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Stupidity in Economic Discourse ( 20140214 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "twitter": {"description": "Stupidity, imputed and real.", "title": "Stupidity in Economic Discourse", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/stupidity-in-economic-discourse/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Stupidity, imputed and real.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "February 14, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1392381584, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2014-02-14T12:39:44-05:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20140214123944, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140214, "pdate": 20140214, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Stupidity, imputed and real.", "title": "Stupidity in Economic Discourse", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/stupidity-in-economic-discourse/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/stupidity-in-economic-discourse/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Stupidity in Economic Discourse", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd73a0\"", "article_summary": "But I think you also want to put it into a larger picture: the enduring myth of the stupid progressive economist.\nUnlike voluntary job leaving, this second kind of work reduction would entail real economic distortions and be a cost, not a benefit.\nWhat one sees in this particular Mulligan piece is something I encounter all the time, in many contexts: the myth of the stupid progressive economist.\nAlong the way these notables reinvented classic conceptual errors from 80 years ago and added a few new howlers too; yet their faith in the proposition that progressive economists must be idiots never wavered.\nThe eminent health care economist and health reform architect is annoyed at Casey Mulligan\u2019s latest, which misrepresents Gruber\u2019s views; mine too."}
