However, few businesses actually pay at that effective rate. Various loopholes and tax avoidance vehicles enable many major corporations to dramatically reduce, and in some cases eliminate, their tax liability.\n\nThe White House has proposed a plan that would slash the corporate tax rate to 28 percent while eliminating loopholes and rationalizing the treatment of income earned overseas.\n\nRelated: GOP Plan Cuts Top Tax Rate, Adds Surcharge to Top Earners\n\nFurman\u2019s remarks came just a day after several media organizations got an advance look at a tax reform proposal that Rep. Dave Camp, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, will release tomorrow.\n\nCamp\u2019s proposal would rewrite the tax code entirely, but his core plan regarding corporate taxes is not far from what the administration has proposed. In Camp\u2019s vision, the corporate tax rate would drop to 25 percent from 35 percent.\n\nSome have criticized Camp\u2019s timing, primarily on political grounds. The release of a tax reform proposal, in which some constituencies will win and others will lose during an election year will force candidates to take positions that they might prefer to avoid until after votes are counted. Also, Camp is term-limited out of his chairmanship of Ways and Means after this year, meaning he won\u2019t be running the committee after next January in the likely event that wholesale tax reform isn\u2019t completed this year.\n\nThe chances for reform appeared to grow stronger earlier this month when Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), who recently took over as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he had assurances from the Congressional Budget Office that its non-partisan budget analysts would consider pro-growth elements of a tax reform package as revenue-generating.\n\nRelated: Tax Reform Is Dead Until a New President Is Elected\n\nIf Wyden is correct, it removes a major impediment to agreement between the two parties, allowing Democrats to make proposals that raise tax revenue without needing Republicans to agree to a hike in tax rates.\n\nIn an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal today, former Republican Senator Phil Gramm and American Enterprise Institute Visiting Scholar Mike Solon said Wyden\u2019s announcement was cause for optimism about tax reform in general.\n\n\u201cTax reform that fueled economic growth and federal revenue growth,\u201d they wrote, \u201ccould be a catalyst for other reforms that could bring back the American economy we once knew and took for granted.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that tax reform would not get through the Senate this year. According to the Associated Press, McConnell said he objects to the idea that the tax code could be rewritten in a way that generates more revenue for the federal government.\n\nAs minority leader, McConnell\u2019s power in the Senate is limited, but he has been highly successful in blocking proposals he disagrees via filibuster.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A top White House aide on Tuesday said that the administration sees positive momentum toward revamping the corporate tax code.
