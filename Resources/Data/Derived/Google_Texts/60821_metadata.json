(Photo by Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Obama administration on Wednesday gave states more time to implement a key feature of the new employer health care marketplaces and gave small businesses more time to comply with some of the new coverage requirements in the law.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, states are required to offer a health care exchange where small businesses can enroll in and pay for insurance plans, all online. Companies in states that declined to build their own portals would be able to access a similar network run by the federal government.\n\nIn both cases, business owners were also supposed to be able to choose either a single plan or give their workers a choice between several plans \u2014 an option that is often too cumbersome to manage for small businesses. Making that \u201cemployee-choice\u201d feature available on the exchanges was meant to give employers more flexibility and better control over their health costs.\n\nAlready pushed back once, it may be another year before business owners in some states can take advantage of that option.\n\nThat\u2019s because, on the federal small-business exchange, which is being used by most states, both that feature and the online enrollment functions were delayed before the marketplaces opened last year. Both components of the marketplaces were supposed to be ready for small businesses by the end of this year.\n\nOn Wednesday, though, the administration again delayed the requirement that states using the federal exchange offer the\u201cemployee choice\u201d option, pushing the deadline back another year to fall of 2015. The feature will still be ready, officials say, but states will now have the option to opt out of offering that option to small businesses through the exchange.\n\nThe change is a \u201cmajor letdown for small business owners and their employees,\u201d John Arensmeyer, chief executive of advocacy group Small Business Majority and an ardent supporter of the health care law, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of benefits have historically been reserved for large businesses and public employees, while small businesses often have to offer a \u2018one-size fits all\u2019 plan with added administrative hurdles,\u201d Arensmeyer added, later saying that \u201cthe employee choice option is crucial to the success of the small business marketplaces.\u201d\n\nThis is one of a larger set of changes the administration announced Wednesday \u2014 for instance, the White House also announced that it will allow individuals and small businesses with non-ACA compliant plans to keep their insurance for another two years.\n\nMoreover, it is the latest in a long series of changes to the timeline of the small-business health care exchange, which President Obama last year said would give business owners a Web site where they could shop for coverage with the same ease as buying flights on sites such as Priceline and Expedia.\n\nInstead, for the first year, small business owners who want to enroll in plans through the federal marketplace can browse through plans online but must send in a paper application to sign up for coverage. As of now, the online enrollment functions are still supposed to be ready by this fall.\n\nStates running their own exchanges haven\u2019t been immune to the problems, either. Small businesses in Oregon, Maryland and California, for example, currently do not have access to an online exchange. And even in states where the marketplaces are up and running, few small businesses have signed up for new insurance plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is the latest of several delays to the online marketplaces, which would allow employers to choose plans.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/OnSmallBiz", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "This is the latest of several delays to the online marketplaces, which would allow employers to choose plans.", "title": "Obama administration permits further delay to health exchanges for small businesses", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/obama-administration-again-delays-health-plan-flexibility-option-for-small-businesses/2014/03/05/238721f2-a48a-11e3-84d4-e59b1709222c_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/09/25/National-Politics/Images/AnielaRusso.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jd_harrison"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/obama-administration-again-delays-health-plan-flexibility-option-for-small-businesses/2014/03/05/238721f2-a48a-11e3-84d4-e59b1709222c_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "small business shop exchange, small business, Obamacare, health care, business, shop exchange, Obamacare delay, business owners, affordable care act, health care law", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/OnSmallBiz"}, "eomportal-uuid": "238721f2-a48a-11e3-84d4-e59b1709222c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "small business shop exchange, small business, Obamacare, health care, business, shop exchange, Obamacare delay, business owners, affordable care act, health care law"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce54b\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration announced on Wednesday it was permitting delays in timeline for small business health exchanges.\nBoth components of the marketplaces were supposed to be ready for small businesses by the end of this year.\nSmall businesses in Oregon, Maryland and California, for example, currently do not have access to an online exchange.\nThe change is a \u201cmajor letdown for small business owners and their employees,\u201d John Arensmeyer, chief executive of advocacy group Small Business Majority and an ardent supporter of the health care law, said in a statement.\nAnd even in states where the marketplaces are up and running, few small businesses have signed up for new insurance plans."}
