According to what GeoBlue sees in our individual membership numbers, about three quarters of crew are non-U.S. citizens who have indicated their home country as \u201cnon-US\u201d.\n\nFor foreign crew not substantially present or paying U.S. taxes, a shared responsibility payment (tax penalty) does not apply. That is good news.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act pertains to U.S. crew or foreign crew who are substantially present in the U.S. and pay U.S. taxes. Crew members outside of the U.S. for 330 days or more in a 12-month period meet the definition for an individual expat and, in turn, are deemed to have met the individual mandate under the law (no tax penalty would apply).\n\nU.S. crew stateside for more than 35 days have three clear choices:\n\nBuy domestic health insurance and face benefit headaches and claim problems abroad. Buy domestic coverage and supplement it with overseas \u201ctop up\u201d coverage. GeoBlue has a new plan called GeoBlue Xplorer Select that does exactly that. A 27-year-old would pay $100 a month for a plan with 100 percent coverage abroad, subject to a $1,000 deductible (deductible waived for office visits and prescriptions). Retain your global health coverage, and pay the shared responsibility payment. The penalty may be less than purchasing two policies. It\u2019s important to run the premium and out-of-pocket numbers by looking at each scenario.\n\nAnother important development to consider: the CR Omnibus Bill was written into law on Dec. 16 and included legislation that attempted to redefine an expatriate as someone living six months or more away from home. This is much broader language than the existing 330 days abroad definition for individuals purchasing coverage. The bill comes into law in July 2015 and GeoBlue is assessing the applicability of the law for crew members.\n\nJill Cappelli is the eastern regional sales manager of individual products for GeoBlue, previously HTH Worldwide, in Pennsylvania.
