Outrageous stuff,\u201d said Stephen Davis, the chief spokesman for the NYPD. \u201cWe see it. It\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the problem are the limits the department faces in what it can do.\n\n\u201cMonitoring these things is challenging,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThere are privacy issues involved. We can\u2019t go and peel back email names and tags and try to find out who these people are.\u201d\n\nThe issue of the blog, started by former NYPD officer Ed Polstein in 1999, has gained notoriety most recently after a white South Carolina police officer shot a black man to death. Shortly after a video of the officer appearing to shoot the fleeing man in the back went viral on the Internet, Thee Rant blew up with comments.\n\n\u201cCop looked good in his stance,\u201d read one post.\n\nPolstein, who did not respond to requests for an interview, has said previously that anyone wishing to post on the blog has to provide proof that they are a current or former member of the NYPD. But whether they are, and how many have signed up, are among the many mysteries surrounding Thee Rant. The blog says it garners 120,000 page views daily.\n\nLeonard Levitt, a respected former Newsday reporter who runs the website NYPD Confidential, said he has stopped assigning much significance to Thee Rant.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t read it,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cI\u2019d say these guys represent the worst elements of the department. I don\u2019t think they speak for the average cop. I have a feeling it\u2019s four or five guys doing most of the yowling.\u201d\n\nIncidents of officers being investigated or punished for their behavior online, in social media or on personal cell phones, have cropped up in Illinois, Missouri and Florida in recent weeks and months.\n\nIn a St. Louis suburb, for instance, an officer was fired after posting racist remarks about the protests in Ferguson. In San Francisco, eight officers were fired for exchanging racist and homophobic text messages.\n\nRelations between the police and minorities have been fraught in New York for decades. The assault on Abner Louima and the killing of Amadou Diallo during Rudy Giuliani\u2019s administration sparked a rise in tension. The aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics during Michael Bloomberg\u2019s mayoralty deepened the mistrust and anger. And the choking death of Eric Garner on Staten Island last year provoked protests and slogans.\n\nWilliam Bratton, Mayor Bill DeBlasio\u2019s police commissioner, has acknowledged the poor relations and vowed to improve them.\n\nThe existence of Thee Rant, and the occasional, perhaps outsize attention it gets, has not made Bratton\u2019s efforts easier.\n\nGarner\u2019s death prompted some of the more extensive back and forth on the blog. Garner was killed when an officer sought to subdue him during a stop for illegally selling loose cigarettes. Bratton initially said it appeared the officer had used an improper chokehold. But a grand jury on Staten Island declined to indict the officer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A site hosting posts from officers past and present confirms our worst fears about the NYPD", "title": "\u201cThe worst elements of the department\u201d: New York cop blog is home to some of the most vile racism on the Internet", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A site hosting posts from officers past and present confirms our worst fears about the NYPD", "title": "\u201cThe worst elements of the department\u201d: New York cop blog is home to some of the most vile racism on the Internet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/19/the_worst_elements_of_the_department_ny_cop_blog_is_home_to_the_most_vile_racism_on_the_internet_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_210586318.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A site hosting posts from officers past and present confirms our worst fears about the NYPD", "title": "\u201cThe worst elements of the department\u201d: New York cop blog is home to some of the most vile racism on the Internet", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_210586318.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joaquin Sapien", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, #blacklivesmatter, Bill de Blasio, cops, michael brown, New York, NYPD, ProPublica, Racism, William Bratton", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The existence of Thee Rant, and the occasional, perhaps outsize attention it gets, has not made Bratton\u2019s efforts easier.\nBut whether they are, and how many have signed up, are among the many mysteries surrounding Thee Rant.\nShortly after a video of the officer appearing to shoot the fleeing man in the back went viral on the Internet, Thee Rant blew up with comments.\nLeonard Levitt, a respected former Newsday reporter who runs the website NYPD Confidential, said he has stopped assigning much significance to Thee Rant.\nIt\u2019s a problem.\u201dAt the heart of the problem are the limits the department faces in what it can do."}
