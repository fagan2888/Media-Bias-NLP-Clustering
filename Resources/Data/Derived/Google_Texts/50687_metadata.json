Auditors said the insurance would help more parolees get treatment for substance abuse issues. The Corrections Department calculates that 70 percent of the state's 14,707 inmates have such issues.\n\nState auditors also said the expanded health coverage \"has the potential to relieve financially-stressed counties of nearly all costs of providing substance abuse treatment to offenders in the community.\"\n\nFederal research concludes that expanded care also could reduce recidivism, which stands at 25 percent in Oregon.\n\n\"Because of the lack of addiction and mental health care resources, our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people who don't have access to treatment,\" said Shannon Wight, deputy director of the Partnership for Safety and Justice, a nonprofit focused on criminal justice issues. She sid that prisoners released without moving into treatment \"contribute to recidivism and unnecessary costs.\"\n\nCorrections experts say the expanded health insurance will ensure not only addiction treatment but care for chronic medical and mental health issues common in inmates.\n\nWithout such care, \"these people are at greater risk of falling through the cracks and committing new crimes \u2013 jeopardizing public safety and public health and increasing public spending on incarceration,\" according to a research paper by Community Oriented Correctional Health Services, a national nonprofit.\n\nBooth agreed.\n\n\"It's such an amazing opportunity, really, for individuals coming out of prison to have something available.\"\n\nBooth said the prison system isn't just handing inmates a health card as they leave prison. She said the agency also is trying to arrange appointments with medical clinics for inmates with high medical or mental health needs. She said the agency is also working with local corrections officials so inmates have someone on the outside waiting to help them through health care issues.\n\nLinking inmates to medical care may not be easy.\n\n\"Just because they get coverage doesn't mean providers are ready to see them right away,\" Booth said. \"Access to treatment will be an issue.\"\n\nThe new coverage also applies to county jail inmates and those on parole and probation. Under the federal law, coverage is cut off for individuals put into custody.\n\n-- Les Zaitz\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health insurance,inmate health care,oregon corrections department,oregon prisons", "title": "Thousands of Oregon inmates to gain health insurance as they exit prison", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Thousands of Oregon inmates to gain health insurance as they exit prison\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/thousands_of_oregon_inmates_ga.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/13807094-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11681595\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-20T19:36:31Z\", \"author\": \"Les Zaitz | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"@breaking-news\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@watchdog-olive\",\"health insurance\",\"inmate health care\",\"oregon corrections department\",\"oregon prisons\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/politics_impact/photo/13807094-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@leszaitz", "site": "@oregonlive", "card": "summary", "description": "Oregon officials estimate thousands of inmates qualify for new health insurance coverage as they depart prison.
