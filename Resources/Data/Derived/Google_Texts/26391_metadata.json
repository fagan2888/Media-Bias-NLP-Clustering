The group is the political and policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant Christian group in the country.\n\nThe conference was the second one this week by the Christian group. Leader Russell Moore interviewed presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio at a missions conference Tuesday.\n\nMoore previously told CNN that the fight to reverse the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling will be a long one.\n\n\u201cThis will not be resolved by a presidential election or two,\u201d he said following the ruling. \u201cThis is a 100-year struggle in front of us in terms of what the definition of marriage and family means and should mean.\u201d\n\nMoore, who has met with President Barack Obama, reinforced that sentiment this week, telling the crowd to stay engaged despite widespread sentiment that the fight over same-sex marriage is finished in the wake of the high court\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cCitizenship is an office in this country that all of us is invested in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe engage politically. We engage socially, but we don\u2019t forget who we are.\u201d\n\nTo believe that conservative Christians have lost the fight against same-sex marriage is misguided, Marshall said.\n\n\u201cFor the Christian, fatalism is a flaw. Cynicism is sin,\u201d she said. \u201cReplace a sense of resignation with a sense of responsibility for the future.\u201d\n\nMoore said Christians should not view cultural shifts on marriages as victims, but to acknowledge that times have changed.\n\n\u201cYou and I are not in threat of persecution in America,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have seen in American society that the illusion of a Christian majority is now gone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NASHVILLE (CNN) -- Despite the Supreme Court decision in June that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, leading evangelicals vowed this week that the fight to keep marriage between a man and a woman is not over.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "b6228bea1d7671a78a13a75050035f3a"}, "og": {"site_name": "Q13 FOX News", "description": "NASHVILLE (CNN) \u2014 Despite the Supreme Court decision in June that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, leading evangelicals vowed this week that the fight to keep marriage between a man an\u2026", "title": "Evangelicals say fight against same-sex marriage not over", "url": "http://q13fox.com/2015/08/06/evangelicals-say-fight-against-same-sex-marriage-not-over/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/marriage-protests.jpg?w=1200", "height": 792}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/marriage-protests.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@q13fox", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@q13fox"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Seattle and Western Washington's source for breaking news, weather, and sports.
