Red Flag (or, Wildfire) Warnings are in place all across western, central, and northeast Oklahoma. Both Oklahoma City and Tulsa are included in today's fire risk.\n\nRelative Humidity values will drop to 10-25 percent and couple with a warm, dry southwest wind at 15 to 30 mph. These factors will allow fires to start and spread easily across the state.\n\nWhile burn bans are official in only four counties (Cotton, Stephens, Canadian, and Pittsburg), outdoor burning is strongly discouraged anywhere in Oklahoma, especially in areas under the Red Flag Warning.\n\nPrecipitation chances remain absent over the next nine days, keeping our fire risk HIGH. The risk will jump back into the EXTREME category on Thursday when winds will be strong out of the north behind a potent cold front.\n\nStay with News 9 as we continue watching for our next chance of precipitation.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "Red Flag (or, Wildfire) Warnings are in place all across western, central, and northeast Oklahoma.
