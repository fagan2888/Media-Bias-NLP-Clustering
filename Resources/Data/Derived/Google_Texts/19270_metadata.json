He adds in another 3% due to the heightened animosity between president Obama and Republicans in congress.\n\n\u201cBecause of the lack of a strong relationship with congress, I think there are few Democrats who will fall on the proverbial grenade to protect the president,\" Engelke adds.\n\nVeteran Wall Street analyst Dick Bove of Rafferty Capital says Engelke\u2019s prediction is unusual for a market analyst, and far too simplistic.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not normal for a financial analyst to make predictions of that nature,\u201d Bove said. \u201cThe reality is that if the president resigns, it creates chaos.\u201d\n\nEngelke came to the financial business in 1986 and has worked at several of small brokerage firms including Sovran Investment Corp., Anderson & Strudwick, Davenport & Co. and now Capital Securities Management, a privately owned retail brokerage group headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. The firm had $4.5 billion in customer assets as of October with more than 200 investment professionals and 18,000 accounts in locations across the United States.\n\nEngelke is no stranger to political commentary as it relates to the markets. He is often cited in financial publications such as The Wall Street Journal and has appeared on the FOX Business Network to provide commentary on economic trends and the federal budget.\n\n\u201cThe primary issue facing the markets right now is Washington, and if you don\u2019t follow Washington, that\u2019s equivalent to not following interest rates and earnings,\u201d said Engelke.\n\nObamaCare was designed to make certain all Americans received health-care coverage through a series of government mandates and subsidies. After a catastrophic start on October 1, the health-care law came face to face with a crucial November 30 deadline for an improved insurance enrollment website for Americans attempting to purchase policies that begin on January 1.\n\nOver the weekend officials said they had met their deadline and goal of making HealthCare.gov run smoothly for a \u201cvast majority\u201d of users, but a surge in traffic on Monday created a backlog on the website, showing it still has a ways to go.\n\nAccording to Reuters, as of Monday evening, HealthCare.gov had logged 750,000 visitors, just 50,000 short of the 800,000 daily users that officials have said the website could handle.\n\nEngelke said that the new developments did not change his opinion on the chances of a possible presidential resignation over the botched health-care plan.\n\n\u201cIf the website still has many issues, the president\u2019s political fortunes will continue to erode,\" he said. \"Marginally working will have no meaningful positive effect.\u201d\n\nYesterday afternoon, President Obama kicked off a three-week campaign to shift the focus from the many troubles of HealthCare.gov to the benefits of the actual health-care law. The president\u2019s approval rating has been slipping since the troubled launch of the website for his signature domestic policy. The most recent polling from Rasmussen Reports showed that 54% of likely U.S. voters disapprove of Obama's job performance, while only 45% approve. The same poll also showed that 43% strongly disapprove of the way Obama is performing as president and only 21% strongly approve.\n\nEngelke thinks ObamaCare may end up being good for the economy if it leads to people focusing on reforming healthcare. \u201cThis could cause us to eventually get health-care delivery right in the United States,\" he said. If ObamaCare fails, then we will move back towards what Engelke calls \"capitalism,\" or a more market-based approach to reforming the system.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-03-02 10:26:30 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Could ObamaCare force the man it\u2019s named after to resign as president?\u00a0One Wall Street analyst places the odds at 10%.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/12/04/one-analyst-sees-slim-chance-obama-resignation.html", "image": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/og-fox-business.png", "description": "Could ObamaCare force the man it\u2019s named after to resign as president?\u00a0One Wall Street analyst places the odds at 10%.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Analyst Sees Chance of Obama Resignation"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"Julie VerHage\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Analyst Sees Chance of Obama Resignation\",\"image_url\":\"http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/og-fox-business.png\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-04T16:27:03Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/12/04/one-analyst-sees-slim-chance-obama-resignation.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"49515324-06b0-49f2-bc0b-4ce3997c826f\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "Could ObamaCare force the man it\u2019s named after to resign as president?\u00a0One Wall Street analyst places the odds at 10%.", "dc.identifier": "49515324-06b0-49f2-bc0b-4ce3997c826f", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "description": "Could ObamaCare force the man it\u2019s named after to resign as president?\u00a0One Wall Street analyst places the odds at 10%.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "politics", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Analyst Sees Chance Of Obama Resignation", "dcterms.created": "2016-03-02 10:26:30 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "Could ObamaCare force the man it\u2019s named after to resign as president?\u00a0One Wall Street analyst places the odds at 10%.", "title": "Analyst Sees Chance of Obama Resignation | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/12/04/one-analyst-sees-slim-chance-obama-resignation.html", "image": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/og-fox-business.png", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-12-04", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Julie VerHage\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Analyst Sees Chance of Obama Resignation\",\"image_url\":\"http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/og-fox-business.png\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-04T16:27:03Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/12/04/one-analyst-sees-slim-chance-obama-resignation.html\",\"post_id\":\"49515324-06b0-49f2-bc0b-4ce3997c826f\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "dc.creator": "Julie VerHage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca796\"", "article_summary": "Veteran Wall Street analyst Dick Bove of Rafferty Capital says Engelke\u2019s prediction is unusual for a market analyst, and far too simplistic.\nHe adds in another 3% due to the heightened animosity between president Obama and Republicans in congress.\nHe is often cited in financial publications such as The Wall Street Journal and has appeared on the FOX Business Network to provide commentary on economic trends and the federal budget.\nThe same poll also showed that 43% strongly disapprove of the way Obama is performing as president and only 21% strongly approve.\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u201cIt\u2019s not normal for a financial analyst to make predictions of that nature,\u201d Bove said."}
