Yes, it will, and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nThe aptly-named Signs Restaurant, scheduled to open July 16, will be Canada\u2019s first restaurant mostly staffed by deaf servers. The establishment will raise awareness of deaf culture by hiring deaf servers, and requiring all customers to order in sign language. If needed, they can get assistance from a \u201ccheat book\u201d that illustrates how to sign menu items.\n\nWhat a cool idea!\n\nHere\u2019s how it got started: when owner Anjan Manikumar was a manager at a pizza joint, he noticed one of his regular guests was deaf. Seeing how difficult it was for his customer to order, Manikumar decided to learn American Sign Language (ASL), beginning with the basics: \u201chello,\u201d for starters, a salute-like wave of the hand. And most important, \u201cenjoy\u201d\u2013a two-handed chest and belly rub.\n\n\u201cHe was very delighted. He brought his friends the next day,\u201d says Manikumar, who has since broadened his ASL vocabulary through interactions with the deaf community.\n\nFrom that moment of prime customer service came the idea for Signs Restaurant, where the deaf can work and dine using their language, and the hearing can learn about the deaf community. And they can all enjoy a good meal together!\n\nDeaf Restaurants Across North America\n\nSigns is just the latest in a string of hangouts for the deaf. Russ and Melody Stein, who are both deaf, opened Mozzeria, a pizza restaurant in San Francisco, in 2011.\n\nAs they explained to The New York Times, they ran into plenty of problems, such as people who themselves would become speechless as they had never met deaf people before, and government and business reps who needed to be told to arrange for ASL interpreters to communicate with them.\n\nAs is the custom in deaf culture, the Steins looked first for deaf artisans or laborers to fill their needs. Almost everything in the restaurant was designed or built by deaf people, as was all the artwork on the walls. They hired deaf and ASL signers.\n\nAt Mozzeria, foodies are not required to sign their orders; instead, everyone carries paper and pen to communicate with hearing guests. And did I mention, the Neapolitan pizza is delicious!\n\nThere are also restaurants for the deaf in Los Angeles, Manhattan Beach, San Diego, and San Antonio.\n\nCulture Of Deaf Restaurants Flourishing In Washington, D.C.\n\nBut it is in Washington, D.C., home to Gallaudet University, the world\u2019s only university specifically designed for deaf people, that the culture of deaf bars and restaurants has really taken off.\n\nOver the past decade, H Street NE has emerged as the city\u2019s nexus of deaf youth culture: not just one restaurant, but a number of bars and restaurants.\n\nThere\u2019s H&Pizza, where everyone is trained to learn basic signs: \u201cthank you,\u201d \u201chello,\u201d \u201cpepperoni?\u201d Michael Lastoria, the restaurant\u2019s co-owner, said he quickly realized those skills were needed to succeed. His first eight customers were deaf.\n\nAt the Biergarten Haus down the street, bartenders hand out menus and wait for customers to point to their selection. Then, the bartenders sign the price.\n\nUp and down H Street restaurants and bars are reaching out to deaf customers. There\u2019s even a deaf trivia contest at the Vendetta restaurant. On a recent Monday night, the place was packed with at least 80 attendees, with groups of friends conversing with their hands. The organizers believe this is the first bar trivia night of its kind.\n\nAs these eateries have become more popular, Gallaudet staff members have held weekend crash courses for business owners to learn about deaf culture. They instruct the owners about etiquette, from always carrying around a pen and paper to feeling comfortable with tapping deaf people on the shoulder to get their attention.\n\nThese exciting new developments are all about offering services for the deaf, but also about bridging the gap between the hearing and non-hearing community.\n\nAnd everyone enjoys a good meal!\n\nPhoto Credit: Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "Signs, in Toronto, Canada, is just the latest in a series of restaurants for the deaf and hard-of-hearing in America; others are in CA, TX, and Washington D.C.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3100/3099608.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "deaf restaurants,are there deaf restaurants in america,deaf restaurants usa,deaf restaurants in california,deaf restaurants in washington,deaf culture,deaf,hard of hearing,sign language,good food,signs,toronto,mozzeria,san francisco,los angeles,san diego,san antonio,washington dc,", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd912c\"", "article_summary": "Deaf Restaurants Across North AmericaSigns is just the latest in a string of hangouts for the deaf.\nAs is the custom in deaf culture, the Steins looked first for deaf artisans or laborers to fill their needs.\nThe establishment will raise awareness of deaf culture by hiring deaf servers, and requiring all customers to order in sign language.\nUp and down H Street restaurants and bars are reaching out to deaf customers.\nCulture Of Deaf Restaurants Flourishing In Washington, D.C."}
