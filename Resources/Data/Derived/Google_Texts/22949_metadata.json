In advance of tomorrow\u2019s show at the Moody Theater, bassist and co-songwriter Gerald Casale spoke from a \u201chorrible Holiday Inn with no Internet service,\u201d a setback that pales next to the loss of his bandmate and brother, Bob Casale, whose sudden death in February deeply rattled the band.\n\nAustin Chronicle: Besides being holed-up in that terrible Holiday Inn, how has tour been so far?\n\nGerald Casale: It\u2019s been fantastic otherwise. We played a sold-out crowd in New York and received nice reviews, so we\u2019re very happy.\n\nAC: Devo fans seem particularly pumped about hearing the band\u2019s early, 1974-1977 cuts you guys are playing live on this tour.\n\nGC: That\u2019s true. It\u2019s kind of difficult, because we would have needed Bob to play a lot of those [early] songs properly. So we picked songs that we could pull off as a foursome.\n\nAC: Partial proceeds from this tour are going to your brother\u2019s family, is that right?\n\nGC: Absolutely. That\u2019s really what this tour is all about. Bob disappeared so quickly, so his family is in dire straits. Devo were famous and critically acclaimed, but we didn\u2019t make much money. Mark [Mothersbaugh] and I wrote the songs, so we made publishing money, but Bob didn\u2019t write songs \u2013 he was more like a utility player: 100% heart and soul, making things work and coming up with cool guitar parts. He was actually in the process of getting ObamaCare when he died, so he didn\u2019t even have life insurance. You can imagine what ER bills are like when you don\u2019t have insurance.\n\nAC: You\u2019ve said these shows will be the \u201cantithesis\u201d of classic, elaborate Devo shows \u2013 how so?\n\nGC: Our shows were always thought-out and conceptualized. There was no banter onstage, or pausing to tune-up or anything. Our shows built and changed, and had a pay-off, and that\u2019s why people liked us live. They knew they\u2019d be entertained. It wasn\u2019t just a band walking out trying to sound exactly like they did on their record, which can be really boring.\n\nAC: Are you guys still wearing costumes for this tour?\n\nGC: Yes, we\u2019ve brought back the very first industrial jumpsuits we ever wore \u2013 we found some online. Surprisingly, they\u2019re still manufacturing them with very few changes, so we look like it\u2019s still 1976 [laughs]. We also have the blue work helmets, as we found those on Ebay, so it\u2019s a complete time warp.\n\nAC: Hearing all this detail makes me hope that those rumors of a Devo musical will become a reality someday soon. Is that still a possibility?\n\nGC: It can be a reality as soon as we find enough start-up money.\n\nAC: Can you give us a little background on the idea behind the musical?\n\nGC: It\u2019s Devo\u2019s libretto, but characters would play avatars of us in this slightly skewed land called Spudland, which is a like a one-dimension-away-from-reality, impressionistic, hyperbolic reality, and is therefore satirical. It\u2019s kind of like Idiocracy. It\u2019s almost real, and you could believe that anything going on there is the way things could be in the near future.\n\nAC: That sounds pretty novel. Do you think there are any contemporary bands that are conceptually similar to Devo?\n\nGC: Not really. There have certainly been bands in the past 10 years that have cited us an influence, but I think mostly the influence they\u2019re citing is stylistic \u2013 not content or concept-wise. In other words, there\u2019s no bigger idea behind what they\u2019re doing besides music.\n\nAC: What was the \u201cbigger idea\u201d behind Devo?\n\nGC: We created an alternate world. We were, by example, showing \u201cde-evolution,\u201d and warning people about embracing technology to the point where it\u2019s not a tool, but it instead takes over and changes people, and they become dumber.\n\nAC: That sounds scarily accurate....\n\nGC: [Laughs] We didn\u2019t really want to be right, but the de-evolution is real now. It\u2019s not just a college-age intellectual joke.\n\nAC: If you could choose one lasting idea Devo will ultimately be remembered for, what would it be?\n\nGC: Devo were fearlessly original. We were what was \u201cnew\u201d about New Wave. We defined ourselves, and we stayed on-message at a time when that was frowned upon in rock & roll. We were also DIY \u2013 we created custom merchandise, we put out manifestos \u2013 and we were laughed at and highly criticized. Nowadays, any band that really wants to make it has to walk in basically having created their own brand and then market themselves, because nobody\u2019s going to do it for them.\n\nAC: We\u2019re eager to have you guys back in Austin. Do you have any particular memories of Austin from past tours?\n\nGC: I have only good memories of Austin. Every time we\u2019ve played there we\u2019ve loved that city. And the Moody Theater is an incredible venue \u2013 possibly the best place we\u2019ve every played acoustically, and the clear way the audience can see the stage. The very first time we played Austin, around 1979, an RN came to our show and \u201cpicked me up,\u201d so to speak, after the show [laughs].\n\nAC: I like that you remember her as a nurse and not a groupie.\n\nGC: Well, we weren\u2019t like most bands. We didn\u2019t really have \u201cgroupies.\u201d We had interested people. I mean, if a woman is attracted to a brain surgeon or a golfer, they\u2019re not called \u201cgroupies.\u201d It wasn\u2019t like the women who came to Devo shows were also going to see heavy metal bands and doing them next.\n\nAC: It probably wouldn\u2019t be very hard to track that nurse down. Do you remember her name?\n\nGC: [Laughs] I actually do remember her name... but I don\u2019t think I should say it. She\u2019s probably married with children now, and wouldn\u2019t appreciate it.\n\nAC: That\u2019s a pretty good memory to hang onto.\n\nGC: What can I say? I needed a nurse.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bob Casale, Devo, Gerald Casale, Mark Mothersbaugh, Moody Theater, Obamacare", "og": {"image": "http://www.austinchronicle.com/imager/b/original/1549564/df85/31072_429944459135_7837858_n.jpg", "title": "Devo Q&A: Gerald Casale"}, "keywords": "Bob Casale, Devo, Gerald Casale, Mark Mothersbaugh, Moody Theater, Obamacare", "google-site-verification": "qnrKtufqpmTjGUn37hMteGd7m_7o98t42RcbtZJAXRs", "viewport": "width=device-width initial-scale=1.0 maximum-scale=1.0 user-scalable=yes", "description": "Spud rockers rattled but unbowed by the death of Bob Casale"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad37\"", "article_summary": "AC: You\u2019ve said these shows will be the \u201cantithesis\u201d of classic, elaborate Devo shows \u2013 how so?\nAC: That sounds scarily accurate....GC: [Laughs] We didn\u2019t really want to be right, but the de-evolution is real now.\nEvery time we\u2019ve played there we\u2019ve loved that city.\nThat\u2019s really what this tour is all about.\nWe didn\u2019t really have \u201cgroupies.\u201d We had interested people."}
