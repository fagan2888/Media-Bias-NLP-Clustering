He also gets his knuckles rapped a lot by teachers.\n\nUnder the country's sharia-influenced laws, dancing is even worse than boys and girls holding hands, or girls going out without head coverings, or, well, just about anything else. The only thing the government permits its citizens to do, it appears, is rat one another out \u2014 an activity that borders on a national pastime.\n\nBut as Gene Kelly sang in Singing in the Rain, \"Gotta dance!\" Afshin manages to enroll in a semiofficial arts school, where a kindly teacher (Palestinian-Israeli actor Makram Khoury) shows his students how to walk the tightrope between artistic fulfillment and official tolerance.\n\nA decade later, Afshin is at the University of Tehran, where he's delighted to meet some similarly creative students; they introduce him to the city's teeming-but-forbidden culture of secret nightclubs, hard liquor and harder drugs. Afshin and his new pals conspire to form an underground dance troupe, rehearsing in an abandoned building. Inevitably, the urge to perform in public begins to tug at them. But how do you find an audience when you can trust almost no one? And where do you perform when the show you're planning could land you in jail?", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:AARP.org", "Division1": "Division:AARP.org", "page_title": "Dancing Against the Devil", "estimated_publish_date": "2015-04-09", "Last-Modified": "2015-05-07T15:26:58.429-04:00", "keywords": "Desert Dancer, movies, movie review, Desert Dancer review, Desert Dancer trailer, new movie releases, movie releases, movies for grownups", "paywallStatus": "off", "livefyreId": "350119:http://www.aarp.org/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-2015/desert-dancer-movie-review.html", "author": "Bill Newcott", "lfdataConfig": "{\"globalConfig\":{\"network\":\"aarp.fyre.co\"},\"livefyreConfig\":[{\"collectionMeta\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LmFhcnAub3JnL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzLWZvci1ncm93bnVwcy9pbmZvLTIwMTUvZGVzZXJ0LWRhbmNlci1tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXcuaHRtbCIsInRpdGxlIjoiRGFuY2luZyBBZ2FpbnN0IHRoZSBEZXZpbCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cuYWFycC5vcmcvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tb3ZpZXMtZm9yLWdyb3dudXBzL2luZm8tMjAxNS9kZXNlcnQtZGFuY2VyLW1vdmllLXJldmlldy5odG1sIiwidGFncyI6IiIsImNoZWNrc3VtIjoiMGU1ZDhhNmZlYTYxZTgzMjhmYTg1MDhiNDc5MjQ5ZWIiLCJ0eXBlIjoibGl2ZWNvbW1lbnRzIn0.-rrDStvLkoVOR_uMYzQ-pObmLFP4ga_1P9V24YP3uFw\",\"checksum\":\"0e5d8a6fea61e8328fa8508b479249eb\",\"siteId\":\"350139\",\"articleId\":\"http://www.aarp.org/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-2015/desert-dancer-movie-review.html\",\"el\":\"livefyreConversation\",\"disableAvatars\":true,\"postToButtons\":[\"tw\",\"fb\"]}]}", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_org", "type": "info", "description": "An underground troupe defies the rulers of Iran in \"Desert Dancer,\" and earns 4 stars from AARP Movies for Grownups.", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Entertainment/Movies for Grownups/Movie Styles/Drama", "Subject2": "DCSubjects:Entertainment/Movies for Grownups", "Subject3": "DCSubjects:Politics and Society/Newsmakers/Celebrities", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "An underground troupe defies the rulers of Iran in \"Desert Dancer,\" and earns 4 stars from AARP Movies for Grownups.", "title": "Desert Dancer Movie Review, Trailer Stars Reece Ritchie - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-2015/desert-dancer-movie-review.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/2015_04/200-mfg-02-desert-dancer.imgcache.rev1428432927982.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarp/en/home/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-2015/desert-dancer-movie-review", "mcafeesecure-site-verification": "fa79d1a3c2770869e1286a81816d01a4", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "IALevel1": "entertainment", "IALevel2": "movies-for-grownups", "s43": "31.Entertainment|MyPersonalTime", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-25"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe199a\"", "article_summary": "Afshin Ghaffarian (Reece Ritchie) has grown up under Iran's revolutionary government, entertaining his grade-school classmates with impromptu dance performances inspired by bootlegged Western films, most notably Dirty Dancing.\nAnd where do you perform when the show you're planning could land you in jail?\nAfshin and his new pals conspire to form an underground dance troupe, rehearsing in an abandoned building.\nUnder the country's sharia-influenced laws, dancing is even worse than boys and girls holding hands, or girls going out without head coverings, or, well, just about anything else.\nBut how do you find an audience when you can trust almost no one?"}
