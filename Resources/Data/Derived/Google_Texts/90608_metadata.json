But the complexity of readmissions \u2014 their varieties, causes and relation to factors outside of the hospital\u2019s control \u2014 has left the AHA, clinicians and administrators across the country with concerns\n\n[Also: These states had the most Obamacare grants]\n\nFor one thing, \u201cnot all readmissions can or should be prevented; indeed, some are planned as part of sound clinical care,\u201d the AHA notes.\n\nFor another, two aspects of the program \u2014 what it does include and what it doesn\u2019t \u2014 is creating frustration and confusion. The program\u2019s penalty formula includes readmissions unrelated to the patients\u2019 initial admission, but its risk adjustment does not include key socioeconomic factors that research suggests has a significant impact on whether a Medicare beneficiary ends up back in the hospital.\n\nIn 2013, the maximum penalty was a 1 percent reduction in base operating payments for all Medicare fee-for-service discharges of patients with heart failure, pneumonia and acute heart attack. The maximum penalty increased to 2 percent in 2014 and 3 percent for 2015, with the conditions also expanding to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and elective total hip/total knee arthroplasty. In 2017, readmissions related to patients who received coronary artery bypass grafting will also be penalized.\n\nIgnoring socioeconomics\n\nAlthough those readmissions are adjusted based on a patient\u2019s clinical factors, including age, gender, comorbidities and frailty, it does not account for factors such as income and poverty levels within a hospital\u2019s service area \u2014 even though patients in disadvantaged neighborhoods have already been linked to higher patient readmission rates.\n\nAmong the factors that do influence a senior\u2019s health but aren\u2019t included in risk adjustment are being eligible for Medicaid as well as Medicare, education level, income, housing, geography, primary language, health literacy or marriage status.\n\n[Also: Medicare penalizes 721 hospitals over medical errors [full list]]\n\nAn Annals of Internal Medicine study of readmission rates at more than 4,000 hospitals for patients with heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia found that nearly 60 percent of the variation in readmission rates was due to community attributes, including high unemployment, never-married residents, and fewer general practitioners per capita. For patients in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods, the study found, readmissions averaged at 27 percent, compared to the most affluent neighborhoods, where the average rehospitalization rate averaged 21 percent\n\n\u201cHigh-quality inpatient care and coordination with other care providers cannot change these individual and neighborhood characteristics,\u201d the AHA said.\n\nUrban academic teaching and safety-net hospitals tend to treat more low-income patients with higher socioeconomic risk factors, said Steven Lipstein, CEO of BJC HealthCare in St. Louis. The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, he said, \u201cdiverts money away from these hospitals and has the unintended consequence of worsening disparities between rich and poor.\u201d\n\nThe AHA and others have been pushing for socioeconomic factors to be included in the program\u2019s risk adjustment, including the National Quality Forum and the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee.\n\nMultiplier effect\n\nThe Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program also has come along with a \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d that makes the penalties greater than the revenue for readmissions, the AHA argues. In some cases, the penalty could be five times as much as the cost of the excess readmissions, the group said.\n\nMedPAC has flagged this issue, too, expressing concern that the program leads to an inverse relationship between national readmission rates and hospital penalties. As readmission rates drop across the nation, the magnitude of the penalty may actually remain the same or grow, and over time hospitals achieving the goal of the program end up being penalized more.\n\n[Also: These 779 hospitals actually scored Medicare bonuses]\n\nThe formula \u201cmultiplies the per-admission payment by the number of all admissions for that condition, not merely the number of readmissions,\u201d the AHA report said. \u201cThis allows Medicare to recoup a payment amount that is far greater than the payments made for the excess readmissions.\u201d\n\nOne example the AHA laid out: A hospital may have had 100 heart failure patient discharges and 20 readmissions in 2013. The next year, that hospital may have only had 65 heart failure discharges, if their preventive care and condition management initiatives are working, and 16 heart failure readmissions \u2014 but their readmission rate would have increased 25 percent, with concurrent penalties.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nThe multiplier issue could be resolved if the program\u2019s \u201clegislative language were clarified so that the formula multiplies by the number of expected readmissions instead of the number of admissions,\u201d the AHA said.\n\nBut the AHA wants CMS and lawmakers to consider broader changes that could fix the program, which can only happen by addressing key issues.\n\n\u201cWhat are the best methods to account for patients\u2019 life circumstances and sociodemographic factors when calculating expected and actual readmission rates?\u201d the AHA said.\n\n\u201cHow can regulators anticipate and avoid unintended adverse consequences for patients and providers when imposing financial penalties for excess readmissions?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/aha-blasts-hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-failing-consider-socioeconomics-other-issues", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/generic%20hospital%20-%20feature.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "\u201cNot all readmissions can or should be prevented; indeed, some are planned as part of sound clinical care,\u201d AHA says.", "title": "AHA blasts Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program for failing to consider socioeconomics, other issues"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/generic%20hospital%20-%20feature.png"}, "title": "AHA blasts Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program for failing to consider socioeconomics, other issues", "description": "\u201cNot all readmissions can or should be prevented; indeed, some are planned as part of sound clinical care,\u201d AHA says.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Amid myriad regulatory battles, America\u2019s hospital advocates are imploring the government and policy makers to consider revising one of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s signature cost-control provisions: the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08c5\"", "article_summary": "Multiplier effectThe Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program also has come along with a \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d that makes the penalties greater than the revenue for readmissions, the AHA argues.\nAmid myriad regulatory battles, America\u2019s hospital advocates are imploring the government and policy makers to consider revising one of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s signature cost-control provisions: the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program.\nBut the AHA wants CMS and lawmakers to consider broader changes that could fix the program, which can only happen by addressing key issues.\n\u201cNot all readmissions can or should be prevented; indeed, some are planned as part of sound clinical care,\u201d AHA says.\n\u201cHow can regulators anticipate and avoid unintended adverse consequences for patients and providers when imposing financial penalties for excess readmissions?\u201d"}
