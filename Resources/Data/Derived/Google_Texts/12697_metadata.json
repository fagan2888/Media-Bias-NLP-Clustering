Many claim that the major reasons for this are the corruption of politics by money and corporate personhood.\n\nAfter all, is it not true that money can purchase an inordinate amount of false advertising to create a false reality? After all, if a corporation is given the rights of a person, does it not get free speech and all the protections of the Bill of Rights and in effect a vote?

Bruce Bartlett, former senior policy analyst in the Reagan White House and former deputy assistant secretary for economic policy in the George HW Bush White House, and Michael Lofgren, former staff member of the House and Senate Budget Committee for 28 years and author of The Party Is Over: How Republicans Went CRAZY, Democrats Became USELESS, and the Middle Class Got SHAFTED appeared on All In w/Chris Hayes.
