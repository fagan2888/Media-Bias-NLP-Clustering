For example, an administration official said, an insurer \u201ccan\u2019t say you can only get substance-abuse treatment in state but you can go anywhere for medical/surgical.\u201d\n\nThe regulations, which specifically put into effect the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, would affect most Americans with insurance \u2014 roughly 85 percent of the population \u2014 whether their policies are from employer plans, other group plans, or coverage purchased in the market for individual plans.\n\nThe final parity rules do not apply to health plans that manage care for millions of low-income people on Medicaid. However, the administration has previously issued guidance to state health officials saying that such plans should meet the parity requirements of the 2008 law.\n\nThe parity law does not apply to Medicare, according to Irvin L. Muszynski, a lawyer at the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nThe rules have been awaited since the 2008 law by patient advocate groups. As it happened, the groups\u2019 complaints about regulatory delays were the subject of a Senate hearing on Thursday. Interest picked up further last month as individuals could begin enrolling in the new insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, provided under Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nUnder that law,treatment for mental health and substance abuse is among 10 categories of benefits considered essential and thus mandatory in plans marketed in the new exchanges to individuals and small groups. Although many insurers already provide extensive mental health coverage, some have found ways to get around existing rules and to deny payment for treatment, or to otherwise limit the benefits.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said the five-year delay in issuing a final rule had real-world consequences. \u201cIn mental health, uncertainty kills,\u201d he said. \u201cIf an individual poses a threat to himself or others, he cannot be told he will get the care he needs as soon as his insurance company decides what \u2018parity\u2019 means.\u201d\n\nInsurance companies have raised concerns about the expense involved in paying for the lengthy and intensive courses of treatment that the final regulations address. But experts have said the rules are not expected to significantly add to the cost of coverage because so few patients require these levels of care.\n\nMental health services are scarce in many parts of the country, particularly for children, so experts have questioned whether changes in the law will have much impact in practice.\n\nFormer Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, a co-sponsor of the 2008 law, said the rules could particularly help veterans. \u201cNo one stands to gain more from true parity than the men and women who have served our country and now need treatment for the invisible wounds they have brought home from Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d he said.\n\nAdministration officials consulted closely with mental health groups. \u201cWhat we are hearing is very positive,\u201d said Andrew Sperling, a lobbyist at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, based on what he had been told of the final language.\n\nUnder the 2008 law, treatment limits \u2014 like restrictions on the number of doctor visits or days in a hospital \u2014 cannot be more restrictive for mental health benefits than for medical and surgical benefits. But interpretation of the law left much in question.\n\nFor example, Mr. Sperling said, policyholders can easily determine whether numerical limits on doctor visits are comparable in their plans for mental and medical health care. But, he said, it is more difficult to challenge \u201cnonquantitative limits\u201d \u2014 like some insurers\u2019 requirements that people get their authorization before seeing a psychotherapist.\n\nThe provision of the rule that will seek to clarify the amount of transparency required of health plans \u201cis important,\u201d Mr. Sperling said. Patients advocates say they need to be able to see the criteria by which insurers find a particular service to be medically necessary, so policyholders can judge whether standards for mental health treatments are more restrictive.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCarol A. McDaid, the leader of a coalition of patients and providers of mental health and addiction services, said: \u201cThis is the beginning, not the end, of our work to make the vision of the law a reality. We have to make sure that the law and the rules are fully enforced.\u201d\n\nInsurers and business trade groups said they did not know enough about the rules to comment.\n\nDr. Paul Summergrad of Tufts University, president-elect of the American Psychiatric Association, said he hoped the final rules would end \u201cthe uniquely discriminatory form of prior authorization and utilization review\u201d applied to emergency care for patients with mental illness.\n\nA person who has a heart attack or pneumonia and goes to a hospital will routinely be admitted, with electronic notice sent to the insurer on the next business day, Dr. Summergrad said. By contrast, he said, if a person who is profoundly depressed and tried to commit suicide goes to a hospital, an emergency room doctor must call a toll-free telephone number, \u201cpresent the case in voluminous detail and get prior authorization.\u201d\n\nState insurance commissioners will apparently have the primary responsibility for seeing that commercial insurers comply with the parity standards. They already have their hands full, however, enforcing new insurance market rules, and in some states insurance regulators are considered close to the industry.\n\n\u201cWe need enforcement,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said in an interview. \u201cThe notion of delegating this to the states, which are looking to the federal government for direction, is problematic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131108000741, "twitter": {"description": "The regulations, which the White House sees as part of a push to curb gun violence, will require insurers to cover care for mental health and addiction just like physical illnesses.", "title": "Rules to Require Equal Coverage for Mental Ills", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/us/politics/rules-to-require-equal-coverage-for-mental-ills.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002541721"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/us/politics/rules-to-require-equal-coverage-for-mental-ills.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002541721", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/us/politics/rules-to-require-equal-coverage-for-mental-ills.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Rules to Require Equal Coverage for Mental Ills", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 8, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Mental Health and Disorders,United States Politics and Government,Gun Control,Regulation and Deregulation of Industry,Drug Abuse and Traffic", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jackie Calmes and Robert Pear", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By JACKIE CALMES and ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The regulations, which the White House sees as part of a push to curb gun violence, will require insurers to cover care for mental health and addiction just like physical illnesses.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The regulations, which the White House sees as part of a push to curb gun violence, will require insurers to cover care for mental health and addiction just like physical illnesses.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 8, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-07-16", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Drug Abuse and Traffic", "published": "2013-11-08", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "08health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140716161431, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/us/politics/rules-to-require-equal-coverage-for-mental-ills.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The regulations, which the White House sees as part of a push to curb gun violence, will require insurers to cover care for mental health and addiction just like physical illnesses.", "title": "Rules to Require Equal Coverage for Mental Ills"}, "pdate": 20131108, "des": "Drug Abuse and Traffic", "articleid": 100000002541721, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Rules to Require Equal Coverage for Mental Ills", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2458\"", "article_summary": "The final parity rules do not apply to health plans that manage care for millions of low-income people on Medicaid.\nAny geographic or facility-type limitations would have to be comparable for medical and mental health benefits.\nThe parity law does not apply to Medicare, according to Irvin L.
