Former President George H.W. Bush will remain hospitalized in Texas for a sixth night, his spokesman said Sunday, adding that they hope for “news about a possible discharge soon.”

Bush, who at 90 is the nation’s oldest former living president, was taken to Houston Methodist Hospital on Tuesday “as a precaution” after experiencing shortness of breath, according to his office.

His wife, former First Lady Barbara Bush, visited Sunday, and the couple watched a Houston Texans football game together, a statement from his office said.

On Christmas, his office said, the 41st president received visits from his wife and from son and daughter-in-law Neil and Maria Bush.

It wasn’t the first time Bush had been hospitalized over Christmas. In November 2012, he went to Houston Methodist with a persistent cough. He developed a fever and stayed nearly two months.

Last year, Barbara Bush was admitted to the same hospital on New Year's Eve with signs of pneumonia. She was released after six days of treatment.

Bush -- the father of former President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- made headlines in June when he celebrated his 90th birthday by skydiving.
