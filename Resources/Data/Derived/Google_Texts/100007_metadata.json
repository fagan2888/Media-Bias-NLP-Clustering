And a slew of new hangover cures have popped up this year \u2013 such as the hangover pill that prevents dehydration, the \u2018Hydration Station\u2019 spa, or even simply the fad of drinking Sprite to make you feel better after a night out.\n\nSprite, for example, was found to quicken the metabolic process of alcohol, as it turns alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) into acetaldehyde. Compared to several teas and various soft drinks, Chinese researchers actually found that Sprite made the metabolization of alcohol in the body faster, decreasing the amount of time a person had to deal with side effects like hangovers.\n\nPerhaps you can quicken the metabolic process, or prevent a hangover completely, with something delicious, buttery and soft: like comfort food. Gastroenterologists suggest eating fatty foods doesn\u2019t necessarily \u201cline your stomach\u201d per se, but it may provide a better foundation for your stomach to handle alcohol.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about lining your stomach as such \u2013 but if you put fat in your stomach before a drink, once it gets into the duodenum [the first part of the small intestine] it will slow down gastric emptying, so that drink will not be emptied so quickly from the stomach,\u201d Dr. Nick Read, a gastroenterologist and medical adviser to the IBS Network, told the Daily Mail. \u201cThis means you\u2019ll get drunk less quickly, which could mean a milder hangover.\u201d\n\nHangovers are mostly the result of dehydration, which occurs after a night of drinking since alcohol is a diuretic \u2013 meaning it leads to the production of urine. Headache, nausea, dry mouth, fatigue, and dizziness are common features of hangovers.\n\n\u201cThe rate of alcohol absorption depends not only on the presence or absence of food, but also on the type of food present,\u201d the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism notes on its website. \u201cFoods with a higher fat content require more time to leave the stomach; consequently, eating fatty foods will allow alcohol absorption to take place over a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn some cultures, they drink olive oil before alcohol for this reason,\u201d Dr. Read continued. \u201cThe same applies to mashed potatoes: some people say you should have two spoonfuls with plenty of butter before a drink. It\u2019s the fat in the butter that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nHowever, even if you happen to be a lucky person who doesn\u2019t get hangovers, it doesn\u2019t mean your body isn\u2019t experiencing the complete effects of alcohol \u2013 which can be damaging in excessive amounts. \u201cIt\u2019s true that some people are less prone to hangovers,\u201d Dr. Sarah Jarvis, a medical adviser to the charity Drinkaware, told the Daily Mail. \u201cBut that does not mean they are immune to the longer-term effects of alcohol.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mashed potatoes, hangover cure, alcohol", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Eating fatty comfort foods, mashed potatoes in particular, could stop a hangover in its tracks.", "title": "Mashed Potatoes \u2018With Plenty Of Butter\u2019: Hangover Cure?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cure-your-hangover-mashed-potatoes-two-spoonfuls-plenty-butter-265799", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/25/mashed-potatoes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eating fatty comfort foods, mashed potatoes in particular, could stop a hangover in its tracks.", "title": "Mashed Potatoes \u2018With Plenty Of Butter\u2019: Hangover Cure?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cure-your-hangover-mashed-potatoes-two-spoonfuls-plenty-butter-265799", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/25/mashed-potatoes.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/25/mashed-potatoes.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-12-25T22:11:43-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-27T12:43:55-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Eating fatty comfort foods, mashed potatoes in particular, could stop a hangover in its tracks."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00c4\"", "article_summary": "Everyone may have their own hangover \u2018cure,\u2019 from Gatorade, to aspirin, to chugging water before falling asleep.\n\u201cThe same applies to mashed potatoes: some people say you should have two spoonfuls with plenty of butter before a drink.\nPerhaps you can quicken the metabolic process, or prevent a hangover completely, with something delicious, buttery and soft: like comfort food.\nSprite, for example, was found to quicken the metabolic process of alcohol, as it turns alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) into acetaldehyde.\n\u201cBut that does not mean they are immune to the longer-term effects of alcohol.\u201d"}
