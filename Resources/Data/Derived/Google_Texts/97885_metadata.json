Bob Corker, a Republican, is pushing for legislation creating a federal entity to regulate the housing market, six years after the government\u2019s subprime loans nearly tanked the U.S. economy.\n\nBut is it a good idea?\n\nTwo experts, one a Franklin-based financial adviser, the other a Heritage Foundation research fellow, oppose housing finance reform legislation from U.S. senators Tim Johnson, D-S.D. and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho \u2014 but for very different reasons.\n\nJohnson\u2019s and Crapo\u2019s legislation, which they\u2019re calling Housing Finance Reform, evolved from legislation previously introduced by Corker.\n\nTim Pagliara, who said he donated $7,000 to Corker\u2019s U.S. Senate campaign and once had direct access to the senator, calls the legislation \u201cresidential Obamacare,\u201d which, if passed, will raise mortgage rates.\n\n\u201cI like Bob Corker, but I\u2019m mad at him because he\u2019s a blockhead and he won\u2019t listen to me. He\u2019s also spent too much time in D.C.,\u201d said Pagliara, chairman and CEO of CapWealth Advisors.\n\n\u201cThe media never writes about planes that don\u2019t crash, so I\u2019ve got to make an impact and I\u2019ve got to get the facts out on the table. It\u2019s not exciting stuff, but I don\u2019t want people to wake up after this legislation has passed and realize their mortgage rates are going to be higher.\u201d\n\nSo what, precisely, does this legislation do?\n\nAccording to its text, it eliminates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and brings in \u201ca diverse set of private entities to step in and replace most of the functions of the Government Sponsored Enterprises\u201d as it pertains to home loan financing.\n\nA Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation, modeled after the FDIC, would regulate the new system and include a reinsurance fund to protect taxpayers, according to the legislation.\n\nThe housing market, the legislation adds, accounts for nearly 20 percent of the U.S. economy.\n\nA board of five members, appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, will manage the FMIC, the legislation said.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Corker suggested to Tennessee Watchdog that Pagliara and others have an ulterior motive for speaking out against this legislation.\n\n\u201cThere are some entities that are doing everything they can to distort the truth and kill efforts to reform the housing finance system because they benefit more from the status quo at the expense of taxpayers,\u201d Corker said.\n\n\u201cFannie and Freddie would not generate one dime of revenue without the government backstop, and I do not believe we should conflate private investors\u2019 investment concerns with the importance of enacting sound housing policy in our country.\u201d\n\nPagliara said 270 of his clients invested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on his advice between 2008 through 2009.\n\nBut Pagliara said Fannie and Freddie need reform, not elimination, particularly given past government pressure for high-risk subprime loans, which led to the 2008 economic collapse.\n\nNorbert Michel, with the Washington, D.C.-based Heritage Foundation, said he\u2019s studied the legislation and has argued against it.\n\nUnlike Pagilara, Michel said he\u2019s opposed because he wants all GSE\u2019s eliminated, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He says the government should not replace them, period.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe there should be an explicit guarantee in the market for housing, just as we don\u2019t believe there should be an explicit government safety guarantee for any markets,\u201d Michel told Tennessee Watchdog.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already got enough regulators. You\u2019ve already got an FDIC. Now you\u2019re going to create something similar to it just for the housing market. It literally creates a new federal financial safety net, which is exactly the wrong direction that we should be going. It\u2019s just really a continuation of the direction that we\u2019ve been going and for quite a while.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, getting government involvement out, Michel added, would not hurt the U.S. housing market.\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens, you\u2019ve got a 65 percent homeownership rate. If you get rid of the GSE\u2019s right now, you don\u2019t take all those people who are in their homes and throw them out on the street,\u201d Michel said.\n\n\u201cNot a single thing happens to those existing mortgages.\u201d\n\nPagliara said he strongly disagrees with Michel, but the two men agree that nothing will happen between now and the end of the year.\n\nThe bill\u2019s fate may rest with whichever party wins control of the U.S. Senate next month, Pagliara said.\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org\n\nFollow Tennessee Watchdog and receive regular updates through Facebook and Twitter\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
