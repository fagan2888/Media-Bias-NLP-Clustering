Though something called the "death tax" sounds ominous, Bill Maher explained on "Real Time" why taxing inherited wealth is actually a good thing. Namely, he just called out some kids who will inherit fortunes for being "entitled jerks."

Maher's examples include Kylie Jenner texting while driving after Bruce Jenner's deadly accident and Paris Hilton's brother Conrad Hughes Hilton III needing to be restrained on a flight.

And while those stories are pretty shocking, we're pretty sure Maher got the facts wrong when it came to saying Hilton's proper title. But you can be the judge.

"Real Time with Bill Maher" airs Friday at 10:00 p.m. ET on HBO.
