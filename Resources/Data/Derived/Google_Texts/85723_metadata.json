Buy! Buy!'\u201d and decided no more classroom for him.\n\nThat roar will soon go silent. On Monday, most futures pits in Chicago and New York, where frenzied buying and selling once helped set prices on cattle and corn, palladium and gold, and dozens of other commodities, are expected to close for good. Traders yelled and shoved and flashed hand signals, just as they did in the movie \u201cTrading Places.\u201d But now the computer \u2014 faster, cheaper and not nearly as noisy \u2014 has taken over.\n\nIt will be a sad day for Meegan, still in the pits 34 years after dropping out of college, donning a trading jacket and mustering the courage to tell his dad.\n\n\u201cI thought he was gonna kill me, but he was like, \u2018I don\u2019t care if you pick up garbage or you\u2019re a dog groomer. If you are happy doing what you are doing, you\u2019re ahead of 99 percent of the people in the world,'\u201d recalls Meegan, now 54.\n\nThe few dozen jobs that will be lost when the pits shut down is just part of it, veterans say. What\u2019s also disappearing is a rich culture of brazen bets, flashy trading jackets and kids just out of high school getting a shot at making it big. The pits were a ruthless place, but they were also a proving ground where education and connections counted for nothing next to drive and, occasionally, muscle.\n\n\u201cIf people came to your spot, you shoved them out of it. \u2018This is my two-foot space \u2026 so get out of it,'\u201d says Dan Sullivan, a broker who\u2019s been working in the pits since 1981. The competition, he adds, also bred camaraderie. \u201cThese guys knew me better than my wife.\u201d\n\nDan Grant, 53, traces his love affair with the pits to a $150-a-week job as a \u201crunner\u201d ferrying messages between clerks taking phone orders from customers and brokers executing them.\n\nSix years into his career, on Oct. 19, 1987, stocks were plunging around the world and he was a clerk taking orders from the head traders at Chemical Bank and Drexel Burnham Lambert desperate to buy anything to protect themselves. Grant still marvels that, just 24 years old and with no college degree, he wielded such power in the crash, later known as Black Monday.\n\n\u201cThey were buying Treasurys and currencies, and watching their stock portfolios go to zero,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nThe pits that are closing deal in futures, or contracts to buy or sell something at a later date at a set price. They\u2019re used by farmers to lock in prices for their crops before harvest, for instance, and investors as a way to bet that prices will go up or down.\n\nNot all futures pits are going away. In its February announcement about the closings, the owner of the exchanges said the pits where Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 stock futures and options on futures are traded will remain open. Floor trading of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, which is owned by a different company, won\u2019t end, either.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Traders recall the \u2018rush\u2019 and \u2018roar\u2019 as famed pits close", "title": "Traders recall the \u2018rush\u2019 and \u2018roar\u2019 as famed pits close", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Traders recall the \u2018rush\u2019 and \u2018roar\u2019 as famed pits close", "title": "Traders recall the \u2018rush\u2019 and \u2018roar\u2019 as famed pits close", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/05/traders_recall_the_rush_and_roar_as_famed_pits_close/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/goodbye-trading-pits.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Traders recall the \u2018rush\u2019 and \u2018roar\u2019 as famed pits close", "title": "Traders recall the \u2018rush\u2019 and \u2018roar\u2019 as famed pits close", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/goodbye-trading-pits.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bernard Condon and Don Babwin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b14\"", "article_summary": "Not all futures pits are going away.\nFloor trading of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, which is owned by a different company, won\u2019t end, either.\nIn its February announcement about the closings, the owner of the exchanges said the pits where Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 stock futures and options on futures are traded will remain open.\nThe few dozen jobs that will be lost when the pits shut down is just part of it, veterans say.\nOn Monday, most futures pits in Chicago and New York, where frenzied buying and selling once helped set prices on cattle and corn, palladium and gold, and dozens of other commodities, are expected to close for good."}
