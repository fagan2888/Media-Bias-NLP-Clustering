Larry Lockman, R-Amherst, said during a news conference Wednesday that Eves should recuse himself because of his affiliation with Sweetser. A letter to Eves signed by 26 House Republicans calls on him to \u201chalt all activities promoting legislation to expand Medicaid enrollment in Maine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that your singular advocacy for Medicaid expansion in the first session of the 126th Legislature, while you simultaneously served as director of business development for a major Medicaid beneficiary, has created the appearance of a conflict of interest, if not an actual conflict of interest,\u201d reads the letter. \u201cYou acknowledged the inherent conflict between your work and your legislative leadership role when you took a leave of absence from your employer. However, you were not on a leave of absence when you voted as a member of the Legislative Council to allow reconsideration of Medicaid expansion in the second session. We believe that action was contrary to the letter and spirit of Joint Legislative Rules that prohibit reconsideration of bills that were voted on in the first session.\u201d\n\nNo members of Republican legislative leadership signed the letter.\n\nHere\u2019s what the Legislature\u2019s Joint Rules say about conflicts of interest: \u201cA member may not vote on any question in committee when that question immediately involves that member\u2019s private right, as distinct from the public interest.\u201d\n\nEves said Wednesday afternoon that the Republicans\u2019 contention that his job with Sweetser involves raising money or winning contracts is incorrect.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve done is work with doctors and primary care physicians to integrate mental health and physical health services,\u201d said Eves. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nDemocrats on Wednesday provided a list of Republican lawmakers whose jobs, paired with their activity in the State House, could be seen as conflicts of interest. The list included Rep. Deborah Sanderson, R-Chelsea, a member of the Health and Human Services Committee who works for Maine Veterans Home.\n\nAsked by a reporter whether she or anyone else saw a conflict of interest in the 125th Legislature when then-Speaker of the House Rep. Robert Nutting, R-Oakland, a pharmacist, participated in debates and votes about prescription drugs, Sanderson said, \u201cWhen Rep. Nutting was speaker of the House, he worked for a pharmacy. He didn\u2019t own the pharmacy. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\nSenate President Justin Alfond, D-Portland, told reporters Wednesday afternoon that Republicans were merely trying to create a \u201cdistraction\u201d from the debate over Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s at hand and what we\u2019ve been talking about for over a year is providing health care for 70,000 Mainers,\u201d said Alfond. \u201cI wish the same group of legislators would spend as much time learning the facts about what\u2019s in front of us, what it could do for our economy, what it could do to dramatically change health care and the delivery of health care, as they do having press conferences basically with no merit. With every one of us, you could find some sort of conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nJonathan Wayne, executive director of the Maine Ethics Commission, would not comment on whether anyone has filed a formal complaint about the matter. He said that if any complaints about the situation have been filed, their existence would be confidential.\n\nSanderson said even if there isn\u2019t technically a conflict, Eves should bow out of the Medicaid debate to avoid the appearance of one.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Eves is too personally and professionally involved in this [Medicaid expansion] bill to act in a professional, responsible manner,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not infer that there is a conflict of interest, but it certainly adds to the perception that it does. Some will say that we have a citizen Legislature and that these conflicts are bound to occur, but I disagree.
