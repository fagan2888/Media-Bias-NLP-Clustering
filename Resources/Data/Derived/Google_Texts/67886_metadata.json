Yet music might help close the gap, according to Nina Kraus and her colleagues at Northwestern University.\n\nKraus\u2019s team tested the auditory abilities of teenagers aged 14 or 15, grouped by socioeconomic status (as indexed by their mother\u2019s level of education, a commonly used surrogate measure). The researchers recorded the kids\u2019 brain waves with EEG as they listened to a repeated syllable against soft background sound and when they heard nothing. They found that children of mothers with a lower education had noisier, weaker and more variable neural activity in response to sound and greater activity in the absence of sound. The children also scored lower on tests of reading and working memory.\n\nKraus thinks music training is worth investigating as a possible intervention for such auditory deficits. The brains of trained musicians differ from nonmusicians, and they also enjoy a range of auditory advantages, including better speech perception in noise, according to research from Kraus\u2019s laboratory. The researchers admit that this finding could be the result of preexisting differences that predispose some people to choose music as a career or hobby, but they point out that some experimental studies show that musical training, whether via one-on-one lessons or in group sessions, enhances people\u2019s response to speech.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research suggests classes can help close the socioeconomic gap in reading ability", "author": "Simon Makin", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Research suggests classes can help close the socioeconomic gap in reading ability", "title": "Music lessons combat poverty\u2019s effect on the brain", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/12/music_lessons_combat_povertys_effect_on_the_brain_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_70107811.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research suggests classes can help close the socioeconomic gap in reading ability", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_70107811.jpg", "title": "Music lessons combat poverty\u2019s effect on the brain", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Music lessons combat poverty\u2019s effect on the brain", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Income inequality, Music Lessons, Neuroscience, piano, Poverty, Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd711\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Income inequality, Music Lessons, Neuroscience, piano, Poverty, Scientific American, Life NewsThis article was originally published by Scientific AmericanScientists have observed that reading ability scales with socioeconomic status.\nKraus thinks music training is worth investigating as a possible intervention for such auditory deficits.\nYet music might help close the gap, according to Nina Kraus and her colleagues at Northwestern University.\nKraus\u2019s team tested the auditory abilities of teenagers aged 14 or 15, grouped by socioeconomic status (as indexed by their mother\u2019s level of education, a commonly used surrogate measure).\nThe researchers recorded the kids\u2019 brain waves with EEG as they listened to a repeated syllable against soft background sound and when they heard nothing."}
