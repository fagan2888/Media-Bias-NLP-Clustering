Dennis Daugaard announced Monday the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion will not take place during the current legislative session.\n\nWith just 10 legislative days left, the Republican politician said there is not enough time for lawmakers to look into implementation and discuss the financial impact.\n\n\u201cSo, given this time frame, I\u2019ve concluded that to urge legislative approval of a Medicaid expansion decision this session would not give the legislature adequate time to give fair and dispassionate consideration to the proposal,\u201d he said at a press conference at the state captiol. \u201cAccordingly, I\u2019m going to be asking the legislative appropriators to amend the general appropriation bill to remove the federal funding authority which would enable expansion in fiscal year 2017.\u201d\n\nWATCH:\n\n\n\nWhile the timeline has been pushed back, the governor made it clear the idea is not dead, saying lawmakers will continue to work to \u201cimplement the federal policy and determine if it will free up sufficient funds to enable South Dakota to afford Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nDaugaard has floated expanding eligibility to the entitlement program to an additional 50,000 people in the state, the Associated Press reports.\n\nSouth Dakota is currently one of the 19 states that has opted out of expansion under Obamacare.\n\nThe Obama administration has proposed extending an expiring Obamacare provision that temporarily covers the cost of Medicaid expansion for states. The GOP-controlled Congress, which has not backed down from its efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, will likely reject the president\u2019s proposal due to its cost.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
