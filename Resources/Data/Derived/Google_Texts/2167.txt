Election Results: Dart wins Cook County Sheriffs primary Tom Dart Aside from governor, the Cook County sheriffs race was practically the only high-profile contested race on Democratic ballots in the March 18 primary, and incumbent Sheriff Tom Dart won handily over three challengers, with 69.4 percent of the vote (169,684), according to unofficial results on Wednesday morning.



Dart is well on his way to being elected to his third term in office in November because there was no Republican candidate running for sheriff in the primary. Unless Republican officials appoint someone to run against him in the general election, the Mt. Greenwood attorney will be unopposed.



William Bill Evans, a lieutenant with 23 years of experience with the Cook County Sheriffs Department, ran a spirited campaign but came in a distant second with 14.3 percent (34,927) of the vote countywide. Sylvester Baker Jr. came in third with 10.1 percent (24.737), and Tadeusz Palka, was fourth with 14,988 votes (6.1 percent).



Its unfortunate that sometimes in Cook County, the best candidates dont always win, said Evans on Tuesday night. I hope I opened some eyes (about problems in the Sheriffs Office), added Evans, who has no plans to run for any other elective office. This is the only office I was interested in. Im a career cop, and I will go back to work on Thursday, he said.



Chicago voters were also asked three nonbinding questions, which got a majority of votes. These include whether large ammunition magazines with more than 15 bullets should be banned; whether guns should be banned from businesses where liquor is sold; and if taxi drivers should receive a rate hike, for the first time in eight years.



Voters in many wards, including the 15th, 16th and 17th wards, were also asked whether employees of companies doing business with the city should be paid at least $15 an hour. That also received wide support.



Both Congressmen Bobby Rush (1st) and Bill Lipinski (3rd) were unchallenged in the Democratic primary.



In the 3rd District Republican primary, Sharon Brannigan, a Palos Township trustee and small business owner was victorious over Diane M. Harris, a resident of Will County, in the bid to go up against Lipinski in November. Brannigan received 18,007 votes (63 percent) to 10,756 for Harris.



On campaign stops, Brannigan described herself as conservative, pro-life, and in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act.



Lipinski isnt a big fan of the ACA or Obamacare himself, and noted at his victory party at Flag Creek Golf Club in Countryside that he voted against it originally and sponsored or co-sponsored at least 20 bills to improve it.



Obamacare didnt fix our healthcare problems and more needs to be done, he said.



The congressman said he looks forward to getting back to work and will focus on job creation, and passing a new transportation and infrastructure bill in September. He said funding is needed to make the many road and rail improvements needed in the Chicago area.



Lipinski said that federal funding from the transportation bill, as well as IDOT, will hopefully enable plans to progress on the building of an underpass at Archer and Central to alleviate chronic traffic congestion caused by the railroad crossing there.



Plans are also in the works for an underpass either at 63rd or 65th and Harlem.



That area is a chronic bottleneck, said the congressman, noting that he would prefer the 65th Street location for the underpass because it would benefit growing businesses in Bedford Park, as well as cause less disruption for residential areas along 63rd Street.



In November, Rush will face Republican Jimmy Lee Tillman, son of former Chicago Ald. Dorothy Tillman.



State senators Steven Landek (D-12th) and Bill Cunningham (D-18th) are running unopposed in their races as well. There are no Republican candidates running in those races either, so they should have an easy time in November.



State Representatives Daniel J. Burke (D-1st), Esther Golar (D-6th), Silvana Tabares (D-21st) Michael Madigan (D-22nd), Michael J. Zalewski (D-23rd), Monique Davis (D-27th) and Mary Flowers (D-31st) were unopposed in the primary as well, and so far, face no Republican opposition either.



State Rep. Frances Hurley (D-35th) was unopposed on Tuesday, but will face Victor C. Horne in November. He ran unopposed in the Republican primary.



The three Democrats nominated for commissioner seats on the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District were Cynthia Santos (109,794), Frank Avila (108,429) and Timothy Bradford (104,343). The fourth-place finisher was Josina Morita with 82,929. An urban planner, she would have been the first Asian-American to sit on the MWRD board.



In the most prominent local judicial race, Lauren Brougham Glennon lost to Terrence J. McGuire for the 3rd-Subcircuit.
