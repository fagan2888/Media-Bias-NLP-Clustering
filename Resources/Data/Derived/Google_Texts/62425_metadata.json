He appears to be hamming up a game of in-door tennis in a gorgeous living room in front of an expensive modern painting while his rich family cuddles and laughs. It is the very picture of opulence, and the image is going viral around the more hand-wringy and indignant corners of the Internet. Time calls it \"maddeningly tone-deaf.\"\n\nOh , please.\n\nYes, the photo is unabashedly self-centered and braggy, but you know what else is unabashedly self-centered and braggy? The entire family holiday card tradition. \"My spouse is perfectly wonderful, and our children are the light of our lives\" is the subtext or actual text of every Christmas card I've ever seen. What distinguishes Dimon's, therefore, card is not its approach, but its gilden accoutrements. But if you really find yourself feeling \"resentful\" that the CEO of JP Morgan has a nice living room, and would dare to mail goofy pictures from it to his best friends over the holidays, your quiver of arrows needs to find more deserving targets\u2014especially when you're firing at JP Morgan.
