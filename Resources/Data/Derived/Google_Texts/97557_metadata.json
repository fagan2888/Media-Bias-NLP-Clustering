If the Obama administration succeeds in lifting current trade restrictions, Cuba will certainly benefit from being able to sell into the enormous market just to its north. But exactly how much it will benefit from increased trade is unclear.\n\nAs large as Cuba loomed in American politics, particularly during the Cold War, it has little economic heft in terms of population size, gross domestic product, and natural resources. About 11 million people live on the island, making it a little smaller by population than Ohio. That\u2019s not nothing \u2013 but the Gross Domestic Product per capita in Ohio runs about $37,690. In Cuba it\u2019s about $10,200.\n\nRelated: Can Business Succeed Where the Cuba Embargo Failed?\n\nOne reason expanded trade with the U.S. won\u2019t make a huge difference for Cuba is that the U.S. embargo currently barring most trade is unilateral \u2013 so Cuba is already doing business with the rest of the world, and has established trade relationships. Second, the bulk of Cuba\u2019s exports are commodities that trade on a global market, meaning that U.S. demand for those commodities already affects demand for its exports, even if they aren\u2019t sold directly to the U.S.\n\nIf Cuba were the world\u2019s only producer of iPhones, for example, and was suddenly presented with the opportunity to sell them to a few hundred million new customers in one of the world\u2019s richest countries, it would be big economic news. But it doesn\u2019t work the same way for raw sugar and fruit juice.\n\nSlideshow: American Cars that Rock Cuba\n\nAnother problem facing Cuba: Currently there\u2019s a global supply glut in the country\u2019s two chief exports: raw sugar and refined petroleum products. Sugar prices have tumbled in recent years as a result of oversupply, which is terrible news for Havana, because it makes up more than 25 percent of Cuba\u2019s total exports.\n\nThe news isn\u2019t much better for petroleum products. Along with the price of crude oil, prices of refined petroleum products (gasoline, kerosene, aviation fuel) have been tumbling on global markets due to increased supply and weak demand. That market makes up another 15 percent of all Cuban exports.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Unilateral Moves Change the GOP Agenda\n\nCuba\u2019s third largest export is nickel matte, and sadly, there\u2019s little for Havana to cheer about there, either. Again, it\u2019s a global commodity, and even if increased direct trade with the U.S. made a difference, it wouldn\u2019t be much. The U.S. imported about $2.5 million worth of nickel matte in 2010, accounting for about 0.03 percent of global demand.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the world\u2019s largest exporter of nickel matte, Canada, is the U.S.\u2019s largest trading partner.\n\nSurely U.S. cigar aficionados and rum drinkers will give a boost to those two Cuban industries \u2013 but given that Cuba already exports both products globally, the increase in sales would likely be relatively small on a percentage basis.\n\nPossibly the biggest economic benefit to Cuba from a restructured relationship with the United States would be the potential increase in tourism. Still, it\u2019s important to remember that the travel restrictions the U.S. imposed were unilateral. Cuba has been welcoming tourists from almost every other nation on earth for the past 50 years, so it\u2019s not as if there\u2019s no tourism sector in the country.\n\nRelated: 4 Issues that Could Derail Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 Hopes\n\nThe proximity of Cuba to the U.S. could drive significant tourism to the island, whose dollars would undoubtedly boost the Cuban economy. Some U.S. developers are already, no doubt, wondering when and if the Cuban government would be interested in allowing a few luxury U.S. resort hotels to open on the island.\n\nEven if that happened, though, cruise ships and planes full of spring breakers aren\u2019t enough to support much more than a lot of low-paying service sector jobs \u2013 just as in the rest of the Caribbean.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Cuba is seen as the big winner from the Obama administration\u2019s plan to normalize diplomatic relations and reestablish trade with the communist nation.
