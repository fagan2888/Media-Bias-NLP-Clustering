Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to write a similar request to President Obama, following up on suspicions long held by conservative activists and some lawmakers that White House aides had inappropriately received private tax returns of organizations and individuals. In April 2014, then Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., had sent a similar request.\n\nA White House spokesman on Friday referred Government Executive to a Feb. 17 response to the senators. In that letter, White House counsel Neil Eggleston said Obama wasn\u2019t refusing to comply, but noted that the new request is \u201clargely identical\u201d to the letter from Camp last year and that Koskinen will be responding in the course of the IRS\u2019 larger documentation production effort to satisfy congressional inquiries.\n\n\u201cI understand that, over the past two years, the IRS has produced more than 1 million pages of documents to your committee,\u201d Eggleston wrote. \u201cI also understand that 250 IRS employees have spent more than 138,000 hours working directly on complying with congressional investigations, at a cost of approximately $18 million, which also includes the cost of adding capacity to the IRS\u2019 information systems.\u201d\n\nThe notion that White House officials looked at private taxpayer returns is also at the heart of an ongoing legal battle between the nonprofit transparency group Cause of Action and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.\n\nTIGTA has so far fended off Cause of Action\u2019s demand for the release of 2,500 documents that the nonprofit says might show inappropriate exchanges of taxpayer information early in the Obama administration. The officials allegedly involved are Austan Goolsbee, former chairman of Council of Economic Advisers, and Jeanne Lambrew, who was deputy director of the now-defunct White House Office of Health Reform.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles S.
