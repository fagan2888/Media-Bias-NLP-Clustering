Some are narcissists, some are psychopaths, some are sadists and some are just plain mean trolls with inferiority complexes.

When the right wing takes to Twitter it isn’t to be funny or relevant it is just to spread hate, racism, xenophobia or stir up the rest of the internet. Here are the worst examples of their tweets this year:

The most disgusting tweets after the State of the Union

I feel like we’ve just endured a verbal water boarding. #sotu #foxnewsCHAT — toddstarnes (@toddstarnes) January 21, 2015

Obama says it's time to close Gitmo… we should be expanding it! #FoxNewsCHAT — Kimberly Guilfoyle (@kimguilfoyle) January 21, 2015

I wish when they cut to Elizabeth Warren she'd be knitting a US flag with a hammer and sickle where the stars are supposed to be. — Jonah Goldberg (@JonahNRO) January 21, 2015

Now Obama explains that smart foreign policy requires us to physically pleasure Iran. — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) January 21, 2015

Oh, this wasn't a small step for diplomacy with the Castros. It was flopping down on the bed and saying, "Heyyyy, sailor." — Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) January 21, 2015

@neiltyson oh shut up already. If you hate this country so much leave you have conned enough money out of ignorant people to leave — Phillip (@PhillipG76) April 2, 2015

Right wing goes after Baltimore uprising on Twitter

"Freddie Gray's family doesn't want this." Apologies but we have a President that does. They're outranked. — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) April 27, 2015

Hmmmm… an AR-15 with 30-round magazines sure seems reasonable in #Baltimore right now, doesn't it? — Bob Owens (@bob_owens) April 27, 2015

And this is why the police have militarized. Geez. Lawlessness begs for more force. KNOCK. IT. OFF. — Melissa Clouthier (@MelissaTweets) April 27, 2015

The right wing cannot handle Caitlyn Jenner’s revelation.

You probably agree that transgenderism is a mental illness, but you're too cowed by the potential disapproval of your peers to say so. — Neal Dewing (@Neal_Dewing) June 1, 2015

If you are cheering rather than praying for a man who has mutilated himself due to mental illness, you are part of the problem. — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) June 1, 2015

Conservatives on Twitter say Cecil the lion is like Planned Parenthood

Tip for reporters trying to figure out why people are shocked by the PP videos. Just pretend PP staff are talking about baby lions. Get it? — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) July 28, 2015

pro-abortion activists I follow have been super silent about @PPact organ harvesting, understandably, but now raising hell about lion. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) July 29, 2015

Look at all this outrage over a dead lion, but where is all the outrage over the planned parenthood dead babies. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) July 29, 2015

#IStandWithAhmed but the right wing certainly doesn’t.

Because hashtags are always helpful. Kinda like not bringing bomb looking things to school. #IStandWithAhmed http://t.co/yoQ3thaOqX — Steven Crowder (@scrowder) September 16, 2015
