Firefighters were able to get a fire near the World Arena quickly under control Saturday morning, despite how large it was when crews first got on scene.

According to people living nearby, a thick plume of smoke and tall flames were visible from several blocks after the fire sparked in a home on Stratmoor Drive at 5:30 a.m.

"There is a structure fire in the Cheyenne Mountain area!!!!! It's big!" Chris Torrez wrote on our 11 News Facebook page. "Glowing red."

"Upon arrival, we had fire coming out the roof of the structure," Stratmoor Hills Fire Department Asst. Fire Chief Mark Parker told 11 News. "Immediately called in help from CSFD."

Parker said once crews got water on the fire, it was knocked down "fairly quick."

Based on the damage on the "upper part of the house" versus the first floor, Parker speculated the fire may have started close to the roof.

"There's very little damage down on the first floor," he said.

Investigators are still working to determine a cause and locate the exact origin of the fire.

No one was in the home at the time of the fire. Officials say the house was under renovation.

"They will be putting a new roof on the house," Parker said.
