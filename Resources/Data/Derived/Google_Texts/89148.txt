As we continue to see proliferation of data in health care, and especially in the realm of mental and behavioral health, this increase is creating silos that hinder the consistent coordination of care. In order to improve the consistent coordination of care, it is necessary to modernize legacy health and human services systems with a patient centric focus to include data that is not just text and notes, but actionable information. This actionable information is critical to drive improved care coordination.

Join Herb Quinde, Director, Public Sector with Microsoft Corporation for this exclusive executive web briefing, “Liberate Your Data: How Modernizing Legacy Health & Human Services Systems Is Leading To Improved Care Coordination,” scheduled for April 30 at 2:00pm EST.
