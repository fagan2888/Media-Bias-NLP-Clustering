The plaintiffs\u2019 religious beliefs \u201cremain the same, but in the interim, the law has changed,\u201d Jackson wrote.\n\nThe defendants in the case, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other government agencies, have made accommodations alleviating the \u201cburden that the mandate imposes on religious organizations that are not entirely exempt\u201d from the law, Jackson wrote in her ruling.\n\nExcept for one plaintiff \u2014 Thomas Aquinas College, which is self-insured \u2014 the law no longer requires the entities to \u201cprovide, pay for, or facilitate access to contraception,\u201d Jackson wrote. The new lawsuit was filed Sept. 20.\n\nSupreme Court\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Nov. 26 agreed to hear two cases brought by businesses owners who object on religious grounds to the birth-control mandate. The lawsuits by the for-profit employers, the craft store chain Hobby Lobby Stores Inc. and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp., will be the court\u2019s first look at President Barack Obama\u2019s biggest legislative accomplishment since a majority of the justices upheld the core of the law in 2012.\n\nThe court on Dec. 2 declined to hear an appeal by Liberty University, a Virginia school founded by the late evangelical preacher and activist Jerry Falwell, which lost a lower-court case arguing the law\u2019s employer mandate exceeded Congress\u2019s power over interstate commerce.\n\nLawsuits by nonprofit religious groups challenging the contraceptive-coverage mandate are less advanced in the courts because the Obama administration delayed that requirement for a year as it sought an accommodation with them.\n\nBrooklyn Case\n\nJackson\u2019s ruling follows and conflicts with a Dec. 16 ruling by U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn, New York, barring the government from enforcing the mandate against a group of New York-based Catholic health and educational organizations. This month, the University of Notre Dame filed a complaint in federal court in South Bend, Indiana challenging the law.\n\nDavid Timothy Raimer, a lawyer representing the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, didn\u2019t immediately return a call after regular business hours seeking comment on the ruling.\n\nUnder a revision to coverage requirements, the Catholic health and education groups are to notify third-party benefit administrators of their objections to the contraception mandate and allow them to provide coverage to employees by Jan. 1. Jackson, disagreeing with the plaintiffs, said that notification requirement wasn\u2019t a substantial burden on the groups\u2019 religious rights.\n\nThe case is Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington v. Sebelius, 13-cv-01441, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). The New York case is Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York v. Sebelius, 12-cv-2542, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).\n\n\u2013With assistance from Christie Smythe in federal court in Brooklyn, New York and Andrew Harris in federal court in Chicago.
