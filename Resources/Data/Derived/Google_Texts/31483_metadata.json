I gulped. Emily was diagnosed with an early-stage breast cancer more than 25 years ago. She had surgery, it was successful, and she went on to live a full, beautiful life as an artist, an architect and a Buddhist. Now, in her early 70s, she discovered that another cancer was growing in her breast, and malignant cells were found in several lymph nodes. Her doctor ordered a PET scan, to see where else the cancer cells might have spread.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to let him do his PET scan,\u201d Emily said, \u201cbut that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m taking chemo, not at my age. I don\u2019t care what the doctor says. I\u2019ve already made up my mind.\u201d\n\nMaking up your mind about what medical interventions to have \u2014 or not have \u2014 is one of the toughest decisions you\u2019ll ever have to make. It\u2019s a deeply personal choice, and depends on your age, your attitude and your approach to life ... and death.\n\nAnd according to a powerful, bestselling book by Dr. Atul Gawande, \u201cBeing Mortal,\u201d it also depends on your ability to deal with high-pressure salesmen with medical degrees, doctors who are trained to believe that death is a failure, that there\u2019s always another drug to give you or treatment to try, regardless of how effective it might be or how much sicker it might make you.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot of things in medical school,\u201d Gawande writes, \u201cbut mortality wasn\u2019t one of them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a terrific book, and even though it\u2019s not what dear pals are expecting from me in their Christmas stocking this year, I\u2019m giving it some serious thought.\n\nEzekiel Emanuel is another doctor who can help educate you when it comes to making informed choices about what to do and what not to do, when the time comes. He\u2019s an oncologist, a bioethicist, and just recently, the author of an eye-opening op-ed piece in The New York Times called \u201cAre Good Doctors Bad for Your Health?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the more surprising \u2014 and genuinely scary \u2014 research papers was published recently in JAMA Internal medicine,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt found that patients with acute, life-threatening cardiac conditions did better when the senior cardiologists were out of town. And this was at the best hospitals in the United States.\u201d\n\nAnd not just a little better \u2014 a lot better. \u201cMortality decreased by about\n\n\u2153 for some patients when those top doctors were away.\u201d\n\nEmanuel calls the results \u201ctruly shocking and counterintuitive.\u201d And while he\u2019s not 100 percent sure how to explain it, he\u2019s got some theories.\n\nOne is that while senior cardiologists are great researchers, it\u2019s actually the junior docs \u2014 just out of training \u2014 who are more adept clinically. Another explanation has to do with interventions. Senior docs are trained to keep trying more and more things, even though the data shows that often, more is not only not better for the patient, it\u2019s actually worse.\n\n\u201cWe \u2014 both physicians and patients \u2014 often forget that every test and treatment can go wrong, produce side effects or lead to additional interventions that themselves can go wrong. ... We find it hard to refrain from trying another drug, blood test, imaging study or surgery.\u201d\n\nLet the patient be aware. But awareness isn\u2019t enough. Next time your doctor is proposing an intervention, whether an x-ray, genetic test or surgery, Emanuel suggests you ask your doctor a few basic questions: First, what difference will it make? Will the rest results change the approach to treatment?\n\nSecond, how much improvement in terms of prolongation of life, reduction in risk of a heart attack or other problem is the treatment actually going to make?\n\nThird, how likely and severe are the side effects?\n\nYour doctor might bristle at the questions, but be brave and ask anyway.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "I\u2019ve already made up my mind.\u201dMaking up your mind about what medical interventions to have \u2014 or not have \u2014 is one of the toughest decisions you\u2019ll ever have to make.\n...
