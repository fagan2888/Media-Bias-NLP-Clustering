But 80 years on, his words fit right into the debate about the Internet in American cities. Should a city, county or district dissatisfied with lousy corporate service have the authority to construct and offer its own Internet?\n\nPortland says yes. Along with some of the nation\u2019s largest cities, like Los Angeles, Boston and San Antonio, the Oregon city has joined Next Century Cities, a group that advocates for municipal \u201cself-determination\u201d on the issue.\n\nPresident Obama thinks so too, and will host a community broadband summit at the White House this June.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, the former mayor of Newark, proposed a law this week that would clear the way for localities to build, operate and expand their own broadband networks.\n\nBut in 19 states, the provision of public broadband is plagued by legal obstacles. Not surprisingly, telecom companies believe state legislators are right to regulate and restrict the practice. And some advocates for the open Internet say the problem isn\u2019t recalcitrant, monopolistic corporations \u2014 but regulation-ridden cities themselves.\n\nHovering over all this is a larger question: Is the Internet today, like electricity a century ago, a utility that \u2014 as a group of Democratic senators opined last year \u2014 Americans \u201ccannot live without\u201d?\n\nAs Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, is to bus rapid transit, so Chattanooga, Tennessee, is to municipal broadband. The \u201cfastest Internet in the Western Hemisphere\u201d has transformed this post-industrial river town into a national example, the envy of urban mayors trying to birth and lure tech firms. San Francisco and New York offer tax breaks in the hundreds of millions of dollars to keep companies like Twitter and Fresh Direct. Chattanooga\u2019s approach was more constructive.\n\n\u201cCheap, high-speed Internet would encourage companies to relocate,\u201d Emily Badger writes. \u201cAnd if those firms ever went bust, or decided to leave town (for, say, more tax breaks elsewhere), at least the city would still be left with an invaluable long-term piece of infrastructure.\u201d Chattanooga now hosts five venture capital funds with more than $50 million to invest, and has attracted a smattering of tech outfits to its downtown core.\n\nIn 2007, the city announced a 10-year plan to build out \u2014 through the municipally owned electric company \u2014 a very fast municipal broadband network. Today, Chattanooga provides fiber connections to 60,000 homes and 4,500 businesses, about half the city\u2019s total potential customers. Downloading a two-hour movie takes the average high-speed broadband customer in the U.S. half an hour. In Chattanooga, it takes 30 seconds.\n\nChattanooga is the largest American city to have constructed its own broadband system. But hundreds of others have followed suit, building independent networks or smaller infrastructure improvements. It was in Cedar Falls, Iowa \u2013 where the publicly owned Cedar Falls Utilities provides broadband nearly 100 times faster than the national average \u2013 that President Obama made his case for municipal networks this month.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As cities clamor to bolster their Internet connectivity, an ideological debate is brewing over how to get it done", "title": "The battle for America\u2019s broadband: The Internet debate taking the country by storm", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As cities clamor to bolster their Internet connectivity, an ideological debate is brewing over how to get it done", "title": "The battle for America\u2019s broadband: The Internet debate taking the country by storm", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/25/the_battle_for_americas_broadband_the_internet_debate_taking_the_country_by_storm/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/obama_circuitry.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As cities clamor to bolster their Internet connectivity, an ideological debate is brewing over how to get it done", "title": "The battle for America\u2019s broadband: The Internet debate taking the country by storm", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/obama_circuitry.jpg", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Henry Grabar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, broadband, Dream City, Oregon, Portland, telecommunications, The Internet", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, is to bus rapid transit, so Chattanooga, Tennessee, is to municipal broadband.\nBut 80 years on, his words fit right into the debate about the Internet in American cities.\nIn 2007, the city announced a 10-year plan to build out \u2014 through the municipally owned electric company \u2014 a very fast municipal broadband network.\nShould a city, county or district dissatisfied with lousy corporate service have the authority to construct and offer its own Internet?\nTopics: broadband, Dream City, Oregon, Portland, telecommunications, The Internet, Innovation News, NewsIn 1932, presidential candidate Franklin Roosevelt delivered a message of civic empowerment to the citizens of Portland, Oregon."}
