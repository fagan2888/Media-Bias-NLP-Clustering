He agreed to step aside and support a replacement called for by members of his own political alliance, news agencies and Iraq\u2019s state television reported on Thursday night.\n\nWhile the development eased fears that a military coup may unfold in Iraq\u2019s capital, uncertainty remained over whether the nominee for prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, himself a Shiite, will be able to quickly form a government that can address the security crisis.\n\nIn Washington, National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice described the development as \u201cencouraging,\u201d and said the White House hopes it will help to unite Iraqis in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nThe Obama administration, along with several U.S. allies, have spent recent weeks calling for the formation of a new Iraqi government that is more inclusive of the nation\u2019s Sunni tribes, some of which are said to have offered support to the Islamic State in areas north and west of Baghdad.\n\nWithout resistance from the tribes, the al Qaeda-inspired extremists have seized a wide swath of territory in Iraq and Syria. The resulting humanitarian crisis prompted President Obama to authorize U.S. airstrikes on Islamic State positions, along with humanitarian air drops for Iraqis surrounded by the extremists.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Obama declared that U.S. forces had broken a siege by Islamic State fighters against ethnic minorities, who had sought refuge on a mountain in northern Iraq, and said it won\u2019t be necessary to conduct a rescue operation.\n\n\u201cThe situation on the mountain has greatly improved,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe broke the [militants\u2019] siege of Mount Sinjar and we helped save many innocent lives.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials initially expressed concern that the U.S. military might be required to evacuate tens of thousands of people of the Yazidi minority group from Mount Sinjar, where they had fled from an onslaught by the militants.\n\nBut Mr. Obama said Thursday that a team of U.S. special operations troops who investigated conditions on Mount Sinjar on Wednesday had determined the Yazidis are now in better condition than had been thought.\n\n\u201cThey found that food and water have been reaching those in need,\u201d the president said, adding that thousands of Yazidis have been evacuating the mountain at night with the help of Kurdish fighters in the region.\n\nMr. Obama said that U.S. military forces will continue to conduct airstrikes against militants aligned with the Islamic State, whose leader declared the establishment of an Islamic caliphate in the region in late June.\n\nThe Obama administration has said its strategy for confronting the extremists centers on a plan to bolster and rebuild the capabilities of Iraq\u2019s military, the northern units of which essentially dissolved in the face of the Islamic State surge two months ago.\n\nThe strategy has been hindered by the political crisis in Baghdad, and Obama administration officials have suggested they are withholding U.S. financial and military support from the Iraqis until the nation\u2019s parliament moves to form a more inclusive government.\n\nWashington\u2019s posturing has coincided with a political struggle in the Iraqi capital, where Mr. al-Maliki had struggled for weeks to stay in power for a third, four-year term as prime minister.\n\nA coalition led by Mr. al-Maliki\u2019s party won the most votes in national elections in May, but the political process has stalled amid infighting and attempts by al-Maliki opponents to push him out.\n\nPressure intensified this week when Iraqi President Fouad Massoum nominated Mr. al-Abadi to replace Mr. al-Maliki and form a new government. Mr. Al-Maliki refused to step aside, saying the nomination violates the constitution.\n\nBut in a meeting Thursday, he agreed to endorse Mr. al-Abadi, according a report by The Associated Press.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council urged Mr. al-Abadi to work swiftly to form \u201can inclusive government that represents all segments of the Iraqi population and that contributes to finding a viable and sustainable solution to the country\u2019s current challenges.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Embattled Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stepped down Thursday, ending a stalemate that had worsened Baghdad's political chaos in recent weeks and crippled the nation's ability to quell a surge of extremist Sunni militants.", "Author": "Dave Boyer, Guy Taylor and Guy Taylor, Dave Boyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Embattled Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stepped down Thursday, ending a stalemate that had worsened Baghdad\u2019s political chaos in recent weeks and crippled the nation\u2019s ability to quell a surge of extremist Sunni militants.", "title": "Iraq\u2019s Nouri al-Maliki resigns as prime minister amid chaos", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/14/iraqs-nouri-al-maliki-resigns-as-prime-minister-am/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/14/mideast-iraqjpeg-06399.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/14/mideast-iraqjpeg-06399.jpg", "title": "Iraq\u2019s Nouri al-Maliki resigns as prime minister amid chaos", "description": "Embattled Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stepped down Thursday, ending a stalemate that had worsened Baghdad's political chaos in recent weeks and crippled the nation's ability to quell a surge", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict, Nouri Al Maliki, Iraq, Baghdad"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8a8\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Al-Maliki refused to step aside, saying the nomination violates the constitution.\nPressure intensified this week when Iraqi President Fouad Massoum nominated Mr. al-Abadi to replace Mr. al-Maliki and form a new government.\nMr. al-Maliki, a Shiite, had been widely blamed for fanning the flames of the insurgency by monopolizing power and alienating Iraq\u2019s Sunni population during his eight years in office.\nHe agreed to step aside and support a replacement called for by members of his own political alliance, news agencies and Iraq\u2019s state television reported on Thursday night.\n\u201cThe situation on the mountain has greatly improved,\u201d Mr. Obama said."}
