The scanner analyzes photons emitted from food molecules, sorting them by wavelength and counting them to identify the chemical compounds in the food, sending the results to one\u2019s cellphone.\n\nThe spectrometer would allow a person with celiac disease or gluten allergy the ability to detect their \u201ckryptonite,\u201d even small amounts of the allergen that contaminate gluten-free restaurant dishes in busy kitchens, at home, and out on the town. The device also estimates a given item\u2019s calorie count, potentially revolutionizing the world of dieting.\n\nIsabel Hoffman, the CEO of startup manufacturer TellSpec, says she was inspired to invent the device after her daughter received a diagnosis of severe allergy to gluten, mold, and certain food dyes. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s health and my desire to help others like her provided the motivation to make TellSpec,\u201d Hoffman said in a statement. \u201cMy goal now is to help people like my daughter to lead a normal life with the knowledge to choose clean healthy food.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian company says they expect to begin manufacturing the device within the next three to four months after the machine, which is now a prototype, is evaluated independently for accuracy. Presently, the company is accepting pledges of $150 for pre-orders of the device.\n\nSara Bleich, an associate professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University, told ABC News this month the device would be great \u2014 if it works. \u201cAmong those who do report seeing the calorie information, there is pretty compelling evidence that is leads them to make a lower calorie choice,\u201d Bleich said. \u201cIt would be great if it could be created as an app so people would always have it with them on their phone. Convenience is very important when you are trying to encourage behavior change.\" Although not yet verified for accuracy, the device has created a buzz online as the company reports raising $380,000 from pre-orders for the device.\n\nBelow is a video on the TellSpec:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "measuring calories, counting calories, device reads calories, laser, allergens, tellspec", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The TellSpec is a device, akin to a \"speed gun,\" that shines a beam of light onto food to measure caloric content, and search for allergens.", "title": "Shine Light On Your Food And Get Allergen, Caloric Information", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-device-uses-light-beam-read-food-calories-allergens-267461", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/19/device-reads-food-measure-calories.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The TellSpec is a device, akin to a \"speed gun,\" that shines a beam of light onto food to measure caloric content, and search for allergens.", "title": "Shine Light On Your Food And Get Allergen, Caloric Information", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-device-uses-light-beam-read-food-calories-allergens-267461", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/19/device-reads-food-measure-calories.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/19/device-reads-food-measure-calories.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-01-19T18:17:39-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-19T19:44:27-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The TellSpec is a device, akin to a \"speed gun,\" that shines a beam of light onto food to measure caloric content, and search for allergens."}, "article_summary": "Like a speed gun for food, a new handheld electronic device allows users to scan food for molecular content, identifying the content and calorie count via laser.\nAlthough not yet verified for accuracy, the device has created a buzz online as the company reports raising $380,000 from pre-orders for the device.\n\u201cMy daughter\u2019s health and my desire to help others like her provided the motivation to make TellSpec,\u201d Hoffman said in a statement.\nThe device also estimates a given item\u2019s calorie count, potentially revolutionizing the world of dieting.\nThe scanner analyzes photons emitted from food molecules, sorting them by wavelength and counting them to identify the chemical compounds in the food, sending the results to one\u2019s cellphone."}
