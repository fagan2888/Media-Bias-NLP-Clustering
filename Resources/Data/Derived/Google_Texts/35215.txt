A week after snow delayed plans, Rep. Rhonda Fields, D-Aurora, will have a ribbon-cutting ceremony to debut a new youth center in Aurora.

The Dayton Street Opportunity Center, as it will be named, will aim to prevent youth violence and tragedies like the one that claimed her son’s life 10 years ago. Her son, Javad Marshall-Fields, and his fiancée, Vivian Wolfe, were killed a week before Marshall-Fields was set to testify in a murder trial.

The perpetrators, now on death row, had dropped out of high school and had limited opportunities in their communities, according to a news release about the grand opening of the center.

“The goal of the Dayton Street Opportunity Center is to reduce factors like these and create more opportunities for youth,” the release states.

Fields started the Fields Foundation and since 2012 has been recruiting community partners to create the center.

Among the partners, the Mosaic Church of Aurora, Colorado State University and Servicios de la Raza will help provide access to a variety of services including health testing, educational preparation, mentoring and job training.

The center will be located at 1445 Dayton St. in Aurora. The ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held from 4 to 6 p.m. Sunday at the center.
