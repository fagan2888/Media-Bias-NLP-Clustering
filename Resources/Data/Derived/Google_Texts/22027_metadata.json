The health risks associated with smoking has led to large declines in the amount of smokers in the U.S. since the 1970s, dropping from around 40 percent to about 18 percent of adults. But as always, as one popular vice fades away, another one gains steam \u2014 or in this case, smoke. Now, a new study from New York University has determined how popular hookah smoking has become among high school seniors.\n\nTraditionally from the Middle East, hookah involves smoking flavored tobacco from a large water pipe. It\u2019s become increasingly popular in North America and other parts of the world, in part, because it\u2019s believed to be less harmful to the body \u2014 the tobacco is considered to be milder. However, that\u2019s not entirely the case because hookah smokers tend to take more puffs in one session, resulting in similar, if not worse effects than smoking.\n\nThe NYU researchers\u2019 study involved data from the Monitoring the Future nationwide study, which follows teens\u2019 behaviors, values, and attitudes. Of the almost 15,000 kids aged 18 involved in the study, 5,540 were questioned about their hookah use between 2010 and 2012. They discovered that 18 percent, or almost one in five high school seniors, had smoked hookah within the 12 months prior to being surveyed.\n\nInterestingly, they also found that \u201cstudents of higher socioeconomic status appear to be more likely to use hookah,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Palamar, assistant professor of population health at NYU Langone Medical Center, in a press release. \u201cSurprisingly, students with more educated parents or higher personal income are at high risk for use. We also found that hookah use is more common in cities, especially big cities. So hookah use is much different from cigarette use, which is more common in non-urban areas.\u201d\n\nIn NYC, hookahs have become very popular, appearing in clubs, increasingly numerous hookah bars, and pretty much wherever someone with a hookah pipe wants to bring it, from the beach to their stoop. Among the general population, hookah use has increased by as much as 123 percent, co-author of the study Dr. Michael Weitzman said. But although they come with similar health risks \u2014 respiratory illness, herpes, heart disease, and some cancers \u2014 consistent use isn\u2019t such an issue. \u201cUse tends to be much different from traditional cigarette smoking,\u201d Palamar said in the release. \u201cRight now it appears that a lot of hookah use is more ritualistic, used occasionally \u2014 for example, in hookah bars, and not everyone inhales.\u201d\n\nThe researchers dampened that glimmer of hope, however, warning that people who begin using hookah may eventually turn to vape pens or e-cigarettes, which also sport a wide range of flavors while remaining mysterious in terms of health effects. But increased scrutiny directed toward the e-cigarette industry may deter these possible transitionaries. Educating the public, and especially the youth, about how smoking hookah isn\u2019t completely harmless may be the experts\u2019 best bet.\n\nSource: Palamar J, Weitzman M, Zhou S, Sherman S.
