Sioux Falls, SD

Summer may still be a ways off but an annual event to help find a cure for children with Cancer brings some summer time fun indoors.

This weekend hundreds take part in the The Winterfest Of Wheels car show in Sioux Falls. Now in its sixth year the event show cases a number of one of a kind cars while raising support for Cure Kids Cancer.

“This is wonderful show and there is a lot of people put a lot of hard work into this. It's all volunteer and it amazing what everybody gets done,” Marv Spomer said.

This year’s theme is a used "classic" car lot. Spomer brought his collection of antique signs and lights. All the money raised from the event goes to Sanford Cure kids Cancer in Sioux Falls.
