Kit Bond\u2019s St. Louis office.\n\nBut Bond, a former governor who now works as a lobbyist in Jefferson City and Washignton, D.C., said on Tuesday he was not ready to endorse his former staff member\u2019s 2016 campaign for governor.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s a great candidate,\u201d he said, adding that he thinks it is \u201ca little too early\u201d for him to weigh in.\n\nThree years out, the field is not yet clear in the race. Republican State Auditor Tom Schweich and St. Louis businessman John Brunner have also indicated their interest in the post, but neither have made explicit announcements.\n\nBond\u2019s positioning differs from that of U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, a long-time Hanaway friend, who endorsed Hanaway\u2019s bid when she announced her campaign earlier this month.\n\nBond, who is advocating on behalf of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce for Medicaid expansion in the state, said, \u201clet\u2019s worry about Medicaid first, 2016 second.\u201d When asked whether a 2016 prospect, or he himself, would back Medicaid expansion on the campaign trail, Bond laughed and said he was not advising her on her campaign.\n\n\u201cIf I were running for a state office I\u2019d want to know about what Obamacare cuts are doing and what we could do to get Medicaid reform and transformation, and I\u2019d be on it,\u201d Bond said.\n\nHanaway has not yet weighed in on the Medicaid fight, but her likely Democratic rival, Attorney General Chris Koster, has. Just hours after Hanaway announced her gubernatorial bid, Koster was on the campaign trail in Columbia touting his support of Medicaid expansion \u2013 saying Republicans oppose it with the same \u201cangry stubbornness\u201d that led him to leave the Republican Party during the 2006 stem cell debate.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.0.1", "og": {"site_name": "PoliticMo", "description": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2013\u00a0Years ago, Catherine Hanaway served as a chief of staff in Republican U.S. Sen.
