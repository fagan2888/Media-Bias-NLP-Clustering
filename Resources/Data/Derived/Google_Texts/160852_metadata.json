The programme is far from perfect, and there are growing concerns about medicine stock-outs, but it is demonstrably saving lives.\n\nDr Motsoaledi\u2019s critics say he is reluctant to delegate, and tries to keep his hand in too many projects. He has failed to publish the long-awaited White Paper on NHI, which has been repeatedly delayed. And he is far from being the darling of the private healthcare sector, which he regularly criticises for its high prices.\n\nHowever, he has yet to acknowledge that even public hospitals levy high fees on all but the very poor, and can place a huge financial burden on families.\n\nHe has taken little action to address the structural issues facing the private healthcare sector, but this may change when the Competition Commission\u2019s market inquiry into healthcare is completed. The inquiry has been delayed by litigation, and will now only begin in earnest in August.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of his past term was his inability to really hold provinces to account for their service delivery failures. Without a change to the constitution \u2014 which is unlikely \u2014 that issue is likely to continue holding up the implementation of whatever policies his department devises, no matter how sound.\n\nDr Motsoaledi\u2019s deputy, Joe Phaahla, takes over from Gwen Ramokgopa, who stepped down and was not on the ANC\u2019s list.\n\nDr Phaahla qualified as a medical doctor at the University of Natal, but his only health-related executive role in government was when he was the Northern Cape\u2019s MEC for health and welfare between 1994 and 1997.\n\nHe does, however, have extensive, if not recent, experience of the public health sector: he started out as an intern at the Edendale hospital in Pietermaritzburg in 1984 and progressed to become a medical superintendent at various public hospitals in the early 1990s. He joined South Africa\u2019s first democratic government in 1994 as a member of the Northern Cape\u2019s provincial legislature.\n\nThe deputy health minister\u2019s position is by and large overshadowed by the minister of the day, who delegates duties to them.\n\nThe only deputy health minister who really made waves was Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, who publicly clashed with then health minister Ms Tshabalala-Msimang.\n\nDr Phaahla\u2019s role will largely be determined by the trust Dr Motsoaledi places in him and the extent to which he is willing to delegate responsibilities to him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BDlive covers economics, business and politics as the website of Business Day, the South African national daily newspaper, including Business Times", "application-name": "Business Day Live", "og": {"site_name": "Business Day Live", "description": "Not only would Dr Aaron Motsoaledi have been a hard act to follow, but a change at helm would have led to delays in implementing key policies such as National Health Insurance", "title": "Motsoaledi returns for second term as health minister", "url": "http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/health/2014/05/26/motsoaledi-returns-for-second-term-as-health-minister", "image": "http://www.bdlive.co.za/incoming/2014/02/18/aaron-motsoaledi-xxx/ALTERNATES/crop_100x100/Aaron+Motsoaledi+xxx", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-26 17:48:46.0", "author": "Tamar Kahn"}}, "msvalidate.01": "7FB4BFB7072B95663F9D473B86922BB1", "Keywords": "Business Day, Times, Media, Markets, Companies, Stock exchange, finance, economics, investment, Wanted, Peter Bruce, World, Africa, South Africa, news", "google-site-verification": "EzCi3Aoap8anKQL71BTkyxoJIAcfLuVnfQ1mtwy5sU4", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "health", "image": "http://www.bdlive.co.za/incoming/2014/02/18/aaron-motsoaledi-xxx/ALTERNATES/crop_258x180/Aaron+Motsoaledi+xxx", "articleid": 317511, "publishtime": "2014-05-26 17:48:46.0"}, "author": "Tamar Kahn", "title": "Motsoaledi returns for second term as health minister"}}, "article_summary": "Tamar KahnMotsoaledi returns for second term as health ministerAARON Motsoaledi comes back for a second term as health minister, with former deputy arts and culture minister Joe Phaahla as his deputy.\nThe only deputy health minister who really made waves was Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, who publicly clashed with then health minister Ms Tshabalala-Msimang.\nThe deputy health minister\u2019s position is by and large overshadowed by the minister of the day, who delegates duties to them.\nDr Phaahla\u2019s role will largely be determined by the trust Dr Motsoaledi places in him and the extent to which he is willing to delegate responsibilities to him.\nHe joined South Africa\u2019s first democratic government in 1994 as a member of the Northern Cape\u2019s provincial legislature."}
