If you read the speech, LBJ comes across as a big, doe-eyed, muddled-headed hippie.\n\nHe warns against \u201cunbridled growth\u201d and \u201csoulless wealth.\u201d Instead, he describes the Great Society as \u201ca place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community.\u201d It is also \u201ca place where man can renew contact with nature\u201d and \u201cwhich honors creation for its own sake.\u201d Then he unloads on the graduates with all the woozy, unfocused pseudo-idealism we associate with the flower children who were about to sprout like weeds at campuses like the University of Michigan.\n\nWithin your lifetime powerful forces, already loosed, will take us toward a way of life beyond the realm of our experience, almost beyond the bounds of our imagination.\n\nFar out, man.\n\nIt\u2019s all well and good that LBJ wanted to talk about \u201cthe needs of the spirit\u201d and \u201ca richer life of mind and spirit,\u201d though it seems a bit of a stretch for a politician who built his career as a scheming back room arm-twister. Then again, this was 1964 and LBJ was running for president, trying to get elected to the office he had taken over when John F. Kennedy died. So he was no doubt eager to rouse the idealistic youth the way Kennedy had done.\n\nYet the \u201cunconditional war on poverty\u201d LBJ had announced was a war with distinctly material goals and material means. It required hard questions about how America was going to produce the wealth required to redistribute to the poor, who was going to produce it, and how a vast network of welfare handouts was going to prepare people to integrate themselves back as productive, self-supporting workers in a growing economy. If you read LBJ looking for answers to those questions, you don\u2019t get them. What you get, instead, is an assurance that the prosperous, vibrant economy is here, we\u2019ve already built it, so now we\u2019re free to transcend its requirements as we spin off into a utopia of pure love.\n\nFor a century we labored to settle and to subdue a continent. For half a century we called upon unbounded invention and untiring industry to create an order of plenty for all of our people. The challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use that wealth to enrich and elevate our national life.\n\nThat LBJ\u2019s material goals failed is beyond dispute. The first plank he named for his Great Society was an effort \u201cto make the American city a place where future generations will come, not only to live but to live the good life.\u201d The immediate result was a decades-long collapse of city life and a desperate flight to the suburbs that was only halted in the 1990s. (In some places\u2014Detroit and Chicago come to mind\u2014it continues to this day.) The other big plank? Better public schools and more affordable college education.\n\nWe can see why these goals failed, because LBJ had no concern for the principles that animated the political and economic system that had settled a continent and unleashed industry and invention\u2014i.e., for the things that had actually made our society great. His speech is all about how we can take for granted that our economy is producing ever-increasing wealth and prosperity, but to be really \u201cgreat\u201d we have to subordinate that pursuit of wealth to woozy \u201cspiritual\u201d social goals.\n\nTalk about the Law of Intended Consequences. We did subordinate the pursuit of wealth, taking no account for the actual steps by which individuals take responsibility for their lives and improve themselves by their own effort. Which is why we didn\u2019t get the final escape of the masses from poverty.\n\nCome to think of it, that\u2019s also one of the reasons we didn\u2019t get a spiritually elevated society, either.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 21 May 2014 07:34:46 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "If you read LBJ's Great Society speech, he comes across as a big, doe-eyed, muddled-headed hippie.", "title": "LBJ Was The Original Hippie", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/800px-Lyndon_Johnson_signing_Medicare_bill_with_Harry_Truman_July_30_1965.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/05/21/lbj-was-the-original-hippie/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "If you read LBJ's Great Society speech, he comes across as a big, doe-eyed, muddled-headed hippie.", "creator": "@Tracinski", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/800px-Lyndon_Johnson_signing_Medicare_bill_with_Harry_Truman_July_30_1965.jpg"}, "title": "LBJ Was The Original Hippie", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Government", "tag": "cities,Great Society,hippies,John Kennedy,Law of Intended Consequences,Lyndon Johnson,War on Poverty,welfare state", "published_time": "2014-05-21T07:34:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If you read LBJ's Great Society speech, he comes across as a big, doe-eyed, muddled-headed hippie."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a42\"", "article_summary": "If you read the speech, LBJ comes across as a big, doe-eyed, muddled-headed hippie.\nYet the \u201cunconditional war on poverty\u201d LBJ had announced was a war with distinctly material goals and material means.\nReading through it, it strikes me that LBJ\u2019s Great Society speech goes a long way toward explaining why that War on Poverty failed.\nNo wonder his Great Society failed.\nIf you read LBJ looking for answers to those questions, you don\u2019t get them."}
