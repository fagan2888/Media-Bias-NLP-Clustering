We are waiting for the Americans to respond to the suggestions we have made.\"\n\nTrade Minister Rob Davies said Pretoria was keen to act to prevent the threatened action.\n\n\"We take the letter seriously as a warning that if we don\u2019t conclude, this will happen,\" he told a news conference in Cape Town.\n\nSouth Africa has banned U.S. poultry imports since last December after an outbreak of bird flu. The measure came on top of 15 years of punitive import duties on some U.S. chicken products.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said South Africa could still avoid the suspension, which could cost it up to $7 million in lost benefits, if it met benchmarks to eliminate barriers to U.S. poultry, pork, and beef.\n\nThe country missed an Oct. 15 deadline to agree on new animal health and food safety rules, which also affect U.S. beef and pork exports, prompting the United States to warn that its eligibility for the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade program was at risk.\n\nEliminating barriers to U.S. trade and investment is one of the criteria for membership of AGOA, which was renewed earlier this year and provides duty-free access to goods from sub-Saharan African countries, ranging from crude oil to clothing.\n\n\u201cWe do not take this decision lightly, and, in fact, have been working hard over many months \u2013 indeed years \u2013 to help South Africa avoid such action. Unfortunately, the issues persist,\" Froman said in a statement.\n\nNational Chicken Council President Mike Brown backed the move and said it made no sense for the United States to give special preferences to countries that treated it unfairly.\n\n\u201cThis should send a clear message to South Africa and their poultry industry that they will not be given a \u2018Get out of jail free\u2019 card every time AGOA rounds the turn,\" he said.\n\nSouth Africa exported $176 million in agricultural products to the United States under AGOA in 2014 and potential lost benefits are estimated to total $4 million to $7 million.\n\nProducts affected would include oranges, wine, macadamia nuts and edible ice, like sherbert - which normally has a tariff of 17 percent - and citrus juice, U.S. data shows.\n\n(Reporting by Roberta Rampton and Krista Hughes; Editing by Sandra Maler, Phil Berlowitz, Bernard Orr in Washington, Wendell Roelf in Cape Town and Peroshni Govendar in Johannesburg; Editing by James Macharia)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "U.S.", "title": "United States moves to punish South Africa over farm export impasse", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/05/Obama-says-will-cut-South-Africas-trade-benefits-60-days", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/05/Obama-says-will-cut-South-Africas-trade-benefits-60-days", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd325d\"", "article_summary": "South African Agriculture Minister Senzeni Zokwana expressed surprise at Obama's move on Friday.\n\u201cWe do not take this decision lightly, and, in fact, have been working hard over many months \u2013 indeed years \u2013 to help South Africa avoid such action.\nSouth Africa exported $176 million in agricultural products to the United States under AGOA in 2014 and potential lost benefits are estimated to total $4 million to $7 million.\nSouth Africa has banned U.S. poultry imports since last December after an outbreak of bird flu.\nU.S. President Barack Obama said he planned to revoke duty-free status for South African agricultural goods in 60 days under a program set up to help African exporters."}
