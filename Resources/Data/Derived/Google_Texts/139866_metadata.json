Before her new role, she served as a community and alumni relations coordinator for the NMSU College of Health and Social Services, and prior to that, assistant development officer for the NMSU College of Business.\n\nMerhege, a lifelong New Mexico resident, has been an active member of the Las Cruces community for six years. She has been involved in the CFSNM as a planning committee member for the organization\u2019s major fundraising gala event and serves on the board of the Junior League of Las Cruces.\n\nIn her new role, Merhege will use her experience in donor and community outreach to build important relationships and partnerships central to the CFSNM mission. \u201cCourtney brings a level of enthusiasm, dedication, and keen awareness that will be a tremendous asset to not only the Foundation, but our community as well,\u201d Cervantes said. Merhege will also highlight the good works of the CFSNM, connecting community members, organizations, and donors through various channels as well as provide information on the various initiatives of the CFSNM, including the Unified Prevention! (UP!) Coalition which works to reduce underage drinking and substance use by youth and young adults; the Ocotillo Institute which focuses on social justice; Place Matters, which supports health equity; and School Based Health Centers, which provide accessible, affordable health care to adolescents in school settings.\n\n\u201cMy focus will be strategic and comprehensive, allowing us to do more for southern New Mexico,\u201d Merhege said. \u201cI look forward to sharing the important work that is being done.\u201d\n\nThe CFSNM is a charitable resource linking donors with community needs.
