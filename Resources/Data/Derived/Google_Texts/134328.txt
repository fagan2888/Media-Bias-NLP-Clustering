Two men were shot during a fight outside the Beer & Deli Spot at 6501 Elmwood Ave. in Southwest Philadelphia.

Two men are recovering from their injuries after they were shot outside a deli in the Elmwood section of Southwest Philadelphia.

The victims, 28 and 22, were inside the Beer & Deli Spot at 6501 Elmwood Ave. around 11:45 p.m. Friday, when a 41-year-old man walked in and started arguing with them, police said.

The dispute moved out to the street, where all three men began fighting, according to investigators.

During the brawl, a fourth man approached, pulled out a black handgun, and fired at the victims, striking the 28-year-old in his left thigh and the 22-year-old in his left knee, police said.

Medics took both men to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, where they were placed in stable condition.

The suspect is described as a 5-foot-8-inch tall black man in his mid 20s, believed to be of African descent. He was last seen fleeing west on Elmwood Avenue, police said.

No arrest had yet been made Saturday. Anyone with information is asked to contact Philadelphia police.
