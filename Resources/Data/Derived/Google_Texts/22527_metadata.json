Trey Gowdy. (Photo: House Oversight and Government Reform Committee)\n\n(CNSNews.com) \u2013 Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) ripped into the administration Tuesday for criticizing Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) over his stance on Iran.\n\nGowdy contrasted Cotton, a U.S. Army veteran, to Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, who is under fire over the way the White House sold the Iran nuclear deal to the American people.\n\nSpeaking during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing at which the White House did not allow Rhodes to testify, Gowdy noted that Rhodes has a Master\u2019s degree in creative writing.\n\nWhile Cotton was serving combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, he said, \u201cBen Rhodes was navigating the mean streets of a creative writing curriculum.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you\u2019re interested in writing haikus and sonnets and novellas, he\u2019s probably the right guy,\u201d Gowdy continued. \u201cOn the other hand, if you\u2019re advising the leader of the free world on foreign policy matters, I don\u2019t know how a haiku helps.\u201d\n\nGowdy said he would like to have been able to ask Rhodes \u201chow his background prepared him to sell the Iranian deal, yet Tommy Cotton\u2019s background did not prepare him to criticize the Iranian deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would have been an interesting dichotomy for me.\u201d\n\nRhodes, in a New York Times Magazine profile, boasted about having \u201ccreated an echo chamber\u201d of experts and compliant journalists to sell the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\nCommittee chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) invited him to testify before the hearing, entitled \u201cWhite House narratives on the Iran nuclear deal\u201d but the White House refused to make him available.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest used the opportunity to mock Republican critics of the JCPOA, naming Cotton and others. He suggested that Chaffetz invite those critics instead to explain why they, either \u201cmisinformed\u201d or \u201clying,\u201d had said things about the deal that turned out to be untrue.\n\nChaffetz then said Cotton was willing to testify before the committee and would do so should Rhodes make an appearance.\n\nObamacare, Benghazi talking points\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) compared Rhodes\u2019 selling of the Iran nuclear deal to the administration\u2019s narrative on Obamacare.\n\nHe recalled the case of Jonathan Gruber, the MIT economist who helped the administration to write and sell the Affordable Care Act, and who infamously said its passage was the result of \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter.\u201d\n\nJordan further quoted Gruber, who was called before the committee in December 2014, as having said that \u201clack of transparency is a political advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice way of saying, if you deceive people, you might get your way, right? It might help your case,\u201d said Jordan, adding that many of the administration claims about Obamacare turned out to be false.\n\nNow Rhodes \u2013 described in the NYT Magazine piece as \u201cthe single most important influential voice shaping American foreign policy\u201d \u2013 comes along and \u201ccreates a false narrative as well,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cSo this isn\u2019t the first time this administration on some big policy decision has deceived the American people,\" Jordan said. \u201cMr. Gruber deceives the American people on Obamacare. Along comes Mr. Rhodes on the Iranian deal, uses deception to create this false choice, help get this agreement passed.\u201d\n\nHe added that it wasn\u2019t the first time Rhodes had done so, recalling the administration\u2019s talking points on the U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi. Libya on Sept. 11, 2012 which killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nAt the time, Rhodes sent an email outlining his advice to then-U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice about how to portray the attack when she appeared on Sunday talk shows five days later.\n\nIn the email, Rhodes said Rice should \u201cunderscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.\u201d\n\nWhen she appeared on the shows, Rice said the attack, according to what she said was the best information available at the time, was a \u201cspontaneous reaction\u201d to an online video mocking Mohammed.\n\nOnly later did the administration publicly concede it was a terrorist attack with a likely al-Qaeda link. The incident prompted suspicions that the administration deliberately tried to mislead American voters \u2013 during President Obama\u2019s re-election campaign \u2013 about the nature of the attack.\n\n(Rhodes\u2019 email was not among Benghazi-related documents released by the administration in response to a congressional subpoena, but it emerged later, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by the watchdog group Judicial Watch.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "Rep.
