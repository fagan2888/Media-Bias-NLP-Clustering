Photos from Facebook.\n\n\u201cTO ALL you people out there,\u201d \u00adRoxane Jones wrote in 2010.\n\n\u201cTake time to spend with your family \u2026 even though they drive us crazy at times \u2026 it\u2019s all worth it in the end.\u201d\n\nTwo years later she was dead.\n\nIn a fit of rage, her son had stabbed and slashed at her with a samurai sword and a kitchen knife, slitting her throat and puncturing her heart as she pleaded with him to stop. When she was finally dead, he zip-tied her arms and legs, wrapped her body in plastic and carried her out to the car.\n\nThis week, a Supreme Court jury in Rockhampton took just over six hours to find 21-year-old Horace Lorenzo Jones guilty of his mother\u2019s murder.\n\nHe was sentenced to life in prison and will spend 15 years behind bars before he is eligible for parole.\n\nIt\u2019s a punishment, according to his sister, that does not fit the crime.\n\n\u201cEverything could have been avoided if we weren\u2019t left so helpless,\u201d Matilda Gilbert, 19, told The Sunday Mail.\n\nHorace Jones and Matilda Gilbert.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying what Horace did was right. But we needed help and we didn\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nHorace, Matilda and their three-year-old brother Angus grew up in Gladstone in a household plagued by domestic violence. Matilda said their mother had often hit them, attacked them with weapons and threatened their little brother.\n\nShe said their cries for help were often ignored and many people had turned a blind eye to the violence.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young, only about four or five, she cooked a pumpkin soup,\u201d Matilda said. \u201cI was sick and I\u2019d vomited into the soup. She was very insistent that I finish it and made me sit there until I had \u2013 even though it had vomit in it.\n\n\u201cHorace and I had been in and out of foster care but they kept giving us back to her, saying there\u2019s nothing wrong with her.\n\n\u201cWhen they did ask us questions, she would be in the room.\n\nMurder victim Roxane Gilbert with daughter Matilda.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d ask \u2018does she hit you?\u2019 and we\u2019d look at her terrified, knowing we\u2019d get flogged if we said anything.\n\n\u201cNobody ever check\u00aded up on us.\n\n\u201cWe always felt so let down. We\u2019d take such a big risk to tell \u00adanybody and then they wouldn\u2019t do anything to help us.\n\n\u201cPeople knew. Sometimes people would even see it happening to us.\u201d\n\nMatilda said her mother was an alcoholic with depression and had been diagnosed as bipolar. Her mother didn\u2019t get the help she needed and as a consequence, she and her brothers were left in a violent household.\n\nIn June 2012, Roxane came to visit her son in Gladstone.\n\nThe torrid visit \u2013 which included her calling the police on her son and hanging up on his friends \u2013 was to end in her death.\n\nIt was her hitting his three-year-old brother that made Horace snap, he told police. Horace claimed in court that his mother had come at him with a knife.\n\nHe said he\u2019d taken an ornamental sword from the wall and swung it at her. \u201cWhy are you doing this? I\u2019m your mum,\u201d she kept asking him.\n\nHorace had used a steak knife and a samurai sword to stab his mother 25 times. In his police interview, \u00adHorace told how he had stabbed his mother again when she had moved as he was cleaning up her blood.\n\nHe said he had used the sword to pierce her heart. \u201cIt\u2019s the sorriest thing I had to do,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "TO ALL you people out there, Roxane Jones wrote in 2010.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/horace-lorenzo-jones-guilty-of-his-mothers-murder-after-years-of-abuse/news-story/9160d350412581354199e5e6a95df5db", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/bdce5f4b56b4bb9d7ef30f4e8935680d", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cTO ALL you people out there,\u201d \u00adRoxane Jones wrote in 2010.", "title": "Why a son killed his mum with a samurai sword"}, "twitter": {"site": "@couriermail", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/bdce5f4b56b4bb9d7ef30f4e8935680d", "description": "\u201cTO ALL you people out there,\u201d \u00adRoxane Jones wrote in 2010.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why a son killed his mum with a samurai sword"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/9160d350412581354199e5e6a95df5db?domain=couriermail.com.au"}, "articleid": "9160d350412581354199e5e6a95df5db", "keywords": "Murder victim, three-year-old brother, samurai sword, Mum terror, police interview, foster care, sorriest thing, violent household, domestic violence, ornamental sword, torrid visit, Facebook, Inc., Supreme Court, Horace Lorenzo Jones, Matilda Gilbert, Roxane Gilbert", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-06T11:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-12-06T22:26:28.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd74b9\"", "article_summary": "This week, a Supreme Court jury in Rockhampton took just over six hours to find 21-year-old Horace Lorenzo Jones guilty of his mother\u2019s murder.\nHorace Jones and Matilda Gilbert.\n\u201cTO ALL you people out there,\u201d \u00adRoxane Jones wrote in 2010.\nMurder victim Roxane Gilbert.\n\u201cEverything could have been avoided if we weren\u2019t left so helpless,\u201d Matilda Gilbert, 19, told The Sunday Mail."}
