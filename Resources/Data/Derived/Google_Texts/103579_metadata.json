Dan Reidel \u2014 Mercury-Register\n\nOroville >> Oroville Hospital has reduced its charges by 30 percent.\n\nThe hospital spent three years negotiating with health insurance companies to be able to reduce its charges and make health care more affordable for its customers, said hospital President and CEO Bob Wentz.\n\nThe change became effective Dec. 1, 2015.\n\n\u201cOur team has spent a lot of time reviewing hospital charges to better assess how we could make medical care more affordable,\u201d Wentz said.\n\nOroville Hospital is using what the California Hospital Association calls \u201cmodern pricing.\u201d The hospital group\u2019s website describes modern pricing as \u201can approach hospitals can voluntarily adopt to adjust their charges to a level that is explainable and understandable, and reflects the unique cost structure of the hospital\u2019s mission and patient population.\u201d\n\nFor the medical facility on Olive Highway, that means the insurance companies now pay a higher percentage of the hospital\u2019s charges. But since the charges are 30 percent lower, the insurance companies actually pay about the same amount they did before. The actual cost of the health care doesn\u2019t change.\n\nAt Oroville Hospital, the reduction is seen mostly in outpatient care and with prescription medication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s skewed toward pharmaceutical charges,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cPeople wonder why an aspirin cost $60; we\u2019re trying to fix that.\u201d\n\nWentz didn\u2019t say the hospital had been overcharging in the past, but he did say the health care industry has historically raised its rates to get the insurance companies to pay closer to the actual operating cost.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make a difference to the individual patient,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cIf the bill was $100 and the insurance company paid $50, you had to pay the rest. We had to say to (the insurance companies) instead of paying 50 percent, pay all of it and we\u2019ll reduce the charges to $50.\u201d\n\nThe hospital is betting that more affordable health care will enable people who have high deductible insurance plans or no insurance to get treatment.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has seen more people get health insurance, but some people still opt to pay the fine or get plans that have very high deductibles so basic service still comes out of their pocket.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act in itself hasn\u2019t had much of an impact,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a significant impact.\u201d\n\nPeople sometimes avoid getting treatment because of the high cost, which often leads to worsening health problems, he said.\n\nIf the rates are more affordable, health care providers hope more people will seek treatment. A higher volume of patients could offset any lost funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe believe that more people may be able to access health care,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cHopefully this is going to empower people to get medical treatment when they need it.\u201d\n\nOroville Hospital is one of the first in the state to implement modern pricing, but Wentz said he expects it to be a future trend in the industry.\n\n\u201cThe CHA told us there were maybe one or two other hospitals doing this,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to be responsible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oroville >> Oroville Hospital has reduced its charges by 30 percent.The hospital spent three years negotiating with health insurance companies to be able to reduce its charges and make health care more affordable for its customers, said h", "title": "Oroville Hospital drops charges 30 percent", "og": {"url": "http://www.chicoer.com/article/NA/20160428/NEWS/160429720", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.chicoer.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NA/20160428/NEWS/160429720/AR/0/AR-160429720.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1000px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Oroville Hospital drops charges 30 percent"}, "twitter": {"domain": "chicoer.com", "description": "Oroville >> Oroville Hospital has reduced its charges by 30 percent.The hospital spent three years negotiating with health insurance companies to be able to reduce its charges and make health care more affordable for its customers, said h", "title": "Oroville Hospital drops charges 30 percent", "url": "http://www.chicoer.com/article/NA/20160428/NEWS/160429720", "image": {"src": "http://www.chicoer.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NA/20160428/NEWS/160429720/AR/0/AR-160429720.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@chicoer", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id509310750?mt=8", "iphone": "id499663248?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.chicoenterpriserecord"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "health,hospital care,news, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "health,hospital care,news, Health"}, "article_summary": "Oroville Hospital CEO Bob Wentz talks about the reduction of charges at the medical facility Thursday in Oroville.\nDan Reidel \u2014 Mercury-RegisterOroville >> Oroville Hospital has reduced its charges by 30 percent.\nBut since the charges are 30 percent lower, the insurance companies actually pay about the same amount they did before.\n\u201cOur team has spent a lot of time reviewing hospital charges to better assess how we could make medical care more affordable,\u201d Wentz said.\nThe hospital spent three years negotiating with health insurance companies to be able to reduce its charges and make health care more affordable for its customers, said hospital President and CEO Bob Wentz."}
