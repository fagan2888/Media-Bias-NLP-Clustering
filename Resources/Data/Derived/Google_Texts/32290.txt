Yesterday held promising developments in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. The Australian ship Ocean Shield, which is towing a U.S. Navy black box detector, picked up two more “pings” that were potentially from the plane’s black box beacons. The beacons — one for the data recorder and one for the cockpit voice recorder — activate upon contact with water and have a battery life of 30 days.

Retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who is leading the joint search, called the latest pings “encouraging information.” Locating the black box would help the search team find the wreckage, and possibly solve the mystery of why MH370 veered off course and ended in the Indian Ocean.

“I believe we are searching in the right area,” Houston told reporters at a briefing in Perth, Australia. “But we need to visually identify aircraft wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370. For the sake of the 239 families, this is absolutely imperative.”

The first two pings were heard by Ocean Shield on Saturday at 4:45 p.m. and 9:27 p.m. Perth time. One was heard for two hours and 20 minutes, the other for just 13 minutes. “The analysis determined that a very stable, distinct, and clear signal was detected at 33.331 kilohertz and that it consistently pulsed at a 1.106 second interval,” Houston told reporters. “They, therefore, assess that the transmission was not of natural origin and was likely sourced from specific electronic equipment.” Investigators are concluding that the signals are consistent with those from a black box, which generally transmits at 37.5 kilohertz.
