A new poll found over half of younger Britons said they were not 100% heterosexual when asked to rank their sexual orientation on a scale.

In a poll conducted by YouGov, 1,632 British adults were asked place themselves on the Kinsey scale, which measures sexual orientation on a range from 0 (completely heterosexual) to 6 (completely homosexual). Out of the general public some 72% chose 0; but in the 18 to 24 age range, only 46% said they were completely heterosexual.

While only 2% of respondents identified themselves as bisexual, it appears that many acknowledge some sexual fluidity outside such labels. Six in 10 respondents overall and 74% in the 18 to 24 range agreed that “sexuality is a scale—it is possible to be somewhere near the middle.”
