JIM WITMER / STAFF\n\nKindy Ghussin, owner of Heartland Pharmacy in Kettering, is likely to see his health insurance premiums rise next year as a result of the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s a business expense he\u2019d rather not incur and will have a direct impact on his bottom line. JIM WITMER / STAFF\n\nBy Randy Tucker and Mary McCarty\n\nStaff Writer\n\nRunning a business can be expensive, leading many self-employed Ohioans to forgo health insurance or maintain limited coverage to keep expenses down.\n\nBeginning next year, that will not be an option.\n\nUnder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, most Americans who don\u2019t have health insurance will be required to obtain coverage that meets minimum government standards or pay a fine.\n\nNew health insurance marketplaces opening in January are expected to provide subsidized coverage to help make health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans.\n\nBut many successful self-employed business operators will not qualify for tax credits to offset the cost of insurance because they bring in too much money.\n\nThe subsidies will be available only through the marketplaces to people earning under 400 percent of the federal poverty level: $45,960 for singles; $92,200 for a family of four.\n\nWith average annual income exceeding $62,000, most of the nearly 900,000 self-employed business owners and micro-businesses in Ohio will have to pay for insurance out of their own pockets, said Katie Vlietstra, a spokeswoman for the National Association for the Self-Employed.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of successful entrepreneurs in Ohio,\u201d Vlietstra said. \u201cMost of them will be faced with higher insurance costs next year, and most will not get a break from the government.\u201d\n\nHealth care costs are typically the second-biggest expense for the self-employed outside of operating costs, she said, noting that health insurance is particularly expensive for the self-employed because they don\u2019t benefit from the group rates offered to workers at most companies.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just way too expensive\u2019\n\nLisa Scott, who owns the Beaute Box day spa in downtown Dayton, said she would rather take her chances than fork the hundreds of dollars a year in premiums that she was quoted to buy health insurance in the individual market before the federal marketplaces were established.\n\n\u201cIf I have to go to the doctor, I just pay out of pocket,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI\u2019ve looked into insurance on my own, and it\u2019s just way too expensive.\u201d\n\nNow she\u2019s faced with a business decision she had not anticipated, whether to buy health insurance or face tax penalties ranging from $95 next year up to $695 by 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably end up enrolling in a plan, because it would be more cost-effective for me to be proactive rather than pay a huge fine at the end of the year,\u201d Scott said. \u201cBut that $80 or $100 a month I\u2019d spend for insurance in the marketplace is still going to have a impact on my business. It\u2019s going to affect the improvements I can make, the advertising I can do\u2026I\u2019ll just have to be even more creative and more frugal with the things I can do to grow my business.\u201d\n\nNot all small business owners go without insurance. In fact, more than 80 percent of the self-employed in Ohio are also self-insured, according to Vlietstra, who said some buy insurance for themselves and others have coverage through their spouses.\n\nSome self-employed people may be able to keep their health plans if they have grandfathered status, which means costs have not changed significantly since the health care law was passed in March 2010, and the plans meet all the coverage requirements under the health care law, including maternity care and mental health and substance abuse services.\n\nBut only a limited number of health plans are expected to maintain grandfathered status next year. And moving into richer, more comprehensive plans will undoubtedly drive costs up for those who own their own businesses, Vlietstra said.\n\n\u201cThe issue becomes the type of insurance the self-employed had and are now going to be required to have,\u201d Vlietstra said. \u201cIt might be a greater, more robust health care product\u2026but they (self-employed) are still going to spend more on health insurance.\u201d\n\nWill new law stifle businesses?\n\nKindy Ghussin, who opened Heartland Pharmacy in Kettering about a year ago, has a high-deductible, low-premium health plan for him and his family that he describes as a \u201cjust in case policy\u201d that fits his needs because he, his wife and three children do not have many health problems.\n\nGhussin, 39, said he expects he will have to upgrade his coverage as a result of the health care law, and because of his income is unlikely to qualify for subsidized coverage in the marketplace. He said the health care law will simply cost him more money for benefits he probably won\u2019t use.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like saying, \u2018I\u2019m thirsty,\u2019 but instead of being able to buy a single bottle of water for $1, now I have to buy 50 bottles of water for $3,\u201d Ghussin said. \u201cOne bottle will quench your thirst.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2016, the least expensive options in the health insurance marketplaces will cost about $4,500-$5,000 per person, and $12,000-$12,500 per family, per year. There are high-deductible, low-premium catastrophic plans available in the marketplaces, but they are limited to individuals who are under age 30 and are not eligible for premium tax credits.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about costs that you cannot easily pass on to your customers,\u201d Ghussin said. \u201cThis is a cost you\u2019re going to have to absorb and take directly off your bottom line.\u201d\n\nCritics say the health insurance mandate is likely to stifle entrepreneurship, but some elements of the law could actually stimulate growth, according to a recent report from the Urban Institute, a non partisan Washington D.C.-based think-tank.\n\nOhio could add as many as 67,000 new entrepreneurs as a result of a provision of the law prohibits insurers from denying coverage to anyone because of pre-existing health conditions.\n\n\u201cMany individuals who may be working for firms today who would like to start their own business are locked in to where they are employed now as a consequence of needing health insurance,\u201d said Linda Blumberg, senior fellow and lead researcher at the Urban Institute. \u201cThe ACA levels the playing field so they don\u2019t have to worry about whether they can afford to give up their health insurance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Running a business can be expensive, leading many self-employed Ohioans to forgo health insurance or maintain limited coverage to keep expenses down.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/self-employed-owners-concerned-about-increased-bus/nZ5bD/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/09/23/13/bc/092413-ACA-self-insured-031.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Running a business can be expensive, leading many self-employed Ohioans to forgo health insurance or maintain limited coverage to keep expenses down.", "title": "Self-employed owners concerned about increased business costs..."}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2013/09/23/f9/73/092413-ACA-self-insured-002.jpg", "description": "Running a business can be expensive, leading many self-employed  Ohioans to forgo health insurance or maintain limited coverage to keep  expenses down.", "site": "@daytondailynews", "card": "summary", "title": "Self-employed concerned about cost of Affordable Care Act"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/self-employed-owners-concerned-about-increased-bus/nZ5bD/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2066357/news/news/self-employed-owners-concerned-about-increased-bus/nZ5bD/", "keywords": "ACA,acadayton", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI", "news_keywords": "ACA,acadayton"}, "article_summary": "New health insurance marketplaces opening in January are expected to provide subsidized coverage to help make health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans.\nHe said the health care law will simply cost him more money for benefits he probably won\u2019t use.\nBut many successful self-employed business operators will not qualify for tax credits to offset the cost of insurance because they bring in too much money.\n\u201cThe ACA levels the playing field so they don\u2019t have to worry about whether they can afford to give up their health insurance.\u201d\nBut only a limited number of health plans are expected to maintain grandfathered status next year."}
