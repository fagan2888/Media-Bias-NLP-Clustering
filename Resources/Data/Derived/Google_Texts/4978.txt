Thousands of Kroger employees across Louisiana and east Texas are gearing up to fight for their health benefits.

A meeting was held in Alexandria on Tuesday night where the employees of the Kroger on Jackson Street decided to join in on a walkout.

"The purpose of it is to send a message to the company. Saying hey we're serious about our insurance, we want our insurance," says Rick Alleman, UFCW Local 455 Secretary Treasurer.

The union says that Kroger agreed to pay additional money into a health and welfare fund if needed after Obamacare was passed in 2010.

The union says their fund consultants notified both parties last fall that costs have been even higher than expected, and that the fund would need more money to protect their insurance through the end of the contract.

The shortfall, according to the union, is around $13 million.

A spokesperson for Kroger tells our media partner, KSLA in Shreveport, that the issue is one for the bargaining parties to discuss and they have requested dates from the union to just that.

After the union meets with all the employees they represent, they will meet with Kroger to address the issue further.
