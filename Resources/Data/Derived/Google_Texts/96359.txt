Wichita police are investigating the alleged abuse of a five-month-old girl.

Friday afternoon, the girl's parents took her from their home in the 100 block of South Ridge Road to Via Christi St. Joseph Hospital because she was reportedly having seizures and vomiting for several days.

During an exam, medical staff found the girl had bleeding on the brain.

"And after further tests, it was determined that the child had suffered from several brain bleeds over a period of time," said Sgt. Brian Sigman.

The girls was transferred to St. Francis Hospital where she remained Saturday. Her current condition is unknown.

Sgt. Sigman said investigators have interviewed the baby's 24-year-old mother and 26-year-old father, but no arrests have been made.

Police also removed a 4-year-old girl from the home and placed her in protective custody.

The investigation is ongoing.
