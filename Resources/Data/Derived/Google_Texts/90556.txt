Get ready for another potential OMG boy band moment: 5 Seconds of Summer is about to make its debut on the MTV Video Music Awards.

The Australian pop-punk-loving quartet of tousle-haired hunks (whose members don’t consider themselves a boy band) will make its debut Sunday on MTV’s over-the-top annual celebration. Boy bands have a long history of VMAs hysteria and much-hyped appearances (think ‘N Sync and its 2013 reunion rumors). 5SOS rides the release of a hit album and an opening gig on One Direction’s stadium tour into its appearance at the Forum in Inglewood, California.

Here’s a look back at five key moments in boy band-VMA history, in chronological order:

— New New Edition: There were plenty of bands with good lookin’ boys on the VMAs in the early years, but the first official boy band appearance didn’t come until New Edition’s epic 1990 reunion on the show. Covering six songs and more than 10 minutes, Bel Biv DeVoe (which included three of New Edition’s original members), Bobby Brown, Johnny Gill and Ralph Tresvant all performed separately before coming together in a reunion performance — complete with mirrorball suit coats, bowler caps and a confusing array of hairstyles — to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the group’s founding.

— Bigtime Boys: Sure, looking back it’s a head-scratcher, but the Backstreet Boys used to be the biggest boy band in the world. Look no further than the band’s run of VMA appearances at the turn of the century. Appearing for the first time in 1998, BSB flexed its muscle-shirted muscle by taking best group video over … Radiohead? … and performed the instantly recognizable hit “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back).”
