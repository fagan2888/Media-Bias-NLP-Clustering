The Buddhist leader will be dying sooner or later, the article says, and maybe sooner.\n\nSo what will happen then to Tibetan Buddhism and the cause of free Tibet?\n\nSo you get paragraphs like this:\n\nThe economic potency of China has made the Dalai Lama a political liability for an increasing number of world leaders, who now shy away from him for fear of inviting China\u2019s wrath. Even Pope Francis, the boldest pontiff in decades, report\u00adedly declined a meeting in Rome last December. When the Dalai Lama dies, it is not at all clear what will happen to the six million Tibetans in China. The Chinese Communist Party, though officially atheistic, will take charge of finding an incarnation of the present Dalai Lama. Indoctrinated and controlled by the Communist Party, the next leader of the Tibetan community could help Beijing cement its hegemony over Tibet. And then there is the 150,000-strong community of Tibetan exiles, which, increasingly politically fractious, is held together mainly by the Dalai Lama. The Tibetan poet and activist Tenzin Tsundue, who has disagreed with the Dalai Lama\u2019s tactics, told me that his absence will create a vacuum for Tibetans. The Dalai Lama\u2019s younger brother, Tenzin Choegyal, was more emphatic: \u2018\u2018We are finished once His Holiness is gone.\u2019\u2019\n\nI had forgotten the dust-up about the pope not meeting with the Buddhist leader, but a year has passed since then and they have yet to meet.\n\nThe article continues on, recounting how 140 Buddhist monks and nuns have publicly set themselves on fire to protest the suppression of Tibet by China. And what does the Dalai Lama do in response?\n\nAs if in response to these multiple crises in his homeland, the Dalai Lama has embarked on some improbable intellectual journeys. In 2011, he renounced his role as the temporal leader of the Tibetan people and declared that he would focus on his spiritual and cultural commitments. Today, the man who in old photos of Tibet can be seen enacting religious rites wearing a conical yellow hat \u2014 in front of thangkas, or scrolls, swarming with scowling monsters and copulating deities \u2014 speaks of going \u2018\u2018beyond religion\u2019\u2019 and embracing \u2018\u2018secular ethics\u2019\u2019: principles of selflessness and compassion rooted in the fundamental Buddhist notion of interconnectedness.\n\nIncreasingly, the Dalai Lama addresses himself to a nondenominational audience and seems perversely determined to undermine the authority of his own tradition. He has intimated that the next Dalai Lama could be female. He has asserted that certain Buddhist scriptures disproved by science should be abandoned. He has suggested \u2014 frequently, during the months that I saw him \u2014 that the institution of the Dalai Lama has outlived its purpose. Having embarked in the age of the selfie on a project of self-abnegation, he is now flirting with ever-more-radical ideas. One morning at his Dharamsala residence in May this year, he told me that he may one day travel to China, but not as the Dalai Lama.\n\nAs much as this leader would like to shuck off his political obligations, the world won\u2019t let him, the article notes. There is simply no one to take his place.\n\nStill, as a political negotiator, the article states, he has failed. But who wouldn\u2019t? Was the Dalai Lama supposed to be a modern-day Gandhi, bringing China to its knees somehow? Rather, it\u2019s China that is setting the conditions. The Dalai Lama very much wants to return to Tibet before he dies. By the time you\u2019ve finished this piece, you\u2019ll be convinced that will never happen.\n\nOne thing the writer -- who is an Indian intellectual and author who\u2019s had access to the Buddhist spiritual leader for years -- brings out is the ordinariness of the man. He lists a number of things the Dalai Lama will do to confound people and keep them from putting him on a pedestal.\n\nI have covered two of the DL\u2019s appearances in the Washington, DC area. The one included an esoteric discourse on Buddhism that defied translation. But the other had quite a bit of barnyard humor, which was tough to square with a world-famous monk. I never knew if the latter was part of an earthiness that comes with being from that part of the world, or something else. The author of this piece likewise captures the oddity of the Dalai Lama, who will sometimes make weird jokes or pronouncements in public settings that make little or no sense or seem odd at best.\n\nCouple that with examples throughout the piece about how the Dalai Lama and his cause are losing traction throughout the West, and one concludes that by waiting out the Dalai Lama, the Chinese may win this battle.\n\nThe piece has way more to say about politics than religion, although it does have flashes of insight like the following:\n\nThe \u2018\u2018world picture,\u2019\u2019 as he saw it, was bleak. People all over the world were killing in the name of their religions. Even Buddhists in Burma were tormenting Rohingya Muslims. This was why he had turned away from organized religion, engaged with quantum physics and started to emphasize the secular values of compassion. It was no longer feasible, he said, to construct an ethical existence on the basis of traditional religion in multicultural societies.\n\nWhen asked if he means to reincarnate once he dies, the Dalai Lama answers that he does not. Our GetReligion colleague Ira Rifkin covered this pronouncement earlier this year. The institution of the Dalai Lama, the author of the magazine article points out, has reached the end of its usefulness.\n\nSo what will happen with Tibet? In one sense, the article leaves you hanging. In another sense, it\u2019s clear that the Dalai Lama has already checked out.\n\nThere are a few journalistic burps in this piece, one being that the Buddha was born in Nepal, not India as the article says. And as one commentator pointed out, Tibetan Buddhism believes its leaders must reincarnate until everyone is ready for full enlightenment. So how can this Dalai Lama say he will not reincarnate?\n\nOtherwise, it raises the right questions about a man who, along with Pope Francis, is one of the world\u2019s top spiritual leaders.\n\nShutterstock photos by Nadezda Murmakova and Phaendin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Dalai Lama was the topic of a New York Times magazine profile \r\nrecently, and unlike the laudatory sort of write-ups one usually sees about \r\nthis 80-year-old religious icon, this one calls his leadership into \r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nNot only his leadership, but his legacy is questioned this time around.\r\n\r\nWe've written about how he decided four years ago to give up his political \r\nrole as head of the world's exiled Tibetan community.
