Kurt Larkin, a Richmond, Va., labor lawyer, says a new federal standard for determining whether a business acts as a "joint employer" with another business could cause big, confusing problems for businesses throughout the United States.

The new joint employer standard, which was announced by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in August, could turn some companies into accidental employers of other companies' workers, and it could make complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) more complicated, Larkin says.
