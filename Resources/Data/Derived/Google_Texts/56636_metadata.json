The family paid for the $606 million buyout by contributing its shares, taking on more than $400 million in debt and accepting an investment from an affiliate of Koch Industries Inc., the privately held company led by Charles and David Koch.\n\nThe Weiss family includes chairman Morry Weiss, Co-Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss and Co-Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Weiss.\n\nCompany officials said neither a timeline nor a target move-in date have been set. About 1,600 employees would be making the move.\n\n\n\nOne of the first signs that the Weiss family was ready to resume the project came at Thursday's Westlake City Council meeting, when council authorized Mayor Dennis Clough to re-bid public improvements for the phase of Crocker Park that includes the American Greetings headquarters.\n\nClough on Friday said American Greetings \"never stopped saying they were moving forward\" so his city is ready to move ahead with the necessary infrastructure improvements -- such as sewer lines and water lines. Clough said it will probably take at least 60 days to get those bids, so that construction likely wouldn't begin until -- at the soonest -- early 2014.\n\nCompany officials are happy to set the project back in motion.\n\n\"We are pleased to be able to restart the process and we are eager to move forward on our next step to our Westlake location,\" said the company's statement. \"We appreciate your patience throughout this time, and we will continue to keep you updated. We look forward to an exciting future home for our associates and a bright future for American Greetings.\"\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "american-greetings,american-greetings-headquarters,crocker-park", "title": "American Greetings resumes plans to move HQ to Crocker Park", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"American Greetings resumes plans to move HQ to Crocker Park\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2013/10/american_greetings_resumes_pla.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/cleveland-homepage-images/photo/13605574-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11457757\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-18T21:21:55Z\", \"author\": \"Olivera Perkins, The Plain Dealer\", \"tags\": [\"@brooklyn\",\"@mobile\",\"@westlake\",\"american-greetings\",\"american-greetings-headquarters\",\"crocker-park\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/cleveland-homepage-images/photo/13605574-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@OPinfo", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "American Greetings, now in Brooklyn, put on hold last year plans to move to Crocker Park in Westlake after the Weiss Family decided to take the company private.
