Lew, warned that without congressional action, Puerto Rico risked \u201canother lost decade.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 measure would include up to $3 billion in cash relief, a payroll tax break for residents of the island and a new independent authority that could borrow for Puerto Rico \u2014 but with no taxpayer guarantee.\n\n\u201cConsistent with the views of Congress and the administration that there will be no \u2018bailout\u2019 \u201d of Puerto Rico, said a bill summary, \u201cthe full faith and credit of the United States is not pledged for the payment of debt obligations issued by the authority.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe bill also called for Puerto Rico \u2014 and all the states \u2014 to disclose, for the first time, the true financial condition of their pension systems for government workers. Currently, governments use actuarial numbers, which can significantly understate a pension plan\u2019s cost. Shifting to fair-value numbers could help with coming negotiations in which Puerto Rico has said it plans to divert money from its bondholders and use it to pay pensions.\n\nThe proposed new disclosures would also make it easier to identify other states whose pension systems are so distressed that they may have to try similar negotiations in the future.\n\nTo get the $3 billion, the bill proposed tapping a $12 billion public-health fund created under the Affordable Care Act, for research and preventive medicine programs nationwide. The bill summary said the money was as yet \u201cunobligated,\u201d and could be \u201crepurposed\u201d with federal supervision to help tide Puerto Rico through an alarming cash squeeze this winter.\n\nTo give Puerto Rican workers a tax break, the bill would reduce by 50 percent the Social Security taxes now withheld from their paychecks.\n\nAnd in an echo of the control board that Congress imposed on the District of Columbia in the 1990s, the Republicans\u2019 bill would designate a \u201cchief financial officer\u201d for Puerto Rico to advise the island\u2019s governor on drafting and sticking to an annual budget.\n\nThe designee would remain in place even if the government changes hands in next year\u2019s election, giving Puerto Rico a better chance of seeing through its five-year economic recovery plan no matter who is elected. The five-year plan was announced in September.\n\nThe legislation was introduced by the Republican chairmen of three Senate committees with jurisdiction over Puerto Rico\u2019s affairs: Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, whose Finance Committee has jurisdiction over tax policy; Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, whose Judiciary Committee is responsible for bankruptcy law; and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, whose Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has jurisdiction over matters involving America\u2019s territories.\n\nEach of those committees has recently held a hearing on Puerto Rico\u2019s travails, taking expert testimony on the severity of the island\u2019s debt crisis and what might be done to restore stability and economic growth. In each of the hearings, Republicans said they wanted to help, but were troubled by a lack of information about the Puerto Rican government\u2019s spending practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDespite repeated attempts by Congress to clarify how the interplay between federal tax, health care and pension policies affect the territory\u2019s economy, we have been unable to receive audited financial statements from Puerto Rico or adequate information from federal health officials,\u201d Mr. Hatch said in a statement. \u201cFederal taxpayers and the Puerto Rican people deserve better.\u201d\n\nHe and the other senators said they had decided to go ahead with a bill based on the limited information they already had. They said it would take time to solve Puerto Rico\u2019s problems, and in the meantime they hoped to get more financial information.\n\nLawmakers from both parties have been working toward a Jan. 1 deadline, when Puerto Rico owes bond payments of as much as $902 million, according to the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan research institute in San Juan. So far, the island has been struggling to stay current on most of its obligations. But officials say they are running out of cash and it is not clear that Puerto Rico will have enough money to pay what it owes on Jan. 1.\n\nAbout $332 million of that bond payment is for general-obligation bonds, which are constitutionally guaranteed in Puerto Rico. It would be unprecedented, and unlawful, for Puerto Rico to skip such a payment outside of bankruptcy \u2014 yet Puerto Rico is barred from using Chapter 9 bankruptcy.\n\nThe Obama administration has expressed doubt that Puerto Rico could successfully restructure without being able to impair all of its bonds, including those with constitutional protection. But Republican lawmakers suspect that if Puerto Rico were to get the tools to legally impair its general-obligation debt, it would not be long before fiscally troubled states, like Illinois, came calling for the same thing.\n\nOn the details of how to revive Puerto Rico\u2019s failing pension system, or changing the way doctors on the island are paid by federal programs like Medicare, the bill proposes only further study.\n\nThe legislation was introduced during end-of-the-session drama in Washington, as the governor of Puerto Rico came to Washington to make one last plea for help.\n\nSpeaking at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Mr. Weiss, the Treasury official, said that the National Economic Council and the Treasury had already \u201cconvened a broad, administration-wide effort\u201d among federal agencies \u201cto develop the most effective policy response to the crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cit has become clear that resolving Puerto Rico\u2019s crisis requires congressional action.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151209175543, "twitter": {"description": "The legislation would include up to $3
