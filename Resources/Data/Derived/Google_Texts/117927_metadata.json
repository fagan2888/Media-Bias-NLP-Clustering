Definitive election results are expected within a week.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama praises Afghan voters for high election turnout\n\nPHOTOS: Leadership in Karzai's shadow: Afghanistan's next president to win vote, not total control\n\nThe three front-runners of the eight presidential candidates \u2014 former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah, former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani and former Foreign Minister Zalmay Rassoul \u2014 said they were confident that they could win, or at least advance to a runoff election. All promised to respect the findings of the Independent Election Commission assuming they are \u201ccredible,\u201d the Associated Press reported.\n\nAhead of the vote, supporters of Mr. Abdullah and Mr. Ghani said they had evidence of vote fraud, voter intimidation, stuffed ballot boxes and government interference in support of Mr. Rassoul. Most of the candidates deployed their own observers to monitor polling centers after the experience of widespread fraud in the 2009 elections.\n\nMr. Karzai, 56, who has served as president since December 2001, was barred by the Afghan Constitution from running for a third consecutive term.\n\nAlthough the election results are uncertain, it is clear that Mr. Karzai will wield considerable influence in Afghan politics even out of office \u2014 and that may be bad news for Washington.\n\n\u201cIt will complicate the relationship with Washington,\u201d a former high-ranking U.S. military officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to address delicate issues, said of Mr. Karzai\u2019s likely influence over his successor.\n\nMr. Karzai\u2019s relationship with Washington has undergone a sea change from the days he was firmly backed by the West.\n\nTies have turned frosty as he publicly criticized NATO\u2019s role in Afghanistan, complained about U.S. drone strikes on suspected terrorists, and released dozens of prisoners who the Obama administration said have U.S. and Afghan blood on their hands.\n\nWashington\u2019s deep frustration with Mr. Karzai \u2014 not just in the Obama administration but also on Capitol Hill \u2014 was reflected in statements after Saturday\u2019s elections.\n\nRep. Edward R. Royce, California Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said the Karzai government \u201cwas a case study in how not to win international support.\u201d\n\nThe \u201celection offers the chance for a fresh start with a new president,\u201d Mr. Royce said.\n\nAnalysts doubt that a new president can bring that fresh start.\n\nThat is because Mr. Karzai will continue to play a significant behind-the-scenes role, said Sarah Chayes, a senior associate in the South Asia and Democracy and Rule of Law programs at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nMs. Chayes and the former U.S. military officer said Mr. Karzai\u2019s post-presidency role would be similar to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s role from 2008 to 2012, when he served as prime minister to his hand-picked successor, Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nMr. Karzai is not barred from running for president in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, his proximity to power will be literal. He will reside in a secure compound a stone\u2019s throw away from the presidential palace, the Arg, in Kabul.\n\n\u201cIt will, literally, be a walk across the garden for him to meet the new president,\u201d said the former U.S. military officer.\n\nSecurity in balance\n\nThe elections present the opportunity for the first democratic transition in Afghanistan\u2019s history.\n\nPresident Obama applauded the Afghan people for participating in the elections, which he said are \u201ccritical to securing Afghanistan\u2019s democratic future, as well as continued international support.\u201d\n\nInternational coalition forces will leave Afghanistan at the end of this year.\n\nMr. Karzai has refused to sign a bilateral security agreement he negotiated with the administration that would allow U.S. and NATO troops to remain as advisers and counterterrorism specialists after all combat forces withdraw.\n\nThe three front-runners \u2014 Mr. Abdullah, Mr. Rassoul and Mr. Ghani \u2014 have promised to sign the security agreement if elected, but a new president may not be in place until the summer.\n\nTo win, a candidate must get more than 50 percent of the vote. A slate of eight presidential candidates makes it unlikely that any candidate can achieve this target in the first round of voting. The outcome is expected to be decided by a runoff vote.\n\nIn such a scenario, Mr. Karzai could remain president until late into the summer.\n\nAnalysts generally predict that Mr. Rassoul ultimately will win the presidential contest because he has the backing of Mr. Karzai\u2019s clan and his political machinery.\n\nIf Mr. Rassoul wins, his first test will be whether he signs the security agreement.\n\n\u201cIt will be truly interesting to watch whether Rassoul asserts himself and becomes his own man,\u201d said the former U.S. military officer. \u201cMedvedev did strike out on his own a few times.\u201d\n\n\u2018Mayor of Kabul\u2019\n\nBorn in 1957 in the southeastern province of Kandahar, Mr. Karzai was one of eight children of the chief of one of Afghanistan\u2019s most powerful tribes, the Popalzai. He was educated in Kabul and in Shimla, India.\n\nMr. Karzai joined the struggle against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s and initially supported the Taliban in the early 1990s. He quickly grew disillusioned with the Taliban and began lobbying for Western support to help topple the hard-line regime that came to power in 1996.\n\nIn 2001, a U.S.-led coalition toppled the Taliban regime for sheltering al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 attacks. The West then installed Mr. Karzai as the leader of Afghanistan, and his rule was ratified by the 2004 election.\n\nBut his influence was limited by a resurgent Taliban, and he received the moniker \u201cmayor of Kabul.\u201d He also was tainted by rampant corruption involving his family.\n\nBy 2009, Washington was so keen to oust Mr. Karzai that it tried to manipulate the election in a \u201cclumsy and failed putsch,\u201d former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said in his memoir. Mr. Karzai faced Mr. Abdullah in a runoff vote. Mr. Abdullah, claiming rampant fraud, quit the race.\n\nThe George W. Bush and Obama administrations invested heavily in Mr. Karzai.\n\n\u201cThey let Karzai boil it down to a personal relationship between the U.S. government and him. That was a mistake,\u201d said Ms. Chayes. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of other countries where the entire institutional relationship with the population of that country boils down to a kind of psychodrama with one individual, which is the way the U.S. government has allowed it to devolve in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nWashington and Mr. Karzai do not have a good relationship because he has \u201cnot provided an attractive alternative to a violent, backward insurgency for the people of his country,\u201d she said.\n\nThere is plenty of blame to go around for the state of the U.S.-Afghan relationship, and it is unfair to place all of that on Mr. Karzai, analysts and former U.S. officials say.\n\n\u201cResponsibility for the downturn in U.S.-Afghan relations in the latter years under President Karzai was not his alone,\u201d said Karl Inderfurth, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\u201cAs Robert Gates accurately described in his memoir, \u2018Duty\u2019: \u2018Many of his outbursts were provoked by our failure to heed concerns he voiced in private \u2014 and by internal politics in Afghanistan,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Inderfurth, who served as assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs in the Clinton administration.\n\nA mixed legacy\n\nMr. Karzai leaves office with a mixed legacy.\n\nAlthough his frequent outbursts directed at the U.S. strained ties with Washington, it built his image as a tough, nationalist leader at home.\n\n\u201cMany Afghans were tired of the high-handedness of the West in their country and cherished Karzai for standing up, as it was seen, to the mighty U.S.,\u201d said Thomas Ruttig, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network.\n\nBut it is of greater significance that Mr. Karzai failed to govern in a way that improved Afghans\u2019 standard of living, he said, \u201cand that\u2019s finally what he needs to be measured against.\u201d\n\nThe Karzai legacy will be hostage to the events that unfold in the next several years, Mr. Inderfurth said.\n\n\u201cWill he be seen as the bridge from three decades of conflict and repression to a more stable and prosperous future? Or will the gains made during his tenure in education and health care and women rights be swept away by a return to a radical, Islamist regime?\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s the latter, Karzai and the Afghans lose, and so will the U.S.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hamid Karzai's name was not on the ballot in Saturday's elections, but the outgoing president of Afghanistan is expected to remain a key political player, possibly complicating the U.S. relationship with his successor.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hamid Karzai\u2019s name was not on the ballot in Saturday\u2019s elections, but the outgoing president of Afghanistan is expected to remain a key political player, possibly complicating the U.S. relationship with his successor.", "title": "Leadership in Karzai\u2019s shadow: Afghanistan\u2019s next president to win vote, not total control", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/6/leadership-in-karzais-shadow-afghanistans-next-pre/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/06/4_6_2014_afghanistan-elections-pho-38201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/06/4_6_2014_afghanistan-elections-pho-38201.jpg", "description": "Hamid Karzai's name was not on the ballot in Saturday's elections, but the outgoing president of Afghanistan is expected to remain a key political player, possibly complicating the U.S. relationship w", "card": "summary", "title": "Leadership in Karzai\u2019s shadow: Afghanistan\u2019s next presiden"}, "Author": "Ashish Kumar Sen", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict, Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan, Washington"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35fd\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Karzai\u2019s relationship with Washington has undergone a sea change from the days he was firmly backed by the West.\nAnalysts generally predict that Mr. Rassoul ultimately will win the presidential contest because he has the backing of Mr. Karzai\u2019s clan and his political machinery.\nWashington\u2019s deep frustration with Mr. Karzai \u2014 not just in the Obama administration but also on Capitol Hill \u2014 was reflected in statements after Saturday\u2019s elections.\nMr. Karzai, 56, who has served as president since December 2001, was barred by the Afghan Constitution from running for a third consecutive term.\nAhead of the vote, supporters of Mr. Abdullah and Mr. Ghani said they had evidence of vote fraud, voter intimidation, stuffed ballot boxes and government interference in support of Mr. Rassoul."}
