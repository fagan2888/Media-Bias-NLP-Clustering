The Fed views valuations in some parts of the market \u2014 especially for smaller social media companies and biotech stocks \u2014 as being \u201csubstantially stretched,\u201d even after a \u201cnotable downturn in equity prices for such firms early in the year.\u201d\n\nIn other words, in spite of all of Yellen\u2019s reassuring words to the contrary in recent months, there may be some kind of asset bubble taking shape in at least some corners of the financial market.\n\nRelated: Janet Yellen's Choice \u2014 Market Bubbles or More Jobs\n\nThe last time that a Fed chairman stuck his head out like this was way back in December 1996, and it ended badly \u2014 very badly \u2014 for all concerned. Alan Greenspan was Fed head at the time, and his questioning about our inability to know when \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d inflated asset values to levels beyond which they could be sustained by fundamentals triggered a prompt and panicky selloff in stocks. Within months, however, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was setting a string of new records and Greenspan was left with egg on his face.\n\nGreenspan wasn\u2019t wrong, of course. The kind of \u201cunexpected and prolonged contractions\u201d he envisaged in his 1996 speech did show up \u2014 but not until early 2000, by which time the Dow had climbed 81 percent. Anyone who had listened to his warnings had forfeited a lot of money.\n\nBurned by that experience, Greenspan never again spoke out to warn the public about bubbles taking shape in the economy or financial markets during his tenure at the Fed. Perhaps he simply didn\u2019t see the giant credit bubble taking shape, as he himself later asserted. Or perhaps, as his critics argue \u2014 pointing to the fact that he\u2019d been asked to comment on the possibility of a housing price bubble by Congress as early as 2002 \u2014 Greenspan simply figured that it was safer to stay on the side of the cheerleaders until it was clear that the bubble was deflating, having miscalculated the way in which it would end.\n\nRightly or wrongly, Yellen may have ignored that history by being as outspoken as she has, and she is attracting a lot of criticism for it \u2014 on several fronts.\n\nWho made the Fed Chair an expert on social media stocks or small biotech companies? Does Yellen have the know-how to determine what constitutes a fair valuation for a fledgling biotech stock, some observers gripe?\n\nOthers go back to Greenspan\u2019s \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d comment, and point out that the Fed doesn\u2019t have a terribly good track record of getting macro calls like that right.\n\nRelated: Central Banks Ending Era of Clear Promises\n\nThen there\u2019s the argument that Yellen\u2019s jawboning doesn\u2019t seem to be working. Sure, social media shares got pummeled, but modestly. Twitter, which was already off its recent highs, fell less than 4 percent; Facebook, up 23 percent so far this year, recouped its losses to finish higher on the week. Similarly, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index ETF (NASDAQ:IBB), after slumping since the Fed comments came out, gained 3 percent on Friday, leaving it ahead 10.3 percent for 2014 and 29 percent over the last 12 months.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: Yellen knows she is walking a very narrow line as she tries to guide monetary policy back toward some kind of \u201cnew normal\u201d for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nFinancial markets, clearly, have been rallying, even as the economy has been stumbling along. That has left the Fed stuck in an uncomfortable and perhaps ultimately perilous position of keeping interest rates low enough to not jeopardize growth, even if doing so risks creating fresh bubbles somewhere in the financial system.\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements has argued that \u201cunusually accommodative\u201d policies (translation: easy money) by the Fed and other central banks have been damaging, and that the continuation of this \u201cunconventional\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d state of affairs involves an entirely new set of risks.\n\nClearly, Yellen\u2019s Fed wants to do what it can to keep bubbles from forming while waiting on monetary policy changes \u2014 the adjustment of key interest rates \u2014 that could undercut some of the economic momentum that may be building. But just because we don\u2019t need to fear that Yellen will quickly follow up her words with interest rate changes just yet doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t pay attention to what she is saying.\n\nRelated: Janet Yellen\u2019s Burning Interest Rate Dilemma\n\nMore than any other single individual in the U.S. financial system, Janet Yellen is in a position to see what is taking place in the economy and its financial markets, and to spot pockets of risk or overvaluation as soon as they appear. Sure, she may be early, and she\u2019s unlikely to be an expert on specific stocks (why would anyone listen to a Fed chair on what specific stocks to buy, anyway?), but that doesn\u2019t devalue her perspective.\n\nMoreover, Yellen has been in Washington long enough and is smart and savvy enough to be aware of the ramifications of using words and phrases that bring back memories of Greenspan. The very fact that she\u2019s doing so means that she probably sees good reason for speaking out.\n\nThat reason likely boils down to \u201ccaveat emptor.\u201d Yellen, in her brief time at the Fed thus far, is telling investors to look out for themselves \u2014 and right now, she feels strongly enough about this particular issue to suggest it is something we might want to worry about. She, meanwhile, will keep worrying about the economy first and foremost.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Janet Yellen is taking a lot of flak for speaking her mind.", "title": "Don\u2019t Ignore Janet Yellen\u2019s Stock Market Warnings", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/07/21/Don-t-Ignore-Janet-Yellen-s-Stock-Market-Warnings", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03192014_Yellen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/07/21/Don-t-Ignore-Janet-Yellen-s-Stock-Market-Warnings", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03192014_Yellen.jpg", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Janet Yellen is taking a lot of flak for speaking her mind.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe13\"", "article_summary": "Janet Yellen is taking a lot of flak for speaking her mind.\nFinancial markets, clearly, have been rallying, even as the economy has been stumbling along.\nRelated: Janet Yellen's Choice \u2014 Market Bubbles or More JobsThe last time that a Fed chairman stuck his head out like this was way back in December 1996, and it ended badly \u2014 very badly \u2014 for all concerned.\nDoes Yellen have the know-how to determine what constitutes a fair valuation for a fledgling biotech stock, some observers gripe?\nClearly, Yellen\u2019s Fed wants to do what it can to keep bubbles from forming while waiting on monetary policy changes \u2014 the adjustment of key interest rates \u2014 that could undercut some of the economic momentum that may be building."}
