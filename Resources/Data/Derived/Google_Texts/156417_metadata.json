Kennedy, Kennedy assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, Life News, News, Politics News\n\nLee Harvey Oswald\u2019s childhood did not take place in any one town or city. He was always provided for, but he was also, in a way, homeless\u2013without a stable backdrop of buildings or even people.\n\nBy the age of seventeen, he had moved twenty times. Almost all of these moves happened because of his mother, Marguerite. Often he shuttled between Dallas-Fort Worth and New Orleans, but he also lived in New York. His briefest stay, in Manhattan, lasted six weeks; his longest, in Fort Worth, four years. He averaged 10.2 months per address. (This did not include stints with family or friends who filled in when Marguerite was absent, or his three-week detainment at a home for troubled youths, in the spring of 1953.) Not surprisingly, nearly all of these homes were rentals or places owned by other people who let them live there for free.\n\nLee\u2019s father, Robert Edward Lee Oswald, had been an insurance premium collector, and he died of a heart attack in August 1939, two months before his son was born. His death and absence from the boy\u2019s life might be regarded as the defining trauma of Oswald\u2019s entire life, setting in motion a youth of chaos and frenzy. Marguerite and Lee rarely changed addresses because of a new opportunity, but rather because of a failure or crisis that almost always crept up suddenly. (Nearly half of the moves that took place between addresses numbers 7 and 21, when Lee was of school age, took place during the school year.) Mostly their hopscotching was prompted by Marguerite\u2019s run-ins with men, landlords, family, or employers. Often an infidelity or job termination was involved. In some cases, Lee\u2019s older brother, Robert, or older half brother, John Pic, moved with him; in other cases, it was just Lee and Marguerite. Some moves were more traumatic than others: Lee spent 1943\u2013the year he turned four\u2013at the Bethlehem Children\u2019s Home in New Orleans. But from late 1945 to mid-1946 he lived in a comfortable brick house in Benbrook, a Fort Worth suburb, with his mother and Edwin Ekdahl, her new husband. Ekdahl was well-off\u2013this was probably why Marguerite married him\u2013and he had an evident fondness for Lee. For a little less than a year, he was the closest anyone ever came to being a father figure to the little boy. Ultimately, this relationship, and the one between Marguerite and Ekdahl, was a failure, too.\n\nMarguerite was hardly capable of playing the role of one parent, let alone two. She was unreliable, frantic, harried, hectoring, needy, and prone to irrational outbursts. Throughout Lee\u2019s childhood, she vacillated between two poles\u2013that of the self-involved, self-imagined victim in search of love and support, and that of the doting, controlling mother. She either paid very little attention to Lee\u2019s wants and needs\u2013yanking him out of school, moving him away from what friends he had\u2013or fawned over him in an effort (obvious to all, including Lee) to compensate for her selfishness. That selfishness, and her inability to provide any semblance of stability and normalcy for her youngest son, is clearly reflected in Lee\u2019s constant moving. Her compensatory \u201clove\u201d comes through in her letters to Lee.\n\nThis homeless youth cannot be stressed enough if we are to understand the unstable man Lee Harvey Oswald was to become. Over the years, the pinball-like movement generated not so much relationships or attachments but a murky tableau of schools, teachers, neighbors, accents, faces, and skylines. There was no single, overarching configuration of people and spaces that governed Oswald\u2019s childhood universe. There was only a whir of disjointed impressions. When someone asked him where he came from, he couldn\u2019t say, so he said whatever he felt like. Nor could he recall or explain how, exactly, he and his mother had proceeded from address number 1 to 2 to 9 to 20. Most everything about his childhood felt arbitrary and fleeting.\n\nAddress number 14, while especially short-lived, marked an important juncture and revealed the first glimpse of the emotionally volatile young man Lee Harvey Oswald was to become. In August 1952, Marguerite and Lee moved out of address number 13, in Fort Worth, to live with John Pic and his wife, Margy, in New York. The Pics didn\u2019t know why Marguerite and Lee had come or when they planned to leave. Still, they were happy to see them. Margy\u2019s mother, who lived with her daughter and son-in-law in the railroad apartment on the Upper East Side, was in Norfolk, Virginia, visiting her other daughter for the month, and the Pics said Marguerite and Lee could stay in her room. The last time John had seen his half brother had been in October 1950, when Lee was not yet eleven. At that time, Lee had been more attached to his mother. (Until he was ten, the two slept in the same bed.) Now, he was going on thirteen and appeared less bound to her. Pic, who had a strained relationship with Marguerite, sensed an opening.\n\nWhen he recalled this brief period, during his testimony before the Warren Commission, Pic sounded remorseful. It was as if he had never really known Lee but had wanted to. His father, Edward John Pic Jr., had married Marguerite in 1929; John Pic had been born in 1932; sometime around then, Edward Pic and Marguerite had divorced; and soon after, Marguerite had married Robert Oswald Sr. John Pic told the commission that the week Marguerite and Lee arrived in New York, he took time off from work to show his half brother the city\u2013the Museum of Natural History, the Staten Island Ferry, and Polk\u2019s Hobby Shop. But from the start of the Oswalds\u2019 visit, the Pics were uneasy, and they had reason to be. Marguerite and Lee showed up at their place with several suitcases and a television set. John and Margy expected they would visit for a week or two\u2013John told the Warren Commission that he thought it made sense that they should come in August so Lee wouldn\u2019t miss the beginning of the school year in Fort Worth. But after a few days it became clear that Marguerite planned that they would stay for good.\n\nMargy was nineteen. She had recently given birth and, presumably, was still nursing. Marguerite didn\u2019t pay for any of their groceries even though John made only $150 per month in the Coast Guard\u2013he was on the security detail at Ellis Island. When he mentioned the groceries to his mother, she became livid. There was also the not unimportant question of space. Mrs. Fuhrman, Margy\u2019s mother, would be home from Norfolk soon. It would have been one thing if it had been their apartment, but it was Mrs. Fuhrman\u2019s. John was angry. Why hadn\u2019t Marguerite said anything before she and Lee came all the way from Texas? John and Margy wouldn\u2019t have minded if it were only Lee, even with the baby and Mrs. Fuhrman. They later said they liked having Lee around, although he could be quiet, and it could be hard to know what he was thinking. The truth was, Pic said, this behavior was very much typical of his mother. It was deceptive and manipulative, and it made Margy upset and infuriated him.\n\nThen an incident took place that was, perhaps, an early indication of Lee\u2019s capacity for violence. All of the anger in the small apartment made for a combustible atmosphere at a time of year, late summer, when it was already hot and humid, and tempers were more prone to flare up. The apartment, which had probably been built in the 1880s, was on Ninety-Second Street, between Second and Third Avenues. It was north of the old money and south of East Harlem. The ventilation was anemie, and it was shadowy and cluttered, without private spaces.\n\nFor reasons that they could not agree on, Lee apparently hit his mother and pulled a knife on Margy. This took place during an argument between Marguerite and Margy, which Pic called \u201cthe big trouble,\u201d and it was the first in a stream of violent outbursts over the next eleven years. The argument started with a disagreement about the television set, but, naturally, it wasn\u2019t really about that. Pic indicated to the Warren Commission that the argument was about who mattered more to Pic: his wife or his mother. Marguerite enlisted Lee, and suddenly Lee pulled out a pocketknife. The order of events is unclear: either Lee threatened Margy, and then he hit his mother, or vice versa. It is also unknown how much time elapsed between these events, although it\u2019s believed that they took place within a few moments of each other. This would explain why John remembered them as a single incident.\n\nMarguerite blamed the whole blow-up on her daughter-in-law. In her testimony before the Warren Commission, Marguerite told I. Lee Rankin, the commissions general counsel, that Margy \u201cdidn\u2019t like me, and she didn\u2019t like Lee. So she\u2013what is the word to say\u2013not picked on the child, but she showed her displeasure. And she is a very\u2013not, I would say so much an emotional person\u2013but this girl is a New Yorker who was brought up in this particular neighborhood, which I believe is a poor section of New York. . . .And this girl cursed like a trooper. She is\u2013you cannot express it, Mr. Rankin\u2013but not of a character of a high caliber.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lee Harvey Oswald had an itinerant and father-less adolescence -- but at first, no interest in radical politics", "title": "Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s lonely childhood: No one imagined he\u2019d kill the president", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Lee Harvey Oswald had an itinerant and father-less adolescence -- but at first, no interest in radical politics", "title": "Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s lonely childhood: No one imagined he\u2019d kill the president", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/13/lee_harvey_oswalds_lonely_childhood_no_one_imagined_hed_kill_the_president/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/lee_harvey_oswald.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lee Harvey Oswald had an itinerant and father-less adolescence -- but at first, no interest in radical politics", "title": "Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s lonely childhood: No one imagined he\u2019d kill the president", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/lee_harvey_oswald.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Peter Savodnik", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, John F.
