(That\u2019s their latest handle of choice having totally ruined previous ones such as \u201cliberal,\u201d \u201cDemocrat,\u201d \u201csocialist,\u201d and \u201ccontrol freak.\u201d)\n\nSEE ALSO: DEAN: When Obamacare met Matt Drudge\n\nPHOTOS: Awesome rifles: The best and the baddest\n\nJesse was a fairly anonymous fellow blogging from the bowels of the White House campus (he\u2019s its \u201cdirector of progressive media\u201d), trying to fan any flames of imaginary optimism he could find out there about the Obamacare tax-fraud scheme that is now upon us.\n\nIt is probably fair to say nobody had ever heard of the guy outside of his cocooned little Twitterverse of journalists and bloggers who follow his utterances for strained happy talk about President Obama and his signature health care law.\n\nThat is, until last Friday when Jesse Lee strayed from his comfort zone of spotting unicorns dancing under rainbows to talking about taxes and how they are paid by the people who build small businesses in America.\n\nFrom there, things got deep for Jesse Lee. Fast.\n\nJesse Lee took grave exception to the announcement by one such business builder \u2014 you might have heard of him; his name is Matt Drudge \u2014 that he had \u201cjust paid Obamacare penalty for not \u2018getting covered.\u2019 I\u2019M CALLING IT A LIBERTY TAX!\u201d\n\nNothing enrages the control freak socialist \u2014 \u201cprogressive,\u201d if you will \u2014 more than a self-sufficient citizen enjoying \u201cliberty\u201d outside the realm of his control. If \u201cliberty\u201d can be had outside the iron fist of government, then what more subversive freedoms might these citizens also yearn for?\n\n\u201cFlat lie,\u201d an enflamed Jesse Lee spat.\n\nNot that anyone still accuses this White House of being pro-business, but my goodness. A successful American entrepreneur pays his taxes, grumbles about it in a good-natured way, and the White House responds by branding him a liar?\n\nWhen did the \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that\u201d White House become the \u201cYou will pay your taxes and like it and if you complain we will personally smear you as a liar\u201d White House?\n\nThen came the verdict of the entire universe of liberal tax experts \u2014 by which I mean people who love for others to pay taxes but get real quiet when the plate comes around in church.\n\n\u201cPenalty isn\u2019t collected until 2015,\u201d ruled one breathless Twitterer.\n\n\u201cAmericans don\u2019t pay a penalty for not having health insurance until they file their 2014 taxes \u2014 in 2015,\u201d zinged another liberal blogger, who announced the tax-paying American entrepreneur was either \u201clying or paid a huge penalty a year earlier than he needed to.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably lying,\u201d was this tax expert\u2019s conclusion.\n\nOf course, as any business owner knows or as anyone who is self-employed knows, the taxes you owe in 2015 must be paid quarterly in 2014. And there is no quarter of the year that is more vicious than April, when you must stroke one check to pay your first quarter taxes of the current year and stroke a second check to pay any final taxes you still owe for the previous year.\n\nThe whole sad fracas lays bare one of the greatest truths about the American tax system. If there were not this system for withholding taxes so that employees \u2014 even \u201cprogressive bloggers\u201d like Jesse Lee \u2014 had to write a check every quarter to pay his taxes, then taxes everywhere would be a whole lot lower.\n\nAnd the government, especially the federal government, would waste a whole lot less of your money on useless bureaucrats and bridges to nowhere.\n\nThe only downside, at least for Jesse Lee, is that he would be unemployed.\n\n\u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com and on Twitter @charleshurt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Poor Jesse Lee.
