The better news: It\u2019s not icing, at least in most of the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nNow, way out west \u2014 in Comanche, Cooke, Eastland and Jack counties \u2014 there are reports of icing on bridges and overpasses. But west of Dallas-Fort Worth, temperatures are a few degrees colder \u2014 in the upper 20s, as opposed to the low to mid-30s being reported west of Interstate 35, the wintry-weather dividing line this New Year\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cIt seems we\u2019re seeing more impact when it\u2019s 28 or lower, and that\u2019s far to the west of the metro,\u201d says Amanda Schroeder, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very stout, thick warm layer above the surface, which has helped keep temperatures a little warmer, which has helped keep things liquid.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not going to get any colder \u2014 today or tonight.\n\n\u201cThe temperature should remain fairly steady this morning and climb a little this afternoon,\u201d she says, \u201cand we\u2019re not expecting freezing temperatures here during the overnight hours.\u201d In fact, we\u2019re not supposed to dip below freezing again until Saturday night, when lows are projected to drop into the low 30s as another shot of cold air arrives just in time for Cowboys-Lions. Says Schroeder, \u201cYou may have a little freezing rain mixed in there this morning in Dallas, but it shouldn\u2019t be enough to cause any impacts.\u201d\n\nThe rain\u2019s likely to stick around until Saturday morning \u2014 the first small hint of good news in the new year, as we struggle to make a dent in a drought now entering its sixth year. As of 9 this morning, Dallas/Fort Worth International has received almost a quarter of an inch of the wet stuff.\n\nSays Schroder, \u201cA good way to start the year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAxL2Zvci1kYWxsYXMtb24tbmV3LXllYXJzLWRheS1uby1pY2Utb25seS1jb2xkLWFuZC1zb21lLW11Y2gtbmVlZGVkLXJhaW4uaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "The good news: It's raining, and we do need the rain.
