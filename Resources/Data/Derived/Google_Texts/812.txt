Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz spoke at a rally in Northeast Columbus tonight. He says the Republican race is only between two candidates.

He says when it comes down to it, the race is between he and Donald Trump. He urges Ohioans to join him in this journey to the White House and take down the frontrunner.

In a last-minute push before the primaries, Cruz took to the stage at the Northland Performing Arts Center saying the most important challenges facing our country are jobs, freedom and security. If he gets elected, he's making replacing Obamacare a high priority.

"Pass a flat tax and lift the regulations and we will see millions of new jobs. Wages going up and it will generate trillions in new government revenue and we will use that money to rebuild this military," Cruz said.





Cruz was quick to attack Donald Trump. He says he is the only Republican candidate who has a realistic chance of beating him.

"If you're angry at the corruption of Washington, then the answer isn't to support someone like Donald Trump who has been immersed in the corruption of Washington," Cruz said.

Debbie Porter, a Cruz supporter, says he's an all around good guy and the most qualified candidate.

"Ted is very strong on the constitution, which I love and he's pro life and he will help protect our religious liberties," Porter said.

Cruz told Ohioans to unite and stand as one. He says if he's on the ticket, he's the best nominee to go up against Hillary Clinton.

He is scheduled to be in Illinois on Monday.
