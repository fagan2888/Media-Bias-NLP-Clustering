Metropolitan Police Department

The Metropolitan Police Department is releasing new photographs of 8-year-old Relisha Rudd, who's been missing from the District for almost a month, and 51-year-old man they believe she is with, Kahlil Tatum.

The picture of Tatum shows distinctive tattoos on his left arm. Those tattoos include an "Ankh," the Ancient Egyptian symbol for life, and another figure that's repeated, but not clear in the photo.

Tatum is facing charges for killing his wife, Andrea Tatum, who was found dead in a motel room during the seach for Relisha.

Police Chief Cathy Lanier says her department, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies are searching all over the region and beyond for Relisha. She says the amber alert for the girl has gone as far north as Delaware and Pennsylvania and as far south as Florida.
