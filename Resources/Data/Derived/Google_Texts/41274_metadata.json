They want the scalps of the vast majority of American consumers and investors, because they\u2019re afraid of letting Americans use the brains under their scalps to make financial decisions.Though much of the coverage of DOL\u2019s rule has characterized it as more mandated disclosure, in fact it is Litan who makes the case for better disclosure to improve options for consumers.Warren and the DOL bureaucrats, by contrast, argue that disclosure has reached its limits due to what they regard as Americans\u2019 inherent intellectual limitations.As Warren wrote in 2008 when she was a professor at Harvard Law School, \u201ccognitive limitations of consumers . . . put consumers\u2019 economic security at risk.\u201dWarren and her co-author Oren Bar-Gill penned some other choice passages about consumers and their \u201ccognitive limitations\u201d \u2014 as apparently opposed to the lack of those limitations by Warren, Bar-Gill, and the bureaucrats they have anointed \u2014 in their 2008 University of Pennsylvania Law Review article \u201cMaking Credit Safer.\u201dWarren and Bar-Gill proclaimed that not only are \u201cmany consumers [] uninformed and irrational,\u201d they are also uneducable. The authors refer frequently to the \u201climits of learning\u201d and \u201cwhy getting smarter collectively does not work.\u201dAs described by journalist Michael Patrick Leahy, Warren and Bar-Gill \u201cargued that American consumers are, in essence, too simple-minded to understand credit and therefore must be protected by the federal government.\u201dThis 2008 article premised on the supposed stupidity of consumers, and the need for a government intellectual elite to limit their decision-making, outlined what would become the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created when the Dodd-Frank \u201cfinancial reform\u201d law was rammed through Congress two years later.In addition to its lack of accountability to Congress through the appropriations process \u2014 lest it become subject to the elected representatives of voters with \u201ccognitive limitations\u201d \u2014 the CFPB also has the power to ban not just \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cdeceptive\u201d lending practices, but loans or credit terms it deems \u201cabusive\u201d to cognitively-impaired consumers.(Because CEI believes consumers can think for themselves, and because we believe that the structure of the CFPB is abusive to constitutional guarantees of accountability in government, we are suing to overturn the CFPB for structural violations of the Constitution.)And now with the fiduciary rule, the DOL has put forth a rationale similar to that of Warren for the CFPB, explicitly premised on what bureaucrats deem to be the stupidity of American retirement savers.As I have written previously , the DOL proposed rule comes right out and says in its first few pages that most Americans \u201ccan\u2019t prudently manage retirement assets on their own\u201d and that improved disclosure won\u2019t help that much.So the DOL rule would massively increase liability and fines for financial professionals who handle 401(k)s and IRAs, unless they choose assets and an investing strategies from an approved DOL list.\u201cDisclosure alone has proven ineffective,\u201d proclaims the rule. \u201cMost consumers generally cannot distinguish good advice, or even good investment results, from bad.\u201d In fact, proclaims the DOL, \u201crecent research suggests that even if disclosure about conflicts could be made simple and clear, it would be ineffective \u2014 or even harmful.\u201dIn their paper , Litan and Singer challenge these points and stand up for American savers\u2019 intelligence and right to make investment choices. \u201cAt a minimum, before undertaking a major overhaul of the retirement savings market, wouldn\u2019t prudence call for at least trying a better disclosure standard first, before abandoning enhanced disclosure entirely?\u201d they ask.To address the DOL\u2019s main complaint of investors not knowing that brokers can receive additional payments from firms that manage mutual funds and annuities, Litan and Singer propose written statements to be given to investors of the exact amount brokers will be compensated by these firms when investors buy these products.I\u2019m not sure I would agree the costs of the regulation they propose would justify the benefits. But it would certainly be better than the current proposed DOL regulation that would likely result in a massive reduction in personalized investment guidance, and that Litan and Singer estimate credibly could cost savers $80 billion over the next decade.More importantly for our system of self-government, a disclosure approach would respect consumers and investors as rational adults capable of making decisions for themselves.What Warren\u2019s feud with Litan really exposes is a dispute among progressives \u2014 as to whether choice and competition can be improved by regulation or if choice and competition represent market failures themselves.Throughout his career, Litan has always fought for the ideal of competitive markets and sovereign consumers even if\u2014as in his role in pursuing the Microsoft antitrust case as a Clinton DOJ official\u2014he championed interventionist approaches that libertarians would oppose.Fortunately, Litan\u2019s brand of left-liberalism that respects consumers\u2019 intelligence still shows signs of life.Ninety-six House Democrats, including some like Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., who are decidedly in the progressive camp, recently wrote the DOL arguing that \u201cIt is vital that the proposal doesn\u2019t limit consumer choice and access to advice, have a disproportionate impact on lower or middle-income communities, or raise the costs of saving for retirement.\u201dThese members should join their Republican colleagues in freezing funding for implementation of the rule until it is rewritten to address these vital transpartisan concerns.Competitive Enterprise Institute Research Associate Rahul Gangan contributed to this post.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Healthcare Reform, Money", "pubdate": "2015-10-06T08:32:35", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "For our system of self-government, a disclosure approach would respect consumers and investors as rational adults capable of making decisions for themselves.", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Wants to Make Financial Decisions For You", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/JohnBerlau/Healthcare-Reform-Money/2015/10/06/id/694856/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=5e628bd3-f001-427a-b6af-6c068d23eca2&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/JohnBerlau/Healthcare-Reform-Money/2015/10/06/id/694856/", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Wants to Make Financial Decisions For You", "description": "For our system of self-government, a disclosure approach would respect consumers and investors as rational adults capable of making decisions for themselves.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1444120355, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "Healthcare Reform, Money", "article": {"section": "JohnBerlau", "published_time": "2015-10-06T08:32:35"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/JohnBerlau/Healthcare-Reform-Money/2015/10/06/id/694856/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "For our system of self-government, a disclosure approach would respect consumers and investors as rational adults capable of making decisions for themselves."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb171\"", "article_summary": "Elizabeth Warren \u201cdrew blood,\u201dWashington Post reporter Tom Hamburger.\n(Because CEI believes consumers can think for themselves, and because we believe that the structure of the CFPB is abusive to constitutional guarantees of accountability in government, we are suing to overturn the CFPB for structural violations of the Constitution.\nput consumers\u2019 economic security at risk.\u201dWarren and her co-author Oren Bar-Gill penned some other choice passages about consumers and their \u201ccognitive limitations\u201d \u2014 as apparently opposed to the lack of those limitations by Warren, Bar-Gill, and the bureaucrats they have anointed \u2014 in their 2008 University of Pennsylvania Law Review article \u201cMaking Credit Safer.\u201dWarren and Bar-Gill proclaimed that not only are \u201cmany consumers [] uninformed and irrational,\u201d they are also uneducable.\n\u201cMost consumers generally cannot distinguish good advice, or even good investment results, from bad.\u201d In fact, proclaims the DOL, \u201crecent research suggests that even if disclosure about conflicts could be made simple and clear, it would be ineffective \u2014 or even harmful.\u201dIn their paper , Litan and Singer challenge these points and stand up for American savers\u2019 intelligence and right to make investment choices.\nThey want the scalps of the vast majority of American consumers and investors, because they\u2019re afraid of letting Americans use the brains under their scalps to make financial decisions.Though much of the coverage of DOL\u2019s rule has characterized it as more mandated disclosure, in fact it is Litan who makes the case for better disclosure to improve options for consumers.Warren and the DOL bureaucrats, by contrast, argue that disclosure has reached its limits due to what they regard as Americans\u2019 inherent intellectual limitations.As Warren wrote in 2008 when she was a professor at Harvard Law School, \u201ccognitive limitations of consumers ."}
