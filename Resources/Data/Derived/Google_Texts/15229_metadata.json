Dick Durbin Dick DurbinReid: 'Lay off' Sanders criticism Senators tout 4.5B defense spending bill that sticks to budget Lawmakers seek changes in TSA PreCheck program MORE (D-Ill.) urged his colleagues on Friday to support legislation that would allow student debt holders to refinance their loan rates.\n\n\u201cStudent debt has reached the breaking point in this country,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cFar too many young people are looking at a lifetime of debt just because they wanted to do the right thing and get a college degree.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDurbin said that shortly after the Senate returns from its August recess on Sept. 8 it would vote again on the Bank on Students Emergency Refinancing Act introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The bill would raise taxes on millionaire in order to pay for the loan rate decrease.\n\nDurbin is a co-sponsor of the bill, which failed to overcome a Republican filibuster earlier this year. He argued that the legislation is necessary because a generation is being bogged down by student loan debt, which averages $28,000 a student.\n\n\u201cThe bill which I co-sponsored earlier this year will help ease that burden by allowing them to lower their interest rates,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cThe Senate will soon take up this common-sense legislation, and I hope my colleagues join me in supporting it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
