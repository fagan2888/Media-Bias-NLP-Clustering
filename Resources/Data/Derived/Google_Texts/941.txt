WASHINGTON – This prank gift might still come in handy – but it would have been perfect before ObamaCare launched.

A Tennessee legislator gave Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius a copy of the book “Web Sites for Dummies,” in a searing gesture about the clunky ObamaCare web site fiasco.

GOP state Sen. Brian Kelsey, an opponent of ObamaCare’s Medicaid expansion, was on hand when Sebelius visited a Memphis library on Friday to promote the new national health plan.

When Kelsey sprung the gift on her, the embattled HHS secretary didn’t look particularly grateful, as revealed in a photo snapped by the Memphis Daily News.

“I only had two seconds to convey that message to her, so I thought the book would be a creative way to ensure she remembered the message,” Kelsey told the paper later.

At the event, Sibelius continued her apology tour for the botched site – while vowing to fix it. “We should have been ready,” she said.

The do-it-yourself guide, which goes for about $25 on Amazon, bills itself as “a step-by-step guide for creating your own web sites.”

According to their own estimate, the feds have spent $630 million on information technology for the creation and rollout of Healthcare.gov, which has been beset with problems and shut down repeatedly.
