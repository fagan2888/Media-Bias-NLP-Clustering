Shawn Jenkins does. When Jenkins, along with Mason Holland, founded the company back in 2000 \u2014 setting up shop in an abandoned Walmart building in Charleston, S.C. \u2014 he quietly began revolutionizing the benefits industry through the company's cloud-based technology. They founded Benefitfocus on a simple premise. \u201cOur idea was simply \u2014 and still is \u2014 that it ought to be easy for an employer to manage all their benefits \u2014 all types of benefits \u2014 in one place through technology. \u2026 We thought the employee and their families should be able to understand those benefits and get multiple ways of communication,\u201d says Jenkins, the company's CEO and president. \u201cWe set out to build a better way. And we built a web-based software platform for electronic enrollment and eligibility management.\u201d Simply put, Benefitfocus aimed to take the \u201cadministrative clunkiness\u201d out of benefits. They wanted to make it easy, they wanted to make it mobile, and they wanted to make it fun. They picked up some customers, got some attention from carriers and employers, and gained a small foothold. But for years, most people, Jenkins admits, still hadn't heard of Benefitfocus. The founders hung around, knowing they had a good concept, and the company gradually grew. Then things got more complex. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was getting off the ground, voluntary benefits were the talk of the industry, and exchanges became part of the picture. More people were confused and frustrated with the way things were going. And that's when things got good for Benefitfocus. People were looking for ways to manage all the complexity using technology, Jenkins explains. And his company was eager to help. \u201cThe additional complexity, the compliance, the constant changing and churning of the rules [in PPACA] is kind of tailor-made for technology,\u201d Jenkins, 46, says. \u201cIt's been a big tail wind for us.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re one of these success stories where we were quietly doing the work and building the infrastructure on the products and the market kind of lined up for us, and it's been great. We\u2019ve grown exceptionally well and we\u2019re just proud,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a founder, it's been fun to build a great team, a great culture, and solve a big, big problem.\u201d Success, after that, came fast: In 2013, after approaching nearly $100 million in revenue, Benefitfocus went public (it's under the ticker BNFT) and revenues surged. Today, Benefitfocus has four other offices \u2014 in San Francisco; Jenks, Okla.; Greenville, S.C.; and Hyderabad, India \u2014 in addition to its 40-acre campus in Charleston. The company has more than 1,000 associates. And 23 million people now belong up in the (Benefitfocus) cloud.\n\nHow it works Benefitfocus offers its clients a cloud-based subscription service to help them manage and streamline their benefits plans, and in so doing, has become one of the largest benefits software companies in the United States. It offers two basic products \u2014 one for employers (among the company's clients are Under Armour, New Balance, Dannon, Triumph Foods and Brooks Brothers) and one for carriers (it works with Prudential, MetLife, UnitedHealth and more than 30 BlueCross partners, among others). Electronic billing, enrollment, sales and access to informative videos, health news and tips are all part of the Benefitfocus platform, which Jenkins describes as the \u201cApple version\u201d of benefits. The company gives consumers the opportunity to manage their benefits in one place, on a computer or a mobile device, much like they would with their music library. \u201cThe platform is really similar to the Apple App Store or the Android store; and we\u2019re kind of a laboratory ourselves \u2014 we have multiple health plan options, dental, vision, critical illness, LifeLock, an array of other products,\u201d Jenkins says. What makes Benefitfocus different than other benefits software, he says, is that it puts voluntary products at the forefront during enrollment. \u201cAs I enrolled myself this last year for my family, as soon as I selected my health plan \u2014 I selected a high-deductible health plan, and it automatically recommended Allstate's critical illness plan to help fill in some of the gaps \u2014 so I selected that and continued on with the rest of my enrollment.\u201d The fact that the platform offers more than just a couple of health plan options is part of its success. Jenkins cites the importance of voluntary benefits for all parties involved \u2014 employers, brokers, carriers and consumers. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken voluntary benefits from kind of a sideshow and woven them directly through our recommendation and put them right at the point where people are making those critical decisions,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cWe can explain it through video \u2014 we have great videos that explain the capability. We are seeing incredible increased participation in these programs because of the ability to make it seamless. A lot of it has to do with technology that is making it seamless.\u201d Technology, of course, is the company's central theme. Jenkins talks a lot about the company's \u201cfantastic software\u201d and its investment in engineering and product development. Benefitfocus does four major software releases a year. \u201cEvery 90 days we\u2019re updating the platform for new regulations, new benefits support, new user experience capability \u2014 the market looks at how they can modernize their benefits platforms,\u201d Jenkins says. That technology, says April Floyd, benefits manager at Under Armour in Baltimore, has allowed her company to streamline communications to all employees by getting them more involved. \u201cMy benefits team has elevated drastically since we no longer have to spend time helping our many teammates make benefit elections and changes nor do we have to answer day-to day-questions. Teammates can do it independently,\u201d she says. \u201cWe may pay a lot of money for our employees\u2019 benefits but if they don't know about them, then it's not really a value. We want to make sure they understand how rich their benefits are,\u201d Floyd says.\n\nFrankly, technology is a long time coming for the benefits industry, Jenkins says. \u201cIn other industries, we\u2019ve certainly seen technology come through \u2014 whether it's the music industry or the travel industry,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cBut the benefits industry is much bigger than the music industry or air travel \u2014 so it's taking longer. But it's vital. You need to be on the right side of the technology equation.\u201d \u2018All in this together\u2019 Besides technology, another aspect that sets Benefitfocus apart is the fact that it's finding success embracing regulatory changes instead of running from them. Not to say it's not a challenge. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is a big tail wind for us,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cIt wasn't necessary for our growth \u2014 benefits administration was ready for cloud-based technology, so that was happening anyway \u2014 but the right technology platforms that can adapt to those changes can further help the customer base. \u201cAs the market looks at how they can modernize their benefits platforms from the carrier, employer or broker standpoint, they realize they need a flexible tool that's constantly improving, and the more regulation, the more confusing it is, it helps our business,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's a big thing to keep up with.\u201d Brokers are also a vital piece of the puzzle. And they\u2019re increasingly choosing to work with the platform, Jenkins says. \u201cAn employer wants an array of benefits \u2014 they want a platform. As an independent broker, it may be difficult to invest tens of millions of dollars to invest in relevant technology in the cloud. What these brokers are finding is, with Benefitfocus, they can use us and they\u2019re able to offer more than just two or three benefits \u2014 they can offer six or eight or 10, maybe more,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cAnd they\u2019re finding that the employer is appreciative because the benefits administration costs are lower, the bills are accurate, and, more importantly for the broker, they are able to sell more products.\u201d Cheri Warnick, account manager for brokerage firm Benefits Controls of the Carolinas Inc., in Charlotte, N.C., says using that technology helps ease some of the increased workload she and other brokers at her firm have experienced due to PPACA. \u201cBenefitfocus has helped us as a broker build stronger relationships with our clients,\u201d Warnick says. \u201cIt has taken workload off of the client at marketing time. And it is easier for us to assist with enrollment, COBRA and employee notices.\u201d", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaaac\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut the benefits industry is much bigger than the music industry or air travel \u2014 so it's taking longer.\nFrankly, technology is a long time coming for the benefits industry, Jenkins says.\nWhat makes Benefitfocus different than other benefits software, he says, is that it puts voluntary products at the forefront during enrollment.\nAnd we built a web-based software platform for electronic enrollment and eligibility management.\u201d Simply put, Benefitfocus aimed to take the \u201cadministrative clunkiness\u201d out of benefits.\nPeople were looking for ways to manage all the complexity using technology, Jenkins explains."}
