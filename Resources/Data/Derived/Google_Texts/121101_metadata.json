It didn\u2019t get much better \u2014 until his team was down to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 24-0, at halftime in week seven.\n\nThat\u2019s when Cousins became a different guy.\n\nHe led his team to a remarkable 31-30 win \u2014 the largest comeback in franchise history \u2014 and punctuated it by yelling into television cameras after the game as he walked toward the Redskins locker room, \u201cYou like that!\u201d\n\nIt became the team motto and came to define the new Cousins. If you are a Redskins fan, how can you not like what you saw in the last two months of the season \u2014 19 touchdowns and just two interceptions and named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December as he led the Redskins to a 6-2 record and the division title.\n\nHe\u2019s not Rodgers \u2014 at least not yet. He showed that Sunday, and he may never be.\n\nBut Cousins \u2014 who completed 29 of 46 passes for 329 yards and one touchdown \u2014 showed he is clearly the best option for the Redskins moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe had high hopes, obviously,\u201d Gruden told reporters last week. \u201cHe\u2019s our starting quarterback and we have a lot of weapons around him. I think once our weapons got entirely healthy we felt good about our offense and our scheme. Kirk has probably done a little bit better than a lot of people have thought. But, in-house, I think a lot of people around here have a lot of confidence in what he can do with the football.\u201d\n\nThe progress that Cousins showed this year validated Gruden\u2019s decision to name him the starter over Robert Griffin III \u00ad\u2014 who will likely be released soon \u2014 and with that move will come the end of the RGIII story in Washington.\n\nWith a full season under his belt as a starter, going into the offseason with no doubt who the team\u2019s quarterback is \u2014 providing it gets Cousins\u2018 contract status settled, as he is set to become a free agent, the best may be yet to come for Cousins, who said Sunday that he \u201cwants to be where he is wanted.\u201d\n\nCousins has proven he has learned from his mistakes and also has proven that those mistakes no longer define him. Sunday\u2019s loss to the Packers, ending the Redskins\u2019 season, will not likely define him moving forward, either.\n\n\u201cEvery experience that he had, he\u2019s going to benefit from \u2014 every situation that he was in throughout the course of the season, and there was a lot of them, we\u2019re going to study very diligently in the offseason and a lot of situations that happened throughout the season on other teams,\u201d Gruden said following Sunday\u2019s loss. \u201cWe\u2019re going to study to make him better and get him better. It was a great experience for him \u2014 and for the entire team, for that matter. A lot of the young guys got some quality work this year, and it\u2019s only going to make them better moving forward.\u201d\n\nRodgers sat behind Brett Favre in the first three years of his career in Green Bay, and, when he finally started in his fourth year, performed well \u2014 28 touchdowns, 13 interceptions, 4,038 yards and a 93.8 quarterback rating \u2014 but the best was yet to come.\n\nCousins finished the fourth season of his NFL career, his first as a starter, with 29 touchdowns, 11 interceptions, 4,166 yards and a 101.6. And the best may be yet to come.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building something for the future,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nSo is Cousins.\n\n\u2981 Thom Loverro is co-host of \u201cThe Sports Fix,\u201d noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 and espn980.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cousins was not the same player who was benched last season for his mistakes or even the player who was mediocre in September.
