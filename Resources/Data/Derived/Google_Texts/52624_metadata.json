VM South Beach, whose members include the Nakash family of Jordache Enterprises, holds the mortgage to the 10-room, 11-bath mansion.\n\nThe Nakash family had been seen as the mansion\u2019s likely buyer because it owns the Hotel Victor next door. After the auction, Joe Nakash told the Herald he plans to operate the mansion as a hotel along with the Victor.\n\nThe mansion was put on the auction block as part of the owner\u2019s Chapter 11 case. As a result, the Nakash family\u2019s winning bid is subject to the approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Miami, which has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday.\n\nMr. Versace purchased the mansion, which also features an expansive garden and pool lined in 24-karat-gold, in 1992. He resided there for five years, until he was gunned down on the mansion\u2019s doorstep in 1997.\n\nWrite to Jacqueline Palank at jacqueline.palank@wsj.com.
