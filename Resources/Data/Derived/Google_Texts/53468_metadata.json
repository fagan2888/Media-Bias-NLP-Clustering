Male students at Tumwater High School, just south of Olympia, published a video in which they applied national sexual assault statistics to their own female classmates. The schmaltzy music could have been left out, and the video doesn't acknowledge sexual assault of other genders, but nonetheless, high-school boys educating their male peers about sexual assault is damn powerful. More than 40 percent of women who are raped in the United States are raped before they turn 18.\n\nGovernor Inslee Snapped at a Crosscut Reporter: On Wednesday, a reporter's question about embattled State Auditor Troy Kelley appears to have pushed the jolly green giant into Hulk SMASH mode. John Stang asked why the governor hadn't demanded a meeting with the state auditor, whose home was searched by the Feds last month. \"Isn't that sort of weak?\" Stang said. Inslee's response, according to the Seattle Times: \"No, John, it isn\u2019t weak, and you and I have to go out in the alleyway and decide who is weak on this. You\u2019ve hit my hot button on that.\"\n\nSpeaking of Governors, Chris Gregoire Had a Strange and Scary Interaction with a Guy in a Parking Lot: A man tried to get into the former governor's car after watching her when she left Lowe's, according to the police report. Gregoire hustled to her car and stepped on the gas as the man opened her passenger door and got part of the way in. Police cited the man for disorderly conduct endangering others.\n\nInsurance Companies Aren't Giving Women Accurate Information About Birth Control: Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are supposed to cover birth control prescriptions.

But if the Last Week Tonight comedian (and, let's be real, journalist) can get people to care about net neutrality, maybe a more online-friendly legislative process would encourage more people to reach out to state lawmakers. The bill, which already passed the state senate, passed nearly unanimously in the house.\n\nDo not trust this man. kurhan/ Shutterstock\n\nA Fake Plumber Is Conning Seniors in Seattle: He says he's working on a water main, then steals elderly women's cash, credit cards, and IDs.
