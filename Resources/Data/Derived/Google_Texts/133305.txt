Liberals and gay activists can celebrate this day (the U.S. Supreme Court legalizing gay marriage). They’ve won a major victory, but the ruling may have just established a precedent which might well impact some of their other hard-won battles.

In their ruling affirming the right to marry to all gay couples throughout the U.S., the Supremes cited the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment of the Constitution which, as they read it, guarantees that whatever rights, liberties and privileges afforded to one person are rightly to be enjoyed and accessible to all — equally.

That said, since 1961, it has been government policy to discriminate in favor of historically disadvantaged racial groups.

What might this ruling mean for affirmative action and similar governmental practices and hiring/recruitment policies? Is it a violation of the EPC if a governmental or business policy promotes one person over another, for any reason other than merit? What of the preferential treatment enjoyed by veterans when applying for governmental work, or housing — the bonus points they are given on the civil service exams?

Or what of income eligibility requirements for Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps or Obamacare — will equal protection mean that all should be equally eligible regardless of need or income? Could the Equal Protection Clause be used to mandate a flat income tax rate, the same rate for rich and poor alike?

I would imagine we have not seen the last mention of equal protection in Supreme Court cases.
