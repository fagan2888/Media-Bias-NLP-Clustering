According to the United Nations, although the U.S. spends more per capita on health care than any other nation in the world, U.S. residents have a life expectancy of 77.9 years, lower than 28 other countries. As we focus on becoming a healthier nation, the Division of Public Health (DPH) urges Delawareans to remember that health choices and challenges are woven into every day, and are profoundly impacted by where people live, work, pray, and play.\n\n\u201cMuch of a person\u2019s overall health is determined outside of a doctor\u2019s office, \u201c said DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. \u201cAnd, while one\u2019s choices fundamentally impact a person\u2019s health, the things they cannot choose also make a difference. DPH celebrates this public health week as a reminder that health is more than health care.\u201d\n\nEach year public health professionals honor National Public Health week with a different theme Monday to Friday, and this year\u2019s celebration focuses on ambitious and global ideas:\n\n\u2022 Making the grade (Monday, April 6): What does the data reveal about America\u2019s health?\n\no Obesity, smoking, and sedentary lifestyles among youth and adults are linked to escalating chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. The 5-2-1 Almost None campaign is a simple way to remember to make smart choices: eat 5 or more fruits and vegetables each day, have no more than 2 hours of recreational screen time each day (includes TV, computer, gaming), get 1 or more hours of physical activity each day, and drink almost no sugary beverages.\n\n\u2022 Starting from Zip (Tuesday, April 7): Your ZIP code says far too much about your health.\n\no Within the United States, there are unacceptable disparities in health, state-by-state and even county-by-county. The effort to make the U.S. the Healthiest Nation in One Generation starts with ensuring equity across all communities. DPH is working with community partners to achieve health equity by working with communities that have the poorest health outcomes to address their most important determinants of health. And, in 2014 DPH was pleased to honor nine communities who have made investments that promote healthy behaviors through infrastructure, events, and policies, and which won \u201chealthy community\u201d recognition from Governor Jack Markell\u2019s Council on Health Promotion and Disease\n\n\u2022 Building momentum (Wednesday, April 8): The Affordable Care Act (ACA) brings health care and preventive services to the front and center.\n\no Access to health care is vital to good health and now Delawareans have more access than ever before to health insurance.

Through strategic planning and the State Health Improvement Process (SHIP), DPH has sought input and guidance from multiple partners to help identify what they see as the most pressing health problems in the state. And, as an agency, DPH has begun to take the \u201chealth in all policies approach,\u201d and is striving to grow partnerships with education officials, local governments, state agencies, public, private and for-profit organizations \u2013 everyone who impacts health.\n\n\u2022 Building upon success (Friday, April 10): Improve DPH performance in all areas and seek national accreditation.\n\no Public health agencies across the country are evolving. Rather than being mostly a direct service provider, DPH is strategically leveraging resources and partnerships to build the agency\u2019s vision of healthy people in healthy communities. DPH and the newly established Delaware Public Health Institute are leading a collaborative process with health stakeholders to improve population health. The SHIP is addressing two core health issues: improving access to mental health services; and assuring an infrastructure to promote healthy behaviors.\n\nTo learn more about national public health week visit, visit http://www.nphw.org To learn more about the DPH SHIP plan, visit http://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph/files/shaship.pdf.\n\nDelaware Health and Social Services is committed to improving the quality of the lives of Delaware\u2019s citizens by promoting health and well-being, fostering self-sufficiency, and protecting vulnerable populations. DPH, a division of DHSS, urges Delawareans to make healthier choices with the 5-2-1 Almost None campaign: eat 5 or more fruits and vegetables each day, have no more than 2 hours of recreational screen time each day (includes TV, computer, gaming), get 1 or more hours of physical activity each day, drink almost no sugary beverages.\n\n###\n\nRita Landgraf, Secretary\n\nJill Fredel, Director of Communications\n\n302-255-9047, Cell 302-357-7498\n\nEmail: jill.fredel@state.de.us\n\nDelaware Health and Social Services \u2013 Division of Public Health\n\nRelated Topics:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cHEALTHIEST NATION IN ONE GENERATION\u201d BY 2030; NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH WEEK STARTS APRIL 6, 2015 During National Public Health Week 2015 (April 6-12, 2015), the public health community is rallying to make the U.S. the \u201chealthiest nation in one generation\u201d by 2030.
