That\u2019s one percentage point higher than last year\u2019s 14 percent\u2014the lowest approval rating ever recorded by the polling firm.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t shocking news to anyone. Congress hasn\u2019t seen a job approval rating above 20 percent in the last five years.\n\nWhen it comes to disapproving of Congress\u2014Republican and Democrat voters seem to be on the same page.\n\nAccording to Gallup, among Republicans and Democrats, 15 percent said they approved of Congress\u2019s job performance throughout 2014. The approval rating among independents was about 14 percent.\n\nThe pollsters attributed the low numbers to the divided Congress, and suggested it\u2019s possible that the lawmakers will see their approval ratings climb next year when one party -- the GOP-- controls both houses.\n\n\u201cOver the past four years, Congress' approval ratings have been among the lowest Gallup has measured. Part of this may be attributed to the divided control of Congress, with neither party controlling both the House and Senate -- thus leaving both Republicans and Democrats with divided sentiments when asked to rate Congress as a whole,\u201d Gallup\u2019s Rebecca Riffkin said in a blog post.\n\n\u201cHowever, in January, when newly elected Republican senators are sworn in and Republicans begin controlling both houses of Congress, approval may increase as Americans who identify as Republicans become more positive.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean voters are optimistic about the future of Congress, Washington or the country in general. A separate poll from Pew Research Center found that seven in 10 voters say they expect Republicans and Democrats failure to work together over the next two years will hurt the country a lot. About 16 percent say it will hurt some. And about 4 in 5 expect it to hurt them personally.\n\nRelated: The Ten Richest Members of Congress in 2014\n\nThe poll found that neither Democrats nor Republicans expect the other to cooperate with them to get things done. Just one in five Republicans said they think President Obama will cooperate with GOP leaders. Meanwhile only 4 in 10 Republicans think GOP leaders will work with the president\u2014and many of them are okay with that.\n\nAs Dan Balz notes in The Washington Post, the Pew survey suggests that dysfunction (and with it deepening pessimism about the system) is the new normal in American politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe findings about expectations for cooperation are worse than they were just eight years ago when the positions of the parties were the opposite \u2014 after Democrats took full control of Congress while Bush was still in the White House,\u201d Balz wrote. \u201cThat deterioration is one more indicator of how much more embedded partisan divisions have become in the political system.\u201d\n\nSure enough, pessimism among all voters seems to be spreading. The Pew poll found that only 49 percent of people expect 2015 to be better than last year. Among Democrats who historically have been optimistic about President Obama\u2019s presidency, only 60 percent expect next year to be better\u2014down from 80 percent last year. The 20-point drop is likely attributed to the Republicans victory in the midterm elections this year, with a GOP-controlled Congress likely to set up more political gridlock between Capitol Hill and the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican\u2019s outlook on 2015 is similarly grim. Just 34 percent of Republicans expect next year to be better than this year.\n\nWhy This Matters:\n\nWhile most employees who fail a performance review wouldn\u2019t be able to keep their jobs, Congress consistently gets poor marks with no consequences. Of course, their own constituents might give them higher grades, but the national opinion of the 113th Congress is overwhelmingly negative. They\u2019ve been named the most unproductive Congress in history\u2014 with only 201 bills signed into law\u2014just 32 of which were major pieces of legislation. \u200b\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are preparing to skip town for the holidays after closing ou", "title": "Congress Ends 2014 with Near Record Low Approval Rating", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/15/Congress-Ends-2014-Near-Record-Low-Approval-Rating", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03122012_Congress_Zoom_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/15/Congress-Ends-2014-Near-Record-Low-Approval-Rating", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03122012_Congress_Zoom_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are preparing to skip town for the holidays after closing ou", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeaf3\"", "article_summary": "Congress hasn\u2019t seen a job approval rating above 20 percent in the last five years.\nThat\u2019s one percentage point higher than last year\u2019s 14 percent\u2014the lowest approval rating ever recorded by the polling firm.\n\u201cOver the past four years, Congress' approval ratings have been among the lowest Gallup has measured.\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill are preparing to skip town for the holidays after closing out the year with one of the lowest job approval ratings on record.\nThe approval rating among independents was about 14 percent."}
