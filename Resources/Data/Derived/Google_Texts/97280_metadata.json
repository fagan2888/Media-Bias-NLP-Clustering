Nikki Haley, R- S.C., delivers a speech on \"Lessons from the New South\" during a luncheon at the National Press Club, on Sept. 2, 2015, in Washington. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said Wednesday she would consider joining the Republican ticket next year if the party\u2019s nominee asks her to run for vice president.\n\nHaley, in a high-profile appearance at the National Press Club in Washington, initially said she would not spend time or energy thinking about the 2016 GOP ticket. But when asked about her interest in becoming a running mate, she didn\u2019t dismiss the idea.\n\n\u201cIf there is a time where a presidential nominee wants to sit down and talk, of course I will sit down and talk,\u201d she said in response to audience questions after delivering a speech promoting South Carolina. She touted the state's success in recruiting industry, expanding workforce training and avoiding violence in the aftermath of two racially charged shootings this year. .\n\n\u201cBlack lives do matter, and they have been disgracefully jeopardized by the movement that has laid waste to Ferguson (Mo.)and Baltimore (Md.),\u201d Haley said. \u201cIn South Carolina, we did things differently.\u201d\n\nHaley\u2019s handling of the June mass shooting at Emmanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston, in which white gunman Dylan Roof is charged with targeting nine black parishioners, launched her into the national spotlight. Within days she called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the Capitol grounds in Columbia, and she became the face of a state recovering from its segregationist past.\n\nThat helped fuel talk that Haley, 43, might be selected to run with whichever GOP candidate wins the party\u2019s presidential nomination. The child of Indian immigrants, Haley is South Carolina\u2019s first female, minority governor, an attractive biography to Republicans struggling to earn minority votes.\n\nIn her speech Wednesday, Haley addressed her party\u2019s shortcomings with voters of color.\n\n\u201cAs a conservative Republican myself, I have no doubts that when it comes to jobs, education, health care, and many other policy areas, Republican principles are the right ones for lifting up all people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem for our party is that our approach often appears cold and unwelcoming to minorities. That is shameful, and it has to change.\u201d\n\nAfter complimenting GOP frontrunner Donald Trump as a smart businessman, she advised him not to \u201cget mad\u201d at his critics.\n\n\u201cEvery time someone criticizes him, he goes and makes a political attack back,\u201d Haley said. \u201cThat is not who we are as Republicans. That\u2019s not what we do. That not what I want my South Carolinians to do.\u201d\n\nShe also urged Republican candidates to celebrate the contributions of legal immigrants, and to offer more details about their plans to secure the Southwest border to reduce illegal immigration.\n\nSouth Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison said Haley\u2019s calls for improving opportunities for minorities in the state ring hollow while she refuses to expand Medicaid to more lower-income residents, as allowed under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhile Governor Haley chases the national spotlight, South Carolina\u2019s families continue to struggle to get ahead,\u201d Harrison said in a prepared statement.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1UssaNu", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "South Carolina Gov.
