The University of South Carolina team of Patrick Walters of Summerville, South Carolina, and Gettys Brannon of Columbia, South Carolina, brought a five-bass limit to the scale Saturday weighing 17 pounds, 1 ounce to win the 2015 FLW College Fishing National Championship on Lake Murray presented by the Lowrance Insight Genesis College Cup. The Gamecock duo beat out 44 teams in front of their hometown crowd to win the top award of a new Ranger Z117 with a 90-horsepower outboard and entry into the 2015 Forrest Wood Cup, the world championship of bass fishing.

“I don't know what the greatest part of this moment is,” said an overwhelmed Patrick Walters, a sophomore majoring in Business. “This has been the most amazing week. We had so much support from our family and friends it is just incredible.”

“I can't even begin to describe how I feel,” said Gettys Brannon, a junior majoring in Advertising. “There were some great fishermen here this week; some really great guys. There is no other sport like this. You compete against these guys who have become your friends and are happy for whoever wins. College fishing is like a fraternity; sometimes you share information, but not enough. This truly is one of the most memorable moments of my life.”

The University of South Carolina duo knew that consistency in the tournament was going to win the race and no other team in the tournament was as consistent as U.S.C. They brought 17 pounds, 6 ounces to the scale on day one, followed that up with an 18-11 stringer on day two and today claimed victory behind the strength of a 17-1 sack.

The team spent the week running to as many points as they could find following the blueback herring spawn. “We couldn't reel in our lines fast enough,” said Walters. “We would cast, reel in and if nothing bit we moved to another point.

Wind was another key factor for the team this week. They said that if the wind wasn't blowing then the fish weren't biting.

“My advice to you (fans) is to go out and buy as many bags of flukes as you can find,” continued Brannon. “I would suggest white, maybe some silver with a little shine…maybe some chrome.”

This is the first FLW College Fishing National Championship title for the University of South Carolina who will now advance to the 2015 Forrest Wood Cup to compete on Lake Ouachita in Hot Springs, Arkansas.
