Many competitors have fallen by the wayside.

All were completely overshadowed by the mighty Facebook

All but Bebo still operate in different forms

In Facebook's first 10 years, it has left many a competitor on the road to oblivion. Here's what we found as we followed the social media boulevard of broken dreams.

• Myspace. No site symbolizes the dominance of Facebook like the once high-flying Myspace. Launched in 2003, it was sold two years later to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for $580 million when it was the world's most popular social networking site. Blindsided by Facebook's ascendance, News Corp. dumped it to Specific Media for $35 million in 2011. It's still kicking around as a networking site for music lovers. Pop singer Justin Timberlake is now an investor.

• Orkut. Google still owns this site despite a steep drop-off in U.S. users. It is now mostly used by teenagers in Brazil and India. Google may be seeking to move its users to Google+, yet another struggling Facebook competitor that has had difficulty gaining traction. Google recently made it possible for Orkut users to link their accounts and Google+ profiles.

• Bebo. The poster child for the social network valuation bubble that eventually popped, Bebo was sold to AOL for $850 million by founders Michael Birch and Xochi Birch in 2008. With a huge following in the U.K. and Ireland, it had about 40 million users at the time of the deal. In 2011, AOL dumped it to a tech investment firm, which, in turn, sold it back to the Birches for $1 million last year. All that's left on the site now is a hilarious video in which Michael Birch pokes fun at the site's raunchy content back in the day. A redesigned version — as a phone app — is coming back in February.

• Friendster. A pioneer in social networking, the site was an inspiration for a wave of copycats. Garnering more than 100 million registered users at its peak, it's now a gaming site based in Kuala Lumpur, with most of its users in Southeast Asia. "Today the ruins of (Friendster) remain perfectly preserved," says a faux-archaeologist in a 2009 Onion video. "As soon as I entered the site, I knew I was the first human being to lay eyes on those pages in many, many years."
