Senators Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and David Perdue (R-GA) decided to co-sponsor legislation to prevent Americans from any more negative effects of Obamacare if the United States Supreme Court were to rule against the administration, holding a key component of Obamacare unconstitutional.

“Since the day that Obamacare was signed into law, I have worked to repeal it because of its terrible consequences on America’s families and small businesses,” said Isakson. “I’m proud to continue these efforts and make sure hardworking families who have already suffered the harmful effects of the president’s health care law will not be further penalized if the Supreme Court rules against the administration.”

“Obamacare has caused higher premiums, reduced access to doctors, and cut back workers’ hours,” Perdue added.

The Supreme Court is set to decide King v. Burwell in June. The case argues that the tax subsidies given to individuals who are enrolled in the federal exchange are illegal. This bill would allow an individual that loses his or her tax credits to receive the subsidy through 2017.

The Preserving Freedom and Choice in Health Care Act is meant to ensure individuals can keep their plans during the transition period, which is expected to last two years. According to the co-sponsors, this bill confers freedom to develop alternatives for the American people and repeals the employer and individual mandates. It additionally permits health care plans that Obamacare restrictions would have canceled to continue until 2017.

“We need commonsense solutions that improve the cost and quality of health care through competition and choice, rather than imposing job-killing taxes, mandates and penalties on the American people,” Isakson said.

“All Americans want and deserve quality, affordable health care, and we continue to see that Obamacare fails to deliver on those promises,” stated Perdue.
