Washington (CNN) Mitt Romney's speech at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting in San Diego proved the party's 2012 nominee is serious about another run and isn't just "going to Sea World for the afternoon," Rep. Jason Chaffetz said on Sunday.

The Utah Republican said he'd spoken with Romney last week -- and he made the case for another Romney campaign during an appearance on CNN's "State of the Union."

Romney, he said, "checks three boxes that the rest of the candidates don't necessarily" tick off. He's been vetted, Chaffetz said. He's been "proven right on so many issues," like Russia and the war on terror. And he could raise the $1 billion necessary "to beat Hillary Clinton."

Chaffetz has been among Romney's top supporters as he considers a third run for the White House, after falling short in 2008 and 2012.
