(Jennifer Mitchell/for New York Daily News)\n\nDe Blasio praised Obamacare for having \u201ctangibly addressed the income-inequality crisis\u201d but added, \u201cWhere I would be critical is that the progressive economic vision that I adhere to was not front and center in President Obama's vision.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThough, by the way, let's be fair \u2014 he didn't promise it.\"\n\nAs for his own record, the mayor apparently thinks non-New Yorkers have the best grasp of his achievements.\n\n\"A lot of people outside New York City understand what happened in the first year of New York City better than people in New York City,\" he told Rolling Stone.\n\nMayor de Blasio had some criticisms of President Obama\u2019s economic vision. (KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS)\n\n\"But I'm convinced something very special happened here.\"\n\nIn his view, his style of governance is far superior to ex-Mayor Giuliani\u2019s.\n\nAsked about Giuliani\u2019s successes, de Blasio - whose old boss David Dinkins left City Hall after one term because he lost to the Republican \u2014 indicated he wasn\u2019t impressed.\n\n\u201cDo you give him credit for figuring out a way to get more credit than he deserves? Sure, if that's credit,\u201d he sniffed.\n\nMayor Elect Bill De BLasio met with Mayor Michael Bloomberg at City Hall shortly after de Blasio\u2019s election. (Mark Bonifacio/New York Daily News)\n\nBut his way is better, he said.\n\n\u201cWe've proven not only was my model more electorally popular than his - by a lot - but that you can manage this place much more effectively if you're not in fact creating division through the process,\u201d he said.\n\nDe Blasio also thinks there was a \u201chype\u201d around Bloomberg that pegged him as above the damning influence of money because he was a billionaire.\n\n\u201cThis theory that he traveled in no world in particular - even just the social dynamic of the people he hung around with all the time meant that it didn't matter if they gave him money or not. They were still hugely influential to him,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said Bloomberg had \u201ca clear free-market worldview,\u201d as shown by the then-mayor\u2019s reaction in March 2012 when a former trader wrote an op-ed attacking the investment bank Goldman Sachs.\n\n\u201cI mean, for God\u2019s sake, when there was a critical op-ed in The New York Times about Goldman Sachs, he went to Goldman and gave a pep talk to the employees!\u201d said de Blasio. \u201cWhen a struggling school was having troubles in East New York, he didn\u2019t go there and give a pep talk.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "JENNIFER FERMINO", "twitter": {"description": "Mayor de Blasio doesn\u2019t have many nice things to say about anyone in a new magazine interview \u2014 except himself.", "title": "Bill de Blasio raps Obama, Bloomberg and Giuliani", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/mayor-raps-obama-bloomberg-giuliani-article-1.2212477", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2212473.1430932370!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-new-york-police.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "bill de blasio, obama, giuliani, bloomberg, new york mayor,", "parsely-author": "Jennifer Fermino", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "bill de blasio, obama, giuliani, bloomberg, new york mayor,", "nydn_tags": "bill de blasio, michael bloomberg, barack obama, rudy giuliani", "news_keywords": "bill de blasio, obama, giuliani, bloomberg, new york mayor,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/mayor-raps-obama-bloomberg-giuliani-article-1.2212477", "parsely-title": "Bill de Blasio raps Obama, Bloomberg and Giuliani", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-06T13:18:02-0400", "sailthru.title": "Bill de Blasio raps Obama, Bloomberg and Giuliani", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-05-06T17:18:02", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2212473.1430932370!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-new-york-police.jpg", "description": "Mayor de Blasio doesn\u2019t have many nice things to say about anyone in a new magazine interview \u2014 except himself.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Mayor de Blasio doesn\u2019t have many nice things to say about anyone in a new magazine interview \u2014 except himself.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Mayor de Blasio doesn\u2019t have many nice things to say about anyone in a new magazine interview \u2014 except himself.", "title": "Bill de Blasio raps Obama, Bloomberg and Giuliani", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/mayor-raps-obama-bloomberg-giuliani-article-1.2212477", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2212473.1430932370!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-new-york-police.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "bill de blasio, michael bloomberg, barack obama, rudy giuliani", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2212473.1430932370!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-new-york-police.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "JENNIFER FERMINO", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda38\"", "article_summary": "Mayor Elect Bill De BLasio met with Mayor Michael Bloomberg at City Hall shortly after de Blasio\u2019s election.\n\"A lot of people outside New York City understand what happened in the first year of New York City better than people in New York City,\" he told Rolling Stone.\n\u201cBut I certainly believe there should've been a focus on economics much earlier.\u201dIn a Rolling Stone interview, Mayor de Blasio criticized former Mayor Michael Bloomberg for favoring the rich.\nMayor de Blasio doesn\u2019t have many nice things to say about anyone in a new magazine interview \u2014 except himself.\nThe mayor even raps President Obama for not focusing enough on a \u201cprogressive\u201d vision."}
