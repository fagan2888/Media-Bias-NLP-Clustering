It's Thursday evening here in Washington. Here's the latest.\n\nTHE BIG STORY\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is delaying a controversial ObamaCare rule that requires restaurants to list the number of calories in the food they sell.\n\nRestaurants and grocery stores will not have to comply with the contentious new rule until after the 2016 presidential election -- at which time a Republican president could choose to scrap the rule altogether.\n\nThe controversial menu labeling requirements issued late last year would require major restaurants and grocery stores to issue calorie counts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the rules have generated bipartisan blowback on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe FDA's delay comes amid fierce pressure from Congress to back down from the rules.\n\n\"The FDA agrees additional time is necessary for the agency to provide further clarifying guidance to help facilitate efficient compliance across all covered businesses,\" FDA deputy commissioner Michael Taylor noted in a statement.\n\nThe FDA announced the delay Thursday morning. Businesses will have until Dec. 1, 2016, to comply.\n\nThe menu labeling requirements came under attack from Congress as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle called for more time for businesses to comply with the rule.\n\nLawmakers sought to delay the menu labeling requirements through a spending bill provision that would have pushed the effective date back to Dec. 1, 2016.\n\nReps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers Cathy McMorris RodgersRyan seeks to put stamp on GOP in Trump era Trump and Ryan to speak by phone Ryan not yet ready to endorse Trump MORE (R-Wash.) and Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) also introduced stand-alone legislation that would have done the same thing.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of senators led by Sens.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said she was \"dismayed\" by the FDA decision to push back the compliance date.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" DeLauro said in a statement. \"Industry is doing everything they can to stonewall implementation of this important public health tool.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, we need to make sure consumers have nutrition information available to them when making purchasing decisions,\" she added.\n\nThe food industry said it is relieved by the decision to delay the rules.\n\n\"We're encouraged that FDA's commitment will give us more time to at least garner some clarity and answers without feeling rushed to make difficult business decisions in an attempt to comply... with regulations that are unclear,\" Food Marketing Institute (FMI) President and CEO Leslie G. Sarasin said in a statement.\n\nON TAP FOR FRIDAY\n\nThe House Financial Services Housing and Insurance Subcommittee will hold a hearing on the future of housing in America and the oversight of HUD's public and Indian housing programs. http://1.usa.gov/1eKnLYr\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will hold a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Community Banking to discuss current issues affecting community banking. http://1.usa.gov/1NWLCQJ\n\nTOMORROW'S REGS TODAY\n\nThe Obama administration will publish 180 new regulations, proposed rules, notices, and other administrative actions in Friday's edition of the Federal Register.\n\nHere's what to watch for:\n\n--The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) will propose changes to pipeline safety regulations.\n\nPipeline operators would be required to notify the PHMSA of accidents and incidents in a timely fashion under the new safety requirements.
