Admit it, it’s what we’ve all been waiting for: the documentary that mocks the Ben Carson “story” Gifted Hands with a ’70s television action-adventure vibe. “Saturday Night Live” went there in a sketch starring Jay Pharoah as Carson in 1968 in Detroit.

With perfectly folded hands over his chest, Carson walks into the scene when a kid is talking about how badass he is because of his fancy gun. Carson’s girlfriend says the kid ain’t got nothin’ on her boyfriend Bennie. The sleepy-eyed Carson asks the kids “what did you say about me” in his typical monotone voice while his girlfriend freaks out about his temper. “I am hot with rage, and right now I’m about to go off. I feel like I might have to cut you,” he says very slowly as if he’s in a high school play or doing the English dubbing for an old Japanese karate film.
