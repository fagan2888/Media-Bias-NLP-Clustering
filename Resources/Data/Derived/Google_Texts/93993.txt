Kate Hudson might just be the coolest mom on the planet.

The "Bride Wars" actress uploaded a video to her Instagram account on Sunday showing her and son Ryder rapping and dancing to Fetty Wap's "Trap Queen." The 36-year-old captioned the clip, "ï»¿How we deal with airport lounge boredom... #TrapQueen #DancingWithMyBoy #HeyWhatsUpHello #WhenYourPreTeenWantsHisOwnInstagramAndYoureLikeNoooooooo." (Best. Hashtag. Ever.)

The duo get pretty into the jam, rockin' out like no one's watching. And can we just say, Ryder's got some serious swag.
