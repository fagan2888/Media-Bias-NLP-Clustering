That\u2019s something people who visit the Phoenix area for the first time will notice immediately \u2013 how incredibly different this area is from home.\n\nRokerij is connected to Richardson\u2019s, and the best way I can describe these places \u2013 and I apologize for obvious this sounds \u2013 is casual southwestern ambience. But the food is great and inexpensive. Think upscale chophouse, but with a laid-back Arizona vibe. I had a habanero-sauced sirloin that was spicy and flavorful.\n\nEron went with a Flintstones-sized ribeye steak. Unique apps like mushroom bread, great wine, and a vibe that reminded me (in a good way) of \"Three\u2019s Company\" just a little, are among the many reasons this restaurant is rocking. If you come, you\u2019ll probably see ballplayers dining, or hanging out in the basement bar, which is a big deal, because almost no restaurant in Phoenix has a basement. I\u2019ll come to to Rokerij again and again.\n\nAfter dinner, we checked out two newish bars that we\u2019d heard good things about. The huge outdoorsy Yard, which is so perfect for this climate, is an awesome addition to the Phoenix nightlife scene. The Yard pours a wide array of beers from Belgian ales all the way down to the humble beer \"in a bag\" special \u2013 just $2 but the can inside the bag is a mystery until it\u2019s served to you. And by comparison, the absolutely tiny micro bar, called the The Whining Pig, continues to show how inventive entrepreneurs are here.\n\nEven though this area is filled with strip malls, bars and restaurants find a way to make the most of them. If this bar was any smaller, there would be no room for stools. The Whining Pig boasts a wide selection of wines by the glass, and you\u2019ll find folks around the bar enjoying trivia games or maybe a cordial round or two of Rock \u2018Em Sock \u2018Em Robots.\n\nThis morning, we took our time to stroll the grounds of the amazingly tranquil Camelback Inn. The more I see here, the more I like it. We had a leisurely outdoor breakfast among other very relaxed guests, then headed back to Maryvale to meet a dog.\n\nOf course, that dog was Hank, the lovable stray everyone\u2019s talking about. The Brewers\u2019 Tyler Barnes introduced us to the little guy on his last day in Arizona; he heads to Milwaukee on Sunday. The team isn\u2019t saying which Brewers executive adopted him, and I asked Barnes why. Quite honestly, the team is being protective of the family\u2019s (and the dog\u2019s) privacy and security, and with Hank\u2019s immense fame, I can understand why. It\u2019s time for this furry little Brewers fan to have the normal family life he deserves.\n\nThis little dog really is adorable. Even though he's a recent stray, he let me pick him up and pet him while Barnes put on Hank\u2019s jersey. We took the pup to a sponsor event, where actual Brewers roamed the area. Not surprisingly, everyone\u2019s attention turned to Hank when he got near. Families posed for photos as kids cooed around him. The dog has an incredibly calm and mellow demeanor.\n\nBarnes told me the Brewers will continue to use Hank in a promotional capacity after he has time to adjust to his new home, although they won\u2019t overdo things. And that\u2019s great. After such a crazy offseason, this is an honest-to-goodness feel-good story. Hank is the real deal, fans.\n\nOn the field, Ryan Braun drew a few boos, but piped down the naysayers by continuing to tear the cover off the ball. I saw Frankie Rodriguez take the mound after his barefoot run-in with a cactus, and he looked fine, giving up one run in one inning. I\u2019m only two days in to this trip, but I\u2019ve seen a lot of bad Brewers spring training squads over the years. Regardless of the scores of these games (the Crew was clobbered by the Reds, 16-4), this team is again playing with confidence.\n\nTonight, we\u2019ll survey the Old Town Scottsdale bar scene, visiting a few old favorites like Coach House and Dos Gringos. Then tomorrow, we move to the Hotel Valley Ho and catch the Brewers at the amazing Talking Stick.\n\nIt\u2019s been a great trip so far. And much more to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When I left off last night, we were heading out to dinner, our first actual meal of this year's spring training trip.
