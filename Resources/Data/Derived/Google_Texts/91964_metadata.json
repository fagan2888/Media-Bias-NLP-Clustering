Brian, CC BY 2.0.\n\nScientists recently discovered a new virus that can be transmitted through blood transfusions, but the jury is still out on how dangerous it is. So far, the researchers claim the virus resembles both hepatitis C, a serious infection that can cause permanent liver damage, and pegivirus, which is often harmless in humans. Their findings are recorded in the journal mBio.\n\nResearchers say that the new virus, which they are calling hepegivirus-1, or HHpgV-1, should not cause alarm yet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first transfusion-associated virus that\u2019s been described in a long time,\u201d Dr. Ian Lpikin, infectious disease expert and co-author of the study, told NBC News. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it is going to be a significant cause of human hepatitis.\u201d\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t seem to be that way. \u201cSo far there is no need to be concerned,\u201d said Amit Kapoor, assistant professor at Columbia University and lead author of the study. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know if there is ongoing transmission of this virus. It may be good for you.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Lipkin noted that this new virus should not be taken as something akin to SARS, MERS, or HIV, but greater investigation into the nature of the virus must still be done.\n\nFor the research team, discovering the virus took sampling from blood decades past, which was preserved at the National Institute of Health\u2019s blood bank. The samples came from 46 participants between the years 1974 and 1980, two of which contained the virus. But, upon reviewing the two patients\u2019 medical histories, both seemed to have \u201ccleared\u201d the virus, and didn\u2019t have any resulting symptoms.\n\nAll of the 46 participants in the study had received blood transfusions to treat hemophilia. Researchers observed that those who contracted the virus seemed to get it after the transfusion.\n\nTo compare the results from this study, researchers cross referenced it with another study looking at 106 people who received transfusions during the same time period. Out of the total sample, two contracted the virus, and one of them seemed to have it in their system for as long as five years. Both eventually cleared the virus, too.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know how many viruses are transmitted through the blood supply,\u201d said Kapoor. \u201cThere are so many viruses out there, and they need to be characterized in order to ensure that transfusions are safe.\u201d\n\nThough hemophilia used to commonly be treated with human blood products, more recent methods involve genetically engineered products to steer clear of potentially unidentified viruses. But, blood transfusions are still a frequent occurrence in U.S. hospitals. As a result, the researchers suggest we make a vigilant effort to identify any possible viruses transmitted through blood that could be dangerous to human health.\n\n\u201cMore than 30 million blood components are transfused annually in the United States alone,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cSurveillance for infectious agents in the blood supply is key to ensuring the safety of this critical resource for medicine and public health.\u201d\n\nSource: Kapoor A, Kumar A, Simmonds P, et al.
