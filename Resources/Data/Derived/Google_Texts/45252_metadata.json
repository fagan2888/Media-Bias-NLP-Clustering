Marco Rubio (R-Texas) places fourth with 10 percent.\n\nThe last iteration of the poll, released Oct. 25, showed Carson with 28 percent support in the state, beating Trump out by 9 points, and Cruz with 10 percent support.\n\nCruz has been aggressively campaigning in the Hawkeye State, picking up key endorsements in the state earlier this week.\n\nFueling the anti-establishment firebrand\u2019s 22-point ascent is his support among traditional Christian voters in the state.\n\nHe carries 45 percent of the evangelical vote in the state, as well as 39 percent of self-described tea partiers.\n\nTwenty percent of all voters also listed Cruz as their second choice in the poll, suggesting he has a lot of untapped support and may not have peaked in the state.\n\nPollster Frank Luntz told the Register that it\u2019s possible that Cruz \u201ccould win Iowa big \u2013 very big.\u201d\n\nAs he watched his lead slip away in the state, Trump made a series of blunders that may have hastened Cruz\u2019s rise.\n\nThe businessman attacked the Register the day before the influential newspaper released the poll, accusing the news outlet of dishonestly covering his presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cYou have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Des Moines on Friday. \u201cThe Des Moines Register is the worst. They\u2019re very dishonest.\u201d\n\nHe predicted he would not fare well in the poll, lamenting that \u201cevery time the Des Moines Register does a poll, I always do badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my opinion that they don\u2019t do it properly,\u201d he added, suggesting the newspaper may be skewing its results.\n\nAs the poll was being released Saturday, Trump told his followers on Twitter not to trust it, pointing to a different poll that showed him up by double digits in Iowa.\n\nNew CNN Iowa poll --- Trump 33, Cruz 20. Everyone else way down! Don't trust Des Moines Register poll- biased towards Trump! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2015\n\nTrump still polls well in the state on issues like the economy, illegal immigration and solving problems.\n\nForty-nine percent said they believe Trump knows how to \u201cget things done,\u201d while only 22 percent said the same of Cruz.\n\nCarson led in the poll as recently as Oct. 23, when he carried 28 percent support in the state.\n\nBut amid terrorist attacks and the escalating fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the soft-spoken Carson has struggled to convince voters that he\u2019s the best man to lead the nation during a time of war.\n\nThe poll of 400 likely Republican caucus-goers was conducted Dec. 7\u201310. The margin of error is 4.9 percent.\n\n- Updated at 6:45 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Texas Republican has 31 percent support, with Donald Trump in second at 21 percent.", "description": "The Texas Republican has 31 percent support, with Donald Trump in second at 21 percent.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Texas Republican has 31 percent support, with Donald Trump in second at 21 percent.", "title": "Cruz surges to 10-point lead in Iowa poll", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/263060-iowa-poll-ted-cruz-donald-trump-ben-carson", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/cruzted_082215getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-12T19:45:55-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/263060-iowa-poll-ted-cruz-donald-trump-ben-carson", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Texas Republican has 31 percent support, with Donald Trump in second at 21 percent.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cruz surges to 10-point lead in Iowa poll"}, "dcterms.modified": "2015-12-12T19:45-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/263060-iowa-poll-ted-cruz-donald-trump-ben-carson", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-12T17:57-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "author": "Bradford Richardson", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-12T17:57:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-12T19:45:55-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Cruz surges to 10-point lead in Iowa poll"}, "article_summary": "New CNN Iowa poll --- Trump 33, Cruz 20.\nDon't trust Des Moines Register poll- biased towards Trump!\n\u201cThe Des Moines Register is the worst.\nThe last iteration of the poll, released Oct. 25, showed Carson with 28 percent support in the state, beating Trump out by 9 points, and Cruz with 10 percent support.\n\u201cYou have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Des Moines on Friday."}
