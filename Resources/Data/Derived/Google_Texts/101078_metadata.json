So, the closest thing to a \u201crisk-free\u201d investment you\u2019re going to find is healthcare stock.\n\nOn the surface, it makes sense. It\u2019s a lot easier to project demand for healthcare than, say, iPhones or Cadillacs, and the demographic trends are certainly in your favor. I can safely say that demand for medical services will increase every year for the foreseeable future.\n\nThere\u2019s just one big problem.\n\nAll the demographic tailwinds in the world won\u2019t make a bit of difference if your profits get regulated away by the government, and healthcare stocks are particularly at risk of that.\n\nVulnerability in Healthcare Stocks\n\nSure, \u201cObamacare\u201d has allowed plenty of previously uninsured Americans to get access to reasonably affordable healthcare. That was a major boon to health insurance stocks like Aetna (AET) and UnitedHealth (UNH), both of which are up more than 70% over the past two years. Big Pharma stocks have had a great run as well.\n\nBut remember, Medicare is the primary payer for most Americans ages 65 and older. And Medicare can \u2014 and does \u2014 pick and choose what it wants to pay for and how much it wants to pay. That can throw a really big wrench into your business plans.\n\nAs a case in point, consider home nursing provider Almost Family (AFAM), a stock I have traded in the past. Almost Family gets about 90% of its revenues from Medicare, and the healthcare reforms that went into effect during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term were so damaging to the company\u2019s business that they dedicated an entire webpage to it. For years, AFAM\u2019s stock price surged or crashed based on news (or even rumors) of policy changes by Medicare.\n\nNot all healthcare stocks are that dependent on Medicare, of course. But to some extent or another, nearly every stock in the sector faces pretty stiff risks from either excessive regulation or repayment uncertainty.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want my investment returns held at the mercy of the U.S. government.\n\nPlaying It Safe in Healthcare REITs\n\nThe good news is that there are plenty of ways to play the boom in the healthcare sector while almost entirely avoiding these risks. And one of my favorites is via healthcare real estate investment trusts.\n\nHealth services require specialized facilities, so the aging of America will give us a raging bull market in medical real estate. A doctor may have his take-home pay pinched by higher taxes and stingier reimbursement, but he\u2019s still going to pay his rent, and we can profit by acting as the landlord.\n\nOne of the bluest of blue chips in the healthcare REIT space is Ventas (VTR). Ventas just dumped most of its Medicare reimbursement risk with the recent spinoff of its skilled nursing facilities to Care Capital Properties (CCP). Ventas\u2019 portfolio is now concentrated in private-pay senior housing, medical office buildings and specialty hospitals.\n\nVentas has grown its dividend at a compound annual rate of 7.45% over the past 10 years, and at current prices, it sports a yield of 5.2%. If Ventas is able to keep up that blistering dividend growth rate, you\u2019d be looking at a yield on cost of more than 7% in five years.\n\nNot too shabby.\n\nAs another example, take Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH). Senior Housing has really worked hard to divest itself of properties with Medicare reimbursement risk, and today the bulk of its portfolio is in medical office buildings and independent-living/assisted-living facilities. Only about 3% of the portfolio is invested in nursing homes.\n\nSenior Housing has been slower to raise its dividend in recent years, as it has paid out 39 cents per quarter for the past three years. But at today\u2019s prices, you\u2019re still getting a 9.8% yield. Even if Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen does an abrupt about-face and decides to raise rates aggressively, that\u2019s a competitive payout.\n\nAnd finally, we get to Healthcare REIT (HCN), one of the largest healthcare REITs by market cap.\n\nHCN gets the vast majority of its revenues from senior housing and skilled nursing facilities. But Healthcare REIT also proudly discloses that fully 87% of its portfolio is leased to private-pay clients.\n\nHCN currently yields 4.9%, and this healthcare REIT has raised its dividend at a comfortable 3.08% rate over the past five years.\n\nCharles Lewis Sizemore, CFA, is the chief investment officer of investment firm Sizemore Capital Management.
