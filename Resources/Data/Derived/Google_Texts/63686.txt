It’s hard to enjoy your golden years when you’re battling health problems or struggling to pay medical bills.

More than 80 percent of retirees recently surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that health was the most important ingredient for a happy retirement, compared to less than 60 percent who said financial security was most important. That survey also cited health care costs as retirees’ greatest financial concern, regardless of their level of wealth.

A report issued this year by the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that average out-of-pocket, recurring medical expenses for retirees are around $1,855 a year, not including hospital stays or nursing home care. That means the average 65-year-old retiree needs to have at least $40,000 saved just to cover those expenses.
