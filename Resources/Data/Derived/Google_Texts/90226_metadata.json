Clinton returned last year to argue the importance of public policy in a defense of Obamacare. There is no word yet on what Clinton is set to talk about tomorrow but it\u2019s unlikely that he goes to bat for his wife\u2019s presidential campaign \u2013 yet. He told Town & Country that his role \u201cshould primarily be as a backstage adviser\u201d until the end of the campaign.\n\nClinton gave a series of talks at Georgetown University in 1991, as well, as he ramped up his own presidential campaign. In those three lectures, Clinton laid out a \u201cNew Covenant\u201d on community, the economy and American security.\n\nIn a bit of happenstance, Clinton\u2019s former foreign policy ally, ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair will speak at Georgetown on Thursday, April 23, on \u201cThe Global Future of Development.\u201d The university wrote online that his speech continues \"a semester-long conversation\" on the topic convened by the school's new Global Futures Initiative, which invites world leaders in the public sector, business, and civil society to engage with the university community around critical issues.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "ugP87rLrMjrBYBz9rCcVsjWtHPbxwO_sPTuJFJaAP8M"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf272\"", "article_summary": "Former President (and potential first \"first gentleman\") Bill Clinton will speak at Georgetown University Tuesday, April 21, in the third of four lectures he plans to give at the Jesuit institution.\nClinton gave a series of talks at Georgetown University in 1991, as well, as he ramped up his own presidential campaign.\nIn those three lectures, Clinton laid out a \u201cNew Covenant\u201d on community, the economy and American security.\nClinton returned last year to argue the importance of public policy in a defense of Obamacare.\nThere is no word yet on what Clinton is set to talk about tomorrow but it\u2019s unlikely that he goes to bat for his wife\u2019s presidential campaign \u2013 yet."}
