Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler said he will not appeal the ruling.\n\nThousands of Washington\u2019s small businesses can feel confident their health-insurance coverage is here to stay, thanks to a decision issued Wednesday by a judge with the Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC).\n\nThe decision affects plans sold through health-insurance trusts and associations that state Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler had rejected as unfairly and illegally priced. The judge ruled there were no state or federal laws to support Kreidler\u2019s opinion.\n\nPeople covered by these plans \u201cshould have peace of mind today,\u201d said Jonathan Hensley, president of Capital Benefit Services, which manages the program for three trusts that brought the legal challenge.\n\nThe trusts provide insurance for 65,000 people and 1,600 businesses affiliated with the Master Builders Association of King and Snohomish Counties, Building Industry Association of Washington Health Insurance Trust and Northwest Marine Trade Association.\n\nThe decision was issued by George Finkle, an OIC administrative-law judge.\n\n\u201cWhile I am disappointed with the ruling, I will not appeal it,\u201d Kreidler said in a statement. \u201cMy office took action based on our interpretation of the federal Affordable Care Act. We believed that federal law required my office to disapprove rates that were not fair to individuals and employers.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, most small businesses that cover their employees purchase insurance through associations and trusts, which historically have offered better prices than the open market.\n\nKreidler has accused these groups of \u201ccherry-picking\u201d the healthiest, cheapest-to-insure workers and driving out businesses with sicker employees. He claims that some of the plans also charge much higher rates for older employees and women.\n\n\u201cI remain deeply concerned about the impact of this ruling on how rates are set for small businesses within associations. My office will remain vigilant in its review of all health-care plans,\u201d Kreidler said.\n\nRepresentatives of associations and trusts reject Kreidler\u2019s characterization of their field.\n\n\u201cIf we were being unfair, why do 90-plus percent of companies renew with us? They have choice,\u201d said Hensley. \u201cIt\u2019s good when you have more options, and the competition is good.\u201d\n\nTwenty years ago, the Legislature passed laws allowing employers with 50 or fewer workers to buy \u201clarge group\u201d insurance through associations and trusts. It meant they didn\u2019t have to follow small-group rules and allowed price variation from employer to employer.\n\nNow there are more than 60 association and trust plans in the state covering hundreds of thousands of workers.\n\nAfter passage of the Affordable Care Act, the OIC asserted it had the legal authority to regulate the trusts in two regards. First, the trust needed to be \u201cbona fide,\u201d which meant it did more than simply sell insurance, and its members needed to belong to the same field, such as technology or farming.\n\nSecond, they needed to price their plans in compliance with specific rules. The OIC claimed the prices could vary by age and geography, but not between businesses.\n\nIn reviewing 2014 insurance plans, the OIC ruled that only 11 trust plans were operating legally, while 23 failed the price test and 19 failed for pricing and their bona fide status. Nine trust plans are still being reviewed.\n\n\u201cWe have lost business because of the uncertainty and the fear of loss of coverage that was created,\u201d said Jerry Belur, chief executive of EPK & Associates in Bellevue, which administers the Master Builders Association Health Insurance Trust. \u201cWe\u2019re very thankful to those companies that have hung with us.\u201d\n\nThe OIC will again review the plans disapproved because of their prices, and expects to approve them based on the new ruling, said OIC spokesman Steve Valandra. The judge\u2019s decision didn\u2019t resolve questions over bona fide status, so those trusts will still need to take action to comply with the law.\n\nThe three trusts involved in the case had already been approved as operating legally, but were rejected over their prices.\n\nTrusts and associations still have pending legal action against the OIC on the question of their bona fide status.\n\nJeff Gingold, an attorney representing association health plans including those offered by the Association of Washington Business, which are still under review, expects the groups to ultimately prevail.\n\n\u201cCommissioner Kreidler is as wrong in what he is doing on that issue [of bona fide status] as he was on the rating issue,\u201d Gingold said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely wrong.\u201d\n\nFinkle did affirm the OIC\u2019s authority to review the association and trust plans. So should the Legislature or federal government issue new rules about pricing, the OIC could apply them. Valandra said there are no plans to ask state lawmakers to make changes.\n\n\u201cIt is now up to the federal government to clarify this intersection of state and federal law,\u201d said Kreidler.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ruling came in a case in which the Office of the Insurance Commissioner had rejected plans of three trusts over price issues.
