Pharrell gave a rendition of his Grammy-winning track “Happy” at the ceremony tonight, paying paid tribute to the #BlackLivesMatter movement when he and and his backup dancers, clad in black hoodies, threw up their hands in the iconic “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture.

While the hoodies make sense, we are still struggling to comprehend how Pharrell’s outfit choice fits in with the political statement. Part of a grassroots “Grand Budapest Hotel” Oscar campaign, maybe?

At least he ditched the Arby’s hat.
