It’s clear that American tech companies are pushing their respective cloud services abroad as fast as possible at a time when suspicion of American tech companies abroad is growing thanks to the never-ending Edward Snowden revelations.

This poses an interesting problem both for those companies and the U.S. government that appears bent on being able to unencrypt the best encryption those companies (or anyone else for that matter) brings to bear.

We know that US tech companies feel that news of NSA snooping is hurting their prospects both at home and abroad. We also know the government thinks it needs to protect us.

The new Beijing-based AWS region sounds a lot like that.
