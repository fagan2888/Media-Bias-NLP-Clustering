Mark Pryor campaigns in El Dorado, Ark. (Michael Orrell/El Dorado News-Times via AP)\n\nThe following is a guest post by Brian Arbour. Arbour is an associate professor of political science at John Jay College at the City University of New York. He also serves as a member of the Decision Team for Fox News Channel.\n\nThe Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) campaign shook up their race against US. Rep. Tom Cotton by releasing an ad last week that focused on Pryor\u2019s vote in favor of Obamacare. Commentators from across the political spectrum have examined the Pryor ad for what it says about the shifting and more favorable political situation of Obamacare in 2014.\n\nThe embrace of a provision of Obamacare by an embattled Democratic incumbent running in a red state is certainly new and noteworthy. But the rhetorical strategy of the ad is tried and true.\n\nIn the ad, Pryor never discusses what he plans to do in the Senate in the next six years. Instead, he focuses exclusively on what he has done in the past. In the ad, Mark and his father David (who served as both governor and senator from Arkansas) discuss Mark\u2019s battle with cancer and his insurance company, and his support for \u201ca law that prevents insurance companies from canceling your policy if you get sick, or deny coverage for preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\nThe ad tells us something about Pryor and what he has done, but never tells us about what he is going to do if reelected.\n\nIn my book \u201cCandidate-Centered Campaigns: Political Messages, Winning Personalities, and Personal Appeals,\u201dI show that ads like Pryor\u2019s are quite common. I find that 85 percent of candidate-sponsored ads feature what I call candidate-centered appeals \u2014 messages that focus on the past actions or experiences of a candidate, rather than his or her policy ideas and plans. Candidate-centered appeals include not just biographical information (like the discussion of Pryor\u2019s cancer diagnosis), but also the past actions of a candidate in the private sector or in public service (like Pryor\u2019s vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act).\n\nWhy do political campaigns choose to use candidate-centered appeals so frequently? They do so in an effort to enhance the credibility and likability of their candidate. I interviewed political consultants, and find that consultants, whether they are Democrats and Republicans, and regardless of whether they are locally, state, or nationally based, all believe that voters are highly skeptical of the claims made by politicians. To overcome this skepticism, these consultants want to use stories about their candidates to show voters \u201cwho the candidate is.\u201d These stories are designed to demonstrate what the candidate has in common with voters and to provide evidence of a candidate\u2019s political beliefs.\n\nThe Pryor ad shows a classic demonstration of this strategy. The Pryors discuss Mark\u2019s cancer diagnosis in an effort to show a little of his humanity and to make him not seem like a typical politician. Then the ad pivots to politics and shows how Mark\u2019s cancer diagnosis is related to his vote for a ban on insurance exclusions for preexisting conditions.\n\nCampaigns use candidate-centered appeals more frequently early. They do this because they need to first establish their candidate\u2019s credibility before they can move on to future-based policy appeals.\n\nWhat do I mean by early? One way is early in an advertisement. The chart show the percentage of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. phrases in an ad that feature a candidate-centered appeals (data are from general election campaign sponsored ads from U.S. House and Senate candidates in 2004). The use of candidate-centered appeals rises quickly and is used in a majority of time in the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th phrase of an advertisement. The use of candidate-centered appeals drops off gradually across the rest of the phrases.\n\n\n\nData and coding calculated by author using data from the Wisconsin Advertising Project.

This figure shows a seven-day moving average of the percentage of advertisements aired that featured a candidate-centered appeal about the sponsoring candidate in September and October 2004. Campaigns talk about their candidate\u2019s background, biography, and record a great deal early in the fall campaign season; more than 80 percent of advertisements aired in the week after Labor Day use candidate-centered appeals about their own candidate. These appeals taper off across the rest of the campaign as campaigns air more policy-based and negative advertisements. This pattern is evidence of the importance of candidate-centered information in developing a candidate\u2019s credibility and likeability with voters.\n\n\n\nData and coding calculated by author using data from the Wisconsin Advertising Project.

Image courtesy Palgrave Macmillan.\n\nPryor\u2019s ad does break new ground in the politics of Obamacare, and whether other embattled Democrats follow him in making pro-Obamacare appeals is very much in doubt. What is not in doubt is that others will follow Pryor in making appeals that focus on the background, biography, and political record of the candidate.
