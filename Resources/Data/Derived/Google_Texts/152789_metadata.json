The federal exchange could not have incorporated the state subsidies.\n\nSince the spring, the Connector had been following a \u201cdual track\u201d \u2014 working with hCentive, a Virginia company, to develop its own software while simultaneously preparing to join the federal website if that first option failed. Now, the state has halted preparations for HealthCare.gov.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s test, hCentive demonstrated that its software could handle the application process for complex family situations, and communicate with health insurers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, Cohen added, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe a sigh of relief right now. Nobody can.\u201d He said any technology project can encounter problems leading to delays \u2014 but this one has a firm start date of Nov. 15. Starting on that date, he expects 450,000 people to enroll in insurance plans that take effect Jan. 1.\n\nAs Cohen described it, the software will enable consumers to enter their personal information and find a menu of options, displaying prices that take into account state and federal subsidies. The consumer will choose a plan, and that information will be sent to the selected insurance company, which will send a bill in the mail within three to five days. Once the bill is paid, the consumer will receive an insurance card in the mail.\n\nIf the prospective enrollee appears to be eligible for MassHealth, the state Medicaid program for low-income people, that person\u2019s information will be transferred electronically to MassHealth. If MassHealth confirms eligibility \u2014 a process that could take as long as a day \u2014 the person will be notified by mail that he or she has been enrolled in MassHealth, Cohen said. If not, the person would be advised to return to the Connector website and sign up for a private health plan.\n\nAsked about the decision to stick with a state-based exchange, Amy Whitcomb Slemmer, executive director of Health Care for All, a consumer advocacy group, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we had really good news, and this is really good news. It\u2019s going to be so much easier for people.\u201d Slemmer said that Health Care for All expects to renew its contract with the state to provide outreach and enrollment help for the Connector.\n\n\u201cThis open enrollment season is going to require all hands on deck,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Connector decision was greeted with skepticism from the political right. Charlie Baker, Republican candidate for governor, said in a statement that when state officials launched the site last year they knew it wasn\u2019t ready. He called for greater transparency this time, urging the Connector Board to \u201cprove every aspect of the new site is ready to go before launching.\u201d\n\nJoshua Archambault, a senior fellow at the Pioneer Institute, a Boston public policy think tank, pointed out that there is \u201cno final cost estimate for the rebuild, no clear understanding of what the federal government will pay for, and no Plan B if they fail again.\u201d\n\nSince 2006, the Connector had served people buying health insurance on their own and a few small businesses. But the program needed a major upgrade to comply with the federal Affordable Care Act, and the new computer system, made by CGI, crashed right out of the gate last October. Consumers seeking to sign up for coverage were never able to determine whether they were eligible for subsidies or Medicaid.\n\nTo ensure people kept insurance coverage, the state extended the Commonwealth Care program of state-subsidized coverage, which was supposed to end last year, and also enrolled people who might qualify for assistance in a temporary MassHealth program. Both these programs, with nearly 100,000 in Commonwealth Care and 250,000 in temporary MassHealth, end on Dec. 31, and transitioning people to new coverage is expected to pose major challenges.\n\nThe state plans an education campaign to let people know they must submit new applications and to urge them to start early, Cohen said. The system is being tested to ensure it can handle large numbers of users at once.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.528357386", "eomportal-id": 685205, "description": "Massachusetts will run its own health insurance exchange and won\u2019t need to join the federal Healthcare.gov website, state officials announced Friday.
