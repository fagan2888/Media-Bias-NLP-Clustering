Martin\n\nStaff Attorney\n\nPacific Legal Foundation - Atlantic Center\n\ncmm@pacificlegal.org\n\n(561) 691-5000\n\n\n\nM. Reed Hopper\n\nPrincipal Attorney\n\nPacific Legal Foundation\n\nmrh@pacificlegal.org\n\n(360) 279-0937\n\nPLF statement on federal manatee announcement\n\n\n\nPALM BEACH GARDENS, FL; January 7, 2016: After being prodded by formal petitioning and litigation from Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) today issued a proposed rule calling for the reclassifying of the manatee from \u201cendangered\u201d to \u201cthreatened.\u201d With this announcement, the FWS \u2014 after a delay of eight years \u2014 has finally moved to bring the classification of the manatee into line with its own scientific findings.\n\nPLF Attorney Christina Martin issued this statement regarding today\u2019s announcement:\n\n\u201cThe good news is that the manatee population is increasing and federal officials are finally acknowledging this fact,\u201d said PLF Attorney Christina Martin, based in PLF\u2019s Atlantic Center office in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. \u201cThe bad news is that federal officials took so long to accept the good news about the manatee\u2019s improvement. It has taken eight years and two lawsuits to get federal officials to follow up on their own experts\u2019 recommendation to reclassify the manatee. Over that time, the manatee population has grown substantially, while federal officials have been sitting on their hands. We are glad to see that the manatee is doing well, but all taxpayers should demand that the government do much better, going forward, in following the requirements of the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is also important to remember that the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s action is only a proposed rule,\u201d Martin continued. \u201cThe agency now has 12 months to either adopt the proposed rule or to explain why it won\u2019t do so. Hopefully, these officials won\u2019t have to be sued again to be forced to do their job and give the manatee the proper classification that their own studies call for.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn seeking reclassification of the manatee, PLF attorneys represent Save Crystal River, Inc., a nonprofit organization of residents from Crystal River in Citrus County, Florida, who advocate for property rights and a quality of life that preserves the proper balance between nature and human activity. As with all its clients, PLF represents Save Crystal River free of charge.\n\n\n\nPLF\u2019s lawsuit to force the agency to comply with the law and issue a decision on manatee reclassification, is titled, Save Crystal River, Inc. v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nAbout Pacific Legal Foundation\n\nDonor-supported Pacific Legal Foundation is a nonprofit public interest watchdog organization that litigates for limited government, property rights, and a balanced approach to environmental regulation, in courts across the country.
