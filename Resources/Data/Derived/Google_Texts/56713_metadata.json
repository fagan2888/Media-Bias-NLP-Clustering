She vowed that no one making less than $250,000 a year would be stung with higher taxes.\n\nRelated: Clinton\u2019s Campaign Promises Total Nearly $1 Trillion \u2013 With More to Come\n\nIn contrast to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 call for as much as $18 trillion of new spending over the coming decade for a raft of domestic programs financed through steep tax hikes on upper-income Americans, Clinton has been selling her approach as pragmatic and fully paid for down the road.\n\nBut a new analysis of her tax plans by the non-partisan Tax Foundation released Tuesday raised perplexing questions about how she actually intends to pay for her domestic agenda, whether wealthier Americans have anything to fear from her tax proposals and whether her approach will be good for the U.S. economy.\n\nHer tax plan includes an increase in the marginal tax rates for Americans with incomes over $5 million a year, a new 30 percent minimum tax along the lines proposed by billionaire Warren Buffet, and returning the estate tax to its higher 2009 levels.\n\nRelated: Experts Predict Rising Deficits and Debt in GOP Candidates\u2019 Tax Plans\n\nAccording to the Tax Foundation analysis:\n\nThe plan would increase federal tax revenues by $498 billion over the coming decade on a \u201cstatic basis,\u201d meaning taking the least optimistic view of long-term revenue growth. That doesn\u2019t amount to even half of what she wants to spend.\n\nBut if the economy begins to lose steam, Clinton\u2019s plan would end up raising just $191 billion over the next 10 years. That means there would be just a fraction of the new revenue she would need to cover the cost of her domestic initiatives.\n\nThe lion\u2019s share of the additional tax revenues would come from capping itemized deductions as part of the \u201cBuffet Rule\u201d and imposing a 4 percent surtax on taxpayers making more than $5 million annually.\n\nClinton\u2019s ideas for rewriting the long-term capital gains rates would actually reduce revenues because it would increase the incentive to postpone selling off assets.\n\nRelated: Clinton Wants $275 Billion for Infrastructure, but How Will She Pay for It?\n\nIt\u2019s always difficult to assemble a major fiscal package because of all the variables that go into it, the seat of the pants revenue estimates and shifting budget baselines. And for sure, Clinton\u2019s proposals will need a lot of tweaking and refinement.\n\nMoreover, the Tax Foundation analysis didn\u2019t consider Clinton\u2019s proposed tax credits for caregivers and others, nor did it count a proposed new tax on high frequency trading.\n\nBut the more troubling implications of the Tax Foundation analysis is that Clinton\u2019s proposals, as currently written may hurt the economy while only nicking the incomes of wealthier Americans compared to the rest of the taxpayers.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts Would Add $24.5 Trillion to the Debt\n\nIf enacted as drafted, Clinton\u2019s tax plan would reduce Gross Domestic Product by 1 percent over the long term because of \u201cslightly higher marginal tax rates on capital and labor.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Tax Foundation\u2019s economic model, the plan would lead to a 0.8 percent reduction in wages, a 2.8 percent smaller capital stock and 311,000 fewer \u201cfull-time equivalent jobs.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, on a static basis, Clinton\u2019s tax plan would lead to just a 0.7 percent reduction in after tax income for the top 10 percent of taxpayers and a 1.7 percent lower after-tax income for the top 1 percent of taxpayers \u2013 the very income groups that Sanders has vowed to soak.\n\nWhen taking into account the projected reduction in GDP, after-tax income for just about all taxpayers would decline by at least 0.9 percent.\n\n\u201cIf enacted, her tax policies would result in a reduction in the size of the U.S. economy in the long run,\u201d the study concluded. \u201cThis would decrease the revenue that the new tax policies would ultimately collect. The plan would lead to lower after-tax incomes for taxpayers at all income levels, but especially for taxpayers at the top.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s fiscal policies are premised on a commitment to roughly $1 tr", "title": "Study Challenges Clinton\u2019s Tax Plan for $1 Trillion in New Spending", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/27/Study-Challenges-Clinton-s-Tax-Plan-1-Trillion-New-Spending", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-clinton_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/27/Study-Challenges-Clinton-s-Tax-Plan-1-Trillion-New-Spending", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-clinton_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s fiscal policies are premised on a commitment to roughly $1 tr", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Moreover, the Tax Foundation analysis didn\u2019t consider Clinton\u2019s proposed tax credits for caregivers and others, nor did it count a proposed new tax on high frequency trading.\nBut if the economy begins to lose steam, Clinton\u2019s plan would end up raising just $191 billion over the next 10 years.\nHer tax plan includes an increase in the marginal tax rates for Americans with incomes over $5 million a year, a new 30 percent minimum tax along the lines proposed by billionaire Warren Buffet, and returning the estate tax to its higher 2009 levels.\nLike many of her Democratic and Republican rivals in the 2016 presidential campaign, the former Secretary of State\u2019s budget and tax proposals are still a work in progress.\nAnd for sure, Clinton\u2019s proposals will need a lot of tweaking and refinement."}
