Delmont, SD

The tornado displaced more than 40 families from their homes.

But what happens when your family of nearly 100 loses the only home its known for more than a century? That's the challenge now facing the congregation of Zion Lutheran church in Delmont.

Emmaus Lutheran in Tripp sees a bigger attendance than usual this Sunday, one week after a tornado destroyed its sister church, Zion Lutheran, in Delmont.

Brian Bucklew is pastor to both congregations and was out of town when the tornado struck.

"I was speechless at first," Pastor Bucklew said.

With the normal scripture, service, songs, and roof over their head, it's something of a return to normal; But some things can never be the same.

"My wife and I had just left the church, and we faced the tornado. It was coming to town," Zion Lutheran Church member Jim Kaufman said.

Tad and Jim Kaufman are fourth-generation members with a direct line to the church's founding. Their grandfather was among the church's first members and helped to lay the cornerstone. This week, they helped to remove that same stone.

It may find a new home...

Jim Kaufman: "The cornerstone is at my farm right now. It'll be waiting for a new building"

Tad Kaufman: "We'll incorporate it somehow."

Jim Kaufman: "We'll put it someplace to remember the old church."

...but the rest of the church will be burned.

Synod officials will officially decommission the building during a short service Monday morning. Then, with the help of the Delmont Fire Department, the ruins of Zion Lutheran will go up in flames.

"We sign a hymn, 'We Give Thee But Thine Own,' so I guess that's a way to give it back," Pastor Bucklew said.

Zion Lutheran's life as a church is over, but the congregation survives by their faith.

"These things are hard to accept - losing the building and what not - but they also strengthen our faith as we look to those things not seen, to those things unseen," Pastor Bucklew said.

It's not hard to see the strength these people have.

Pastor Bucklew says Emmaus Lutheran in Tripp will continue to host the congregation of Zion Lutheran for up to six weeks, while they hold meetings to discuss their next move.
