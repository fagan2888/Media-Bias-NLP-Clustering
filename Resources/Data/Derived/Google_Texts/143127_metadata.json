Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, ex-Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, real estate mogul Donald Trump, brain surgeon Ben Carson, ex-Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and others\u2014said America\u2019s future depends on returning to a past before big government, but never big business, was public enemy number one, and when American military might made dictators and terrorists cower.\n\nIt was equal parts a right-wing talent and freak show, where anything that could be called liberal was derided as weak, morally loose, indecisive, coddling and a failure. Federal government and union-represented public schools are scourges and the source of the major problems that Americans face, they said repeatedly, adding that only the GOP could give working people the tools needed to finally prosper. That agenda includes sealing the borders, dismantling Obamacare, shutting government agencies, cutting taxes and red tape for small business, gutting unions, privatizing schools, protecting Christian liberty and traditional marriage, and using the military.\n\n\u201cToday is the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill\u2019s passing,\u201d Cruz said in one rant. \u201cChurchill stood as a lion in winter. A voice against the darkness that was sweeping the globe. And I\u2019ll tell you 50 years later that we are facing threats every bit as ominous.\u201d\n\nSpeaking just days before the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, Cruz once again displayed why he is arguably the Senate\u2019s biggest demagogue since Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Nothing in the world today\u2014including the horror in Syria\u2014matches the slaughter of WWII. But Cruz, like the others speaking in Iowa, is being given an outsized podium and microphone by the libertartian Koch brothers, whose network co-sponsored the event and also announced it would spend nearly $900 million in the 2016 election, guaranteeing that ultra-right-wing views will bombard the airwaves.\n\nThe mainstream media\u2014like NPR\u2019s coverage of the summit\u2014tends to give each possible candidate the benefit of the doubt, portraying each as a good guy or gal with no prior record that needs to be brought up at this stage of the process. So let\u2019s go through thumbnail sketches of those we are going to be hearing a lot from in coming months, especially as the Koch party tries to push the political center to the far right.\n\n1. Scott Walker: The Thug\n\nWalker was pronounced the event\u2019s winner, if you will, by mainstream media. That\u2019s really not a shocker, because he told everyone he is a preacher\u2019s son who grew up in Iowa until the third grade, learned most of what he needed to know about life from that small town experience, and felt the power of people\u2019s prayers as he and a GOP majority legislature went after the public employee unions in Wisconsin. \u201cWe weren\u2019t afraid to go big and go bold,\u201d he said, getting sympathetic nods as he recounted how he ignored 100,000 protesters and his family suffered death threats. Walker also bragged about loosening gun controls to allow concealed weapons, policing the polls with stricter voter ID laws, and cutting state spending. Walker\u2019s evangelical values, anti-union crusade (excluding police and firefighters) and imperial management style telegraphed that a conservative son of a small Iowa town could become the ruler of a bigger blue state. After his speech, he flew to California to attend a Koch donor retreat, and by the weekend\u2019s close he announced he was forming a presidential campaign committee.\n\n2. Ted Cruz: The Demagogue\n\nThere is no Republican in national office who throws rhetorical barbs like Cruz and enjoys watching the sting of his words. Cruz, another preacher\u2019s son whose rise in politics followed his willingness to incite fights for right-wing causes, threw chunks of red meat, endearing him to the Tea Partiers. \u201cOur rights are from God, not government,\u201d he said, adding the \u201cConstitution binds the mischief of government.\u201d He said federal government was filled with \u201csenseless obstacles,\u201d and called for dismantling the IRS (reassigning its 110,000 employees to guard the Mexican border), getting rid of \u201clocusts\u201d at the Environmental Protection Agency, repealing \u201cevery word\u201d of Obamacare, and replacing the federal income tax with a flat tax rate (which benefits the rich and hurts the poor). Cruz repeatedly recited what may become his mantra, if he runs: \u201cShow me where you have stood up and fought.\u201d He said only true conservatives could \u201creignite the miracle of America,\u201d saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re a single mom waiting tables, you can do anything.\u201d He said the key to a 2016 victory was \u201creassembling the Reagan coalition\u201d of evangelicals, libertarians, blue-collar democrats, women and youth.\n\n3. Chris Christie: The Combatant\n\nEast coasters probably would not have recognized the deferential and solicitous man who introduced himself to Iowans as a pro-life, conservative, successful blue-state governor just re-elected with significant black and brown voter backing. The New Jersey governor did not present himself as the over-confident, bullying, self-satisfied politician he is locally known to be. He explained that his reputation for brashness comes from his Irish father and Italian mother who taught him to clear the air in life. Christie said the rich are doing fine, \u201cbut the promise of America is shrinking,\u201d \u201cthe anxiety is still there,\u201d and the \u201cunder-represented need our help.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat we need in America is a leader who we really know,\u201d alluding to an opacity around President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Above all, Christie said he has never pretended to be anything but a conservative, and that forthrightness with the public is the key to winning blue states. By the time Christie finished his speech, the stone-faced audience was strongly clapping.\n\n4. Carly Fiorina: The Taskmaster\n\nKarl Rove, speaking on Fox News, said that the ex-Hewlett-Packard CEO, who lost a 2010 U.S. Senate race to California\u2019s Barbara Boxer, gave the best speech after Walker. Fiorina began with an anecdote about her mother teaching Sunday school, who gave her and the other students a plaque reading, \"What you are is God\u2019s gift to you and what you make of yourself is your gift to God.\" She said she didn\u2019t feel very gifted but learned what it was to work, get an education, become an entrepreneur, and raise a family. \u201cI have traveled all over the world and it is only in the United States of America that a young woman can start as a secretary and become the chief executive officer of the largest technology company in the world,\u201d she said. That promise is imperiled, Fiorina said, by weak politicans, especially President Obama and Hillary Clinton, who approach crises as managers, making do, instead of real leaders who \u201ccreate possibilities\u201d and bring others along.\n\nFiorina said it was small business, not corporations, that are hurt by excessive government. She derided Obama as a liberal hypocrite, calling for equal pay for equal work for women but not changing the seniority system, \u201cwhich is in place in every federal government bureaucracy and every union: the seniority system, which does not reward performance, or merit, or hard work, but rewards instead time and grade. The seniority system, which disadvantages women.\u201d Her sharp focus stood out from what most of the men said from the stage, whether on domestic or foreign affairs. Fiorina, a cancer survivor who is pro-life, said both parties \u201ctinker around the edges,\u201d citing many examples domestic and abroad where \u201cpolitics has triumphed over principle, and expediency has triumphed over courage.\u201d She concluded, \u201cWhat is required now is citizenship and leadership\u2026 Let us together truly reform our government and our politics,\u201d prompting one of the day\u2019s few standing ovations.\n\n5. Ben Carson: The Scold\n\nRetired brain surgeon Carson has become a right-wing darling for his calm demeanor and cutting criticisms of President Obama, what he says are the left\u2019s moral lapses, and his complaints about the disintegration of conservative family values. Like others on the podium, he grew up poor, faced long odds and still succeeded, he said, thanks to his single mother\u2019s firm hand and getting an education. Carson, who is African American, said Americans need to listen to their parents, \u201cnot social psychologists.\u201d He supports charter schools, said business owners should be prosecuted for hiring any undocumented person, the U.S. border should be sealed, and government\u2014as epitomized by Obamacare\u2014has gotten too big and is drowning future generations in debt. What government now spends on Medicaid\u2014state health plans for the poor\u2014is about $5,000 a year and could buy \u201cboutique\u201d private plans. The federal government should open all public land to oil and gas drilling. \u201cWe have to have courage once again in this country,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow the progressives to shut us up through political correctness, and through all the things that they do. And if they want to act like third graders and call us names, let them\u2026 Freedom is not free.\u201d\n\n6. Donald Trump: The Shyster\n\nTrump, the New York-based real estate mogul, is easily dismissed by longtime GOP politicos like Karl Rove for being more of a political entertainer (like Palin) than a candidate. But his comments at the Iowa Freedom Summit added a pro-business spin to the more ideological candidates. (Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul did not attend; they went to the Kochs' donor summit in southern California). Trump was widely quoted saying that Mitt Romney \u201cfailed\u201d and \u201cchoked\u201d running for president in 2012, and should go away, and \u201cthe last thing we need is another Bush,\u201d referring to ex-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. (Neither attended.)\n\nBut on substance, Trump claimed that Obama is not respected abroad and the toughest foreign leaders \u201ctake advantage of us,\u201d referring to China, Russia and Iran. At home, he said America\u2019s roads, bridges and airports \u201care crumbling\u201d and \u201cwe have to rebuild.\u201d He said mainstream Republicans are weak, bungling their response to Obamacare and immigration reform and are poised to alienate the public by going after Social Security. He said they, like Obama, don't know how to negotiate and close deals. \u201cI\u2019m seriously thinking of running,\u201d Trump said, \"because I can do the job.\u201d\n\n7. Rick Santorum: The Savior\n\nSantorum, the social conservative who surprised the mainstream media by winning Iowa\u2019s Republican Party Caucus in 2012, beating Mitt Romney, appears ready to run again. He had a very different message from four years ago, when he, too, mostly was an evangelical scold. Santorum said Americans can see that Obama failed to deliver on his promises and want a positive message they can believe in. When the GOP talks about entrepreneurs, they are ignoring 90 percent of the people who don\u2019t own businesses, he said. \u201cAmericans feel the divisiveness and are sick of it.\u201d The often-cited GOP rhetoric that a rising economic tide will lift all boats doesn\u2019t work for people \u201cwithout a college degree,\u201d with family breakdowns, and \u201choles in their boat,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you say that we will raise the tide, they don\u2019t feel it,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel better. They\u2019re sinking deeper.\u201d His remedies include privatizing education and taking steps \u201cto rebuild the family,\u201d such as ending welfare programs (and corporate welfare as well). Like the others expressing libertarian views, he blamed Washington \u201cfor making U.S. manufacturing uncompetitive\u201d and lambasted Obama\u2019s foreign policy, saying he\u2019s \u201cseen the impact of indecision by an American president.\u201d But most surprisingly, the former senator said, \u201cWe [Republicans] don\u2019t win because too many people don\u2019t think we care.\u201d\n\nThe Long View\n\nThese seven potential candidates are not the full GOP field. But collectively, they represent the spectrum of views from its major right-wing factions, whether evangelicals or libertarians, or a mix of both. It is easy to sneer at figures like Palin or Trump, but there's no doubt their views will be amplified by the media between now and the November 2016 election.\n\nIn contrast, the Democrats appear poised for a coronation, where Hillary Clinton will get the nod. It\u2019s perilous to assume that the White House will remain in Democratic hands, especially since there are serious critiques across the political spectrum of Obama\u2019s record. If anything, progressives need to be wary that their views will not be further marginalized, as centrist Democrats consolidate their control and the Kochs pull the Republican Party further to the far right.\n\nPerhaps there is a silver lining in the prospect of right-wingers dominating the 2016 coverage in the near-future, because the country will likely tire of their views before the real campaign begins. On the other hand, the last thing the country needs is to be drenched in endless right-wing propagandizing about the evils of government, unions, liberalism, safety nets, environmentalism, and diplomacy overseas, and how conservative Christian values are imperiled.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to the Kochs, ready or not, here they come.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "Thanks to the Kochs, ready or not, here they come.", "title": "Thugs and Demagogues: 7 Right-Wing Wackos the Media Will Shove Down Our Throats in 2016", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/tea-party-and-right/thugs-and-demagogues-7-right-wing-wackos-media-will-shove-down-our-throats-2016", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/ted_cruz_2.png", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "Thugs and Demagogues: 7 Right-Wing Wackos the Media Will Shove Down Our Throats in 2016"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-28T22:28:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "He said they, like Obama, don't know how to negotiate and close deals.\nBut collectively, they represent the spectrum of views from its major right-wing factions, whether evangelicals or libertarians, or a mix of both.\nWhen the GOP talks about entrepreneurs, they are ignoring 90 percent of the people who don\u2019t own businesses, he said.\nIt is easy to sneer at figures like Palin or Trump, but there's no doubt their views will be amplified by the media between now and the November 2016 election.\nThe New Jersey governor did not present himself as the over-confident, bullying, self-satisfied politician he is locally known to be."}
