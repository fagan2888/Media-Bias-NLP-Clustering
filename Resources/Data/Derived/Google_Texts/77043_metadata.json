The president believes in bigger government, more government control, more government programs, a top-down approach, while Republicans believe that we ought to empower people, empower small businesses and grow this economy from the bottom up.\u201d\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nBoehner alleged that the president\u2019s policies have \u201churt\u201d the country as a whole and its economy, claiming that the American people \u2014 not Obama \u2014 are responsible for the sinking unemployment rate, which fell to 5.6 percent in December.\n\n\u201cThe economy is a little better, I\u2019m not going to deny that, but he shouldn\u2019t be taking credit for it,\u201d said the Ohio Republican, specifically referencing Obama\u2019s State of the Union address last week. \u201cThe American people are the ones that are growing the economy.\u201d\n\nOf course, as Boehner emphasized, the labor participation rate is at its lowest in four decades, indicating that over 37 percent of Americans have dropped out of the work force entirely.\n\n\u201cThe improvement in the economy is fine for the top \u2014 as he calls it \u2014 1 percent, but for most Americans, they\u2019re not seeing it,\u201d Boehner added.\n\nThe House speaker also addressed his plan to sue the president over his executive action on immigration, a move that 26 states are also pursuing in a separate suit.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about immigration,\u201d explained Boehner, who filed a similar suit on behalf of the House over the president\u2019s executive action on Obamacare late last year. \u201cThis is about the president violating the Constitution, violating his oath of office and frankly not upholding the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t have the ability to just change law all by himself,\u201d he later added.\n\nIn a rare moment of positivity, Boehner expressed his approval of the president\u2019s decision to scrap his plan to tax college savings plans just days after Obama proposed the move during his State of the Union address.\n\n\u201cThe president always wants to raise taxes, and this idea that we\u2019re going to raise taxes and grow government in Washington is exactly what the American people don\u2019t want,\u201d explained Boehner. \u201cThe idea that we ought to tax college savings plans was bizarre, and I\u2019m glad the president changed his mind.\u201d\n\nWhile the speaker was unable to list more than a few things House Republicans anticipate to accomplish while Obama is still in office, he insisted optimistically that \u201chope springs eternal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "During a recent interview with Fox News' Bret Baier, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) emphasized the need for the congressional Republicans to focus on improving the economy for middle class Americans.", "title": "John Boehner: American people, not Obama, responsible for economic...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/01/boehner-fox-news-bret-baier-600x322.jpg", "height": 322}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/01/29/john-boehner-american-people-not-obama-responsible-economic-growth/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "obama-state-of-the-union-economy", "published_time": "2015-01-29T12:53:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-29T12:54:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf840\"", "article_summary": "During a recent interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) emphasized the need for the congressional Republicans to focus on improving the economy for middle class Americans.\n\u201cThis is about the president violating the Constitution, violating his oath of office and frankly not upholding the rule of law.\u201d\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t have the ability to just change law all by himself,\u201d he later added.\n\u201cI want to get more done,\u201d Boehner said of the new Congress on \u201cSpecial Report.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a president that doesn\u2019t really share our vision.\nThe House speaker also addressed his plan to sue the president over his executive action on immigration, a move that 26 states are also pursuing in a separate suit.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about immigration,\u201d explained Boehner, who filed a similar suit on behalf of the House over the president\u2019s executive action on Obamacare late last year."}
