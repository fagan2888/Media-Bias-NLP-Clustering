From this perspective, natural law is a transcendent moral order that provides the standard of justice for \u201cpositive law,\u201d i.e. human legislation.\n\nThe law forbidding the sale of loose cigarettes that Garner violated (repeatedly) is unjust. Garner \u201caggressed\u201d against no one. He merely exercised his \u201cnatural right to dispose of his own property (\u2018loosies\u2019) at will.\u201d Natural law forbids only those actions that violate the \u201caxiom\u201d of \u201cnon-aggression,\u201d actions that directly contravene the natural rights of others. Since Garner, allegedly, \u201caggressed\u201d against no one, morally speaking, he was \u201cinnocent.\u201d Moreover, the positive law that Garner violated was unjust because it violated Garner\u2019s \u201cnatural right to dispose of his own property (\u2018loosies\u2019) at will.\u201d\n\nSpeaking as one who believes in natural law, I\u2019ll be the first to say it: The road from natural law to positive law is paved with immense difficulties. The concept of \u201cnatural law\u201d must be handled with great care.\n\nLet\u2019s assume for the moment that the above argument is correct and that the law forbidding the sale of untaxed cigarettes violates the natural law. So what? As far as I see it, one of two\u2014and only two\u2014implications follows from this assumption: (1) Garner acted rightly, for there is no moral duty to comply with an unjust law; or (2) Garner acted wrongly in breaking the law, even though it was unjust, because there is a moral duty to comply with, or at least not resist, laws enacted by recognized authorities (like legislators).\n\nNeither line of reasoning bodes well for Garner\u2019s natural law supporters.\n\nThe problem with (1) is that even from the perspective of many of history\u2019s great natural lawyers, it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThere may very well be a moral (\u201cnatural\u201d) duty to comply with an unjust positive law. Believers in natural law from at least the time of Socrates certainly thought that the immorality per se of a given law was far from a sufficient ground on which to disobey it. Of course, they recognized that immorality admitted of many degrees. For instance, a positive law demanding murder is far more egregious than one, say, forbidding the sale of untaxed cigarettes. Certainly, the only fitting response to the former is non-compliance. Regarding the latter, though, matters are far messier.\n\nSocrates was unjustly convicted on trumped up charges and sentenced to death. Yet even under these circumstances, he refused to escape from prison when a friend made the arrangements for him to do so. Socrates justified his decision on the grounds that in spending his whole life under Athenian law, he implicitly contracted to abide by it. And from this system of law he derived enormous benefits. In disobeying this law now just because it (or its application) harms him, Socrates believed, would be to undermine the laws that made his good life possible.\n\nAs he explained to Crito, his friend who came to bust him out of jail, a citizen must \u201cdo what is his city and country order him\u201d to do or else strive to \u201cchange their view of what is just [.]\u201d\n\nThe great English natural law jurist, William Blackstone, is also worth consulting on this issue.\n\nIn his magisterial, Commentaries on the Laws of England, Blackstone writes that \u201cin relation to those laws which\u2026forbid only such things as are not mala in se (wrong in themselves), but mala prohibita (crimes, because forbidden)\u201d\u2014like peddling untaxed \u201cloosies\u201d\u2014our moral obligation is to either comply with the law or, \u201cin case of our breach of those laws,\u201d submit to the penalty. Whichever course of action a person chooses, \u201chis conscience will be clear [.]\u201d\n\nBlackstone further notes that if everyone went about breaking those laws that they disliked\u2014\u201cif every such law were [viewed as] a snare for the conscience of the subject\u201d\u2014then \u201cthe multitude of penal laws in a state would not only be looked upon as impolitic, but would also be a very wicked thing [.]\u201d\n\nCountless laws could be deemed immoral and disobeyed. This, though, would result in the overthrow of law itself.\n\nHe further adds that \u201cdisobedience to the law\u201d is \u201can offence against conscience\u201d if it \u201cinvolves\u2026anydegree of public mischief or private injury [.]\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the fallout following a grand jurys decision to not indict police for the death of Eric Garner, there is no shortage of libertarians who claim that Garner was innocent as far as the natural law is concerned..05/26/2016 3:34:07AM EST.", "author": "Jack Kerwick", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "In the fallout following a grand jurys decision to not indict police for the death of Eric Garner, there is no shortage of libertarians who claim that Garner was innocent as far as the natural law is concerned.", "title": "- Natural Law Verses Positive Law", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/jackkerwick/2014/12/15/natural-law-verses-positive-law-n1932030", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/347/a5953e8c-ba6f-40e3-b3eb-384a934dc531.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "In the fallout following a grand jurys decision to not indict police for the death of Eric Garner, there is no shortage of libertarians who claim that Garner was innocent as far as the natural law is concerned.", "title": "- Natural Law Verses Positive Law", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/jackkerwick/2014/12/15/natural-law-verses-positive-law-n1932030", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/347/a5953e8c-ba6f-40e3-b3eb-384a934dc531.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Natural Law Verses Positive Law, Jack Kerwick, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d51\"", "article_summary": "From this perspective, natural law is a transcendent moral order that provides the standard of justice for \u201cpositive law,\u201d i.e.\nSince Garner, allegedly, \u201caggressed\u201d against no one, morally speaking, he was \u201cinnocent.\u201d Moreover, the positive law that Garner violated was unjust because it violated Garner\u2019s \u201cnatural right to dispose of his own property (\u2018loosies\u2019) at will.\u201dSpeaking as one who believes in natural law, I\u2019ll be the first to say it: The road from natural law to positive law is paved with immense difficulties.\nLet\u2019s assume for the moment that the above argument is correct and that the law forbidding the sale of untaxed cigarettes violates the natural law.\nThere may very well be a moral (\u201cnatural\u201d) duty to comply with an unjust positive law.\nHe merely exercised his \u201cnatural right to dispose of his own property (\u2018loosies\u2019) at will.\u201d Natural law forbids only those actions that violate the \u201caxiom\u201d of \u201cnon-aggression,\u201d actions that directly contravene the natural rights of others."}
