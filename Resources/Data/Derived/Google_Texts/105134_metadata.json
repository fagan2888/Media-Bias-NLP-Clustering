And under current conditions, operating losses for the five hospitals studied would total $190 million in 2019, according to Navigant.\n\nIf the proposed changes are implemented, the five hospitals would see a profit of $64 million in 2019, the report stated.\n\nThe status quo is not a viable option, the consultants said.\n\n[Also: These states had the most Obamacare grants]\n\nTheir recommendations are based on healthcare requirements, the trend and population need for more outpatient services and the current financial and physical condition of the five hospitals studied.\n\nUniversity Hospital would be expanded into a state-of-the-art regional medical center. University Hospital and Clara Maass Medical Center would remain inpatient hospitals.\n\nThe recommendations also call for a large capital investment of $1 billion, with much of that going to University Hospital.\n\nPediatrics and cardiovascular services would be consolidated at Newark Beth Israel, they recommended.\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/struggling-new-jersey-hospitals-could-become-ambulatory-centers", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Newark-Beth-Israel-facebook-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Under current conditions, operating loss for the five hospitals studied would be $190 million in 2019, according to Navigant Consulting.", "title": "Struggling New Jersey hospitals could become ambulatory centers"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Newark-Beth-Israel-facebook-feature.gif"}, "title": "Struggling New Jersey hospitals could become ambulatory centers", "description": "Under current conditions, operating loss for the five hospitals studied would be $190 million in 2019, according to Navigant Consulting.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Consultants are recommending that three money-losing hospital in\u00a0 New Jersey -- Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, East Orange General Hospital, University Hospital and Saint Michael\u2019s Medical Center -- should become ambulatory care centers before financial losses topple the institutions.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb4a\"", "article_summary": "Consultants are recommending that three money-losing hospital in New Jersey -- Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, East Orange General Hospital, University Hospital and Saint Michael\u2019s Medical Center -- should become ambulatory care centers before financial losses topple the institutions.\nPhoto of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center from Facebook.\nThe recommendations also call for a large capital investment of $1 billion, with much of that going to University Hospital.\nUniversity Hospital and Clara Maass Medical Center would remain inpatient hospitals.\nPediatrics and cardiovascular services would be consolidated at Newark Beth Israel, they recommended."}
