On the one hand, young people are reserves of boundless potential, eligible for hundreds of thousands of dollars in cheap education loans to develop their human capital. On the other, employers are so awash in capable young recruits that some industries have stopped paying entry-level hires at all. Politicians spend precious campaign dollars doing youth outreach, then blow off the issues that matter to us. Now the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the keystone to the president\u2019s legacy, needs buy-in from millennials more than anyone else. The question is whether we will \u2014 or should \u2014 show up. For any group insurance policy to work, it needs a diversified risk pool, and the ACA is no exception. The mix of enlistees has to include people who tend to be healthy, like young people, to offset those who are more likely to get sick, such as those who are older. Grouping risky and less risky people is how insurance providers are theoretically able to keep premiums low, and if the ACA can\u2019t \u2014 or if Americans think it can\u2019t \u2014 make insurance affordable, the program might never get off the ground. There are some safeguards designed to protect the system from immediate failure, but for the plan to work, it needs young people to buy in.\n\n\n\nThe fear among the act\u2019s proponents is that young people won\u2019t enroll. Earlier this month Gallup presented new poll numbers about \u201cObamacare\u201d under the typically alarmist headline \u201cYoung Americans least familiar with healthcare law.\u201d Instead, what the numbers reflect are those who have strong \u2014 but not necessarily well-informed \u2014 opinions on \u201cObamacare.\u201d Republicans, who have based much of their party identity around ACA opposition rhetoric that has played infamously fast and loose with the facts, are more likely than Democrats to describe themselves as familiar with the law, by a margin of 23 percentage points. Once Gallup is done blaming millennials, they can concede that unfamiliarity with the law is understandable, \u201cgiven the law\u2019s complexity and that many of its features are still being rolled out.\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps, rather than being ignorant about the law, young people have simply learned not to trust the people pushing it to use complex mechanisms in the general interest. A Harvard Institute of Politics survey of millennial viewpoints from earlier this month found that President Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating dropped to 41 percent among adults under the age of 30 \u2014 his lowest measure yet, down from a high of 58 in 2009. Just 14 percent of young adults surveyed said they believed the country is headed in the right direction. And slightly more than half of those 18 to 24 \u2014 only a quarter of whom were Republicans \u2014 said they would replace the president.\n\nThe possibility of total inaction on \u2018Obamacare\u2019 gives us enormous leverage. It\u2019s time to use it do what every other interest group in American politics does: Demand everything.\n\nAmong millennials, there\u2019s an evident lack of faith in the government. How could there not be? Candidate Obama talked a big game on unemployment, student debt, climate change, electoral reform and economic inequality. But five years after his election, the country has little to show for it. The national feeling of dread Obama promised to alleviate is alive and well. And now the government is calling for young people to pay for the care of older people. It\u2019s all very convenient. When some of us took to the streets with the Occupy movement, we hoped our bodies in the public square would be leverage enough to shift the national agenda, but the authorities called our bluff with police batons. Then they needed us out of the way; now they\u2019re banking on us staying in one piece.\n\nApathy is a blessing", "article_metadata": {"description": "Refusing to buy health insurance may be our only political hope", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2013/12/millennials-holdobamacarehostage.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/opinions/2013/12/millennials-holdobamacarehostage/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.obamacare_millenials_121613.1387295186466.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "Refusing to buy health insurance may be our only political hope", "title": "OPINION: Millennials: Hold \u2018Obamacare\u2019 hostage"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/opinions/2013/12/millennials-holdobamacarehostage/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.obamacare_millenials_121613.1387295186466.jpg", "description": "Refusing to buy health insurance may be our only political hope", "card": "summary", "title": "OPINION: Millennials: Hold \u2018Obamacare\u2019 hostage"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Health Care, Barack Obama, Obamacare, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe40f8\"", "article_summary": "Now the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the keystone to the president\u2019s legacy, needs buy-in from millennials more than anyone else.\nThere are some safeguards designed to protect the system from immediate failure, but for the plan to work, it needs young people to buy in.\nFor any group insurance policy to work, it needs a diversified risk pool, and the ACA is no exception.\nJoe Raedle/Getty ImagesAmerica has a hard time figuring out how to approach millennials.\nOn the other, employers are so awash in capable young recruits that some industries have stopped paying entry-level hires at all."}
