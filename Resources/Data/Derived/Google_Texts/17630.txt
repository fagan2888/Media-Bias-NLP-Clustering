We are increasingly called to present information and educate audiences using small chunks of text that fit in Twitter’s 140-character limit, or that work well as Facebook status posts.

One of the ways we attempt to do this is through our History of HIV/AIDS Timeline—one of the most-visited pages on the AIDS.gov site. The timeline is a resource that distills information about the epidemic into short, pithy statements you can quote for your social media audiences.

It begins with the publication of the first report of what would come to be known as AIDS, and contains many links to original source materials. A simple click will take you to any year between 1981–2015.

Many of the entries can be used as tweets or Facebook posts. You might consider using some of the information as #tbt (Throwback Thursday) or #FactFriday social posts.

We’re excited to see that people are using the timeline in novel ways. For example, it helped to inform the International Museum of Surgical Science’s December 2015 exhibit: Then and Now: 35 Years of HIV/AIDS .

As we approach the 35th anniversary of that first report, we hope you will take advantage of the wealth of history the timeline offers to educate your digital followers about how far we’ve come since the early days of the epidemic!

You can view the timeline online or download it as a PDF [PDF 491KB].
