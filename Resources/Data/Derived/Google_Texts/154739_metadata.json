Last year, PhRMA reported spending $18.45 million lobbying federal officials on a broad range of issues, an 11 percent increase from 2014, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nRelated: Ignoring Warnings, Drug Companies Hike Prices By 10 Percent\n\nHere is a chart showing how the ten top pharmaceutical companies and trade groups spent on lobbying in 2015:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Last week\u2019s House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on predatory presc", "title": "Big Pharma Prepares Ad Blitz to Improve Its Tainted Image", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/08/Big-Pharma-Prepares-Ad-Blitz-Improve-Its-Tainted-Image", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222010_Pills_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/08/Big-Pharma-Prepares-Ad-Blitz-Improve-Its-Tainted-Image", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222010_Pills_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Last week\u2019s House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on predatory presc", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Last week\u2019s House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on predatory prescription drug pricing didn\u2019t offer much insight into the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s controversial research and marketing strategies.\nThe ad campaign is coinciding with what some congressional aides describe as a major bump in lobbying activity by drug manufacturers.\nExpect to see a lot of gauzy ads featuring patients who have been helped or saved by newly developed drugs.\nRelated: Ignoring Warnings, Drug Companies Hike Prices By 10 PercentHere is a chart showing how the ten top pharmaceutical companies and trade groups spent on lobbying in 2015:\nBracing for a legislative onslaught, the drug industry is launching a new advertising campaign designed to improve its tarnished image among lawmakers and consumers, according to The Wall Street Journal."}
