Criticizing international sanctions imposed after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, he said, \u201ctalking to Russia from a position of force is an exercise in futility.\u201d\n\nIf Putin meant to instill confidence in the health of the Russian economy among his listeners, he probably lessened the effect by practically begging Russians with assets overseas \u2014 even assets obtained through potentially illegal means \u2014 to bring their money home.\n\nRelated: Russian Leader Accuses Central Bank of Economic Sabotage\n\n\u201cI propose a full amnesty for capital returning to Russia,\u201d Putin said, according to an English translation of his remarks provided by the Kremlin. \u201cI stress, full amnesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat if a person legalizes his holdings and property in Russia, he will receive firm legal guarantees that he will not be summoned to various agencies, including law enforcement agencies, that they will not \u2018put the squeeze\u2019 on him, that he will not be asked about the sources of his capital and methods of its acquisition, that he will not be prosecuted or face administrative liability, and that he will not be questioned by the tax service or law enforcement agencies.\n\n\u201cWe all understand that the sources of assets are different, that they were earned or acquired in various ways. However, I am confident that we should finally close, turn the \u2018offshore page\u2019 in the history of our economy and our country. It is very important and necessary to do this.\u201d\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nAs the economic situation in Russia becomes increasingly dire, the government is turning to more desperate measures \u2014 such as soliciting the capital of likely criminals. With Vladimir Putin comparing opponents of Russia\u2019s militarism to the Nazis, the worry is that he will further escalate tensions in Europe, leading to a broader economic crisis on the continent.\n\nIn Russia, two of the major classes of people who have large amounts of capital overseas are organized criminal groups and the so-called oligarchs, the people who profited in extraordinary, and sometimes illegal, ways after the fall of Communism left control of former state enterprises up for grabs. In stressing that there would be no prosecution, Putin appeared to explicitly leave the door open to money obtained illegally.\n\nRelated: 5-Year-Low Oil Price Plunge Adds Pressure on Putin\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s talking to people who have engaged in corporate raiding,\u201d said Professor Louise Shelley, founder and director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA. \u201cThere are thousands of cases where people who have used criminal processes and false documents to acquire assets. He\u2019s talking to organized crime figures who have taken over businesses.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThere are no large fortunes that are entirely clean money in Russia.\u201d\n\nIt should be no surprise that Russia is desperate to bring more capital into the country.\n\nIn the months since Russian troops invaded Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula last summer, capital flight from country\u2019s economy has intensified. The Finance Ministry now predicts total outflows of $125 billion in 2014, and has increased its estimate for 2015 to $90 billion from $50 billion. In addition, foreign direct investment in Russia has largely dried up.\n\nRelated: Putin, Ukraine and Europe Are Still Preparing for War\n\nHowever, experts on the subject of transnational crime and capital flows said that Putin\u2019s proposal probably won\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cIt's an astonishingly naive \u2014 or disingenuous \u2014 proposal,\u201d wrote New York University Professor Mark Galeotti in an email. \u201cThe primary reason for the massive and increasing levels of illegal capital flight, despite Russia's low tax rate, is precisely because people do not trust the system. They fear predatory and corrupt officials within the tax authorities, the judiciary and the other control mechanisms, and do not believe the courts can or do protect property rights adequately.\u201d\n\nGaleotti continued, \u201cA simple promise from the president will not, in my opinion, make the slightest difference. However, given that this is as close to a concrete policy proposal in what is the most arid and insubstantial State of the Federation address that I can remember, it very much demonstrates both the lack of ideas in the Kremlin and their concern about the outflow of money, reflecting a lack of faith in the government and Russia's future.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Putin also addressed international outrage over his country\u2019s annexation of Crimea earlier this year. And, despite his claim that \u201cwe will never enter the path of self-isolation, xenophobia, suspicion and the search for enemies,\u201d he posited a U.S.-led conspiracy to repress the Russian state.\n\nRelated: Estonia Offers \u2018Electronic\u2019 Residency Worldwide\n\n\u201cCrimea, the ancient Korsun or Chersonesus, and Sevastopol have invaluable civilizational and even sacral importance for Russia, like the Temple Mount in Jerusalem for the followers of Islam and Judaism,\u201d Putin said. \u201cAnd this is how we will always consider it.\u201d\n\nPutin discussed the efforts of the U.S. to assist the struggling Ukrainian government, saying, \u201cI mentioned our American friends for a reason, since they are always influencing Russia\u2019s relations with its neighbors, either openly or behind the scenes. Sometimes it is even unclear whom to talk to: to the governments of certain countries or directly with their American patrons and sponsors.\u201d\n\nPutin said the sanctions imposed by the West after the invasion of Crimea \u2014 and stiffened in response to Russia\u2019s ongoing support for violent separatist groups in the eastern part of Ukraine \u2014 are actually part of a larger plan to diminish Russia, and would have been implemented regardless of events in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf none of that had ever happened, they would have come up with some other excuse to try to contain Russia\u2019s growing capabilities, affect our country in some way, or even take advantage of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe policy of containment was not invented yesterday. It has been carried out against our country for many years, always, for decades, if not centuries. In short, whenever someone thinks that Russia has become too strong or independent, these tools are quickly put into use.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin Is Hoarding Gold and Rattling Sabers \u2013 What\u2019s He Up to Now?\n\nHe suggested that foreign governments have worked behind the scenes to abet the \u201cdisintegration and dismemberment\u201d of Russia with \u201call the tragic fallout\u201d for the Russian people.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work. We didn\u2019t allow that to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as it did not work for Hitler with his people-hating ideas, who set out to destroy Russia and push us back beyond the Urals. Everyone should remember how it ended.\n\n\u201cWe will do this even if some governments attempt to create a new iron curtain around Russia.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In his annual address to the Federal Assembly, Vladimir Putin struck a defiant tone, calling international sanctions \u201can exercise in futility.\u201d He then asked Russians who have capital stashed offshore to bring it home \u2014 with no questions asked.", "title": "Putin Urges Oligarchs, Criminals to Bring Dirty Money Back to Russia", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/05/Putin-Urges-Oligarchs-Criminals-Bring-Dirty-Money-Back-Russia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-putin_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/05/Putin-Urges-Oligarchs-Criminals-Bring-Dirty-Money-Back-Russia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-putin_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In his annual address to the Federal Assembly, Vladimir Putin struck a defiant tone, calling international sanctions \u201can exercise in futility.\u201d He then asked Russians who have capital stashed offshore to bring it home \u2014 with no questions asked.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In stressing that there would be no prosecution, Putin appeared to explicitly leave the door open to money obtained illegally.\nRelated: Putin, Ukraine and Europe Are Still Preparing for WarHowever, experts on the subject of transnational crime and capital flows said that Putin\u2019s proposal probably won\u2019t work.\nRelated: Russian Leader Accuses Central Bank of Economic Sabotage\u201cI propose a full amnesty for capital returning to Russia,\u201d Putin said, according to an English translation of his remarks provided by the Kremlin.\n\u201cWe all understand that the sources of assets are different, that they were earned or acquired in various ways.\nIn the months since Russian troops invaded Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula last summer, capital flight from country\u2019s economy has intensified."}
