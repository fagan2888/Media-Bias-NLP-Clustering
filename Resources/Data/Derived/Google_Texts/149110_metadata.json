That number does not include undocumented immigrants who are not eligible for benefits under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe state hoped to enroll 1.1 million people through its exchange by 2016 and nearly hit that mark after just six months. That includes those signing up for a private insurance plan and those enrolling Medicaid.\n\nWhat this new report also details is a breakdown of race, location, language preference and income levels for the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who enrolled.\n\nSubsidies\n\nMost New Yorkers were eligible for a federal subsidy that helped them defray the cost of their insurance. The average subsidy was $215 per month, meaning that the 273,888 New Yorkers eligible for a subsidy to purchase a private insurance plan will receive an estimated $706 million in annual federal tax credits.\n\nMarket share\n\nAs Capital previously reported, no one insurance company garnered 20 percent of the market, but four different companies had between 14 percent and 19 percent of market share. Health Republic Insurance of New York (19 percent) Fidelis Care (17 percent) and H.H.C. MetroPlus (15 percent) led the way.\n\n\"It's very good to see no one plan is a huge market leader,\" Feyman said.\n\nThe competition bodes well for premium prices, which could be kept lower by insurance companies wary of their competition.\n\nIt can also be instructive for other players in the market. Those insurers typically offered some of the lowest-cost options on the exchange and that appears to have attracted the majority of the market.\n\nMetroPlus, which was only available in four New York City counties captured 44 percent of the Bronx market, 38 percent of Brooklyn, 29 percent of Manhattan, 35 percent of Queens\n\nMetal level\n\nThis is where New York diverges from much of the nation. As of mid-April, the last day of enrollment, 13 percent of enrollees chose the most expensive Platinum level plans, 10 percent took Gold level plans, 10 percent are in Silver level plans without cost sharing reductions, 45 percent are in one of three Silver level Cost-sharing Reduction plans, 19 percent are in Bronze level plans, and 2 percent are in Catastrophic plans.\n\nThe federal government released a report in April showing that only 5 percent of those who enrolled through healthcare.gov, the federal marketplace managing the exchange for 36 states, chose a platinum plan while 20 percent took a Bronze plan.\n\nWhere they live\n\nA majority (52 percent) of enrollees came from New York City and an additional 14 percent lived on Long Island. The enrollment numbers are, for the most part, in line with the regions' share of the state's population.\n\n... by borough\n\nAlmost twice as many enrollees (159,000) came from Brooklyn as from Manhattan (85,000) The Bronx had 82,000, Queens 151,000, Staten Island had 19,500.\n\nTiming\n\nThe data dump shows that New Yorkers, like much of the nation, were procrastinators. Though enrollment began in October, 74 percent of New Yorkers enrolled after January 1, more than one-third enrolled in March, and 38,000 signed up for coverage on the last day of March, which was supposed to be the last day of open enrollment.\n\nLanguage\n\nAcross all programs, 85 percent of enrollees selected English as their preferred language, 10 percent selected Spanish, 4 percent selected Chinese and 1 percent selected Russian. Consumers enrolled in Medicaid were more likely to select a language other than English (19 percent), compared with consumers in other programs (11 percent and 9 percent for CHP and QHPs, respectively).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/health-care/2014/06/8547911/breakdown-new-yorks-obamacare-numbers", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20Doctor%27sOffice_0.png", "type": "article", "title": "A breakdown of New York's Obamacare numbers"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Data on race, location, language preference and income levels for enrollees"}, "article_summary": "That includes those signing up for a private insurance plan and those enrolling Medicaid.\nReports have estimated that at least 100,000 New Yorkers had their insurance plan canceled last year.\nWednesday's report is the fullest picture yet of exactly who enrolled in the state's health insurance exchange created by the Affordable Care Act.\nWhat this new report also details is a breakdown of race, location, language preference and income levels for the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who enrolled.\nThe enrollment numbers are, for the most part, in line with the regions' share of the state's population."}
