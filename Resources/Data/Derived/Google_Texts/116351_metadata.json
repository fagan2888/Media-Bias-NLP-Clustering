From across the political spectrum come arguments that we\u2019ve been played for suckers; the system is rigged. So how does a free society respond?\n\nHow do legitimate grievances that stir legitimate anger get resolved, not exploited? One answer comes from a late winter more than eighty years ago. On March 4, 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt became President of a nation where one in four adults were out of work, where banks were failing by the hundreds, where deprivation was a stark reality.\n\nFRANKLIN ROOSEVELT: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\n\nJEFF GREENFIELD: His reassuring words about fear are famous \u2014 less so, his indictment of those responsible:\n\nFRANKLIN ROOSEVELT: Rulers of the exchange of mankind\u2019s goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated.\n\nJEFF GREENFIELD: But by month\u2019s end, FDR had turned from recriminations to action \u2013 using the first of his \u201cfireside chats\u201d to explain a mandatory week-long bank holiday to avoid a run on the banks. And he was also offering a raft of proposals during his first hundred days \u2014 a New Deal \u2014 to pump up the economy.\n\nFRANKLIN ROOSEVELT: Confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out our plan.\n\nJEFF GREENFIELD: But across the Atlantic in another democratic nation afflicted by crisis, something very different was happening. A day after FDR\u2019s inauguration, Germans went to the polls burdened by their grievances \u2014 punishing reparations imposed on them after World War I and staggering inflation that rendered life savings worthless.\n\nTheir votes strengthened the hand of interim chancellor Adolf Hitler, who endlessly told his country of the great betrayal at the hands of Bolsheviks and Jews, who, he said, had committed a \u201ccrime unparalleled in German history.\u201d\n\nBy the end of March, 1933, the German Parliament would adopt \u201cThe Enabling Act,\u201d which let Germany slide into a one-party dictatorship determined to avenge the humiliations of the Great War by military conquest. One nation preserving its traditions, the other descending into tyranny; but it\u2019s not the whole story.\n\nFor instance, there were important voices back then arguing the tools of the American government were inadequate to meet the crisis of the Great Depression. Walter Lippman, the most influential, syndicated newspaper columnist of his day, had argued: \u201cA mild species of dictatorship will help us over the roughest spots in the road ahead.\u201d\n\nThe day after FDR was inaugurated, a Chicago Sunday Tribune headline had read: \u201cFor Dictatorship If Necessary.\u201d William Randolph Hearst, then the most powerful newspaper publisher of his day, financed a movie, \u201cGabriel Over the White House,\u201d\n\n\u201cGABRIEL OVER THE WHITE HOUSE\u201d CLIP: \u201cMr. President, this is dictatorship.\u201d\n\nJEFF GREENFIELD: It celebrated the idea of a divinely inspired President solving the nation\u2019s woes by seizing total power.\n\n\u201cGABRIEL OVER THE WHITE HOUSE\u201d CLIP: \u201cAnd as commander and chief of the army and navy it is within the rights of the President to declare the country under marshall law\u201d\n\nJEFF GREENFIELD: And in real life, Louisiana Senator Huey Long \u2013 whose control over the State was described as a dictatorship by critics-was preparing a presidential challenge to FDR with a \u201cshare the wealth\u201d program.\n\nHUEY LONG: \u201cThat 4% of the American People own 85% of the wealth of America\u201d\n\nJEFF GREENFIELD: Radio priest Charles Coughlin, whose listeners numbered in the millions, was beginning his move from FDR supporter to denouncing \u201cinternational bankers\u201d and Jewish political influence.\n\nFATHER CHARLES COUGHLIN: \u201cWe are Christian in so far as we believe in Christ\u2019s principal of love your neighbor as yourself and with that principal I challenge every Jew in this nation to tell me that he does not believe in it.\u201d\n\nJEFF GREENFIELD: And in 1937, FDR himself pushed the boundaries of presidential power\u2026trying to change a Supreme Court that opposed many of his programs.\n\nHe wanted to \u201cpack\u201d the high court with six additional justices. But his own Democratic party rejected the plan. Retirements enabled FDR to replace enough Justices so the Court\u2019s was no longer an obstacle to the New Deal,\n\nFRANKLIN ROOSEVELT: \u201cI ask this Congress for authority and for funds\u201d\n\nJEFF GREENFIELD: By 1940, a defense \u201cmobilization\u201d to meet the growing Nazi threat finally ended widespread unemployment. It\u2019s impossible to know what might have happened with different leaders at the helm of the United States and Germany; if the U-S had been led by a more timid \u2014 or a more aggressive or vengeful leader.\n\nAnd even in this winter of our discontent, we are facing nothing like the crisis of that Great Depression. But that long ago March has a lesson for us \u2014 when a sense of grievance is strong enough, wide enough, it can subject even the most stable of political system to the most significant of challenges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A recent poll revealed that only 21 percent of Americans think the country is heading in the right direction.
