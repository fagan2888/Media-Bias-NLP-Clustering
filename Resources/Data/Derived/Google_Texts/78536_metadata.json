Sixty-one-year-old Rita Stiles went at least a decade without a mammogram. And 55-year-old Tina Williams has had only one Pap smear in her life.\n\nThe story is the same in many parts of America, including Appalachian Kentucky, USA TODAY has found, and the experience in rural Arkansas provides a cautionary tale for states like Kentucky and Indiana. Experts say there\u2019s no excuse so many cancers are found too late, since screenings that have been around for decades can detect breast, colorectal and cervical cancers at early stages, and even find colon polyps and cervical lesions before they turn into cancer.\n\nBut their promise is limited \u2014 the nation\u2019s progress against cancer diminished \u2014 because poor, minority and rural residents are left behind.\n\nUSA TODAY analyzed state-by-state data on screenings, incidence and death for these three cancers. The newspaper worked with the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries to compare states\u2019 incidence-to-mortality ratio to see where deaths exceed what\u2019s expected based on how often cancer strikes. States faring worst include Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama, largely because cancers were found late, causing untold suffering and pushing up health costs for everyone.\n\nThe main commercial street in Hughes, Ark., is largely vacant. \u201cBonnie\u2019s Place\u201d was decorated recently for Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October.\n\n(Photo: Laura Ungar, USA TODAY)\n\nKentucky also ranked poorly for its incidence-to-mortality ratio - ninth-worst for cervical cancer and 14th-worst for breast cancer. And its death rates were among the Top 10 for cervical, breast and colorectal cancers, partly because many residents didn\u2019t get screened when they should have \u2013 although the state has made major strides in colorectal cancer screening in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe really can alter survival from the disease with early detection,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Salner, director of the Hartford HealthCare Cancer Institute in Connecticut, one of several New England states that fared well in its incidence-to-mortality ratio. \u201cWe can bring down mortality \u2026 if we can provide equal access to care.\u201d\n\nBut getting preventive screenings and quality treatment is much tougher for people who struggle daily just to get by. So cancer preys upon the poor. State-by-state rankings for poverty closely mirror those for cancer deaths. Kentucky, for example, has the highest overall cancer mortality rate in the nation and the fifth-highest poverty rate.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act has brought insurance coverage to millions, it hasn\u2019t solved the myriad other problems impeding access to care, such as transportation difficulties, lack of education, inability to take time off from low-wage jobs for medical appointments, and shortages of doctors, hospitals and cancer-screening facilities. It hasn\u2019t made all doctors \u201cculturally competent\u201d to effectively care for minority patients.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has the greatest cancer control program in the world \u2014 for the middle class.\u201d Thomas Tucker, Director of Kentucky Cancer Registry\n\nThough it eases financial barriers, \u201cI don\u2019t think the ACA is a panacea to make everything equal,\u201d said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nGovernment funding is no equalizer either. States with the most cancer deaths often have less money to fight the disease, so their efforts reach only a fraction of the most vulnerable citizens. Rural hospitals dependent on government insurance struggle with low reimbursement that contributes to the demise of some.\n\nMeanwhile, federal funding for cancer screening is in flux. A nationwide program that has provided more than 12 million mammograms and Pap tests for low-income women since 1991 lost $8 million in federal funds in the last five years. And the recently-agreed-upon federal spending plan for next fiscal year includes a relatively small increase of less than $4 million over this year\u2019s funding for cancer prevention and control.\n\n\u201cThe environment right now is very challenging,\u201d said Amy Elizondo, a vice president at the National Rural Health Association. \u201cThe budget cuts in general, the hospital closures, the primary care shortages \u2014 all of that is sort of this perfect storm creating these disparities.\u201d\n\nAnd these disparities can be as deadly as cancer cells.\n\nRuby Huffman curls on a couch in the small house she shares with her husband Wayne, located off a miles-long gravel road running through flat acres of Arkansas maize. After being diagnosed with colon cancer in May, she\u2019s had surgery to remove her tumor, a hysterectomy and several rounds of chemo. She travels 1.5 hours each way every two weeks for treatment in neighboring Mississippi.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed, \u201cthe doctor asked if she ever had a colonoscopy, and she hadn\u2019t \u2026 She told me, \u2018I don\u2019t need one,\u2019 \u201d says Wayne Huffman, a retired salvage yard worker. \u201cIf she would\u2019ve got them when she was 50, (what was once a polyp) might not be cancerous.\u201d\n\nWayne Huffman, whose wife suffers from colon cancer, stands near their home amid the cornfields of Marianna, Ark. Residents in such impoverished rural areas are less likely to be screened as recommended for breast, cervical and colorectal cancers.\n\n(Photo: Laura Ungar, USA TODAY)\n\nStatewide, slightly more than half of Arkansans between 50 and 75 years old got a screening sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy as recommended \u2014 compared with nearly three-quarters in the best-performing states, according to 2012 federal survey data in the American Cancer Society\u2019s latest cancer prevention report. Less screening means more death. National Cancer Institute statistics analyzed by USA TODAY show Arkansas\u2019 mortality rate of 17.6 per 100,000 was 20 percent higher than the national average, even though incidence was only 7 percent higher.\n\nThe trend is similar for cervical and breast cancers. Just under 40 percent of Arkansas women 40 and older got a mammogram and clinical breast exam in the past year, for example, compared with about 60 percent in the best-performing states. This contributes to a death rate 9 percent higher than the national average even though breast cancer strikes Arkansas women at a rate 11 percent lower than average.\n\nKathy Hall, 47, of Little Rock, wishes she\u2019d had a mammogram when she should have. She was at risk for breast cancer after surviving Hodgkin\u2019s disease as a teenager, and doctors advised her to get annual mammograms starting at age 30. But after having one at 32, she didn\u2019t have another. She never thought cancer would strike. She was a busy single mom fresh out of law school with no health insurance. Then one morning when she was 38, she felt a knot the size of a small pine cone while adjusting her bra. It turned out to be Stage 3 breast cancer.\n\nHall had chemotherapy, a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction, and the cancer went into remission for almost a year, only to return in 2009 and spread to her liver, pelvis, groin and bones. A recent brain scan showed two lesions on her brain, and she knows it will take her life one day. But she hopes for as much time as possible with her 10-year-old son, Christian Fulmer. She treasures even the routine moments, like helping him make his favorite after-school snack of Nutella on toast.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made peace with everything. I know what\u2019s going to happen to me when I die,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mission is to get that little one raised as much as I can.\u201d\n\nOther Arkansas women are headed toward the same tragic path. Despite current controversy on mammograms, everyone agrees that women in their 50s need to be screened at least every two years, high-risk women earlier and more often. But Stiles, the 61-year-old from the Delta region, recently got her first mammogram in about a decade on a mobile mammography van run by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. She \u201cput it off and put it off,\u201d she says, taking action only after her sister was diagnosed with breast cancer. Earlean Lee, 64, also got her first mammogram in a decade on the van at the suggestion of a clinic doctor, a year-and-a-half after watching her husband die of kidney disease and colon cancer.\n\nKathy Hall helps her son, Christian Fulmer, 10, make an after-school snack. She tries to spend as much quality time as possible with him as she struggles with the Stage 4 breast cancer. The disease has spread throughout her body, and she realizes it will eventually take her life.\n\n(Photo: Laura Ungar, USA TODAY)\n\nLee, who never finished high school, says she\u2019s not sure why she waited so long between screenings, she just \u201cforgot about it,\u201d which is not unusual in poor, rural areas like hers. Lee lives in Hughes, a dying Delta town where tall grass surrounds rows of abandoned, dilapidated homes; a once-commercial street contains no open businesses and the schools are empty of children since the entire system closed last year.\n\nAmid such desolation, the churches on nearly every corner are all that thrive.\n\nWeb of problems Access to care, education a problem in rural America\n\nSimilarly-downtrodden communities dot the mountains of Appalachian Kentucky. And experts say preventing cancer is not a priority in such places.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re living in poverty, you have more immediate problems than seeing about getting a prostate screening or, \u2018Is it time for a colonoscopy?\u2019 \u201d said Clifton Collier, CEO of the Lee County Cooperative Clinic in Marianna, Ark. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to make sure food is on the table. You\u2019re trying to make sure the lights are on. So we neglect our health a lot of times.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re living in poverty, you have more immediate problems than seeing about getting a prostate screening or, \u2018Is it time for a colonoscopy?\u2019\u201d Clifton Collier, CEO of the Lee County Cooperative Clinic\n\nPeople also may not know they should get a colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 50 or have a Pap smear at least every three years as a young woman. \u201cHealth literacy\u201d goes hand-in-hand with poverty and education levels. One in five Arkansans, and one in four in the Delta region, live in poverty, and only 14 percent of rural Arkansans have a college degree, less than half the national average. The picture is similar in many rural areas of Kentucky.\n\nBut public health efforts often don\u2019t reach these vulnerable Americans. Thomas Tucker, cancer registry director in Kentucky, echoes other experts: \u201cThe U.S. has the greatest cancer control program in the world \u2014 for the middle class.\u201d\n\nDoctor shortages only make things worse. Nearly a quarter of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, but only 10 percent of physicians practice there. A state report in Arkansas found one primary care doctor per 867 residents, much worse than the national average of one to 631. And a recent study in Kentucky found the state would need nearly 3,800 more doctors just to meet pre-ACA demand, which has grown since the law took effect.\n\nIn addition, not all doctors take Medicaid, lessening the impact of Medicaid expansions in both Kentucky and Arkansas (which expanded its program through a federal waiver.) Cancer specialists are scarce in rural areas, and 26 of Arkansas\u2019 75 counties have no mammogram facilities, said radiologist Dr. Sharp Malak of UAMS, adding that such shortages are common in rural areas across the nation.\n\nEven having a facility doesn\u2019t guarantee effective screening. \u201cThe quality of mammography is going to vary by socioeconomic status,\u201d said the cancer society\u2019s Brawley. \u201cCollege-educated people get better quality mammography, better quality screening in general \u2026 (Poor people and minorities) are more likely to go to hospitals that are overcrowded and overburdened,\u201d or get care from inferior doctors.\n\nBill Strickland, 56, a colon cancer survivor, stands with his wife, Magdalene, at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock, where he was treated. He says he wonders if his initial colonoscopy, done at a small local hospital near his home, missed his cancer or the precancerous polyps that preceded it.\n\n(Photo: Laura Ungar, USA TODAY)\n\nBill Strickland of Center Ridge, Ark., said he was told he was fine after a colonoscopy at a local hospital, which he got at age 46 after a colleague at the paper mill where he works developed colon cancer. But just a few years later, another colonoscopy detected potentially deadly Stage 3 colon cancer that required surgery and chemotherapy. \u201cLooking back on it, maybe \u2026 these guys missed it the first time,\u201d said Strickland, 56, who is African-American and now gets his care at UAMS. \u201cNow I tell people: Go to a place where they specialize in doing it, like an endoscopy center.\u201d\n\nBrawley said quality treatment is also key to beating cancer, especially since every patient and every cancer is different. Research, including a landmark 2002 Institute of Medicine report called Unequal Treatment, shows that minorities, even those with incomes equal to whites, are likely to get lower-quality care. African Americans make up more than half the population in some Delta counties, many descendants of slaves and sharecroppers. Cancer kills them at rates much higher than whites.\n\n\u201cThe Delta is very much the Deep South. There\u2019s racial tensions,\u201d said Holly Felix, an associate professor in health policy at UAMS. \u201cMany of the patients say they\u2019re treated poorer than their white counterparts. Providers may have inherent bias.\u201d\n\nGiven all of the state\u2019s socioeconomic challenges, Dr. Appathurai Balamurugan of the Arkansas Department of Health said he\u2019s not surprised by its poor rankings on screenable cancers. But he said he\u2019s deeply concerned, and cites efforts at improvement: the UAMS MammoVan, which travels to rural areas throughout the state; a recent \u201cColorectal Cancer Roundtable\u201d to develop a plan to fight this cancer, and an osteopathic medicine college under construction that may someday help relieve the state\u2019s doctor shortages.\n\nStill, he said progress has been limited by resources, which include about $9 million a year from the federal and state governments for cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do our best with what we have,\u201d said Balamurugan, medical director of chronic disease prevention and control. \u201cMore can be done, no doubt at all. And more needs to be done.\u201d\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Despite screenings that have been around for decades that can detect breast, colorectal and cervical cancers at early stages, a state-by-state analysis finds that rural America is left behind in the fight against these diseases. Laura Ungar, USA TODAY\n\nTaking control Wealthier states make more strides against cancer\n\nWealthier states tend to be much further ahead in cancer screening and treatment \u2014 and survival.\n\n\u201cEvery state and locality has different resources available \u2026 Rural and frontier states have always been a challenge,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Richardson, director of the division of cancer prevention and control in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which helps fund state cancer control programs. \u201cStates that look better tend to have a better health insurance system, a health care system that functions better, and more coordination.\u201d\n\nConnecticut is among this group, as are Vermont, Hawaii and Rhode Island.\n\nHeather Buie, a mammographer on the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences MammoVan, positions patient Rita Stiles, 61, for her first mammogram in a decade during a stop at a clinic in Marianna, Ark.\n\n(Photo: Laura Ungar, USA TODAY)\n\nAlong with the third-lowest poverty rate in the United States, Connecticut has some of the highest rates of screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer. Its incidence-to-mortality ratio for all three of these cancers ranks among the best in the nation. Even in breast cancer, where its incidence rate is sixth-highest in the nation, it fares well on mortality, ranking 39th among states \u2013 which doctors attribute to finding cancers early and treating them effectively.\n\nMary Witek\u2019s cancer was found at Stage 1. The 50-year-old disability case manager from Rocky Hill had a routine mammogram on a Hartford Hospital mobile van in January 2013, then underwent a lumpectomy and eight weeks of radiation.\n\n\u201cI was lucky I didn\u2019t need chemotherapy,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been blessed. I have not had any complications whatsoever.\u201d\n\nWitek said women in Connecticut are bombarded by messages about early detection on billboards and television and in newspapers. Susan Tannenbaum, an associate professor of medicine at University of Connecticut Health, said \u201cwe\u2019re a very proactive state\u201d in raising awareness about screenings, and they follow through with innovative efforts such as a UConn program offering breast cancer education and free mammograms to underserved women who come to them for dental care.\n\nDoctors in Connecticut say the state\u2019s small size and dense population help, since people don\u2019t have to travel far for screening or cancer care. And compared with most other states, doctors are plentiful and insurance coverage is high. Only 5 percent of Connecticut adults lacked insurance as of mid-year, a Gallup-Healthways Well-Being index found, compared with 9.1 percent of those in Arkansas and 9 percent in Kentucky. Connecticut has also expanded Medicaid under the ACA.\n\nBut Salner said states without the advantages of wealth or small size can also make strides against cancer by truly understanding their unique problems, coming up with creative solutions and mustering political will.\n\n\u201cA small group of people who are committed to work on disparity issues can really get it done. If you look at the data, you can actually mount a cancer control program that makes a difference for people.\u201d Andrew Salner, director of the Hartford HealthCare Cancer Institute\n\nIn Kentucky, for example, local gastroenterologist Dr. Whitney Jones, who has a passion for preventing colon cancer, started the nationally renowned Colon Cancer Prevention Project, which raised money and awareness of the disease and pushed for programs such as free screening for low-income, uninsured residents. Since the group started 11 years ago, the screening rate has more than doubled to 69.6 percent\u2014 and deaths are down more than 25 percent.\n\n\u201cA small group of people who are committed to work on disparity issues can really get it done,\u201d Salner said. \u201cIf you look at the data, you can actually mount a cancer control program that makes a difference for people.\u201d\n\nIf disparities are allowed to fester, however, experts say America\u2019s groundbreaking research, technological advances and new treatments will only go so far toward defeating cancer.\n\nReporter Laura Ungar, who also covers public health for USA TODAY, can be reached at (502)582-7190 or lungar@courier-journal.com.", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Cancer grows, spreads and kills mercilessly in rural America\u2014\u00a0even the types that can be caught or stopped with well-known screening tests.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Cancer grows, spreads and kills mercilessly in rural America\u2014\u00a0even the types that can be caught or stopped with well-known screening tests.", "title": "Found too late: Cancer preys on rural Americans", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/life/wellness/health/2015/12/23/found-too-late-cancer-preys-rural-americans/76558680/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Getting preventive screenings, quality treatment is much tougher for people who struggle to get by.", "title": "Found too late: Cancer preys on rural Americans", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635823229192149203-XXX-IMG-6413.JPG", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Medicine", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Medicine", "title": "Found too late: Cancer preys on rural Americans", "author": "Laura Ungar", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "life/wellness/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06ba27a0362a386e9000c02e5ad114cc3f2d85e9/c=714-0-2550-2448/local/-/media/2015/11/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635823229192149203-XXX-IMG-6413.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70261845367a788a3f907a9f1f073a9c7298db27/c=408-0-2856-2448/local/-/media/2015/11/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635823229192149203-XXX-IMG-6413.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/519e70b3dd198a728f9efe74a59e76efcbe622d3/c=4-0-3260-2448/local/-/media/2015/11/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635823229192149203-XXX-IMG-6413.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3dee5462e17a2761864be78c1f70a8125d51610d/c=0-273-3261-2115&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/11/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635823229192149203-XXX-IMG-6413.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-12-26T14:37:18.450000-05:00", "shorthed": "Found too late: Cancer preys on rural Americans", "articleid": 76558680, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c6b8a2c50f1880c1f72f7bdf5b30e1a6a7b3dfe3/c=0-273-3261-2115/local/-/media/2015/11/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635823229192149203-XXX-IMG-6413.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/80bc2c6d6bcf6351394bb3af892ba4acb199efd5/c=947-0-2318-2448/local/-/media/2015/11/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635823229192149203-XXX-IMG-6413.JPG"}}}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Laura Ungar, USA TODAY)Kentucky also ranked poorly for its incidence-to-mortality ratio - ninth-worst for cervical cancer and 14th-worst for breast cancer.\n\u201cThe environment right now is very challenging,\u201d said Amy Elizondo, a vice president at the National Rural Health Association.\nShe tries to spend as much quality time as possible with him as she struggles with the Stage 4 breast cancer.\nShe \u201cput it off and put it off,\u201d she says, taking action only after her sister was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\u201cBonnie\u2019s Place\u201d was decorated recently for Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October."}
