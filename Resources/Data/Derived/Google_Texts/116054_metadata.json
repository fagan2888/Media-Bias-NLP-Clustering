Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Labor Secretary Tom Perez listen at the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), in Washington, DC, USA, 23 February 2015. Obama joined AARP and members of the \u2018Save Our Retire\u2019 coalition in efforts to protect retirement savings from bad investment advice. EPA/MIKE THEILER / POOL\n\nAttention, Republicans: if you want to know why Americans never seem to believe you when you say you have ordinary people\u2019s interests at heart, look no further than the new regulation governing investment advisers the Obama administration has now released.\n\nI realize that few readers will lean forward with excitement upon reading the words \u201cfiduciary standard,\u201d but this is actually an important topic, both substantively and politically, so stay with me. The new regulation, which had been in the works for some time, says that investment advisers are required to follow a fiduciary standard, which means nothing more than that they have to be guided by what\u2019s in their client\u2019s best interests, just like a doctor or lawyer must.\n\nYou might ask, who on earth could possibly object to that? Other than the investment advising industry, of course. The answer is\u2026the Republican Party.\n\nNot the whole party, actually. Most Republicans would rather not discuss this issue at all, because doing so puts them in an uncomfortable place. But I have yet to find a single elected Republican who comes down on the side of the fiduciary standard.\n\nTo explain briefly: As things exist today, when you hire a financial adviser, they\u2019re under no obligation to actually give you advice that\u2019s in your best interests. What they often do instead is sell you products from which they\u2019ll obtain bigger commissions, pushing you into investments that make them more money but won\u2019t necessarily be good for you. The new regulation changes that, imposing the fiduciary standard on those advisers. This is a very big deal, because we\u2019re talking about an industry that manages trillions of dollars in Americans\u2019 money.\n\nThis morning I spoke to University of Chicago professor Harold Pollack, co-author (with Helaine Olen) of The Index Card: Why Personal Finance Doesn\u2019t Have to be Complicated and a longtime advocate of the fiduciary standard. He was, unsurprisingly, enormously pleased by the administration\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cPeople are unaware of the many conflicts of interest that exist in the financial advice industry and how much money it costs them over the course of their lives,\u201d Pollack said, noting that selling clients products they don\u2019t need is a core part of the industry\u2019s business model.\n\nBut Pollack is quick to note that financial advisers provide an essential service, since most of us don\u2019t have the expertise to make good investments and save properly for retirement or our children\u2019s education. It\u2019s also an extremely intimate relationship \u2014 Americans are notoriously secretive about their finances, which means you\u2019ll share details of your life with your financial advisor that you wouldn\u2019t tell friends or even some family members. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential that the relationship is based on a core of trust.\n\n\u201cWhen people are dealing with financial advisers,\u201d Pollack says, \u201cthey need to know that what they are getting is actual advice and not a sales pitch.\u201d He also pointed out: \u201cThe research that has come out about the poor performance of actively managed investments has had a huge impact.\u201d More and more people are becoming aware that the best investment strategy is often to simply park most of your money in a low-fee index fund; no matter how smart your adviser is, you aren\u2019t going to beat the market.\n\nSo what are the political implications of this new rule? On the surface, you\u2019d think that a position in opposition to the administration\u2019s move would be almost impossible to defend. Who\u2019s going to argue that your financial adviser ought to be able to push you into buying something you don\u2019t need? That\u2019s just a couple of steps away from outright fraud.\n\nBut if you listen to Republicans, it becomes clear they don\u2019t like the rule, but not for any specific reason relating to the rule itself. They\u2019ll talk about Washington bureaucrats and Obama overreach, but the tell is in their repeated use of the phrase \u201cObamacare for financial planning!\u201d (here\u2019s an example from Paul Ryan). Whenever Republicans say something is \u201cObamacare for X,\u201d it\u2019s a way of saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t like this thing, but we don\u2019t want to say exactly why, so we\u2019ll just say it\u2019s like that other thing we don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nThis gets to the heart of the different perspective the two parties bring to questions of the economy and government\u2019s role in regulating it. The conservative perspective is essentially laissez-faire: if financial advisers take advantage of their clients, well, that may be regrettable, but we don\u2019t want the government to actually do anything to prevent it, because we have to let the market do what it will. And when it comes to the affirmative policy changes they want to make, for ordinary people most of it involves waiting for things to trickle down. Let us cut taxes on the wealthy and reduce regulations on corporations, they say, and that will create the conditions that will foster economic growth, so that at some time in the future it will be easier for you to find a good-paying job (those getting the tax cuts and regulatory breaks, on the other hand, get their benefits right away).\n\nLiberals, in contrast, are comfortable with making policies like the fiduciary rule \u2014 or increases in the minimum wage, or paid family leave, or more inclusive overtime rules \u2014 that are designed to deliver immediate benefit to ordinary people. And as complicated as economic policy can sometimes get, most voters can understand this fundamental difference. That\u2019s why Republicans constantly have to struggle to explain why they actually have ordinary people\u2019s interests at heart, and why Democrats can just say, \u201cYep, there go the Republicans again, just trying to help the rich and screw the little guy,\u201d and voters nod their heads in recognition. Republicans may think it\u2019s unfair, but when they oppose things like the fiduciary rule or try to shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (protecting consumers, egad!), what do they expect voters to conclude?\n\nBoth Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders came out in favor of the fiduciary rule last fall; it remains to be seen whether they\u2019ll bring it up again on the campaign trail. But as Pollack notes, the change might not have been possible without the attention it has already gotten. Though people in positions of power often say, \u201cgood policy is good politics\u201d as a way of claiming that they have only the purest of (non-political) intentions for their decisions, sometimes exactly the opposite is true.\n\n\u201cThis is an example where good politics is actually critical to good policy,\u201d Pollack says, \u201cbecause if this had been decided quietly in Congress, there\u2019s a good possibility it would have been weakened.\u201d The more attention it got, the more room the administration had to do the right thing. And now that they have, Democrats should keep talking about it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A story about how good politics can be essential to good policy.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A story about how good politics can be essential to good policy.", "title": "Why Republicans struggle to convince ordinary Americans the GOP is on their side", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/04/07/why-republicans-struggle-to-convince-ordinary-americans-the-gop-is-on-their-side/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/02/23/Production/WashingtonPost/Images/04634467.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/04/07/why-republicans-struggle-to-convince-ordinary-americans-the-gop-is-on-their-side/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "fiduciary rule, obama administration, elizabeth warren, hillary clinton, bernie sanders", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "fiduciary rule, obama administration, elizabeth warren, hillary clinton, bernie sanders"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c71\"", "article_summary": "Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders came out in favor of the fiduciary rule last fall; it remains to be seen whether they\u2019ll bring it up again on the campaign trail.\nRepublicans may think it\u2019s unfair, but when they oppose things like the fiduciary rule or try to shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (protecting consumers, egad!\nMost Republicans would rather not discuss this issue at all, because doing so puts them in an uncomfortable place.\nThough people in positions of power often say, \u201cgood policy is good politics\u201d as a way of claiming that they have only the purest of (non-political) intentions for their decisions, sometimes exactly the opposite is true.\nLiberals, in contrast, are comfortable with making policies like the fiduciary rule \u2014 or increases in the minimum wage, or paid family leave, or more inclusive overtime rules \u2014 that are designed to deliver immediate benefit to ordinary people."}
