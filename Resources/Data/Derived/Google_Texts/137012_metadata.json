They are 9-3 this season, including a 63-0 victory against SMU on Saturday in Fuente\u2019s final game.\n\nVirginia Tech said defensive coordinator Bud Foster, thought to be a candidate for the job, will remain in that position at Fuente\u2019s request. Virginia Tech will introduce Fuente at a news conference on Monday.\n\nFuente took over at Memphis in 2012 after the Tigers had gone 5-31 in the three previous seasons. He quickly engineered a turnaround, guiding them to their first 10-win season since 1938 last year, and a No. 25 ranking in The Associated Press\u2019 final top 25, a program first.\n\nVirginia Tech athletic director Whit Babcock said he identified Fuente as a top candidate early in his search to replace Beamer, who has the sixth-most wins in the Bowl Subdivision. The Hokies\u2019 23-20 victory at Virginia on Saturday was the 279th of his career.\n\nThe Tigers won their last seven games last season and their first eight to start this season, using a high-powered offense that outscored its opponents by an average of nearly 21 points. The streak included a 37-24 victory against No. 13 Ole Miss on Oct. 17.\n\nBefore taking over at Memphis, Fuente spent five years on Gary Patterson\u2019s staff at TCU.\n\nBabcock said after the Hokies\u2019 victory at Virginia that Beamer and his staff will coach the bowl game.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fuente, 39, has turned around Memphis in four seasons' time and will look to do so at Virginia Tech, which has qualified for its 23rd consecutive bowl game despite going 6-6 in Beamer's 29th season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fuente, 39, has turned around Memphis in four seasons\u2019 time and will look to do so at Virginia Tech, which has qualified for its 23rd consecutive bowl game despite going 6-6 in Beamer\u2019s 29th season.", "title": "Justin Fuente, formerly of Memphis, hired by Virginia Tech to succeed Frank Beamer", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/29/justin-fuente-formerly-memphis-hired-virginia-tech/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/29/AP_206103679789.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/29/AP_206103679789.jpg", "description": "Fuente, 39, has turned around Memphis in four seasons' time and will look to do so at Virginia Tech, which has qualified for its 23rd consecutive bowl game despite going 6-6 in Beamer's 29th season.", "card": "summary", "title": "Justin Fuente, formerly of Memphis, hired by Virginia Tech to succeed"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Frank Beamer, Memphis, Justin Fuente, Virginia Polytechnic Institute And State University"}, "article_summary": "Virginia Tech hired Memphis\u2018 Justin Fuente as its next coach on Sunday, bringing a quick end to its search for a successor to Frank Beamer.\nBefore taking over at Memphis, Fuente spent five years on Gary Patterson\u2019s staff at TCU.\nVirginia Tech said defensive coordinator Bud Foster, thought to be a candidate for the job, will remain in that position at Fuente\u2019s request.\nVirginia Tech will introduce Fuente at a news conference on Monday.\nBabcock said after the Hokies\u2019 victory at Virginia that Beamer and his staff will coach the bowl game."}
