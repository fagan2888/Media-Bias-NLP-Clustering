On Sunday night, Mohawk storyteller Kay Olan will appear on the television program Global Spirit for a unique trans-cultural experience. Global Spirit is all about spiritual searching, or "internal travel," and seeks to offer "insights into some of mankindâ€™s deepest existential questions, tracing our collective human journey in the timeless quest for truth, wisdom and understanding." It's about finding how we connect in our own quests for meanings even when we might seem to be worlds apart, and in pursuit of that goal the show unites eminent spiritual people from different cultures.

On Sunday's show, "Stories to Remember," which airs at 9 PM Eastern and 6 PM Pacific on LinkTV, Olan and Global Spirit host Phil Cousineau will be joined by Orland Bishop, a youth mentor who uses African storytelling traditions in his work with young people in South Central Los Angeles.
