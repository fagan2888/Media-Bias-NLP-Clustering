Liberal TV host and former Democratic campaign manager Bob Beckel on Wednesday claimed he was “bludgeoned” by a White House official over the phone after he criticized the Obamacare rollout and suggested the law’s implementation should be delayed for 6 months to a year.

“I got a call from somebody over at the White House who absolutely bludgeoned over it…”

“I said, ‘look, you can’t do this thing — yes it’s true, [Obamacare is] not a website, but it’s a portal to get through to get insurance,’” Beckel said.

Beckel’s claim line up with other media personalities that have made the same type of allegations against the Obama administration.

CNN’s Carol Costello on Wednesday morning said “President Obama’s people can be quite nasty.”

“They don’t like you to say anything bad about their boss, and they’re not afraid to use whatever means they have at hand to stop you from doing that, including threatening your job,” she added.
