Michael Smigiel, a former state lawmaker who the DC activists supported because of his libertarian stance on drug policy, limped into second place with 11 percent of the vote.\n\nThat Harris, who was first elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave, had an easy win is no shock. The First District is Maryland\u2019s most reliable GOP stronghold and the part of the state where Donald Trump performed best in the presidential primary. (Trump did well across Maryland, but romped on the Eastern Shore with nearly 63 percent.) What\u2019s leaving Smigiel\u2019s now-former DC supporters bummed is the magnitude of his loss.\n\nSmigiel got the attention of pro-statehood activists like Josh Burch and marijuana-reform organizers like Adam Eidinger in January when he slammed Harris\u2019s record of meddling with the steps DC has taken to decriminalize and legalize cannabis. While other GOP House members also played roles in leaving the District with a legally murky system that allows people to grow and use pot, but not buy or sell it, Harris\u2019s voice was the loudest. \u201cThe situation he created is intolerable,\u201d Smigiel told Washingtonian in January.\n\nSmigiel\u2019s newfound friends in DC were also cheered by a poll his campaign released that gave him a 29-percentage point lead over Harris from registered voters in the First District. While internal polls are often loftier than reality, this one should have been taken more skeptically (uh, yes, by us, too). The firm that conducted it, Florida-based Gravis Marketing, has an unreliable track record. The statistical-analysis website FiveThirtyEight gives it a \u201cC\u201d on its polling-firm report card, while Slate once gave it a \u201cStrategic Vision Award for Botched Polling.\u201d\n\nBy primary night, Smigiel\u2019s poll was off by 97 percentage points, and his supporters from the District were left feeling like they had embarked on something of a folly. \u201cI think Maryland Democrats are to blame for that District,\u201d Burch says. \u201cThey made it so overwhelmingly Republican.\u201d\n\nBurch is referring to Maryland\u2019s redistricting process after the 2010 Census, which grouped historically GOP-friendly counties in Western Maryland with deep-blue Montgomery County and the Baltimore suburbs and leaving the Eastern Shore as the state\u2019s lone conservative bastion.\n\nSmigiel\u2019s other policy positions also dimmed his new friends\u2019 hopes when they turned out to be far too conservative for a bunch of DC lefties. Eidinger and some of his fellow pro-pot activists made multiple trips to the Eastern Shore to promote Smigiel and bird-dog Harris, but by election day they were a bit uneasy canvassing the district in hopes of turning GOP voters away from their incumbent.\n\n\u201cThe literature we were handing out yesterday was about Obamacare, libertarianism, freedom, and abortion,\u201d Eidinger says. \u201cIt was a little uncomfortable. I was there for one reason: we had the same enemy.\u201d\n\nThat enemy, Harris, couldn\u2019t be vanquished on Tuesday and looks to be firmly on his way to a fourth term. Even with a potentially toxic candidate like Trump at the top of the ticket, Harris is a safe bet to return to Congress. The Democratic nominee, Joe Werner, is a little-known Harford County attorney and perennial candidate, and the First District is one of the most reliably conservative seats anywhere; the Cook Political Report gives it a Partisan Voting Index of R+14, meaning it is 14 percentage points more Republican than the country as a whole.\n\nBurch suggests that instead of trying to knock out entrenched incumbents in one-sided districts like Harris, efforts like his and Eidinger\u2019s are better spent on unseating Republicans in swing districts around the country who might not cook up DC-meddling agendas themselves, but will vote for them anyway out of party loyalty.\n\n\u201cI think we go for some of the people who voted with Andy Harris like Republicans from suburban Philadelphia,\u201d says Burch. \u201cThere\u2019s not always Andy Harris around, but there\u2019s always people who vote with Andy Harris.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "2016 election, andy harris, congress, eastern shore, marijuana, statehood, health, politics, entertainment, arts, headlines, washington, dc, food, restaurant reviews", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washingtonian", "description": "It's tough to defeat an entrenched incumbent.", "title": "Activists Tried to Defeat the Maryland Congressman Who Messed With DC's Pot Laws.
