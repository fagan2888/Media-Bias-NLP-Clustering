It was an extended, largely negative assessment of my analysis of our political moment, \u201cAn Abandoned White Middle Class.\u201d There I argued that the changing nature of our leadership class explains the populist rebellion, at least in part. My critic, who remains anonymous, thinks I\u2019m off-base.\n\nAs I read his criticism, I find myself reassured.\n\nI hold that the meritocratic aspect of our current elite has the consequence (not entirely unintended) of decapitating most communities. Take the talented, ambitious son of an Irish immigrant who, in 1946, after coming home from the war, would have gone to Fordham, perhaps, and then to Fordham Law School. His uncle might have gotten him a job as a lawyer for the longshoreman\u2019s union. By 1960, he could well have become the union boss, a major player in New York Democratic Party politics, and something of a macher in the convention that nominated John Kennedy.\n\nBy the end of the last century, that kid ends up at Penn, goes to Columbia Law School. If he has political ambitions, he works on Hillary Clinton\u2019s senate campaign in New York, and ends up living in suburban Washington, working as a lobbyist. Or he ends up at Cravath and becomes a go-to bundler in the always important scramble for campaign cash. Or he chucks the law degree, moves to Silicon Valley and joins a start-up team.\n\nMy critic admits this difference, claiming that young people (like him?) who end up part of our new, rootless establishment aren\u2019t to blame. Given economic and cultural changes, the opportunities are ever more concentrated on the East and West coasts.\n\nExactly.\n\nMoreover, I wasn\u2019t blaming anybody. I want to understand our political moment, not to moralize about it.\n\nBasically, with Sanders and Trump we\u2019re witnessing something that we\u2019ve been told is impossible. Sanders calls into question the neo-liberal economic consensus. This consensus is all-powerful among our leadership class. Trump calls into question our elite cultural consensus, which requires a carefully calibrated, therapeutic rhetoric that never offends\u2014or at least never offends people designated as those never to be offended. He also calls into question our political consensus, which is that getting the right policies (always within the neo-liberal consensus) is what makes or breaks a candidate.\n\nWhen the \u201cimpossible\u201d happens, we should step back and ask ourselves why.\n\nWhat is the establishment\u2019s explanation? The standard narrative is that we\u2019re seeing significant disruption in this primary season because of economic changes. The middle class is being hammered by economic globalization and technological changes. They\u2019re hurting economically, and that\u2019s driving the populist rebellion against establishment candidates.\n\nThat\u2019s true. But I find it an insufficient explanation. Trump and Sanders seem to tap into a greater sense of disempowerment. They speak to feelings of political impotence, not economic anxiety. Sanders says, \u201cLet\u2019s make a revolution!\u201d Trump promises to bang heads together and \u201cmake American great again.\u201d Theirs is a politics of meaning, not a politics of policies.\n\nIn both cases, they\u2019re filling a vacuum that has been developing for quite a while. Our establishment has remade itself in many different ways, some of which I\u2019ve tried to outline. The upshot is a McKinsey approach to leadership that, quite frankly, fails to inspire, because it\u2019s deracinated, remote, and all too often smugly superior.\n\nIt gets worse. Dreher\u2019s friend finds my account of the growing gap between the leaders and the led \u201cproblematic.\u201d He sees the hi-tech push for more foreign workers as justified because \u201cAmerican workers cannot do the work (I have experienced this firsthand).\u201d I don\u2019t doubt that\u2019s true. But Joe Sixpack has gotten the message from those \u201cin the know\u201d who claim to have \u201creal knowledge\u201d of how things work: You\u2019re not up to the job of doing what needs to be done for the future that we, the leadership class, will dominate.\n\nIn a democratic culture, that sort of message is about as sure a guarantee of political rebellion as any I can imagine.\n\nI don\u2019t say that because I want a rebellion. (I too am an establishment person.) Nor do I say that to condemn Silicon Valley execs who want to make their companies as competitive as possible. But we need to grasp reality, which is that the interests, mentality, rhetoric, and conditions of life for our establishment have gotten out of alignment with the median voter, and this underlies\u2014and to a great degree explains\u2014today\u2019s populism.\n\nLook at the editorial page of the New York Times. The editors there seem incapable of hearing the derision in their voices as they explain that Trump\u2019s appeal is based on \u201cfear\u201d and \u201chate.\u201d Over at the Wall Street Journal, the popularity of Sanders gets explained away as driven by na\u00efve young people who have had no experience of the failures of socialism.\n\nThere\u2019s an element of truth in these assessments. But they mask a deeper truth: voters are frustrated with our establishment, which increasingly offers them political, economic, and cultural leaders they find dissatisfying. These establishment leaders promise to manage us, diagnose us, medicate us, and otherwise minister to us from above. That\u2019s not inspiring. In a democratic culture, ordinary people want to hear the following: \u201cLet\u2019s do something important, together.\u201d Trump and Sanders are saying exactly that in their own ways. In my analysis, this failure of establishment leadership is happening because, for all sorts of political, economic, and cultural reasons, our establishment is becoming disconnected from the society it dominates.\n\nEvery society needs a responsible, effective leadership class, and that includes our own. That requires a degree of self-awareness that, quite frankly, seems in short supply today.\n\n\n\n\n\nR. R.
