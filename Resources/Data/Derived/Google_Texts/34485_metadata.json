Here\u2019s Rep. Chris Van Hollen being asked on MSNBC, of all places, about the gubernatorial race in Maryland, of all places. That race, in a deep blue state, pits Lt. Gov Anthony Brown and architect of the spectacularly failed Maryland Obamacare exchange against Republican businessman Larry Hogan.\n\nVan Hollen says if Brown loses, it\u2019d have nothing to do with Obama, despite the fact that Maryland is one of the few places the president has stumped in recent months. What it is, you see, is that Maryland\u2019s not usually in play, and so a lot of Democrats fell asleep at the switch. And, why is Maryland in play, pray tell, so that falling asleep at the switch matters? Perhaps because the point man on an utterly failed, but super-expensive, exchange web site that is a palpable and expensive symbol of Obama\u2019s failed policies is at the top of the ticket, with Obama literally standing beside him.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the fact that Maryland has not traditionally been in play. So a lot of Democrats were falling asleep at the switch,\u201d Mr. Van Hollen said Monday on MSNBC. \u201cLook, the only people that can beat Democrats in Maryland, Democratic candidates, are Democrats who stay home.\u201d Mr. Van Hollen said that as more and more Democrats recognize the race is actually close, they\u2019re getting more excited about the contest.\n\nWe\u2019ve covered the failure of the Maryland exchange here, here, and here.\n\nNever forget: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be smoother in places like Maryland where governors are working to implement it rather than fight it. (Applause.)\u201d \u2014 President Barack Obama, Sept. 26, 2013\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Blue.", "title": "Van Hollen on MSNBC:  A lot of Democrats were asleep at the switch\u2026in Maryland?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/11/03/van-hollen-on-msnbc-a-lot-of-democrats-were-asleep-at-the-switch-in-maryland/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-04T02:31:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-04T02:47:17+00:00"}, "keywords": "exchange implementation, governors, Maryland, Obamacare exchange, van hollen,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe90\"", "article_summary": "Van Hollen on MSNBC: A lot of Democrats were asleep at the switch\u2026in Maryland?\nSo a lot of Democrats were falling asleep at the switch,\u201d Mr. Van Hollen said Monday on MSNBC.\nHere\u2019s Rep.
