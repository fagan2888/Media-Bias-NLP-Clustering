NEW YORK (MainStreet) — After reviewing 58 applications in four weeks, the city of Aurora in Colorado awarded 21 dispensary licenses, and although marijuana retail stores were officially permitted to open on October 1, none of them launched. That’s because approved applicants must now complete the planning and zoning process, which could include amendments to site plans, redevelopment plans or a full development application for ground-up construction.

“Approval by the building division varies widely depending on the scope of the project and the responsiveness of the licensed dispensary’s design professionals,” said Julie Patterson, senior public information officer with the City of Aurora. “We expect a few of the businesses will open this month.”

Dispensary applicants that were approved include Starbuds, Sweet Leaf, Euflora, Terrapin Care Station, Lightshades and Gaia.

“The building and planning requirements are essentially the same as for any other business in Aurora with the exception of certain additional security and odor mitigation measures,” Patterson said.

Applicants were required to meet minimum qualifications related to industry experience, criminal background, financial liquidity, staffing, security, air quality filtration, business and operating requirements and fee payments by city ordinance.

“Store owners had a relatively short window from the time licenses were announced to the first day they could legally open to prepare and submit building documents, renovate buildings and do everything else they need to do to open a new business,” Patterson said.
