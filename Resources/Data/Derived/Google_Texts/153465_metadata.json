Jason Carter, D-Decatur, recently announced that he is running to become governor of Georgia, attempting to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather Jimmy Carter, who was governor of the state from 1971 to 1975.\n\nCarter sat down this week with Georgia Health News to discuss a range of health care issues, including the Affordable Care Act, the criticism of the State Health Benefit Plan, and the financial struggles of rural hospitals.\n\nThe article has been edited for space.\n\nQ: What are your thoughts about House Bill 990, which would require legislative approval for any expansion of Medicaid in Georgia?\n\nA: I think it\u2019s essentially a political bill. If you examine the bill by looking at the problem that it\u2019s attempting to solve, it\u2019s very difficult to discern what the Legislature believes that problem to be, other than they\u2019re worried that I\u2019m going to get elected governor.\n\nQ: You\u2019re in favor of Medicaid expansion?\n\nA: What I believe is that we have to look at this problem critically. I think expansion should be on the table ... and make sure those folks (eligible for coverage) can get either private insurance on the exchanges or get a Medicaid-like expansion \u2014 it all has to be on the table. I think we will do one of those things if I\u2019m elected governor.\n\nQ: Are you going to make expansion and health reform issues in your campaign?\n\nA: There are sort of two sides to this coin. What you\u2019re talking about on some level is, what are the politics of it? And on another level, what\u2019s the moral value, or what\u2019s the correct policy option?\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the politics are, but I\u2019m going to do what I think is right, no matter what.\n\nI think that it makes economic sense for our state to ensure that we draw down our tax dollars and bring them back to Georgia to improve the health options that our citizens have, to improve the economics of our hospitals, to inject a giant amount of money into the economy.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the argument that expansion will cost the state too much money?\n\nA: What\u2019s interesting to me about this rhetoric about the federal government is that it\u2019s pick-and-choose. We don\u2019t like Obamacare because Obamacare is unpopular. That\u2019s pure politics. We like deepening the Savannah Harbor with federal dollars because, well, that is popular.\n\nGeorgia today under the current leadership is one of the most dependent states on the federal government in the country, and yet we sit here and blast the federal government all day while we grow more and more dependent on it. Half of the time we\u2019re begging for federal dollars.\n\nI think we have to strengthen our state government in ways that make sense. We have to invest in the future. To the extent that we\u2019re going to participate or not participate in federal programs, we need to look at what they are doing for our state. Are we investing in our future? Are we getting stronger? When we build roads, when we invest in our infrastructure, when we deepen the Savannah port, I think those things strengthen our state. I think it strengthens our state by injecting billions of dollars into our health care system to reduce the size of our uninsured population.\n\nQ: The health plan that covers state employees and teachers has come under sharp criticism since changes were launched in January. What\u2019s your view of this situation?\n\nA: First of all, I\u2019m on that same health plan. I not only heard complaints from citizens, but complaints from my wife. A very important constituent (laughs). (Both Carter, as a state legislator, and his wife, a teacher, are eligible for the state health plan.)\n\nI believe that we have to have options \u2014 more options than we have now. I think the outcry from teachers and others has been intense and powerful. And you saw, all of sudden it\u2019s an election year, and we\u2019re seeing a huge amount of responsiveness from the governor\u2019s office. The flip-flop on whether we needed to use the reserves from the State Health Benefit Plan is not shocking, it\u2019s just politics as usual.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent $100 million out of the reserve fund as an attempt to placate the anger. It doesn\u2019t actually solve the problem. We\u2019re going to continue to hear from a great number of people, led in part by the teachers, that this is not enough. We\u2019re talking about real options that need to be there.\n\nThe State Health Benefit Plan is a symptom of a much deeper-seated problem, which is the current leadership of our state doesn\u2019t believe they need to take care of those teachers. They don\u2019t have a respect for the work that gets done, and the desire to recruit and retain and support the best possible workforce that they can.\n\nQ: Is health care going to be a big part of your campaign?\n\nA: Part of a campaign is meeting people where they are.\n\nHealth care is an undeniably important part of our policymaking. The state government has a huge impact on the health care industry and the health care of its citizens. There are major problems that we\u2019re confronting. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that it will be an important, crucial part of my governorship.\n\nHow the campaign plays out is too hard to know.\n\nQ: Can the state do anything about making health care prices more transparent?\n\nA: Yes, I think that the state can do that. Part of the problem is that (there is) so much volatility into the system with the staggered rollout of the different parts of the Affordable Care Act, we have to take a minute to see where that\u2019s going to go. We don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to do to costs.\n\nBut once we settle in, and understand what the (impact of) the federal law is going to be, I think there\u2019s a variety of things the state can do, certainly from an informational standpoint. It\u2019s not easy, but I do think transparency is one of the things that almost always helps.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Election, Health, Local News, Features, Andy Miller and Charles Craig", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "State Sen.
