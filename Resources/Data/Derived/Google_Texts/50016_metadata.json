President Barack Obama's health insurance expansion faces the biggest test of its second year on Monday, the deadline to sign up for coverage that starts Jan. 1. Not only are Healthcare.gov and state websites preparing for heavy traffic, but the deadline also is a test of whether millions of current customers understood that they needed to come back and shop to keep their premiums in line. (AP Photo, File)\n\nCHICOPEE, Mass. (WWLP) \u2013 Massachusetts health insurance companies are about to feel the impact of Obamacare.\n\nOther states have to play \u201ccatch-up\u201d with our state, but business expenses could grow for some companies here, as Massachusetts will be operating under the same rules as the rest of the country.\n\n98% of Massachusetts citizens are insured under the state Health Connector. The Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as \u201cObamacare,\u201d has a goal of 100 percent coverage.

We want to make sure the insurance companies are not cherry-picking. Not trying to only cover those people who are healthier population that\u2019s going to be a lower-cost population for them to cover,\u201d Welch said.\n\nSenator Welch told 22News that Governor Baker is working with our congressional delegation, led by Congressman Richard Neal to have the Obama Adminitration waive the \u201cRisk Adjustment\u201d because Massachusetts already has a high percentage covered through the state\u2019s health reform\n\n22News will continue to follow this story to let you know if this will end up costing you more for your coverage.", "article_metadata": {"bing-site-verification": "23CDEE3A27AFAAFA06AA97D2752E7BC3", "description": "Massachusetts health insurance companies are about to feel the impact of Obamacare", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wwlp", "og": {"site_name": "WWLP.com", "description": "Massachusetts health insurance companies are about to feel the impact of Obamacare", "title": "Changes coming to Massachusetts health coverage", "url": "http://wwlp.com/2015/04/14/changes-coming-to-massachusetts-health-coverage/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/health-overhaul_mart.jpg", "height": 353}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Massachusetts health insurance companies are about to feel the impact of Obamacare", "title": "Changes coming to Massachusetts health coverage", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/health-overhaul_mart.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WWLP22News", "site": "WWLP22News", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Western Massachusetts Breaking News, Weather", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488537620", "fb": {"pages": 16780999098}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wwlp.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/82beb0f66fcee4174912ea30f52087cc?s=16", "application-name": "WWLP.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WWLP22News", "published_time": "2015-04-15T02:24:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-28T17:59:10+00:00"}, "keywords": "breaking news, weather, investigative reports, springfield news, chicopee news, northampton news, amherst news, greenfield news, hampshire county, hampden county, berkshires, Connecticut river valley, pioneer valley, westfield news, western massachusetts, national news, headlines, online, nbc news", "google-site-verification": "6YJPKhiEei9MITNyJe-rDmtJtJ8OhKZ_QWocROYaWIU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd590\"", "article_summary": "(WWLP) \u2013 Massachusetts health insurance companies are about to feel the impact of Obamacare.\nPresident Barack Obama's health insurance expansion faces the biggest test of its second year on Monday, the deadline to sign up for coverage that starts Jan. 1.\n98% of Massachusetts citizens are insured under the state Health Connector.\nPart of reaching that goal is a federal mandate that will force insurance companies to share the risk for the people who still have no health coverage.\nWe want to make sure the insurance companies are not cherry-picking."}
