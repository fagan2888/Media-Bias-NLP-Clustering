According to industry experts, the ACA won\u2019t affect the medical bill payment process; however, insurers will likely see an increase in the cost of medical care for auto accident patients, more subrogation liens from health insurers and the potential for delayed treatment in workers\u2019 compensation claims.\n\nAccording to a Travelers white paper, The ACA and its Potential Impact on the P&C Industry, some key ACA components expected to affect the P/C industry include:\n\n\u2022 Extended healthcare coverage \u2013 a 15 percent increase in demand for a fixed supply of healthcare services.\n\n\u2022 A potential increase in costs in pharmacy and durable medical equipment (DME) taxes and assessments by 1.5 percent and 2.3 percent respectively.\n\n\u2022 Enhanced electronic record keeping and sharing of medical data among providers.\n\nMichele Hibbert\u2011Iacobacci, vice president of information management and support for San Diego-based Mitchell International, has been with the company since 1994, since they acquired the property/casualty bill review company that she worked for at that time.\n\nShe described Mitchell\u2019s general predictions for the ACA\u2019s impact on property/casualty lines and workers\u2019 compensation in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any changes in the way bills are paid. However, because of the extensive amount of population predicted that would be joining the health care system that didn\u2019t have it before, it could impede patients from getting care as quickly as they do today,\u201d said Hibbert-Iacobacci, emphasizing that for auto injuries, in particular, patients will flock to emergency rooms because they won\u2019t be able to get in to see their primary care physician.\n\n\u201cIn Florida, before 2013, about 11 percent of patients were seen in the emergency room for automobile accidents. We do have a benchmark that we\u2019re going to be looking at. Florida\u2019s one of our largest transaction states, because it\u2019s a PIP state in auto,\u201d Hibbert-Iacobacci said. \u201cWe plan on looking at that metric and seeing if it changes over time.\u201d\n\nDavid Wendt, a property casualty insurance broker for more than 25 years and general manager with Minn.- based Associated Professionals Inc., said there is concern that auto and workers\u2019 compensation insurance could be added to the exchange.\n\n\u201cOur concern is that there\u2019s enough medical insurance in auto insurance they may decide to put auto insurance on the exchanges and workers\u2019 comp,\u201d Wendt said.\n\nThough unlikely, Wendt said, given the poor reception the program has had to date.\n\n\u201cThe worse this does [the ACA], the better the property casualty industry will do,\u201d he said.\n\nAs an example, Manitoba, Canada, has both health insurance and auto insurance.\n\nHealth Insurers Will Increasingly Seek Subrogation\n\nAnother prediction, according to the Mitchell exec, is that subrogation is going to become an even bigger deal as more patients become insured.\n\n\u201cToday, if you and I get in an automobile accident, we may go to the emergency room, if we have insurance, and usually we get referred to our primary care to start directing our care. They\u2019re being paid by the healthcare [carrier], but the healthcare [carrier] is not going to tolerate that for a very long period of time. They\u2019re going to want their money from the property/casualty insurer,\u201d said Hibbert-Iacobacci.\n\nAuto is particularly vulnerable because there are policy limits for available just for medical expenses.\n\n\u201cWe will see that in auto, because auto has the money. They\u2019ve got it there in their pocket. They plan on spending it, up to the policy\u2019s limit, if need be, for the patient. It\u2019ll just be more frequent than it ever was before. The carriers need to really have an expectation that their process of subrogation is going to take more time than it ever did before,\u201d said Hibbert-Ioabacci.\n\nImpact on Workers\u2019 Comp Slow\n\nAs far as workers\u2019 compensation, Hibbert-Iacobacci doesn\u2019t think the ACA will have an immediate effect.\n\n\u201cIn workers\u2019 comp, we do not see an immediate change initially,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the Casualty Actuarial Society\u2019s (CAS) Ratemaking and Product Management Seminar held last year, Anne M. Petrides, a director and consulting actuary with Towers Watson, noted that greater access to healthcare could lower costs in workers\u2019 compensation if it created a healthier workplace.\n\nRuth Estrich, chief strategy officer for MedRisk, a company that specializes in return to work treatment programs, thinks the ACA will impact workers\u2019 compensation in two ways.\n\nLike Petrides, she said there could be a benefit if injured people turn to their healthcare provider instead of potentially claiming a work injury.\n\nOn the flip side, Petrides said that if there was a provider shortage or delayed treatment, it could increase costs.\n\nEstrich said that if there is a provider shortage, treatment could take longer for the majority of workers\u2019 compensation claimants.\n\n\u201cReducing access to primary physicians could have a significant impact on workers\u2019 comp,\u201d said Estrich.\n\nEstrich said that given the choice, primary care physicians will treat regular patients before workers\u2019 compensation claimants. That\u2019s due to the necessary authorization for treatment, fee schedules, litigious nature of those types of claims and the extensive paperwork involved.\n\nBenefits Versus Drawbacks\n\nThe Travelers white paper also noted some possible positive effects of the ACA on the P&C industry could include:\n\n\u2022 Increased wellness.\n\n\u2022 Decreased incentive to file questionable P&C claims.\n\n\u2022 Increased fraud detection supported by government funding.\n\n\u2022 Fewer emergency room visits.\n\n\u2022 A decreased need to over-treat.\n\nIn addition, the Conn.-based insurer\u2019s white paper noted some potential negative consequences of the ACA on the P&C industry:\n\n\u2022 Decreased access to care, increasing indemnity costs as immediate access to physicians is reduced and return to work is delayed.\n\n\u2022 Increased cost shifting from Medicare to P&C payers by physicians and hospitals\n\ndue to declining Medicare reimbursement rates.\n\n\u2022Increased pharmacy and DME medical costs due to new taxes and fees passed on to\n\nconsumers.\n\n\u2022 Decreased network discounts due to increased bargaining power of physicians/hospitals and less need to drive volume, increasing medical costs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though parts of the Affordable Care Act have been in place since 2010, key reforms began on January 1, 2014.
