The city of Umea , Sweden will hold an event Tuesday and Wednesday commemorating Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass, an unspeakably violent 1938 pogrom against German and Austrian Jews in which Jewish properties and businesses were destroyed, set on fire and vandalized with anti-Semitic slogans. Many see Kristallnacht as the beginning of the Holocaust.

In a tragic and ironic twist, Jews are not being invited to the event.

Workers Party member and event organizer Jan Hagglund claims the presence of Jews presents a security risk. “In previous years we have had a lot of Palestinian flags at these rallies and even one banner where the Israeli flag was equated with a swastika,” said

Hagglund. “The Jewish Community as not invited because we assumed they might be uncomfortable around that sort of thing.”

Critics claim that Hagglund’s exclusion of the Jews is due to the sort of groups he invited – most likely far left or anti-Semitic. Pro-Israel Swedes say the alleged “concern” about Jews being upset by other attendees sounds like a phony excuse. The truth may. E that the leftist and anti-Semitic groups are beginning to hijack this tragic event in Jewish history.

The event’ Facebook page doesn’t even discuss the role anti-Semitism played in the Holocaust.

Some local officials are holding counter rallies in protest of the exclusion. Municipal workerAnders Agren has invited the Jewish community to a ceremony which will feature the lighting of memorial candles and a moment of silence.
