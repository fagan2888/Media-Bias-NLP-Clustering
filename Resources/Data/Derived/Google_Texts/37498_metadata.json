Seneca, then a 16-year leukemia survivor, began planning fundraisers and events to raise money for Colorado families struggling with medical bills from a cancer battle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve served well over 200 families in financially debilitating situations,\u201d Seneca said. \u201cNot only is it a huge reward for me to see this come together, but seeing these people\u2019s faces \u2026 it\u2019s incredible. How do you even describe it?\u201d\n\nSeneca said as grueling and horrific as cancer was for him, it\u2019s brought him to his \u201cpurpose\u201d in life.\n\n\u201cI just want to help people like I was helped,\u201d he said. \u201cI get to be the inspiration, the hope, the support, and then seal it with an act of compassion.\u201d\n\nSeneca recalled Brianna Roberts, a 3-year-old girl with a rare cancer that developed a tumor the size of a lemon when she was an infant. In its first project, Cops Fighting Cancer provided $15,000 for Roberts and her family.\n\nNow 14, Roberts is still in close contact with Seneca, who tears up just thinking about her.\n\n\u201cShe was the catalyst,\u201d Seneca said.\n\nWith the organizational aid of faithful volunteers from the Aurora Citizen\u2019s Police Academy, funds raised through the program help upwards of 10 families a year. Recipients are approved through an online submission process.\n\nVolunteer Alice Jackson said the crossfit competition was to be the first of many in partnership with the owners of CrossFit 6th Avenue in Lakewood.\n\nParticipants were a blend of police officers and regular fitness buffs who trained for three months to prepare for the fundraiser. In the future, Jackson said the event could be split between two days to accommodate the turnout.\n\n\u201cWe started light for the first year,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBut there were plans to do it on two days. We may start there next year.\u201d\n\nMegan Mitchell: 303-954-2650 or mmitchell@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CrossFit event stacks Aurora cops against cancer", "title": "CrossFit event stacks Aurora cops against cancer", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/11/crossfit-event-stacks-aurora-cops-against-cancer/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130910__copsfightcancer2p1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130910__copsfightcancer2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-11T10:59:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T18:55:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc304\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s something I believe in, and is especially important when you\u2019re fighting cancer.\u201dWhen he began the nonprofit in 2003, Cops Fighting Cancer was a one-man show.\nIn its first project, Cops Fighting Cancer provided $15,000 for Roberts and her family.\n\u201cWe wanted to do something different that supports wellness and fitness,\u201d Seneca said.\nFlexing their bulging calves above multicolored sneakers, 20 teams of two competitors \u2014 one man and one woman \u2014 were flipping kettlebells and lifting 50- to 100-pound medicine balls over their heads for the first Cops Fighting Cancer CrossFit Competition on Sept. 8.\nVolunteer Alice Jackson said the crossfit competition was to be the first of many in partnership with the owners of CrossFit 6th Avenue in Lakewood."}
