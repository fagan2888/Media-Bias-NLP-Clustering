Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson recently told an audience in San Diego that God spoke to him immediately after he threw a decisive interception to seal his team’s Super Bowl loss in February.

“This may sound crazy to some people. So, the play happens, and they pick the ball off. And I take three steps,” the NFL star told Pastor Miles McPherson of The Rock Church on Sunday. “One. Two. Three. And on the third step God says to me, ‘I’m using you. I want to see how you respond. But most importantly I want them to see how you respond.’”

The football star paused while the audience clapped, recounted the team’s win the previous week against the Green Bay Packers, and then said that without obstacles people would not need to turn to Christ.

“Over the past five months or six months or whatever I’ve been able to see how God has been using me. You know? And that everything is not perfect. I think sometimes as Christians we lose this. … And like it says in James 1. It says ‘Consider it pure joy to go through trials and tribulations,’” the quarterback said.

Mr. Russell also raised eyebrows during the interview by saying that he plans to practice abstinence with his famous girlfriend, singer Ciara.
