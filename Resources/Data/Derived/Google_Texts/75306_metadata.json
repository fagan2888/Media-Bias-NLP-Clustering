Spokesperson for the Secretary-General, told a press briefing on Wednesday, explaining the Houthis stand behind April\u2019s U.N. Security Council resolution 2216, which calls for rebels to withdraw from areas they captured, surrender any seized arms and respect Yemen\u2019s political transition.\n\nThe U.N. special envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, welcomed the latest development. He will travel to the region on Thursday, \u201cin order to gain the support of the government of Yemen, the Houthis and of the regional powers\u201d for further peace talks, Dujarric said.\n\nNegotiations hope to bring an end to the violence that erupted when Houthi rebels stormed Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana\u2018a, in September 2014, eventually forcing President Abdel Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee the country in March 2015. A Saudi-led coalition has since supported the President with air strikes against the rebels. Hadi returned to Yemen late last month.\n\nCivilians are increasingly suffering the consequences of the spiraling violence. More than 2,300 civilians have been killed and millions more are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nDujarric said the U.N. has a \u201cvery high concern for the fate of civilians in Yemen, whether it\u2019s due to aerial bombardments or other attacks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels confirmed their commitment to a peace plan aimed at ending the country\u2019s months-long conflict.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The rebel group confirmed their commitment on Wednesday.", "title": "Yemen\u2019s Houthis Reaffirm Commitment to U.N.
