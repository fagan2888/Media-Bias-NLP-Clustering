A self-identified tea party patriot took to YouTube this week to explain why he may actually vote for Hillary Clinton over the Republican presidential nominee in 2016.

James Webb, who calls himself a “commie-hating, Obama-hating” American in another video, says he seriously doesn’t know who to vote for next time around. On the one hand, he’s a tea partier and has voted for Republicans for decades.

On the other hand, there’s Obamacare.

Yes, this tea partier actually praises Obamacare for helping his life out and allowing him to retire at age 50. The GOP, he said, have “done nothing for me” and because they’re planning to repeal Obamacare, he may vote for Clinton.

Webb has posted plenty of way more tea party-aligned videos in the last few years, including ones on “crazy-ass Ferguson protesters,” Al Sharpton, “annoying vegans and global warming,” and even a video expressing his outrage with a gay kiss on this season of The Walking Dead.
