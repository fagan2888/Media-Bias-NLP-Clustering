Think Different: Behind Apple's Legal Fight

In the late 1990s, Apple used the slogan "Think Different" in its ads. That could also be applied to its battle with the FBI pitting privacy against national security. Experts say this week's court order differed from those issued in the past, in that it requires Apple to create new software, rather than providing technology already at hand. Of note: The company's legal team includes two lawyers who successfully challenged California's ban on same-sex marriage. Tell us on Facebook: Should Apple help the FBI?

Trump and the Pope Throw It Down

In a campaign filled with "firsts," this ranks right up there: Pope Francis took a jab at Donald Trump, saying, "A person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian." And the candidate jabbed right back: "For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful." Trump has feuded with President Obama, Jeb Bush, Megyn Kelly and Rosie O'Donnell, to name just a few, so why not the pope? Looking at the numbers, it probably won't hurt him.

That's great news for the resorts in Lake Tahoe. Will it also be good news for the drought? Read on to see why we won't know until April 1.

A Supreme Battle Test

Obamacare. Immigration. The debt ceiling. Are these past battles between President Obama and GOP lawmakers indicative of what will happen in the fight over a new justice for the Supreme Court? Democrats think if the White House stands firm, the opposition will crack — indeed, a few have said it’s too soon to rule out an Obama nominee. Republicans say it’s a false comparison and predict Americans will agree with them. Meanwhile, here are some candidates the president may consider.

Track Change for the Bullet Train

The would-be California bullet train is facing high construction costs, political opposition and legal entanglements. Now, it's trying to take the path of lesser resistance: Rather than building the first segment from Fresno to Burbank, the state is now planning to run it from the Kern County line to San Jose. Here's why that won't solve all of its problems.
