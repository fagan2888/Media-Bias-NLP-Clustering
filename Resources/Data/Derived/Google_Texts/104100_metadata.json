But what is the Medicaid gap?\n\nHealthcare is like a pair of gym shorts. Even if it covers nearly all of what it\u2019s supposed to, you\u2019re still left with some problematic gaps, and terrible things can happen\n\nIn 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld \u201cnearly all\u201d of the lovingly nicknamed Obamacare, Oliver explained. The concept to expand Medicaid entails the uninsured could be categorized into two groups. People who make 138 per cent or more of the poverty line could buy insurance with subsidies up to a certain point. Medicaid would expand to cover those who make less than that. But when 20 states decided not to expand Medicaid, it left more than 3 million people too \u201cwealthy\u201d to qualify for Medicaid and too poor to qualify and buy into Obamacare with subsidies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oliver explains how the \"problematic gaps\" in American healthcare can be filled - if citizens vote accordingly", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "National Post", "description": "Oliver explains how the \"problematic gaps\" in American healthcare can be filled - if citizens vote accordingly", "title": "'Healthcare is like a pair of gym shorts': John Oliver tackles Medicaid", "url": "http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/television/healthcare-is-like-a-pair-of-gym-shorts-john-oliver-tackles-medicaid", "image": "http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2015/11/jo.jpg?quality=65&strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://news.nationalpost.com", "description": "Oliver explains how the \"problematic gaps\" in American healthcare can be filled - if citizens vote accordingly", "title": "'Healthcare is like a pair of gym shorts': John Oliver tackles Medicaid", "image": {"src": "http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2015/11/jo.jpg?quality=65&strip=all"}, "site": "@nationalpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 576295511, "app_id": 114466555268868}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "National Post", "keywords": "television, arts, john oliver, last week tonight with john oliver, medicaid", "google-site-verification": "gpwoEJPJUg3ROJCJdh57kfONPUShcZp639SqJs901Ko", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://news.nationalpost.com/feed;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/bf69214e83fdd5520e4b5d91ba3b7d64?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1de4\"", "article_summary": "On this weekend\u2019s Last Week Tonight, John Oliver tackled the Medicaid gap over in \u2018Merica, along with another doozy: local elections.\nAccording to Oliver, for Mississippi, Virginia and Kentucky, local elections could either close or open the Medicaid gap.\nThe concept to expand Medicaid entails the uninsured could be categorized into two groups.\nBut what is the Medicaid gap?\nBut when 20 states decided not to expand Medicaid, it left more than 3 million people too \u201cwealthy\u201d to qualify for Medicaid and too poor to qualify and buy into Obamacare with subsidies."}
