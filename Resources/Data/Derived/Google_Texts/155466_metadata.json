Credit unions offer the best rates on checking accounts, with an average interest rate of 0.55 percent.\n\nEven as banks have raised their prime rates, they have little incentive to immediately pass along those increases to savers.\n\nRelated: The Fed Just Raised Rates. Here\u2019s What It Means for Your Money\n\nWhile rates haven\u2019t increased much on deposit accounts, fees have. Paper statement fees and monthly fees both rose in the fourth quarter, and \u201cminimum to open\u201d requirements jumped more than 6 percent.\n\nOne exception: Non-bank ATM fees inched downward and more banks in the quarter began reimbursing non-bank ATM fees, continuing a trend that began in early 2014.\n\nWith rates so low, it\u2019s even more important for consumers to keep an eye on fees, which can wipe out any paltry interest payments they do receive.\n\nAccording to a separate report from WalletHub, the best overall online checking account in the country is from Bank of Internet Rewards Checking, which has no monthly fee, reimburses users for out-of-network ATM fees, and offers an annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 1.5 percent.\n\nThe checking account with the highest interest rate is AmericaNet Rewards Checking from All America Bank, which pays 1.5 percent interest on balances up to $10,000, and 0.50 percent on additional funds.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While the December Fed rate hike has already pushed up rates on credit cards, the inte", "title": "Here\u2019s Where You Can Find the Best Bank Rates", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/13/Here-s-Where-You-Can-Find-Best-Bank-Rates", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06282013_Glass_Piggy_Banks_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/13/Here-s-Where-You-Can-Find-Best-Bank-Rates", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06282013_Glass_Piggy_Banks_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "While the December Fed rate hike has already pushed up rates on credit cards, the inte", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The report found that online-only savings accounts offer the best rates, but with average rates at a measly 0.61 percent the bar remains fairly low.\nCredit unions offer the best rates on checking accounts, with an average interest rate of 0.55 percent.\nOne exception: Non-bank ATM fees inched downward and more banks in the quarter began reimbursing non-bank ATM fees, continuing a trend that began in early 2014.\nHere\u2019s What It Means for Your MoneyWhile rates haven\u2019t increased much on deposit accounts, fees have.\nThe checking account with the highest interest rate is AmericaNet Rewards Checking from All America Bank, which pays 1.5 percent interest on balances up to $10,000, and 0.50 percent on additional funds."}
