This celebration of freedom of expression, literature, literacy and the arts takes place in Hemming Park on Sunday, Sept. 27.\n\nLectures on the history of Nazi art censorship follow at the Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens on Sept. 29.\n\nNext, BANNED brings 2014 National Book Award-winner and JAX Reads! author Jacqueline Woodson to town Oct. 3 and 4.\n\nWoodson will lead free workshops for teachers and young writers and be our guest of honor at BANNED\u2019s fundraiser.\n\nThe highlight of the weekend is Woodson\u2019s presentation of her memoir, \u201cBrown Girl Dreaming,\u201d at the Main Library courtesy of the Jacksonville Public Library and BANNED.\n\nVisit Facebook.com/bannedjax often for program announcements and event details.\n\nBANNED is made possible by grants, the support of generous sponsors and community partners and the tireless efforts of many volunteers. Sponsorship opportunities are available.\n\nPlease join the conversation.\n\nWe are listening.\n\nLeslie Kirkwood, chair, BANNED\n\nNeptune Beach", "article_metadata": {"description": "PAM BONDIMixed feelingsOne has to applaud Attorney General Pam Bondi for asking for money to pay for processing long untested rape kits.But you can\u2019t push for tax cuts and then expect essential services not to suffer.The current effort by the attorney general causes one to ponder this question:Would there be a need for additional funds if Bondi hadn\u2019t wasted public money, legal efforts and time filing or joining lawsuits to overturn the Affordable Care Act, deny same sex marriages and oppose abortion rights?", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "A roundup of letters from readers.", "title": "Monday's Letters: Praise, criticism for Pam Bondi", "url": "http://jacksonville.com/opinion/letters-readers/2015-09-11/story/mondays-letters-praise-criticism-pam-bondi", "image": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#426ab2", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon70x70tiny1.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8iconLarge1.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/wide310x150.png", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/Win8icon.png", "keywords": "Letters From Readers, Opinion", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon150x150square1.png", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"articleid": 659111, "publishtime": "2015-09-11T13:31:09Z"}}}, "article_summary": "With the track record of those efforts, we can only be thankful Bondi does not coach our favorite team.\nWhat kind of conscience guided her to break the trust of the very people who entrusted her to do the job?\nPAM BONDIMixed feelingsOne has to applaud Attorney General Pam Bondi for asking for money to pay for processing long untested rape kits.\nWhat kind of conscience does all this while asking for special accommodations and claiming Christian persecution?\nWhat kind of conscience guided her to take that oath and then claim that the same God told her to disobey and break the law?"}
