But the promise could go unfulfilled.\n\nIt\u2019s true that patients with cancer and difficult conditions such as multiple sclerosis or Crohn\u2019s disease will be able to get insurance and financial help with monthly premiums.\n\nBut their annual out-of-pocket costs could still be so high they\u2019ll have trouble staying out of debt.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t call them uninsured any longer. You might say they\u2019re \u201cunderinsured.\u201d\n\nThese gaps \u201cneed to be addressed in order to fulfill the intention of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Brian Rosen, a senior vice president of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. \u201cThere are certainly challenges for cancer patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cCost may still be an issue for those in need of the most care,\u201d said Steven Weiss, spokesman for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. That \u201cmakes it critically important for patients looking at premiums to also consider out-of-pocket costs when choosing a plan.\u201d\n\nOut-of-pocket costs include a health plan\u2019s annual deductible, which is the amount before insurance starts paying, as well as any copayments and cost-sharing.\n\nA few numbers tell the story. Take someone under 65 with no access to health insurance on the job and making $24,000 a year \u2014 about what many service jobs pay.\n\nUnder the health care law, that person\u2019s premiums would be capped below 7 percent of his income, about $130 a month. A stretch on a tight budget, yet doable.\n\nBut if he gets really sick or has an accident, his out-of-pocket expenses could go as high as $5,200 a year in a worst-case scenario. That\u2019s even with additional financial subsidies that the law provides people with modest incomes and high out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe $5,200 would be more than 20 percent of the person\u2019s income, well above a common threshold for being underinsured.\n\n\u201cChronically ill people are likely to be underinsured and face extremely high out-of-pocket costs,\u201d said Caroline Pearson, who tracks the health care overhaul for Avalere Health, a market research and consulting firm. \u201cWhile the subsidies help, there still may be access problems for some populations.\u201d\n\nUnder the law, insurance companies competing in new online markets like HealthCare.gov can offer four levels of coverage.\n\nAll plans cover the same benefits; the difference is in financial protection. A bronze plan covers 60 percent of expected costs, silver covers 70 percent, gold covers 80 percent, and platinum covers 90 percent.\n\nBronze plans have the lowest premiums but provide less insurance. Gold plans are the closest to employer-provided coverage. Indeed, members of Congress and staffers who will now get their coverage through the health care law have been steered to gold plans.\n\nSilver, however, is the standard for most consumers. The law\u2019s tax credits to help with premiums are keyed to a benchmark silver plan in each geographical area. And the law\u2019s subsidies to help with out-of-pocket costs are only available to people who get a silver plan.\n\nAvalere found that the average annual deductible for silver plans is $2,567, more than twice what workers in employer plans currently face. Additionally, many silver plans have high cost-sharing requirements for prescriptions, particularly \u201cspecialty drugs\u201d to treat intractable conditions such as severe forms of arthritis.\n\nSome plans may offer limited relief by covering certain services before a patient has met their annual deductible. Those services can include primary care, some prescription drugs and routine care for common chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nBut Pearson says that won\u2019t help people with high-cost illnesses. \u201cChronically ill people may still experience significant financial challenges,\u201d she said.\n\nPlatinum or gold coverage may be the better option for people with serious health problems. They\u2019ll pay more in premiums, but reduce exposure to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nObama administration spokeswoman Joanne Peters said the new system is still \u201cnight and day\u201d from what patients faced for years, because insurers can no longer turn away those with pre-existing medical conditions, and because the new plans cap out-of-pocket costs. While that limits medical debt, it doesn\u2019t eliminate it.\n\nOne of the leading advocates of the health care law says most people will still come out ahead.\n\n\u201cIf the question is, will some people find that coverage and care remain unaffordable, the answer is yes,\u201d said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA. \u201cThere will be some people who feel that way. The overwhelming majority will be far better off, even if what they have is not perfect.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 For working people making modest wages and struggling with high medical bills from chronic disease, President Barack Obama\u2019s health care plan sounds like long-awaited relief.
