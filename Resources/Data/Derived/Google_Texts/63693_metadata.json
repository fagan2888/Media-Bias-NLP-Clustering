Obama and his ilk are succeeding in changing America\u2019s basic values. When Obama adorers see what this country will become, they may regret their vote. The realization may dawn that Obama\u2019s agenda will diminish America.\n\nAfter five years of Obama appointees polluting our way of life, three out of four Americans now are dissatisfied with the country\u2019s direction. According to last week\u2019s Gallup poll, nearly half of Americans no longer see the United States as a land of opportunity.\n\nHere is where we are:\n\nTax revenues are threatened because higher tax rates wound or kill the golden geese that push the tax base higher. American families\u2019 median income has been steadily dropping since 2008. Welfare expenditures and government debt have risen to record levels. Private-sector jobs are barely growing because job creators \u2014 mostly businesses and wealthy employers \u2014 are being penalized. Obamacare will cut the 40-hour work week to 29 hours, hitting the middle class hard. This means we will live mostly in a part-time nation.\n\nDeficit spending only works for short periods, then its usefulness lapses into a liability. Forty cents of every dollar we spend is borrowed. The Federal Reserve\u2019s attempts at a repair job have left working Americans no better off and savers worse off, with financial bubbles that the feds blame on Wall Street. Americans already work half the year for governments, not for themselves. Fifty years of remarkable achievements in technology will not be repeated because the rewards for innovation and entrepreneurialism are disappearing.\n\nSafety nets have proliferated. There\u2019s little reason for Americans to save if safety nets take care of every social need. But even the nets are now starting to fray because of costs \u2014 entitlement spending in our \u201chandout nation\u201d now amounts to about two-thirds of federal spending. Ninety million Americans are not working. Food stamp costs are now $83 billion, double what they were in 2008.\n\nThe benefits of education may be outweighed by the costs, and feel-good degrees like anthropology and humanities are near-worthless in today\u2019s job market. The government has loaned a trillion dollars we don\u2019t have to kids who can\u2019t pay it back, and who were schooled for jobs that no longer exist.\n\nOur young are being cannibalized and ripped off to take care of baby boomers. The only way government can give one American a dollar is to first confiscate that dollar from another American, often through a coercive and extortionist tax code and fines. Governments increase deficits and are looking for new money, including a possible 1 percent tax on the net wealth of affluent households.\n\nThe National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance of communications of tens of millions of Americans apparently is not enough. The feds now want black boxes in automobiles, so they can track your location and calculate how much you should pay in new road taxes.\n\nYour access to health care will be controlled, and healthy people will now pay for unhealthy people\u2019s medical costs, even those who are unhealthy by their own hand. Obamacare is presented as an act of charity, but its actual goal is \u201csingle-payer government healthcare,\u201d an instrument that begins the national transformation to socialist control.\n\nPatriotism among the Obama crowd in Washington D.C. is laughed at, because this alienated coterie considers themselves \u201ccitizens of the world\u201d first, and Americans second.\n\nAmerica has mortal enemies within Syria, Iran and terrorist groups, all of whom declare openly that they must erase us from the face of the Earth. And yet Obama chooses to appease such enemies while snubbing Israel.\n\nObama and the left regard the American past with contempt, a fallen world corrupted by wealth, in need of profound income redistribution. He called the U.S. Constitution \u201cdeeply-flawed\u201d in 2008. Obama\u2019s intellectually dishonest re-writers of history are especially busy these days, peddling the fictional narrative that government played only a small part in America\u2019s financial crisis.\n\nThe result of the administration\u2019s destructive politics is either a permanently weakened America or ultimate institutional collapse. Reversing that threat will require confrontation and fighting fire with fire, but if Obama\u2019s policies become permanent, the America we knew is lost.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "All you President Obama lovers better step back and consider what you\u2019ve uncorked.
