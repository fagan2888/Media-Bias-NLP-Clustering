However, bad debt write-offs continue to be problematic for hospitals.\u201d\n\nReduced charity care at hospitals was one of the key goals of the federal health law, said Nancy Kane, a professor of management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThose who rely on free care suffer from economic insecurity that can have negative consequences, Kane said, including delays in seeking needed care. One fear is that growing bad debt numbers could suggest people newly covered under the health law simply face a new form of insecurity \u2014 high deductibles that leave them with medical bills that are capped, but still unaffordable.\n\n\u201cThe bad debt piece is the wild card,\u201d said Kane, who does research in hospital finance. \u201cA lot of the exchange products are affordable because of deductibles that are higher than people are used to.\u201d\n\nThe Star Tribune analysis draws on data from some of the state\u2019s largest health care providers, including Allina Health System, Fairview Health Services and Mayo Clinic. It also includes numbers from Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) in Minneapolis and Regions Hospital in St. Paul, which are two of the state\u2019s largest charity care providers.\n\nAll of those health systems, plus three others in the analysis, reported less charity care in 2014 than the previous year. Two health systems reported an increase in charity care costs.\n\nThe Minnesota Hospital Association also is collecting numbers on uncompensated care to assess the impact of the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA). Responses from 26 hospitals thus far also point to a decline in charity care last year, Burt said, as well as an increase in bad debt.\n\nStefan Gildemeister, the state\u2019s health economist, said factors other than the health law could have contributed to the decline in charity care. The state\u2019s economy was stronger last year, which likely means people had more job-based coverage and income for medical expenses, he said.\n\nCharity care numbers at particular hospitals can bounce around from year to year because of a number of factors, he said. But there\u2019s clearer evidence of a common explanation like the health law when there is a \u201cchange in the same direction across a number of facilities,\u201d Gildemeister said.\n\n\u201cTo be more certain, we\u2019ll want to look at complete 2014 data or, better yet, at 2016, when the ACA reforms will likely have settled,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the year that we chose for simulating potential impacts on charity care.\u201d\n\nHCMC saw a decline in charity care costs last year of $10.7 million, or about 40 percent. The savings are being passed on to Hennepin County taxpayers and offset by a health law reduction in payments designated for hospitals that traditionally care for a large number of uninsured patients, said Larry Kryzaniak, the chief financial officer at HCMC.\n\nThe health law drove the change, Kryzaniak said. Financial counselors at HCMC saw a 300 percent increase in applications for insurance coverage during the first five months of 2014, he said.\n\n\u201cWe have not benefited significantly from the ACA \u2014 it\u2019s our patients and taxpayers that have benefited,\u201d Kryzaniak said.\n\n\u201cPatients, historically, have not liked to apply for charity care,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were very appreciative of it, but, at the same time, they were feeling responsible and they couldn\u2019t pay. Now, they\u2019re enrolled in a program.\u201d\n\nAllina cited the expansion of Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act when explaining its $8 million, or 27 percent, decline in charity care costs last year. Robbinsdale-based North Memorial Health Care did not provide figures, but chief financial officer Todd Ostendorf called the health law a \u201ckey driver\u201d in lower charity care costs.\n\nBut the Rochester-based Mayo Clinic did not credit the health law for its reported decline of roughly $8.5 million, about 10 percent, in charity care costs. Instead, Mayo credited tight control of expenses across its six-state system of hospitals and clinics.\n\n\u201cIf our costs would have increased more, our charity care would have been higher,\u201d the clinic said in a statement.\n\nRegions Hospital in St. Paul saw a decline of about $3.2 million, or 16 percent, in charity care spending last year, but chief financial officer Heidi Conrad said the numbers were difficult to interpret. The health law was partly a factor, she said, but the hospital also saw an increase in the number of people using charity care \u2014 it\u2019s just that those patients tended to use services that were not as costly.\n\nSt. Cloud-based CentraCare Health could not provide comparable numbers for the analysis. But Kathy Parsons, a hospital official, also cited mixed signals, since charity care at the system\u2019s St. Cloud Hospital jumped during the second half of 2014.\n\nThe Star Tribune analysis tabulated bad debt costs across 13 hospital systems, with one of the biggest jumps coming at Children\u2019s Hospitals & Clinics of Minnesota. The state\u2019s largest independent pediatric medical center saw bad debt costs increase by about 75 percent to nearly $13 million in 2014.\n\nFor years, private health insurance policies have featured growing deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs as a way to limit the growth in premiums. Hospitals have cited these changes as a key driver in the growing amount of unpaid bills they must write off.\n\nAt Children\u2019s, the health law seemed to exacerbate the trend last year, said Chief Financial Officer K. Alec Mahmood.\n\n\u201cThey think, \u2018I\u2019m not going to be sick, so I can have a higher deductible,\u2019 \u201d Mahmood said. \u201cNo one thinks they\u2019re going to have a kid that ends up being born at 28 or 29 weeks, and spend three months in the NICU, and it happens. And it\u2019s expensive.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Charity care declined while bad debt inched up in first year under Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Charity care declines at Minnesota hospitals, but bad debt inches up", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/charity-care-declines-at-minnesota-hospitals-but-bad-debt-inches-up/297080361/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Charity care declined while bad debt inched up in first year under Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Charity care declines at Minnesota hospitals, but bad debt inches up", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/charity-care-declines-at-minnesota-hospitals-but-bad-debt-inches-up/297080361/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Charity care declined while bad debt inched up in first year under Affordable Care Act."}, "article_summary": "Robbinsdale-based North Memorial Health Care did not provide figures, but chief financial officer Todd Ostendorf called the health law a \u201ckey driver\u201d in lower charity care costs.\nCharity care costs declined last year at several Minnesota hospitals, and the drop could be linked to the expansion of health insurance coverage under the federal health law.\nCharity care numbers at particular hospitals can bounce around from year to year because of a number of factors, he said.\nWhile several medical centers say coverage expansion likely drove the decline in charity care, at least one didn\u2019t credit the health law.\nResponses from 26 hospitals thus far also point to a decline in charity care last year, Burt said, as well as an increase in bad debt."}
