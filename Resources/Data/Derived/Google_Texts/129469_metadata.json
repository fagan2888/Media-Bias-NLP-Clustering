Its seen a 50 percent increase in traffic in 2014, according to internal measurements. What about the new website is attracting so many more visitors?\n\nGRIEVE: Traffic is actually up 57 percent, but who\u2019s counting? Actually, we all are, and that\u2019s part of it. \u201cTraffic\u201d can be such a dirty word for journalists. Our reporters and editors know that great journalism and great traffic go hand in hand. As our managing editor, Kristin Roberts, said the other day: \u201cImportant journalism and epic traffic are related. Not related like second cousins who get together every other Thanksgiving. I mean like sisters or spouses. They not only can coexist, they can thrive together.\u201d\n\nCAPITAL: Tell us about the redesign of your print magazine, which debuted today.\n\nGRIEVE: It\u2019s going to be beautiful, and I mean that in a bunch of different ways. First off, there\u2019s the design. We've brought in Joe Heroun, an amazingly talented guy who\u2019s done design work for The New Republic, Boston magazine and a bunch of other great titles. He\u2019s created a really gorgeous magazine for us\u2014one that\u2019s sophisticated, elegant and also really modern. So, to answer your question literally, it's going to look great.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter if the content isn\u2019t great. And it will be. Our new magazine editor, Richard Just, brings a really distinct vision to National Journal\u2019s magazine, one that it hasn\u2019t had before. For a long time, we tried to be a news magazine for influential, really well-informed readers. But I\u2019m not sure that concept really works anymore\u2014the news part, not the magazine part. By the time Friday rolls around, our readers know the news. They know all the insta-analysis of the news. What they want\u2014what we all want\u2014is insight, depth and a way to make sense of what\u2019s happened and what\u2019s going to happen, not just next week but next year and beyond. There are a lot of different ways of doing that.\n\nCAPITAL: Capitol Hill is getting crowded these days, with publications like C.Q. Roll Call, The Hill and POLITICO (your former employer) all covering federal policy. What does National Journal offer readers that its competitors don't?\n\nGRIEVE: It is crowded, with lots of publications with lots of reporters racing around to scoop up every little nugget of minute-to-minute news so that they can say they had it first. I\u2019ve done that kind of journalism, and I think we do it really well at National Journal\u2014when there\u2019s a big, fast-moving story that requires it. But day-in and day-out, it\u2019s not what we want to do.\n\nI want to write stories that really tell our readers something they don't know, and that\u2019s hard to do: Our readers know a lot. But when Tim Alberta goes deep into the House conservatives\u2019 plans to oust John Boehner, or Marin Cogan tells some stories you wouldn\u2019t believe about Brian Schweitzer, or Brendan Sasso or Sam Baker help me understand Obamacare or net neutrality in a way I never did before, or Lucia Graves or Ron Fournier gives me a new way of thinking, I know we\u2019re doing it. And sometimes Brian Resnick just finds a really beautiful photograph from space, and that\u2019s cool, too.\n\nCAPITAL: When you left POLITICO, you had a little more than a month of downtime before you started at National Journal, waiting for your old contract to expire. What's the quirkiest way you spent your time during that month?\n\nGRIEVE: I\u2019m not sure \u201cquirky\u201d is a thing I do. But I cooked a lot, and I hung out with my wife and kids, and I helped teach the 16-year-old how to drive, and I figured out pretty quickly that there are worse things in life than a forced vacation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/06/8547576/60-second-interview-tim-grieve-editor-chief-national-journal", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20TimGrieve.png", "type": "article", "title": "The 60-second interview: Tim Grieve, editor in chief National Journal"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The 60-second interview: Tim Grieve, editor in chief National Journal"}, "article_summary": "Our reporters and editors know that great journalism and great traffic go hand in hand.\nOur new magazine editor, Richard Just, brings a really distinct vision to National Journal\u2019s magazine, one that it hasn\u2019t had before.\nBy the time Friday rolls around, our readers know the news.\nI want to write stories that really tell our readers something they don't know, and that\u2019s hard to do: Our readers know a lot.\nHe\u2019s created a really gorgeous magazine for us\u2014one that\u2019s sophisticated, elegant and also really modern."}
