So you see governors, for example, in Florida and Ohio and South Carolina and Michigan, state after state with Republican governors, you see the unemployment rate going down, you see private sector jobs being created, you see Republican governors taking on public pension reform to tackle long-term debt. You see Republican governors embracing school choice and tenure reforms. You see Republican governors cutting taxes, creating good jobs, balancing our budgets, doing fiscally responsible thing,\u201d said Jindal, a Republican, in response to a question about whether there a disconnect between Americans and the Republicans in Washington.\n\nJindal said that disconnect was between Americans and Washington lawmakers of both parties.\n\nO\u2019Malley, a Democrat, said the divide is actually between \u201cideologues that have taken over the once proud party of Abraham Lincoln\u201d and other lawmakers who want to work on issues like raising the debt ceiling and passing an immigration reform bill.\n\n\u201cShutting our country down does not help job growth. Selling America short does not help us build a better future for our kids, and these are the things that the tea party Republicans have brought to our Congress and made it very difficult for Mr. Boehner even to enact the sort of reasonable compromises that all of us took for granted in years past,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.\n\nBut Jindal defended conservatives when asked about Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who has been one of the most vocal lawmakers in the Senate since he was elected.\n\n\u201cI think he's passionate. I'm not one that wants to engage in Republican fratricide. I don't think we need to beat each other up. I think it's a good thing that there are tea party and other conservative members active in our party,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd on immigration, Jindal said that if the president were serious about the issue, he would \u201cstart by securing the border.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, we've got low walls and a narrow gate. That's the opposite of what we need. We need high walls and a wide gate so that more people can come into this country legally,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nAs for one of the most contentious Democratic issues, the Affordable Care Act, O\u2019Malley said he expected perceptions of the program to change once the enrollment period closes at the end of March.\n\n\u201cYou will see most states hitting their goals. You'll see our country having extended healthcare to more people. And all of those that have been scared and frightened that somehow, something's going to happen to their healthcare, will realize that those scare tactics were not true, that those were just falsehoods peddled by the ideological right,\" O'Malley said.\n\nThe National Governors Association (NGA) is holding its annual meeting in Washington this weekend , giving state leaders a chance to highlight their relative success at legislating while Congress is still mired in gridlock.\n\nAs for a possible presidential bid, both politicians demurred on what the future holds.\n\n\u201cThe honest answer is I don't know,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cWe've got 36 governor's races this year; we've got to control the Senate, control the House, we're focused on that.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley said he\u2019s \u201clooking at\u201d a presidential bid, \u201cbut the most immediate responsibility I have is to govern Maryland well.\u201d\n\nAs for how a run by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would affect his decision, O\u2019Malley said, \u201cI think the most important question for any of us who feel that we have something to offer for our country's future is to offer those ideas, and to put those ideas out there, and most importantly, to ask the right questions. Questions like, 'What will it take to make sure our middle class is growing again so we can grow our economy?' And that's what I'm going to be doing, and what the other candidates may or may not do is their choice.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both men demurred on whether a presidential bid was in their future", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bobby-jindal-martin-omalley-face-off-on-which-partys-governors-have-it-right/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/02/23/e2b67eb9-a975-4d44-8641-18e7dbe10d2e/thumbnail/1200x630/2b0473787aa17809fada167ae46993c2/ftn-jindal-223.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Both men demurred on whether a presidential bid was in their future", "title": "Bobby Jindal, Martin O'Malley face off on which party's governors have it right"}, "twitter": {"description": "Both men demurred on whether a presidential bid was in their future", "title": "Bobby Jindal, Martin O'Malley face off on which party's governors have it right", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/bobby-jindal-martin-omalley-face-off-on-which-partys-governors-have-it-right/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/bobby-jindal-martin-omalley-face-off-on-which-partys-governors-have-it-right/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bobby-jindal-martin-omalley-face-off-on-which-partys-governors-have-it-right/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@facethenation", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/02/23/e2b67eb9-a975-4d44-8641-18e7dbe10d2e/thumbnail/1200x630/2b0473787aa17809fada167ae46993c2/ftn-jindal-223.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bobby-jindal-martin-omalley-face-off-on-which-partys-governors-have-it-right/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/bobby-jindal-martin-omalley-face-off-on-which-partys-governors-have-it-right/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FaceTheNation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb11c\"", "article_summary": "It was a battle of the governors on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday as Louisiana\u2019s Bobby Jindal and Maryland\u2019s Martin O\u2019Malley faced off about whether Republican or Democratic governors had more success in their states.\nYou see Republican governors embracing school choice and tenure reforms.\nSo you see governors, for example, in Florida and Ohio and South Carolina and Michigan, state after state with Republican governors, you see the unemployment rate going down, you see private sector jobs being created, you see Republican governors taking on public pension reform to tackle long-term debt.\nYou see Republican governors cutting taxes, creating good jobs, balancing our budgets, doing fiscally responsible thing,\u201d said Jindal, a Republican, in response to a question about whether there a disconnect between Americans and the Republicans in Washington.\nWe need high walls and a wide gate so that more people can come into this country legally,\u201d Jindal said."}
