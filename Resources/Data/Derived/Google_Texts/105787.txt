The National Park Service says five young members of a family were hurt when part of a butte collapsed in Badlands National Park.



Park rangers got a 911 call at 7 p.m. Saturday reporting multiple injuries on the Door Trail.



According to the agency, five hikers fell about six feet when the Badlands butte they were climbing suddenly gave way.



The Park Service says the five had hiked off-trail and had climbed the butte for a photo. Four children and an 18-year-old woman were hurt. One was flown to Rapid City Regional Hospital. Two others were taken by ambulance to the hospital. Two were treated on the scene for minor injuries.



The park has received above-average rainfall this spring, weakening rock ledges and precipices.
