Democrats didn\u2019t object, but took to the House floor to say passing it won\u2019t stop gay marriage from being legalized nationwide eventually.\n\n\u201cSome fine day, my partner and I are going to be able to get married in the great state of Texas. The Supreme Court will hopefully take care of that issue for us,\u201d said Rep. Celia Israel, an Austin Democrat who is one of two openly gay state lawmakers. \u201cWhen that day comes, rest assured that, for those pastors and preachers who will take a more literal interpretation of the bible, my partner of 20 years and I will not be going to them to bless our union.\u201d\n\nTexas\u2019 bill is less divisive than so-called religious objections measures elsewhere, applying only to religious wedding ceremonies and largely restating existing state law - hence Democrats not voting against it. Gay marriage has been banned in the state since voters approved a 2005 amendment to the Texas Constitution.\n\nIt was approved 141-2 after sailing through the Senate last month. A final, largely ceremonial House vote that\u2019ll likely happen Friday would send it to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it into law.\n\nApplauded by conservative preachers and pastors, the bill nonetheless raises some of the same issues as the religious freedom laws that sparked criticism this spring when approved recently in Indiana and Arkansas.\n\nSupporters say such measures protect the freedom to exercise religious beliefs from government intrusion. Advocacy groups argue they allow businesses to refuse service to or otherwise discriminate against gay people.\n\nDebate in the Texas House comes after the nation\u2019s high court heard arguments about the constitutionality of gay marriage for couples across the country, and should the justices rule later in favor of same-sex weddings, it would supersede the state constitutional prohibition.\n\nThursday\u2019s debate was especially heated because of Democrats\u2019 stall tactics last week to kill a bill prohibiting government employees from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. That measure\u2019s supporters chose not to attempt to revive it as an amendment to the clergy bill, but weren\u2019t shy about saying they\u2019d like to keep gay marriage out of Texas.\n\n\u201cWhen you look down the road and you see the legal and cultural environment changing - and you see that the Texas Constitution itself saw that those things would happen,\u201d said the bill\u2019s House sponsor Rep. Scott Sanford, a McKinney Republican. \u201cThe Legislature should pass a law that\u2019s necessary to protect all religious denominations.\u201d\n\nSanford said religious leaders in other states had been threatened with lawsuits and even prosecution for refusing to lead gay marriages, but couldn\u2019t cite examples when pressed by Democrats.\n\n\u201cThis bill is a shield and not a sword,\u201d Sanford said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Texas House voted Thursday to let clergy members refuse to perform marriages that violate their religious beliefs - further shielding the nation's largest conservative state from a possible U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing gay couples to wed.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Texas House voted Thursday to let clergy members refuse to perform marriages that violate their religious beliefs - further shielding the nation\u2019s largest conservative state from a possible U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing gay couples to wed.", "title": "Texas House OKs letting clergy refuse to marry gay couples", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/21/texas-house-mulls-letting-clergy-refuse-to-marry-g/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/21/2f9210d5b5902516770f6a70670038a2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/21/2f9210d5b5902516770f6a70670038a2.jpg", "description": "The Texas House voted Thursday to let clergy members refuse to perform marriages that violate their religious beliefs - further shielding the nation's largest conservative state from a possible U.S. S", "card": "summary", "title": "Texas House OKs letting clergy refuse to marry gay couples"}, "Author": "WILL WEISSERT", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Democrats didn\u2019t object, but took to the House floor to say passing it won\u2019t stop gay marriage from being legalized nationwide eventually.\nGay marriage has been banned in the state since voters approved a 2005 amendment to the Texas Constitution.\nThe Supreme Court will hopefully take care of that issue for us,\u201d said Rep.
