An Oregon woman landed on the $8 million jackpot while playing the slot machine at a Lucky Eagle Casino, but walked away empty-handed when the casino told her the machine malfunctioned.

Veronica Castillo, a mortgage loan officer from Beaverton, Oregon, took her mother to the casino in Rochester, Washington, last weekend. She was elated when she put $100 in one of the slot machines and hit the jackpot — or so she thought.

“I was very excited, happy,” she told a local CBS News affiliate. “Then I couldn’t believe it.”

The casino staff told Ms. Castillo that she hadn’t won the $8 million because the machine malfunctioned.

“They shut off the machine, took it away, printed out a ticket and gave me $80,” she said.

The casino machines all have a sticker on them informing players that a machine malfunction voids all pays and plays, CBS reported.

“To me, it’s cheating, may even be fraudulent,” Ms. Castillo said. “My first thought was, how many people has this happened to? They think they won, then going away empty-handed.”

She is working to get an attorney to claim her winnings.
