Congresswoman Gwen Graham continues her work in the Panhandle.

After stopping in Liberty County Wednesday, she made her way to Chipley Thursday.

The focus of her visit was jobs, and she's aiming to save more than 200 jobs in Washington County.

It's not every day you see someone from Congress with their sleeves rolled up, stuffing and sewing comforters and packing them.

"It was such an incredible experience to be here all day and learn what they do and get to make new friends," said Florida's Second District Representative Gwen Graham.

But that was all part of a bigger visit for Congresswoman Graham at WestPoint Home in Chipley Thursday.

She announced her fourth major piece of legislation, "The Northwest Florida Job Certainty Act."

"What I'm doing announcing this new act is an example of what I'm willing to do, to go the extra mile to make sure that we maintain an ability to have these types of manufacturing jobs," Rep. Graham said.

The act extends the free trade provision between the United States and Bahrain, which expires in 2016.

"That provision helps us bring in duty free products that we then continue to manufacture and provide jobs here and complete the product, and so when that expires, we will lose a competitive edge," explained WestPoint Home Vice President of Business Development Terry Ellis.

Currently WestPoint Home is the last major home-textiles producer in the county and without the extension, the 250 jobs at the factory are at risk.

"This area right here really don't have like opportunities and this job right here is a good opportunity. I mean it's hard to find a job."

Congresswoman Graham says the bipartisan bill has to go before Congress and signed into law by the president before it can be enacted.

Representative Steve Southerland first introduced the act last year.
