Beauty is both biological and cultural — and one can argue that each ethnicity has its own “ideal” versions of beauty. For example, while the U.S. may place thin models on a pedestal, other countries view the plus-sized body as far more attractive.

An online pharmacy called Superdrug Online Doctors aimed to explore these different cultural ideas of beauties and used the same photoshopped image of a woman to do so. The project, called Perceptions of Perfection, spans 18 countries — including Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands, and Ukraine — and used 18 designers to alter the original stock photo into what they believed their country's "ideal" version of beauty was.
