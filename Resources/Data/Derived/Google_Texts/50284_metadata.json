The job is finally done.\n\n\u201cFrom Day One, there was no doubt in my mind that they wouldn\u2019t accomplish it. There was no doubt in their mind that they wouldn\u2019t accomplish it,\u201d manager Ned Yost said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a special, special group that doesn\u2019t come around very often.\u201d\n\nDown 2-0 in the ninth, Kansas City fought back against two of the top arms on the pitching-rich Mets: Matt Harvey and Jeurys Familia. And the Royals won it not with power at the plate but instead an aggressive sprint home by Hosmer on a groundout, a three-run double from Lorenzo Cain, a couple of crucial steals.\n\nConsistent contact, keep the line moving.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have written a better script,\u201d Yost said.\n\nThat\u2019s how Series MVP Salvador Perez and the Royals became the first team since the 2002 Angels to come from behind in all four World Series wins, according to STATS.\n\nThat\u2019s how they washed out the bitter taste of last year\u2019s Game 7 loss to San Francisco at home, an October heartbreak that drove the Royals to their singular focus all season.\n\nNever waver. Win it all. Wipe away the pain.\n\n\u201cKansas City is No. 1. Who cares about what happened last year?\u201d Perez said.\n\nTo get back where they were last fall \u2014 90 feet from tying the Giants in the ninth inning \u2014 the Royals played more than 50,000 pitches of baseball and flew nearly 30,000 miles while crisscrossing the country.\n\nNow, this group of homegrown favorites who revitalized a floundering franchise, Mike Moustakas and Alex Gordon and Hosmer to name a few, can finally rest and rejoice.\n\nNot to be forgotten, major contributions from new additions assembled by general manager Dayton Moore like Ben Zobrist, Johnny Cueto, Kendrys Morales, Chris Young and Alex Rios.\n\nAll together, they take their place in Royals history alongside Hall of Famer George Brett, Bret Saberhagen, Willie Wilson and those unexpected champs from 30 years ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of good that these guys have their own identity,\u201d said Brett, a team executive. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun comparing the two teams.\u201d\n\nNext up, Tuesday\u2019s parade in Kansas City to celebrate the club\u2019s second title, capped with a party at historic Union Station.\n\nWith no margin for error, Harvey put the Mets\u2019 last hope in his hands and hung on as long as he could. After eight scoreless innings, he pushed to pitch the ninth and finally faltered.\n\n\u201cObviously, I let my heart get in the way of my gut,\u201d manager Terry Collins said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work. It was my fault.\u201d\n\nNew York slugger Yoenis Cespedes exited with knee pain but Curtis Granderson hit a leadoff homer, his third long ball of the Series, and the Mets managed two runs against heavy-hearted Royals starter Edinson Volquez, pitching one day after returning from his father\u2019s funeral.\n\nBut for these resilient Royals, no deficit was too large, no time too late.\n\n\u201cWe never quit. We never put our heads down,\u201d Perez said. \u201cWe always compete to the last out.\u201d\n\nPerez looped a leadoff single in the 12th off losing pitcher Addison Reed, and pinch-runner Jarrod Dyson stole second. One out later, Colon stepped in as a pinch-hitter for his first plate appearance since the regular-season finale Oct. 4.\n\nHardly rusty, he lined a 1-2 pitch into left-center and pounded his chest at first base.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a winner,\u201d Yost said.\n\nAlcides Escobar added an RBI double, and Cain\u2019s bases-loaded double off Bartolo Colon broke it open.\n\nRoyals reliever Luke Hochevar, drafted No. 1 overall by the team in 2006, pitched two hitless innings for the win.\n\nAll that was left was for Wade Davis to close it out. He threw a called third strike past Wilmer Flores to end it and tossed his glove high in the air as the Royals rushed toward the mound to celebrate.\n\nOut in the Midwest, fireworks popped from Missouri to cities all over Kansas. Thousands of fans crammed into the Power & Light District, partying as though it was New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nAt Citi Field, hundreds of Royals fans dressed in blue descended toward the Kansas City dugout to cheer their champs. Perez received his MVP award after the catcher hit .364.\n\nLater, the Mets came back onto the field to salute a smaller pocket of fans who stuck around for one last chant of \u201cLet\u2019s go, Mets!\u201d The team remains without a World Series title since 1986.\n\nIt was the eighth comeback victory for Kansas City this postseason, matching a mark also held by the 1997 Marlins and 2002 Angels, STATS said. The tenacious Royals trailed by at least two runs in a record seven of those games \u2014 including when they staved off elimination by overcoming a 6-2 deficit in the eighth inning of an AL playoff game in Houston.\n\nFired up all night, Harvey was at 102 pitches following a 1-2-3 eighth and stalked briskly back to the dugout with one purpose in mind. There, cameras caught him telling Collins \u2014 in no uncertain terms \u2014 he was going back out for the ninth.\n\nCollins relented, and a huge roar went up as Harvey bounded off the bench and sprinted to the mound, looking for his second complete game in the majors. But he walked Cain on a full-count slider, and Hosmer hit an RBI double.\n\n\u201cI wanted it bad. The way the game was going, the last thing I wanted to do was not finish what I started,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cI poured my heart out and gave everything I had.\u201d\n\nHarvey was pulled for Familia, and Hosmer advanced on Moustakas\u2019 groundout to the right side.\n\nSound fundamentals, a Royals staple.\n\nSo up stepped Perez with the potential tying run 90 feet away, same as last year when he fouled out against Giants ace Madison Bumgarner to end the World Series.\n\nThis time, Perez got jammed and hit a slow grounder to third baseman David Wright, who froze Hosmer with a glance and threw across the diamond for the second out.\n\nHosmer, however, bolted for the plate when Wright released the ball. First baseman Lucas Duda fired wide of catcher Travis d\u2019Arnaud \u2014 a good throw probably would have been in time \u2014 and Hosmer made a headfirst dive home with the tying run.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I saw his head turn towards first, I just decided to take a chance,\u201d Hosmer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to take a chance when you\u2019re up three games to one, so just felt it was the right time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fear in anybody on this team,\u201d he added.\n\nHosmer was greeted by excited teammates, while Familia was saddled with his third blown save of the Series, though two were the result of shaky defense.\n\n\u201cThey definitely put their foot on the gas the entire series on the basepaths, and this is just another example,\u201d Wright said.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nCespedes fouled a pitch off the top of his left kneecap in the sixth and crumpled to the dirt in pain. He couldn\u2019t even run to first base when he popped out, and was replaced in center field by Juan Lagares.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIn an unusual bit of fortuitous scheduling, the teams open next season with two interleague games at Kansas City.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kansas City Royals win World Series, rout New York Mets in 12 innings", "title": "Kansas City Royals win World Series, rout New York Mets in 12 innings", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/01/kansas-city-royals-win-world-series-rout-new-york-mets-in-12-innings/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101__royals-moundp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101__royals-moundp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-01T22:44:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:39:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "UP NEXTIn an unusual bit of fortuitous scheduling, the teams open next season with two interleague games at Kansas City.\nAt Citi Field, hundreds of Royals fans dressed in blue descended toward the Kansas City dugout to cheer their champs.\nIt was the eighth comeback victory for Kansas City this postseason, matching a mark also held by the 1997 Marlins and 2002 Angels, STATS said.\n\u201cKansas City is No.\nSo go ahead and crown \u2019em, Kansas City!"}
