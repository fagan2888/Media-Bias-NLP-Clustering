Until I read the whole report.\n\nAs I read the survey, it was predictable\u2014touting the massive success of ObamaCare as single-handedly resolving the problem of the uninsured in California. Then, as the report went on, it began to advocate for California to spend taxpayer money to cover the illegal aliens that even the federal government won\u2019t cover.\n\nA red flag went up. This was not so much a \u201creport\u201d as a shill for more government spending\u2013and not for struggling citizens, but to give free health care to those who came into our country illegally.\n\nPrior to my election to the California State Assembly in 2010, California was facing a $30 billion annual budget deficit, much of which can be attributed to the explosive growth of social programs that create an entitlement based on an individual\u2019s need. The \u201creport\u201d made certain to point out that California is famous for creating entitlements for illegals, even when the federal government excludes them. It\u2019s one of the reasons that California\u2019s cost of living and tax burden is so high.\n\nAs I read this report, I kept hearing echoes of Karl Marx: \u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\u201d\n\nThe \u201creport\u201d noted that in a number of counties in California, where they had a policy against giving taxpayer-paid benefits to illegals, the caseload of indigents had been reduced significantly, down to only a few hundred or even zero cases.\n\nYou\u2019d think that would be a good thing. Maybe we could end a government program, and give back the taxpayers their hard-earned money.\n\nSounds good, right?\n\nBut no\u2013instead of advocating the return of those monies to the taxpayers in the form of a refund, or using them to improve health care services for our long-suffering veterans in the state that is home to more veterans than any other, this organization\u2014Health Access California, a 501 c (4)\u2014has a singular focus: getting everyone on a single-payer, government controlled insurance plan like Medicare.\n\nThey want the government to control as much of our health care process as possible, creating new excuses to raise taxes, paving the way for the creation of more government jobs, and enabling public sector unions to grow at the taxpayers expense. That, in turn, empowers the left for generations to come.\n\nTheir website barely disguises their hard-leftist ideology:\n\nHealth Access California is the statewide health care consumer advocacy coalition, bringing together dozens of other member organizations representing seniors, people with disabilities, children, immigrants, communities of color, health care professionals, people of faith, labor, women, low-income families, and communities throughout California.\n\nAlmost every one of their staffers lists \u201csocial justice\u201d as their primary education or work experience. What most ordinary Californians don\u2019t know is that nonprofits like this organization recruit, hire and train leftist activists to fight against everything you believe in\u2014hard work, paying your own way, playing by the rules\u2014and their efforts are aided and abetted by complicit taxpayer-supported public universities.\n\nIn 2007, I attended my brother-in-law\u2019s graduation from a law school in Berkeley, California. The speaker was none other than our current Lt. Governor, Gavin Newsom, who was then the mayor of San Francisco. I listened as he inspired the class to fight against conservatism at every turn, and undo any and all efforts to control our borders, protect the 2nd Amendment and exercise our religious liberty to worship and believe as we see fit.\n\nAt the time, I was not involved in politics\u2014other than having been a leader of the largest Minuteman Group in California\u2014but I was stunned by what I\u2019d heard. As they read off the list of dozens of hardcore leftist, socialist organizations and nonprofits who had made lucrative offers to hire these idealistic young lawyers to weaken our Constitution, undermine the rule of law, and attack our fundamental freedoms, I felt as if I\u2019d been kicked in the stomach.\n\nIn that moment, I felt powerless to battle such well-funded and powerful forces. But after spending four years inside one of the most corrupt legislatures in the country, where I battled them on a daily basis, I learned that the one thing they fear\u2014maybe the only thing\u2014is effective opposition.\n\nPeople often ask me why government never stops growing, and how the left is so successful at working against the majority of the taxpayers in California. It\u2019s because almost everyone in the process has become desensitized. Overspending has become an addiction for California\u2019s Marxist-progressives, and just like any junkie, they\u2019ve had to resort to crime to support their habit.\n\nHowever, when the government steals from you\u2014and calls it a government program for the poor\u2014you can\u2019t call the police. No one gets punished except the poor working guy who can\u2019t pay the government bite.\n\nWhen political figures are asked to comment on a \u201creport\u201d that is published by a leftist lobbying group, and the \u201creport\u201d is nothing more than a justification for more government spending so that individuals illegally present in our state can have free health care at taxpayer expense, you know the fix is in. Their bias knows no bounds.\n\nIn 2015, it is this kind of blatant, biased pandering that forms the basis for new laws, new government programs, and new handouts. In particular, State Senator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) starting began pushing the \u201cHealth Care For All Act\u201d (SB1005) last year, which would cover illegal aliens, and has re-introduced it again this year as (SB4).\n\nIt\u2019s astounding that such hopelessly biased \u201creports\u201d and \u201cstudies\u201d conjured up by activist groups who will clearly benefit are all it takes to persuade the government to engage in more legalized theft from hard-working Californians in order to provide yet another incentive for illegals to make California their home.\n\nShare this article with your friends if you oppose free healthcare for illegals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Free Health Care for Illegal Aliens: If You Give It, They Will Come", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Free Health Care for Illegal Aliens: If You Give It, They Will Come", "title": "Free Health Care for Illegal Aliens: If You Give It, They Will Come - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/border-protest-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/03/15/free-health-care-for-illegal-aliens-if-you-give-it-they-will-come/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Free Health Care for Illegal Aliens: If You Give It, They Will Come", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/border-protest-AP.jpg", "title": "Free Health Care for Illegal Aliens: If You Give It, They Will Come - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "gavin, government theft, illegal immigration, medi-cal, obamacare, ricardo lara,Breitbart California, Immigration, Obamacare,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "ricardo lara", "published_time": "2015-03-15T05:12:53-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California,Immigration,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "This was not so much a \u201creport\u201d as a shill for more government spending\u2013and not for struggling citizens, but to give free health care to those who came into our country illegally.\nIn particular, State Senator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) starting began pushing the \u201cHealth Care For All Act\u201d (SB1005) last year, which would cover illegal aliens, and has re-introduced it again this year as (SB4).\nTheir website barely disguises their hard-leftist ideology:Health Access California is the statewide health care consumer advocacy coalition, bringing together dozens of other member organizations representing seniors, people with disabilities, children, immigrants, communities of color, health care professionals, people of faith, labor, women, low-income families, and communities throughout California.\nThen, as the report went on, it began to advocate for California to spend taxpayer money to cover the illegal aliens that even the federal government won\u2019t cover.\nShare this article with your friends if you oppose free healthcare for illegals."}
