Fire departments are hurting once again due to Obamacare. This is not the first time the President’s legacy legislation has put fire departments in a bind, as previously reported by the Free Beacon.

Ohio firefighters have had their hours reduced to Obamacare.

Stringent regulations imposed by Obamacare have forced fire departments to either pay for their employees’ health insurance or reduce their hours.

Mike Blackwell, Public Safety Director of Union Fire Department explained to WHIO: “We were scheduling most of our part time employees 39 hours a week. With Obamacare and the regulations, we have to cut all those part time employees down to 29 hours per week.” He says that the city would like to offer healthcare, but they don’t have the money for it.

Josh Rawlins, a firefighter in Brookville, has been forced to find more work. He works for four fire departments now.

The law passed to help firefighters has actually hurt firefighters by making it more difficult to work enough hours to make ends meet.

Ronald Fletcher, Fire Chief for the city of Brookville: “That [Obamacare] has put a crunch because every fire department is basically competing for the same group of part time firefighter, EMT, and paramedics.”
