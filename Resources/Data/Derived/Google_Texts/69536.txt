A hitchhiker allegedly ordered a driver at gunpoint to take her out of state, and claimed she was carrying a bomb.

The victim's boyfriend called Springs police at 8:45 Friday night after receiving a text from his girlfriend that a hitchhiker she'd picked up had a gun and was forcing her to drive to Michigan. Springs police connected the boyfriend with the Fremont County Sheriff's Office after learning the car had crossed the county line on Highway 115.

The victim was able to send occasional texts updating her boyfriend on their location, and contacted him a short time later that she was driving to Canon City where they would stop for gas. When the victim and suspect got to a Loaf n' Jug in Canon City, the victim sent another text to her boyfriend that the hitchhiker claimed to have a bomb in her backpack.

Sheriff's deputies, Canon City police officers and state troopers caught up to the car on eastbound Highway between Canon City and Pueblo. The suspect, identified as 25-year-old Sarah Stanigar of Colorado Springs, was arrested. The victim was not hurt.
