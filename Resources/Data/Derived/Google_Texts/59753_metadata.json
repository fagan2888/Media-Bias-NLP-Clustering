(USATSI)\n\nThe Pac-12 voted Monday to adopt a reform package that includes guaranteed four-year athletic scholarships, liberalized transfer rules within the conference and post-graduate medical coverage for all athletes.\n\nThe changes voted on by Pac-12 presidents and chancellors appear to be the most progressive package put forward by a conference, although they are measures that could have previously been adopted by schools or conferences. The changes come at a time when the Power 5 conferences have the autonomy to vote on and create their own benefits as college sports faces ongoing litigation threats over how athletes are treated and compensated.\n\n\u201cHopefully this demonstrates to anyone that's paying attention that reform is possible within a conference, within the NCAA, and that there are schools out there serious about it and will redirect a lot of resources toward it,\u201d Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott said in an interview with CBSSports.com. \u201cHopefully this makes clear how serious our schools are for doing as much as possible for student-athletes without crossing the line in terms of professionalism.\u201d\n\nThe Pac-12's changes:\n\n\u2022 Guaranteed four-year athletic scholarships while in good standing.\n\nA scholarship will not be reduced or canceled if the athlete remains in \"good standing and meets his/her terms of the agreement.\" The Pac-12 said starting in 2015-16 all of its scholarship agreements offered to recruits will be multiyear agreements for no less than four academic years.\n\nEarlier this month, the Big Ten became the first major college conference to guarantee scholarships across all sports through the duration of an athlete's enrollment at a university. The NCAA is now in its third academic year since passing a rule giving schools the option to provide multiyear scholarships\n\nA recent CBSSports.com analysis showed many universities still don't offer multiyear scholarship agreements. For example, within the Pac-12 in 2013-14, Arizona State provided 18 percent of its athletes with multiyear scholarships, Washington was at 2 percent, UCLA was at 1 percent, and Arizona provided no multiyear scholarships.\n\nThe Pac-12 four-year scholarship requirement will apply to athletes on partial scholarships. For instance, if an athlete was promised a 25-percent scholarship entering school, he or she could be awarded more in a given year but can't be awarded less, Scott said.\n\nThe Pac-12 will allow \u201cgood standing\u201d to be defined by each school's publicized student conduct and athletic conduct policies.\n\n\u201cWhat it is clearly saying is there's been concern out there within the media and otherwise that a scholarship could be taken away by a coach if he or she doesn't like the way the student-athlete is performing,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThe perception and reality have been vastly different. But this is making clear aid cannot be pulled for athletic performance or by the whim of a coach.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Return to school for athletes who don't graduate.\n\nPac-12 athletes will be allowed to return to school to complete their degree. Starting in 2016-17, if a Pac-12 athlete leaves a university in \"good standing\" and has completed half of his or her degree, the athlete can return and receive \"necessary educational expenses\" for remaining terms of the scholarship agreement.\n\nThe Big Ten previously announced it would make a similar guarantee for athletes to continue pursuing an undergraduate degree if it gets \"interrupted for a bona fide reason.\"\n\n\u2022 Enhanced medical support for current and former players.\n\nStarting in 2015-16, Pac-12 schools will be required to provide direct medical expenses for documented athletically related injuries to former players for a period of four years after they leave their team or university.\n\n\u201cThis is meant to respond to concerns that have been expressed that student-athletes put their bodies on the line and there's not good enough care for them after school,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThis is saying for four years or until a student-athlete is 26 years old, they'll have medical expenses.\u201d\n\nThe Pac-12 chose four years in part because by the age of 26 a former athlete is covered by the Affordable Care Act, Scott said. Pac-12 schools will administer the medical expenses for former athletes based on their own specific procedures and injuries will need to be documented by a university medical official in order for coverage to continue.\n\n\u201cEssentially, all schools have a process they go through when an athlete gets ready to leave school where they document what injuries they occurred while there,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThat will be the process by which they then determine what they treat and cover financially over the ensuing four years.\u201d\n\nScott said he was not comfortable yet providing estimates on what the additional post-college medical expenses will cost Pac-12 universities. \"It can be all over the map,\" he said.\n\n\u2022 Liberalized transfer rules within the Pac-12.\n\nThe Pac-12 removed the financial-aid penalty that applies to its transfer rule within the conference. Effective immediately, an athlete who transfers within the Pac-12 can receive an athletic scholarship from the second school immediately provided the athlete is eligible to receive the aid.\n\n\u201cWe're not going to have a rule to withhold aid if you transfer within the conference,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThey don't have to worry about any economic hardship.\u201d\n\nThis rule does not allow athletes who transfer within the Pac-12 to play immediately. That is an NCAA rule that would have to be changed nationally through the association's new autonomy or shared governance structure.\n\n\u201cWe haven't had in any substantive way those conversations yet,\u201d Scott said of eliminating the NCAA's one-year transfer rule. \u201cBut it's something we believe should be discussed. We are encouraging a national discussion about those transfer rules.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Increased athlete representation at Pac-12 meetings\n\nThe Pac-12 now has athletes attending conference meetings to discuss policies. Scott said athletes will have \u201cmeaningful impact\u201d with their voice. He stopped short of saying Pac-12 athletes will have votes at conference council meetings, where each school is represented by an athletic director, senior administrator and faculty rep for one vote per school.\n\n\u201cI'm not opposed to it at all,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe haven't yet figured out whether we'll have a fourth representative per school or add a student-athlete vote. We're going to look at different models.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Will other conferences follow?\n\nThe reality of what the Pac-12 passed: These are items conferences or schools could have already passed -- some do apply these changes already to various degrees -- and areas other conferences could act on as well without NCAA legislation. Scott said he suspects other conferences or individual schools will act in different ways.\n\n\u201cWe decided we didn't want to wait and see what others are going to do if we have the ability to do things ourselves,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think all the things we acted on are things all conferences have been talking about. This was an opportunity to pivot from talk to action and step up.\u201d\n\nThe Pac-12 will rely heavily on each of its schools to self-enforce the reform package. \u201cLike with any conference rule, if there's a concern brought to our attention, we'll have to the ability to review it and discuss it,\u201d Scott said. \u201cBut mostly we're relying on the schools to self-enforce this.\u201d\n\nThe Pac-12 appointed a task force to study the issue of excessive time demands for college athletes and plans to work with the other Power 5 conferences on the topic. Scott noted the issues surrounding time demands are \u201creally, really complicated\u201d that will take a lot of time.\n\n\u201cI met with a group of student-athletes recently and I went around the room and the majority of the room is very leery of the idea of putting demands on them,\u201d Scott said. \"These are successful Olympic athletes and others who want to perfect their craft and want the flexibility to put in extra time outside formal practices. We have to tread very carefully about using blunt instruments on this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pac-12 adds measures addressing four-year scholarships, post-graduate medical expenses, liberalized transfer rules and ongoing education for athletes.", "og": {"site_name": "CBSSports.com", "description": "Pac-12 adds measures addressing four-year scholarships, post-graduate medical expenses, liberalized transfer rules and ongoing education for athletes.", "title": "Pac-12 adopts reforms hoping to help college athletes", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/writer/jon-solomon/24771325/pac-12-adopts-reforms-hoping-to-help-college-athletes", "image": "http://sports.cbsimg.net/u/photos/football/college/img24771342.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pac-12 adds measures addressing four-year scholarships, post-graduate medical expenses, liberalized transfer rules and ongoing education for athletes.", "title": "Pac-12 adopts reforms hoping to help college athletes", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/writer/jon-solomon/24771325/pac-12-adopts-reforms-hoping-to-help-college-athletes", "image": "http://sports.cbsimg.net/u/photos/football/college/img24771342.jpg", "creator": "@JonSolomonCBS", "site": "@cbssports", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 297742330311988, "pages": 25902406772}, "vr": {"content_id": 24771325, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "sports news scores information, NFL football MLB baseball NBA basketball live scores news standings teams players, NCAA college basketball football scores news polls rankings, fantasy football news player rankings advice, fantasy baseball basketball news, CBS fantasy sports, golf tennis soccer autos auto racing tour de france, summer winter Olympics, CBSSports.com Sports Line, CBS SportsLine.com", "googlebot": "NOODP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3cd\"", "article_summary": "Pac-12 athletes will be allowed to return to school to complete their degree.\nWe are encouraging a national discussion about those transfer rules.\u201d\u2022 Increased athlete representation at Pac-12 meetingsThe Pac-12 now has athletes attending conference meetings to discuss policies.\n\u201cThey don't have to worry about any economic hardship.\u201dThis rule does not allow athletes who transfer within the Pac-12 to play immediately.\n\u201cWe're not going to have a rule to withhold aid if you transfer within the conference,\u201d Scott said.\nThe Pac-12 four-year scholarship requirement will apply to athletes on partial scholarships."}
