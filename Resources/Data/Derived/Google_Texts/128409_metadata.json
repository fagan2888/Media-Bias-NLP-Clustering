This fellow is studying how to make more resilient antennas, sort of like temporary tattoos that can be implanted underneath the skin and better relay information from implanted medical devices.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe research could ultimately help improve a variety of health areas, since many areas use implanted medical devices: defibrillators, neural recording devices, cochlear and retinal implants,\u201d Arriens said. \u201cLong-term just refers to the fact that implanted medical devices are, often, not a short-term patient option (think of a pacemaker or ear implant, for example \u2013 patients live with those long-term).\u201d\n\nArriens said the EAPSI program allows graduate students to \u201cgain valuable research experience, plus experience working and collaborating in a foreign country, and they bring back all this knowledge to the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe NSF funding will provide the student\u2019s airfare and a stipend for eight weeks of research in Korea. The National Research Foundation of Korea will provide funding for the student\u2019s living expenses and lab expenses.\n\n\u201cNSF\u2019s investment in EAPSI is matched roughly dollar for dollar by the investment of our international counterparts,\u201d she said.\n\nArriens said additional funding could be provided only if the NSF approves a separate project proposal submitted by the student.\n\nUpdate, 4:05 P.M.: This post has been updated with comment from the NSF.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NSF provided $5,070 to test devices", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) is helping fund the creation of an implantable antenna for health care, which could be used for \u201clong-term patient monitoring.\u201d    The government has so far g", "title": "Feds Help Finance Creation of Implantable Body Antenna for \u2018Long-term Patient Monitoring\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/feds-help-finance-creation-of-implantable-body-antenna-for-long-term-patient-monitoring/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cool-baby-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) is helping fund the creation of an implantable antenna for hea", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cool-baby-150x150.jpg", "title": "Feds Help Finance Creation of Implantable Body Antenna for \u2018Long-term Patient Monitoring\u2019", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDespite their potential use in long-term patient monitoring and wireless biometric tracking there is limited research on [Ultra High Frequency] UHF [radio-frequency identification] RFID for insertion in high-loss human body environments,\u201d the grant said.\n\u201cAntennas operating near or inside the human body are important for a number of applications, including healthcare,\u201d a grant for the project said.\nArriens said additional funding could be provided only if the NSF approves a separate project proposal submitted by the student.\n\u201cThose devices use antennas to record everything from battery levels to patient health.\n\u201cThis specific award supports the student to conduct fundamental bio-engineering research on in-body antennas, which are used to communicate with medical devices implanted inside the body (a pacemaker, for example),\u201d she said."}
