But for many, getting coverage eliminated just one of many barriers to getting health care.\n\nThat\u2019s something Dr. Luis Diez-Morales knows from the calls his Hartford office gets.\n\nThere was the newly insured man looking for a primary care doctor, who\u2019d already found that other physicians aren\u2019t taking new patients or don\u2019t have an opening for several months. A patient called after going to the pharmacy to say she couldn\u2019t afford her insulin and wondered if there was anything else she could take. Another woman wanted an appointment for her mother, who needs a doctor who speaks Spanish.\n\nA 60-year-old man with heart disease called to cancel his next visit because he realized he couldn\u2019t afford the copayments. And a woman who works in a convenience store and doesn\u2019t get paid if she doesn\u2019t work called asking for a Saturday appointment -- a rarity in medicine.\n\nDiez-Morales, a physician at St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center and medical director of the St. Francis Center for Health Equity, spoke as part of a roundtable discussion Wednesday on the barriers the newly insured face in getting health care. It was sponsored by the Connecticut Center for Patient Safety.\n\nPanelists cited a wide range of potential pitfalls that face the newly insured. Among them:\n\nMost people buy insurance without properly understanding their plans.\n\nIt can be nearly impossible to find the details about what drugs a health plan covers.\n\nSome new patients feel disrespected by doctors who rush through their appointments or spend the visit looking at computer screens, making them unlikely to go to a second appointment.\n\nPatients who don\u2019t speak English often have to rely on a patchwork of inadequate solutions to communicate with a doctor.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t have access to a car or public transportation struggle to get to medical appointments.\n\nAnd some patients avoid seeing a doctor because they fear being diagnosed with an illness.\n\nInsurance confusion\n\nOne of the major challenges, panelists said, is consumers\u2019 lack of understanding of how insurance plans work.\n\nThat\u2019s of particular concern because experts believe that people are increasingly going to be responsible for more of their own health care costs. Many health plans already have high deductibles. And increasingly, experts believe, companies are likely to shift from offering their own health plans to giving workers a set amount of money to buy their own coverage on public or private health insurance exchanges.\n\nSteve Glick, president of the Chamber Insurance Trust, which helps businesses with insurance, is among those forecasting the shift. And he said people need far more education about insurance than they have now.\n\nResearch suggests that the vast majority of people don\u2019t know how to define copayments, coinsurance, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs, he said.\n\nInstead, people often buy insurance based solely on the premiums -- the up-front cost they must pay each month -- without realizing how much they might have to pay when they get care.\n\nAs a result, Glick said, people who shopped on the exchanges created as part of the federal health law are realizing that the plans they bought don\u2019t cover a drug they need. Or they didn\u2019t realize they\u2019d have to pay more than $6,000 toward a deductible before the plan would begin paying for a service.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such confusion,\u201d said Glick, who has worked in the industry for 35 years.\n\nThe federal health law requires that health plans provide a description of benefits in a standardized format, known as a summary of benefits and coverage. They\u2019re intended to allow people to compare plans. But Glick said even those summaries are too difficult for most people to understand.\n\nPrescription drugs are a particular challenge, Glick said, because there have been significant changes to cost-sharing requirements. He cited the case of one client, a single mother who works as a paralegal and needs infusions that cost $10,000 per month. In her old plan, they were covered with a $40 copay. But her new plan required her to pay $500 per month for the drug.\n\nGlick said it\u2019s not an isolated problem.\n\n\u201cMajor drugs are not covered the way they used to be, and that\u2019s going to affect many people,\u201d he said.\n\nBut figuring out those changes can be tough, said Doris Peter, director of the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center.\n\nIn trying to find the list of covered drugs for one of the plans sold by Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange, Peter had to navigate through multiple websites.\n\n\u201cIt took me about 11 clicks, and I knew what I was looking for,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is just outrageous, I think, for people to be able to manage.\u201d\n\nOften, understanding a health plan's drug coverage comes down to experiments, Peter said: People get a prescription, go to the pharmacy, and end up with a bill.\n\n\u201cFast food drive through\u201d medicine\n\nThe families Jacqueline Ortiz-Miller works with face even more barriers. Many are below the poverty level. Some are not in the country legally. Often, they have several generations living in a small apartment or are homeless.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to understand that life\u2019s struggles make a huge impact in accessing health care,\u201d said Ortiz-Miller, a community health worker in Hartford who works on a childhood obesity program.\n\nMany of the families she works with don\u2019t have cars or the money for public transportation, so they walk to appointments. When a primary care center moved out of walking distance, many patients were left to figure out how to get there, she said.\n\nIn the Hispanic and African-American communities, Ortiz-Miller said, she often sees a psychological barrier: a fear of diagnosis. \u201cFor many of my families, because of that fear, they won\u2019t see a doctor,\u201d she said. She believes it contributes to the high rates of diabetes, heart disease and obesity in their communities.\n\nAnd among those who go to the doctor, the experience isn\u2019t always positive, she said. Because of changes in insurance, many have been told they can\u2019t see the primary care doctor they\u2019ve developed a relationship with, Ortiz-Miller said.\n\nOthers complain that their appointments are rushed and feel \u201clike a fast-food drive through type of service.\u201d Sometimes, doctors tell them at the start that there\u2019s a 10 or 15 minute limit to the appointment.\n\nMany doctors now use electronic medical records, and Ortiz-Miller said patients perceive their doctors spending more time entering information into the computers and making sure they can bill for services than making eye contact and talking to the patient.\n\n\u201cA lot of my families have been sharing how they feel like they\u2019re not valued and they feel like they don\u2019t matter when they\u2019re at their appointments,\u201d she said.\n\nVenton B. Forbes, executive director of FaithCare, which aims to integrate faith and medicine and helps connect people to free care, said he hears similar complaints from patients who say their doctors spend more time on computers or trying to ensure they get reimbursed than they do learning about their patients.\n\nPatients who don\u2019t speak English face particular challenges. Because qualified interpreters are overbooked, medical offices often revert to having staff interpret, even if they\u2019re not qualified to translate medical terminology, Ortiz-Miller said. There is a language line that people can call for translation, but she said patients often find it cumbersome and uncomfortable to share personal medical information with someone over the phone.\n\nDiez-Morales is the only provider fluent in Spanish in his office, and said that every day, another provider asks him to help with a patient. \u201cI wish I could clone myself 20 times,\u201d he said.\n\nOrtiz-Miller said one solution is to have community health workers play a larger role in the health care system because they can bridge gaps between medical professionals and patients by providing simplified information that\u2019s easy to apply to people\u2019s lives. If patients needs to eat a diabetic-healthy diet, for example, community health workers could help them adapt recipes from their culture and shop in local stores.\n\nDiez-Morales said he believes the health care system will need to adapt to the needs of patients. Among the changes: offering appointments at night and on weekends.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we can afford anymore to say, \u2018Well, we only work from 9 to 5,\u2019\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/05/15/obamacare-got-them-insurance-but-patients-still-face-barriers-to-care/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/05/15/obamacare-got-them-insurance-but-patients-still-face-barriers-to-care/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "The law known as Obamacare helped thousands of Connecticut residents get health care coverage.
