Eric Kearney, D-Cincinnati, was chosen Wednesday by Ed FitzGerald to be his runningmate in the 2014 Ohio governor\u2019s race.\n\nBy Jackie Borchardt\n\nStaff Writer\n\nDemocratic candidate for governor Ed FitzGerald has chosen Ohio Sen. Eric Kearney of Cincinnati to be his running mate in next year\u2019s election.\n\nKearney\u2019s southwestern Ohio roots help balance out a ticket pulled by Northeast Ohio by FitzGerald, Cuyahoga County\u2019s top executive official. Kearney also has the ability to raise money. He and his wife Jan-Michele Lemon Kearney are friends with Barack and Michelle Obama and he served as the co-chair of Obama\u2019s Ohio fundraising committee.\n\n\u201cEric is known for being one of the most effective members of the Ohio legislature, able to reach across party lines to get things done,\u201d FitzGerald said in an email sent Wednesday to supporters. \u201cHe is also a fierce advocate for Ohio\u2019s middle-class families and children and shares my commitment to restoring those values to our state\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nKearney, 50, was appointed to the state Senate in 2005 and was re-elected in 2006 and 2010. He cannot seek re-election next year due to term limits. He has served as the leader of the Senate minority party since 2012.\n\nKearney is a licensed attorney. Before serving in the Senate, he founded one of the country\u2019s largest African-American publishing companies, Sesh Communications, which publishes the Dayton Defender, The Cincinnati Herald and The Northern Kentucky Herald.\n\nFitzGerald and Kearney will likely receive the Democratic Party nomination, facing Republican Gov. John Kasich and Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor. Kearney would be the first black Democrat elected to statewide office in Ohio.\n\nRepublicans quickly criticized the choice, saying there\u2019s a clear contrast between Democrats and the Kasich-Taylor team, noting the state\u2019s rainy day fund was filled and taxes have been cut on their watch.\n\n\u201c[Kearney] has offered continued praise and defense of ObamaCare even after its disastrous rollout,\u201d Ohio GOP Chairman Matt Borges said in a statement. \u201cGiven his record on taxes, ObamaCare, and his support of past Strickland budgets, the Democrats should make their candidate publicly available to the media today and not have him hiding from his positions.\u201d\n\nThe campaign planned to announce Kearney\u2019s run in Cincinnati on Thursday, but news reports hinted an announcement was forthcoming and Kearney was the pick.\n\nKearney could not immediately be reached for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic candidate for governor Ed FitzGerald has chosen Ohio Sen.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/democratic-gubernatorial-candidate-fitzgerald-taps/nbysn/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/11/20/66/4b/Ohio-Union-Fight.JPEG-0d01a.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Democratic candidate for governor Ed FitzGerald has chosen Ohio Sen.", "title": "Dems add Cincinnati senator to governor ticket"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2013/11/20/b9/cc/Ed-Fitzgerald.jpg", "description": "Democratic candidate for governor Ed FitzGerald has chosen Ohio Sen.
