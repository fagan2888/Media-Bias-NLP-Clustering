Getting to Mars could take anywhere from 150 to 300 days, the sort of epic journey that would require a lot of food, supplies, and fuel. This is why scientists are considering different avenues to make the trip a little more efficient. One of those ways is to place the astronauts into a form of \u201cdeep sleep,\u201d also known as torpor, so they don\u2019t need half as many supplies.\n\nYes, it sounds pretty crazy \u2014 and rather strange. Why place a bunch of sleeping people in a spaceship hurtling thousands of miles into space? Who would man the ship? What would happen if they didn\u2019t wake up?\n\nBut there is some scientific basis behind this seemingly science fiction-y notion. Therapeutic torpor, or therapeutic hypothermia, has been used in emergency settings to buy time to save people\u2019s lives. When doctors lower someone\u2019s body temperature, they ultimately reduce their metabolism and slow down all processes, buying them more time to fix issues. \u201cTherapeutic torpor has been around in theory since the 1980s and really since 2003 has been a staple for critical care trauma patients in hospitals,\u201d Mark Schaffer, an aerospace engineer at SpaceWorks Enterprise in Atlanta, said at a conference. \u201cProtocols exist in most major medical centers for inducing therapeutic hypothermia on patients to essentially keep them alive until they can get the kind of treatment that they need.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s idea, however, would be taking this to another level. Astronauts would be placed into torpor and fed through intravenous tubes in order to keep them alive without much fuss \u2014 sort of like hibernating. But in current tests, humans have only been able to stay in torpor for about a week. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had the need to keep someone in [therapeutic torpor] for longer than seven days,\u201d Schaffer said. \u201cFor human Mars missions, we need to push that to 90 days, 180 days. Those are the types of mission flight times we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nNASA plans on studying this some more. \u201c[R]ecent medical progress is quickly advancing our ability to induce deep sleep states (i.e. torpor) with significantly reduced metabolic rates for humans over extended periods of time,\u201d NASA writes on its website. \u201cNASA should leverage these advancements for spaceflight as they can potentially eliminate a number of very challenging technical hurdles, reduce the IMLEO for the system, and ultimately enable feasible and sustainable missions to Mars.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "torpor, deep sleep, astronauts going to mars, therapeutic torpor", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new NASA study introduces the idea of putting astronauts into torpor when sending them on a lengthy trip to Mars.", "title": "Should Astronauts Be Put Into 'Deep Sleep' When Sent To Mars?
