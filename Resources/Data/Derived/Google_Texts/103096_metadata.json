Announced last week, the employer mandate will be postponed, again, for businesses employing 50 to 100 people. President Obama, using his pen, his phone, and apparently a secret decoder ring that lets liberals see provisions in the Affordable Care Act the rest of us can\u2019t, waved his hand and created a new deadline, for a new category of employers.\n\nThese new Obama tricks are because of an old problem. The health care law continues to be deeply unpopular. Obama Democrats know if the mandates and deadlines actually written in the law were to go into effect, millions of Americans would lose their plans (and their doctors, and maybe their jobs) just before the 2014 elections.\n\nObama\u2019s latest lawlessness is all about politics. But Obamacare also makes for an interesting case study in political science.\n\nThe health care law is the only measure in history of such significance that passed with no support from the opposition party. Remember the Louisiana Purchase, Christmas Eve votes, and all the other kickbacks and procedural contortions liberals had to pull in order to keep enough Democrats in line? The law\u2019s passage was extraordinary (another word is \u201cperverse\u201d; or \u201cillegitimate\u201d).\n\nMoreover, most measures end up with some success, some failure, some gray area. Both supporters and opponents can find things to justify their positions. Take 1990s welfare reform. Bill Clinton took credit for it, but a Republican Congress (elected after Hillarycare, Obamacare\u2019s predecessor, imploded) forced the measure to Clinton\u2019s desk. Reforms reduced the welfare rolls, both sides took credit, and the rest was history. At least until President Obama unilaterally repealed the welfare law\u2019s work requirements in 2012.\n\nSame with Clinton\u2019s tax hikes. The economy boomed in spite of them, fueled by the tech bubble. And the GOP Congress forced Clinton to agree to balanced budgets. Result: economic growth and a budget surplus. And, both sides could contend that their policies were the result.\n\nObamacare is different. The big promises made by supporters have all proven false. \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep it,\u201d is 2013\u2019s lie of the year. In politics, that\u2019s saying something.\n\nIn fact, the actual results under Obamacare have so far unfolded exactly as opponents predicted. Or worse. Website: disaster. Premiums: skyrocketing, unless subsidized by government spending, which is also skyrocketing. Insurance coverage: more expensive, while covering less (except for things like free birth control, maternity care for men, and other requirements mandated by Washington).\n\nInteresting things are happening as a result. Obama\u2019s Democrats are using whatever pretense necessary to shore up the law. The result is that Obama\u2019s credibility is in shambles. And the pretenses are revealing much about Democrats\u2019 true political philosophy.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 reaction to the report released February 4 by the Congressional Budget Office has been most telling. Keep in mind that Obama and his liberal allies have consistently relied on the CBO when they liked the CBO\u2019s analysis.\n\nThe CBO report was disastrous for Obamacare and Democrats. The CBO estimated that Obamacare would \u201creduce the total number of hours worked, on net, . . . during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor \u2014 given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive.\u201d The CBO estimates a \u201cdecline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024.\u201d\n\nObamacare will be a drag on economic growth, and it subsidizes working less. It\u2019s a concept as old as the Great Society of the 1960s. All exactly as the law\u2019s critics have predicted.\n\nThe Democratic response to this double-whammy? The White House and Congressional Democrats fell all over themselves to argue that this is a good thing. Less work, and more subsidized living, will free people from \u201cjob-lock.\u201d\n\nSpinning the pretense that the CBO\u2019s prediction of lower growth and less employment is good, Democrats let another mask slip. When Bill Clinton signed welfare reform, Democrats postured as the party of \u201cworking Americans.\u201d Now, Obama Democrats reveal themselves as the party of subsidized government dependency. Never mind those of us who will have to work harder to pay for the \u201cfreedom\u201d of others not to work, and to make up for slower growth.\n\nObamacare presents American voters with a case study from which clear conclusions can be drawn about Democrats and their vision of big, intrusive government. I just hope, beginning in November, they draw the right ones.\n\n\u2013 Cory T. Wilson is a Madison attorney with Heidelberg Steinberger Colmer & Burrow, P.A.
