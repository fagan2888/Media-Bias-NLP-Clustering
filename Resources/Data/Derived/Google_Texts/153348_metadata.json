The exchange is one of a handful of state-based exchanges erected as part of the sweeping health care reform legisation known as the Affordable Care Act. Maximus call centers that service Access Health are located in New York City, Chicago, Hartford and Harrisburg Pa. The Chicago center is the only one currently in operation. The outage comes a week before a health insurance coverage deadline.\n\n\u201cNaturally we are concerned that our call center is not fully functioning during our last week of open enrollment,\u201d said Wadleigh. \u201cMonday is usually our busiest day of the week so consumers calling us should expect very long wait times.\u201d\n\nWadleigh said any consumer who calls Access Health before the enrollment deadline at midnight on Jan. 31 and leaves a message will receive a call back after the deadline to help them enroll. The exchange also is looking into the possibility of adding additional customer service representatives to the call centers between now and Jan. 31 to handle the added volume.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Access Health CT\u2019s customer call center is experiencing a temporary outage, linked to the weekend blizzard, announced Access Health CT CEO Jim Wadleigh.  \u201cMaximus told us that the severity of the snow storm caused a technical outage and has also impaired the ability of Maximus staff to travel to their offices to fix the problem,\u201d Wadleigh said in a news release.
