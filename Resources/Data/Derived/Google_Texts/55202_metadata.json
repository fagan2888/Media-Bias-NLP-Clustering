Unlike many other industrialized nations, the U.S. taxes its citizens and resident aliens on income made anywhere in the world.\n\nThe inspector general's audit found more than 65,000 returns that improperly claimed the foreign tax credit.\n\nAround 16,000 taxpayers also claimed both a tax credit and a deduction for their foreign income, even though they're only allowed one or the other. Those taxpayers claimed almost $3 million worth of the foreign tax credit.\n\nAnd the inspector general said the IRS allowed almost $40 million more in tax breaks to be claimed on more than 188,000 returns, even when the taxpayer didn't submit needed supporting documents.\n\nIn all, that means the IRS improperly allowed the foreign tax credit on almost 270,000 returns. Of those returns, almost three-quarters were completed by paid preparers.\n\nThat still means that the vast majority of the foreign tax credit claims were likely legitimate. In just 2013, for instance, more than seven million returns claimed some $16.7 billion worth of foreign tax credits.\n\nThe IRS agreed with the inspector general's recommendations, which included updating any training materials and finding new strategies to improve compliance by paid preparers. Both the agency and Congress have been looking at ways to crack down on unscrupulous tax preparers.\n\nThe inspector general also urged the IRS to do a better job tracking statistics surrounding the tax credit \u2014 an area where the IRS said it was limited due to budget restrictions.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The credit's goal is to reduce double taxation of income Americans earn abroad.", "description": "The credit's goal is to reduce double taxation of income Americans earn abroad.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Bernie Becker", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The credit's goal is to reduce double taxation of income Americans earn abroad.", "title": "IRS needs stronger security for foreign tax credit", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/254689-irs-needs-stronger-security-for-foreign-tax-credit", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/254689-irs-needs-stronger-security-for-foreign-tax-credit", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-23T16:19-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Bernie Becker", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-23T16:19:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/254689-irs-needs-stronger-security-for-foreign-tax-credit", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The credit's goal is to reduce double taxation of income Americans earn abroad.", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS needs stronger security for foreign tax credit"}, "dcterms.title": "IRS needs stronger security for foreign tax credit"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd1f\"", "article_summary": "That still means that the vast majority of the foreign tax credit claims were likely legitimate.\nIn all, that means the IRS improperly allowed the foreign tax credit on almost 270,000 returns.\nIn just 2013, for instance, more than seven million returns claimed some $16.7 billion worth of foreign tax credits.\nThe inspector general's audit found more than 65,000 returns that improperly claimed the foreign tax credit.\nThose taxpayers claimed almost $3 million worth of the foreign tax credit."}
