(AP) \u2014 Hundreds of people marched through Berkeley for a third night a row, blocking a major highway and stopping a train as activists in this ultra-liberal bastion protest grand jury decisions not to indict white police officers in the deaths of two unarmed black men.\n\nProtesters blocked traffic on both sides of Interstate 80 in Berkeley, while another group stood on and sat on train tracks, forcing an Amtrak train to stop Monday night.\n\nA large group of people began peacefully marching earlier Monday through downtown Berkeley. The first stop for demonstrators shouting, \u201cWho do you protect? Peaceful protest\u201d was the Berkeley Police Department. A line of officers in riot gear blocked them from getting close to the building. The group then headed to a Bay Area Rapid Transit train station and sat outside, prompting authorities to briefly shut down the station.\n\nBut as the night went on, the protesters divided into smaller groups that disrupted traffic and train passengers.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol said in a tweet that some in the crowd tore down fencing to enter the freeway.\n\nMerchants in downtown Berkeley on Monday cleaned up broken glass and took stock of the previous night\u2019s looting after a protest turned that turned violent Sunday night.\n\nAlthough many activists in other parts of the country have gone home, protests in Berkeley and Oakland are still active, reflecting the area\u2019s long history of protest dating to the 1960s.\n\nThe crowds that came out to protest in Berkeley numbered only a few hundred, but some are not college students or residents so much as full-time demonstrators who protest anything \u2014 war, prison conditions and economic inequality \u2014 and sometimes use demonstrations as a pretext for violence and vandalism, just as they did during the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\nBerkeley Mayor Tom Bates said a tiny fraction of protesters are obscuring the wider message calling for reform of policing policies nationwide.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Protesters block highway, stop train in California", "title": "Protesters block highway, stop train in California", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Protesters block highway, stop train in California", "title": "Protesters block highway, stop train in California", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/09/protesters_block_highway_stop_train_in_california/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/police-protests-california.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Protesters block highway, stop train in California", "title": "Protesters block highway, stop train in California", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/police-protests-california.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kristin J.
