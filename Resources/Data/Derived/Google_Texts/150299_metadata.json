Sixty-one percent of employers cite \u201cpreparing for a post-healthcare reform era\u201d as a highly important benefits objective, but only four in ten feel prepared to meet this objective.\n\nFacing a myriad of reforms and regulations, 60 percent of employers say they need help managing the ACA terrain. As companies reassess their approach to benefits, three trends are gaining momentum: increased outsourcing; reliance on private exchanges; and consideration of self-insurance.\n\nOne in three employers expect to outsource more aspects of their benefits program as a direct result of the ACA. Nearly 70 percent of employers expect greater compliance and administrative burdens.\n\nAbout 20 percent of employers expect to offer benefits on a private exchange in the next year. Top reasons are to increase employee choice and to improve the employee experience. Seven in ten employers say it is highly important to offer benefits that meet their employees\u2019 personal needs and help them make better benefits choices.\n\nOf those thinking of self-insuring, 58 percent say the ACA is the impetus and half of those planning to self-insure expect to carry stop loss insurance. Self-insuring medical plans is a less common funding option for smaller firms but is receiving increased attention due to the ACA. Seventy-eight percent of employers expect benefit cost increases due to the ACA, impacting an employer\u2019s health benefits offering.\n\nAn infographic outlining the top challenges and emerging trends for employers can be accessed here: infographic.\n\n\u201cBrokers and carriers are needed to play a strategic role in helping employers navigate the ACA and in identifying the best options for how they can move forward in a changed benefits landscape,\u201d said Ray Marra, Senior Vice President, Group Products at Guardian. \u201cAs employers adapt to the ACA, we\u2019re seeing greater adoption of private exchanges and self-funded medical plans paired with stop loss insurance, so employers can deliver the workplace benefits their employees rely on while addressing the challenges they are facing.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Guardian\u2019s Workplace Benefits or to obtain a copy of The Guardian Workplace Benefits Study SM: Third Annual, please visit https://www.guardiananytime.com/2015-workplace-benefits-study or Guardian Anytime.\n\nAbout the Survey\n\nThe Guardian Life Insurance Company of America\u00ae (Guardian) conducted the Guardian Workplace Benefits Study to showcase how the workplace remains a foundation of financial security for many American households, and how employees rely on benefits for overall feelings of financial preparedness.\n\nThis study presents findings from two online surveys conducted in the fall of 2014 of benefits decision-makers (\u201cEmployers\u201d) and from a survey of 1,706 benefits plan participants (\u201cEmployees\u201d), age 22 or older, who work full time for a U.S. company with at least five employees.\n\nAbout Guardian\n\nThe Guardian Life Insurance Company of America\u00ae (Guardian) is one of the largest mutual life insurers, with $6.8 billion in capital and $1.3 billion in operating income in 2014.
