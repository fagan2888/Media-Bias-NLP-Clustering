Why should I pay a premium for health insurance if I have to pay a deductible before I can use it? This is the complaint I would most often hear when helping people sign up for health insurance. Many people who have never had health insurance also do not understand it’s value and how it can work for them. This is why they need someone who can not only help them pick out a plan but who can also educate them on how their health insurance plan works.

Why do people ask the question presented at the beginning of the article? It’s because many people who have never had health insurance think that once you pay your premium your insurance pays their bills 100%. That’s where the confusion and disappointment starts.

Health insurance and personal responsibility

Your health insurance deductible has a lot to do with personal responsibility. When you choose a higher deductible, in essence, you are taking on more of the responsibility for your health care. By doing so you are raising your personal liability for any covered illness or accident. In turn you are lowering the upfront liability for the insurance company. The reward to you is a lower premium since prices have gone up since the beginning of the ACA.

A deductible is like a credit card in reverse. If you have a credit card with a $5000 credit limit and you never use the card you will never receive a bill. Your balance will remain at zero. When you begin to use the card you will begin to receive a bill that reflects what you owe and your current credit limit. You will have the option to pay the entire bill or a portion of the bill, which is your minimum payment.
