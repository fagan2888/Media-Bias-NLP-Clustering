Burwell acknowledged the error on social media after a Bloomberg News report alleged that the administration had included about 400,000 dental plans in numbers it reported for enrollments under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe mistake we made is unacceptable,\u201d Burwell said on Twitter. \u201cI will be communicating that clearly throughout the (department).\u201d\n\nA White House spokesman later told the Associated Press that the administration had mistakenly over-reported Obamacare enrollment numbers by about 400,000 by double-counting consumers who had purchased both dental coverage and medical insurance coverage separately through Healthcare.gov and various state insurance marketplaces created under the law.\n\nThe mistake represents yet another setback for President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement. (Pool/Getty Images)\n\nAdministration officials had included the extra 400,000 in their enrollment numbers, helping Obama get 7.1 million enrollees \u2014 markedly above his original goal of getting 7 million enrollees. The revised number, to account for the error, as of Oct. 15, will be closer to 6.7 million enrollees, according to the administration.\n\nThe discrepancy was reportedly uncovered by Republican investigators for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nCommittee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) has accused the White House of fudging the numbers deliberately.\n\n\u201cFaced with large numbers of Americans running for an exit from Obamacare, instead of offering the public an accurate accounting, the administration engaged in an effort to obscure and downplay the number of dropouts,\u201d Issa said in a statement.\n\nThe White House has denied those allegations.\n\nWith News Wire Services\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
