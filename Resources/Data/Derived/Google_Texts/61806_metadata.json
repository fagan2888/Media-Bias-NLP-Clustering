When it was announced in 2010, she made what turned out to be a controversial proclamation, arguing that \u201cSolving the obesity epidemic requires far more than anything government can do alone and today\u2019s announcement represents an important step forward to providing Americans with healthier choices so that they can choose to lead healthier lives.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t sit well with NYU\u2019s in-house nutrition activist Dr. Marion Nestle. Nestle, the author ofFood Politics, is one of the most widely quoted voices about nutrition and obesity policy.\n\nFor her and others who urgently demand more government intervention with how we eat, obesity seems less like a public health problem, and more like a news hook. To activists, every report about obesity is a justification to increase food and beverage taxes, lobby for more taxpayer-funded programs, and call for restrictions on advertising of foods they don\u2019t want us to eat.\n\nRegulation-hungry thought leaders like Dr. Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa blame obesity on the failure of public health officials and lawmakers to \u201clegislate change\u201d \u2013 not enough statutes, regulations, public monies spent, or taxes on foods that he thinks are bad.\n\nHowever if it were really just about solving a serious public health problem, these smart people would be able to come up with more narrowly-tailored and useful solutions than the one-size fits all big-government regulatory approaches they\u2019ve been trying to shove down our throats. And instead of demonizing industry, they\u2019d realize that companies that sell food aren\u2019t the enemy, they are a necessary partner.\n\nWhile a conciliatory approach is the sensible one, it isn\u2019t a strategy that helps sell books, raise funds, motivate their base, get media attention, and cajole politicians.\n\nNestle reflected about the first lady\u2019s ongoing anti-obesity campaign in an interview with The Nation\u2019s Bridget Huber in 2012, \u201cLooking back on it, it\u2019s enough to make you weep. So little has been able to be achieved.\u201d\n\nTo activist groups, partnering with industry is akin to signing a pact with the devil. Huber framed the underlying controversy accurately. \u201cIt also raises fundamental questions about whether the goals of public health and those of the food industry are at irreconcilable odds. Should those who seek to address the obesity crisis treat food companies as collaborators or as adversaries?\u201d\n\nThe study published Wednesday suggests an answer to Huber\u2019s question. And it puts the Marion Nestle\u2019s of the world on the wrong side of history. This isn\u2019t just my view, but it seems to be the take of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, no bastion of free-market policy advocacy.\n\nIn a commentary published alongside the report in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, RWJF president Risa Lavizzo-Mourey and colleagues wrote, \u201cThrough the HWCF and similar initiatives, industry is demonstrating that it can be part of the solution. So we both congratulate these companies and call upon them and other industry leaders to join together with the health community to go even further to help all children achieve a healthy weight.\u201d\n\nThose who care about public health, rather than scoring political body blows should agree. But the call should go further. We should urge public health groups to realize that the way towards progress for healthy eating is to encourage this type of voluntary dialogue backed up by results.\n\nActivists in the public health community should latch onto this positive example of private-sector driven progress and put an end to divisive rhetoric that demonizes food companies rather than helps consumers be healthy. Think of it this way: When it comes to addressing obesity, carrots work better than sticks.\n\n[Originally published at Pundicity]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/09/food-fight-can-food-companies-help-battle-obesity/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/foodb.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Food Fight: Can Food Companies Help Battle Obesity?"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "And instead of demonizing industry, they\u2019d realize that companies that sell food aren\u2019t the enemy, they are a necessary partner.\n\u201cIt also raises fundamental questions about whether the goals of public health and those of the food industry are at irreconcilable odds.\nShould those who seek to address the obesity crisis treat food companies as collaborators or as adversaries?\u201dThe study published Wednesday suggests an answer to Huber\u2019s question.\nFor her and others who urgently demand more government intervention with how we eat, obesity seems less like a public health problem, and more like a news hook.\nActivists in the public health community should latch onto this positive example of private-sector driven progress and put an end to divisive rhetoric that demonizes food companies rather than helps consumers be healthy."}
