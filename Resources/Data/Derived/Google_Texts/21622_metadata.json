Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nThe controversy over the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s treatment of tea-party groups is fading in Washington. But for some House Republicans, it is still heating up.\n\nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) filed an impeachment resolution on Tuesday against IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, the turnaround expert who was brought in to clean up the tax agency in 2013. Mr. Chaffetz was joined by 18 fellow Republicans.\n\nThe charges focus on the destruction of magnetic tapes that contained e-mails from Lois Lerner, the former agency executive whose office gave extra scrutiny to the groups.\n\n\u201cJohn Andrew Koskinen engaged in a pattern of deception that demonstrates his unfitness to serve as Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service,\u201d the resolution says, focusing on Mr. Koskinen\u2019s statements last year about the agency\u2019s efforts to retrieve documents for congressional investigations. \u201cCommissioner Koskinen made a series of false and misleading statements to Congress in contravention of his oath to tell the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe IRS vigorously disputes the allegations in the resolution. We have fully cooperated with all of the investigations,\u201d the agency said in a written statement.\n\nThe move came just hours after Mr. Koskinen testified in the Senate in a hearing that was at times testy but lacking in the kinds of confrontation that have persisted in the House for more than two years.\n\nSenate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) told Mr. Koskinen that he had a \u201chigh opinion\u201d of him, adding that the statement would get him \u201cin trouble\u201d with the House. The impeachment resolution came four days after the Department of Justice said that no one, including Lerner, would be prosecuted.\n\nThe odds are against Mr. Chaffetz\u2019s impeachment bid. Even if the House went ahead and impeached Mr. Koskinen, it would take 67 votes in the Senate \u2013 and thus at least 13 Democrats \u2013 to remove him from office.\n\nThe House hasn\u2019t impeached anyone except judges and President Bill Clinton since 1876.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) filed an impeachment resolution on Tuesday against IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, the turnaround expert who was brought in to clean up the tax agency in 2013.
