We are all asking that,\u201d said Darren Ripley, coordinator for the Maine Alliance for Addiction Recovery.\n\nThe recent surge in heroin and opiate overdoses \u2013 including 14 during a 24-hour period in Portland last week \u2013 has elevated public awareness about a drug problem hitting big cities and small towns in Maine and throughout the country. It also has intensified public debate over whether Maine needs to invest in drug treatment programs or, as Gov. Paul LePage insists, in additional drug agents to target dealers and gangs bringing the deadly opiates into the state.\n\nLePage surprised some in the treatment community when, in a July 29 radio addressand in a letter to legislative leaders this month, he suggested a Maine Department of Health and Human Services fund for drug programs was under-utilized.\n\n\u201cFor those who are addicted to deadly opiates like heroin, there is help, even if you don\u2019t have insurance,\u201d LePage said. \u201cThe liberal media claims that reductions in welfare eligibility for able-bodied young adults have reduced drug treatment options for addicts. This is false. DHHS has money available for drug treatment, even for those who don\u2019t have Medicaid or private insurance. In fact, we have hundreds of thousands of dollars left over every year in this program. We have the resources to help those who need it.\u201d\n\nThose statements have left more than just substance abuse providers puzzled.\n\n\u201cYour administration claims that there are funds for substance abuse treatment that are not being used, but neither the legislature nor the substance abuse providers are aware of the funding you reference,\u201d House Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick,wrote in a letter to LePage on Friday. \u201cWe are interested in learning more about that.\u201d\n\nDrug recovery experts say access to clinical help depends on the level of treatment needed \u2013 in other words, residential treatment versus outpatient \u2013 and a person\u2019s ability to pay for it.\n\nBob Fowler at Portland\u2019s Milestone Foundation, which currently runs the city\u2019s only inpatient detoxification program that serves adult heroin addicts, said this week that demand for his 16 beds far outstrips availability. Likewise, David Faulkner at Day One Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services said he \u201calways runs waiting lists\u201d for the 30-plus beds available for youth addicts in three locations. Faulkner, who said opiate addicts account for a growing share of the youths treated in their residential facilities, said options for adults without insurance or coverage through MaineCare \u2013 the state\u2019s Medicaid program \u2013 are \u201cfew and far between.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all shocked,\u201d Faulkner said about the excess money LePage said is available. \u201cAs far as I know, it doesn\u2019t exist. And I would know because I would be accessing it.\u201d\n\nDHHS provided only basic information about the unexpended funds in response to repeated requests from the Portland Press Herald over three days.\n\nDepartment spokesman David Sorensen would only say the surplus has generally been \u201cin the low six figures\u201d and that the federal money was intended for treatment or counseling provided to uninsured Mainers.\n\n\u201cThe pot of money would be funds available to the department for the provision of substance abuse treatment to the uninsured,\u201d Sorensen wrote in an email. \u201cThis is money that goes to reimbursing providers for services rendered, for a combination of inpatient and outpatient care.\u201d Sorensen added that the \u201csupply-demand pinch\u201d for services for Mainers with intellectual or developmental disabilities is far greater than those for heroin addicts.\n\nSorensen said that spending on treatment has increased during LePage\u2019s time in office, noting that between state and federal funds the administration earmarked nearly $70 million for addiction treatment last year.\n\nAsked whether DHHS should be letting providers know that there is additional money available, given the growing opiate problem, Sorensen appeared to dismiss the suggestion.\n\n\u201cDHHS doesn\u2019t just hand out unlimited money to anyone who asks for it (anymore) without a demonstrated need defined by clear criteria,\u201d he wrote. Sorensen later wrote that \u201cunused funds generally are given to providers at the end of the year based on a demonstrated need.\u201d But that contradicted an earlier email to a Press Herald reporter stating that \u201cwe\u2019re still putting money back into the General Fund from unspent (Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services) funds.\u201d\n\nDEMAND RISING SHARPLY\n\nThose working in the field questioned why any treatment money would go unspent given the demand they are seeing every day and the rising numbers of overdose deaths.\n\n\u201cI fielded three calls from people today who needed help and they can\u2019t get into a place because they don\u2019t have (insurance),\u201d said Ripley, with the Maine Alliance for Addiction Recovery. \u201cIf there is all of this money left over, why is it not being distributed to the treatment agencies to get these people help?\u201d\n\nThe number of Mainers seeking treatment for heroin addiction swelled from 1,115 in 2010 to 3,463 last year, according to the Maine Office of Substance Abuse. The annual budget of that office increased from $18.6 million in fiscal year 2010 to $21.5 million in the fiscal year that began July 1 \u2013 an increase of 16.6 percent over a five-year period.\n\nIn his July 29 radio address, LePage said the state had \u201cincreased funding for addiction treatment from $7 million to $17 million since I\u2019ve been governor,\u201d beginning in 2011. Sorensen did not respond to a request Friday for clarification about the discrepancy between LePage\u2019s statement and the Maine Office of Substance Abuse figures.\n\nAs with other healthcare issues, the availability of heroin treatment programs is directly affected by insurance company policies, as well as state and federal reimbursement rates.\n\nMost private insurers will not cover inpatient detoxification treatment for opiate addictions and many hospitals will only admit opiate addicts if they have another medical condition that requires immediate care. As a result, addicts who don\u2019t have insurance or can\u2019t afford to pay out-of-pocket for costly residential treatment often struggle to access the most advanced care that professionals say is sometimes needed to break the intense addiction cycle of opiates.\n\nThis summer, Mercy Hospital closed its Mercy Recovery Center in Westbrook that offered inpatient detoxification beds for heroin addicts and others with substance abuse problems. While Mercy continues to provide outpatient treatment to some clients \u2013 and has connected the remaining clients with a physician willing to provide treatment with the drug suboxone \u2013 the hospital is no longer providing inpatient care to opiate addicts unless they have another medical condition.\n\nPatricia Kimball, executive director of Wellspring Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services in Bangor, said the lack of residential beds for opiate addicts combined with changes to MaineCare eligibility have created a sizable gap for services.\n\nKimball estimated that there are 50 people on the waiting list for the 28 beds operated by her organization. Roughly three-quarters of those people have no insurance coverage or do not qualify for MaineCare because they are considered able-bodied adults without children. While the state provides grant funds to pay for some of the uninsured individuals who request placement with Wellspring, the organization doesn\u2019t have the money or the capacity to meet the demand, she said.\n\nKimball said she was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d to hear there may have been unexpended money.\n\n\u201cThe funding that the governor is referring to, I\u2019m very happy that it is there,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how to access it.\u201d\n\nINTERDICTION VS. TREATMENT\n\nThe discussion and confusion about any unspent treatment funds also highlights the stark difference between LePage, who wants more investment in drug agents, and providers in the treatment community.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging news conference held May 29 at the Blaine House, LePage railed against the Legislature for not funding his request for additional agents at the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency. He then told a story about a traffic stop that he said was relayed to him by the Maine State Police. He said that a man was stopped for speeding on I-95. During the stop, the governor said, the man overdosed, prompting emergency service personnel to inject him with Narcan, a drug that reverses the effects of opioids such as heroin.\n\n\u201cIt was the second Narcan shot that week (for the man), the 10th since January,\u201d LePage said. \u201cThe 10th.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd my friends on the other side of the aisle don\u2019t see the problem.\u201d LePage then argued that he had increased treatment funding.\n\n\u201cWhen is it enough?\u201d he said. \u201cWhen are we going after the bad guys? I\u2019m not looking to put the users in jail, because quite frankly, we don\u2019t have enough room. I\u2019m looking to go after the traffickers. I don\u2019t care about the users. We\u2019ll get them in clinical therapy and that can be dealt with \u2013 if they chose to.\u201d\n\nFaulkner, who runs the Day One facility for youth with addiction problems, said investing in more law enforcement was fine with him as long as more money was also put into treatment, because imprisoning dealers only addresses part of the problem.\n\n\u201cIf you have a demand, other people will come\u201d to replace arrested dealers, Faulkner said. \u201cSo you have got to suppress the demand, and the only way to do that is treatment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state is quiet after the governor says in his weekly address that DHHS has heroin treatment money.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "The state is quiet after the governor says in his weekly address that DHHS has heroin treatment money.", "title": "Abuse specialists question LePage funding claim - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/609750_768797-Lepage2.jpg", "height": 672}, "updated_time": "2015-08-08T20:46:18-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/08/08/abuse-specialists-question-lepage-funding-claim/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/609750_768797-Lepage2.jpg", "description": "The state is quiet after the governor says in his weekly address that DHHS has heroin treatment money.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Abuse specialists question LePage funding claim - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2015-08-08T03:58:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-08T20:46:18-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "We have the resources to help those who need it.\u201dThose statements have left more than just substance abuse providers puzzled.\n\u201cThe liberal media claims that reductions in welfare eligibility for able-bodied young adults have reduced drug treatment options for addicts.\nThis summer, Mercy Hospital closed its Mercy Recovery Center in Westbrook that offered inpatient detoxification beds for heroin addicts and others with substance abuse problems.\n\u201cYour administration claims that there are funds for substance abuse treatment that are not being used, but neither the legislature nor the substance abuse providers are aware of the funding you reference,\u201d House Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick,wrote in a letter to LePage on Friday.\nDHHS has money available for drug treatment, even for those who don\u2019t have Medicaid or private insurance."}
