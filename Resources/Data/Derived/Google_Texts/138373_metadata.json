And the timeline for training the workers is tight. According to the new health law, people can begin shopping among the new policies on Oct. 1. The enrollment period lasts six months. Coverage begins in January.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of concern about whether, with all these state requirements, they are going to be ready to go,\u201d said Katie Keith, a former research professor at Georgetown University, who has been tracking the heath care legislation. \u201cYou want people out there educating consumers.\u201d\n\nDeploying the guides for the uninsured is one the first hurdles for the new health system as it transitions from an abstract political debate in Washington to a real-life process in communities. It is one of the steps government officials are concerned about as critics warn that the Affordable Care Act could become a \u201ctrain wreck.\u201d\n\nThis report from WTVY-TV details some of the confusion about Obamacare that navigators would be positioned to help clear up:\n\nThe guides will be sent to community events with laptops to help people sign up for insurance online. They will work at food banks, shelters, churches and free clinics where the uninsured are likely to be. TheBlaze blog noted last month that Planned Parenthood, for example, is among one of the groups receiving federal grant money hire navigators to help inform people about the new healthcare plan.\n\nCVS has also invited such guides into its stores to help people sign up for Obamacare.\n\nBut the short time available for training raises questions about how prepared the workers will be to answer people\u2019s questions about the different policies and government subsidies available. Community groups received the course materials for the 20-hour training only days ago. Many have just begun to post the openings on job boards.\n\nA small scream came from Tara McCollum Plese when she was asked whether her group, Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers, has hired any of the 45 workers authorized in its federal grant. \u201cAck! No,\u201d she said Thursday. Her group has posted a job description, she said, and is now flooded with inquiries for the positions, which pay about $15 an hour. She\u2019s since heard one worker has been hired.\n\nNot one navigator has been hired yet under the $2 million grant obtained by the Ohio Association of Foodbanks. The Illinois Eye Institute, which will help with enrollment in the Chicago area, plans to train a dozen staffers for the task.\n\nThe work will be more difficult than what most other temporary employees, such as census workers, do. The navigators must listen to a family\u2019s real-world story, assess its income, and figure out eligibility for the Medicaid program, which provides health care for the poor, or for new tax credits, each with its own complicated rules.\n\nIf the system works as federal officials hope, more than half of the nation\u2019s uninsured, which amount to 15 percent of the population, will get coverage.\n\nIn Texas, with the highest percentage of uninsured residents, eight groups are receiving a total of $10.8 million and plan to train more than 150 paid workers and volunteers. Tim McKinney, CEO of United Way of Tarrant County, which got the largest grant, said many people without insurance are looking for information.\n\nIn Mississippi, workers will go into rural areas without Internet access to help people with the enrollment and policy-shopping process, which is done online.\n\n\u201cWhen Oct. 1 rolls around, we\u2019re going to be ready to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll,\u201d said the Rev. Michael O. Minor of Oak Hill Baptist Church in Hernando, Miss.\n\nIn 17 states, navigators have additional hoops to jump through because of new state laws affecting the federal health care law, such as required background checks for the workers.\n\nRepublican members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce have also called on some of the assisting groups to explain how consumers will be protected when they speak with a navigator. The Republicans\u2019 letter sets a Sept. 13 deadline for the groups to produce documents.\n\n\u201cThis request threw us for a loop quite honestly,\u201d said Plese of the Arizona health center group. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even drawn down any funds from the grant.\u201d\n\nWill there be enough time for the hiring and training?\n\n\u201cIt has to be enough time,\u201d said Laura Goodhue, executive director of Florida CHAIN, a consumer health group involved in the training. \u201cWe have to do what we have to do.\u201d\n\nAP writer Ann Sanner contributed to this report from Columbus, Ohio.
