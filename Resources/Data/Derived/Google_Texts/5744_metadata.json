Hamilton County Democratic Chairman Tim Burke noted that the party did pick up one judgeship it didn't have previously, as well as a state Board of Education seat that it shares with Warren County. Cecil Thomas handily kept the 9th Ohio Senate District blue despite a strong push and a lot of money from Republican Charlie Winburn. And Auditor Dusty Rhodes easily held off challenger Mike Mezher Jr.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be Pollyanna \u2013 we got our asses handed to us,\" Burke said. \"That's slower progress than I'd like.\"\n\nIn addition to Luken and Branch, other Democratic losses included Fanon Rucker for the 1st District Court of Appeals and Ray Pater for Hamilton County Domestic Relations Court. Courthouse races aside, Micah Kamrass was unable to hold the 28th Ohio House District that's being vacated by fellow Dem Connie Pillich in northeast Hamilton County, and Republican Commissioner Chris Monzel coasted back into office despite some community anger over his removal of Music Hall from the icon tax in August.\n\nBurke's Republican counterpart, Alex Triantafilou, was thrilled with Tuesday's results in a county where President Barack Obama took 26,000 more votes than Republican Mitt Romney two years ago.\n\n\"This county goes back and forth,\" Triantafilou said. \"It's purple. But it's red tonight.\"\n\nAnd Tuesday's results will mean judgeships for three more Republicans: Judge Russell Mock will be leaving a vacancy on Municipal Court after being elected to the Court of Appeals; Winkler's win will leave a Common Pleas judgeship open; and Patrick Dinkelacker, who was elected to Common Pleas, will leave a Court of Appeals opening.\n\nGov. John Kasich will make those appointments based on recommendations from the county, and Triantafilou said early Wednesday that he had already begun hearing from Republicans interested in the jobs.\n\nWhile Republicans move onward and upward, Democrats are assessing where they go from here. Rob Richardson Jr., a Hamilton County Democratic insider, said his party needs to make changes at both the state and local levels.\n\n\"This wasn't a good night no matter how you look at it,\" he said. \"It's clear that mistakes were made. I'm not necessarily pointing to any particular person.\"\n\nRichardson wants to see better candidate recruitment and a grassroots infrastructure that doesn't depend on presidential campaigns to get out the Democratic vote.\n\nBurke, however, feels good about the prospects of several young Hamilton County Democrats.\n\n\"Micah may have lost tonight, but he's a superstar in the making,\" Burke said. Cincinnati Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld \"is our next statewide candidate, I think.\"\n\nHe also mentioned state Rep. Denise Driehaus and state Rep.-elect Christie Bryant as rising stars.\n\nRichardson said the party and its candidates also need take a hard look at their messaging: \"When you let one side define the issue and you're always reacting, you lose. Democrats have had trouble going on offense. Look at the Affordable Care Act. Democrats run away from it even though it's working.\"\n\nConversations are sure to continue as the reverberations of this midterm election are felt from the halls of Congress to the halls of the Hamilton County Courthouse.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1tZAMl6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Democrats are assessing what went wrong as the Hamilton County Courthouse remains mostly Republican.", "p": {"domain_verify": "8c50ff021dfc409ea7325f425f178799"}, "og": {"site_name": "Cincinnati.com", "description": "Democrats are assessing what went wrong as the Hamilton County Courthouse remains mostly Republican.", "title": "County Dems 'got our asses handed to us'", "url": "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/columnists/cindi-andrews/2014/11/05/hamilton-county-democrats-chalk-up-few-wins/18521677/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrats are assessing what went wrong as the Hamilton County Courthouse remains mostly Republican.", "title": "County Dems 'got our asses handed to us'", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/af17e44ffec8fea6390df6ae3c9ab4700ced7aec/c=151-0-790-639&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/08/07/landsmanburkesittenfeld.jpg", "creator": "@enquirer", "site": "@enquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600019252", "fb": {"app_id": 157995810912644}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Republican Party", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Republican Party", "title": "County Dems 'got our asses handed to us'", "author": "Cindi Andrews", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/cindi-andrews", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e43714def2c773d77e69b74605f0169de62bfef0/c=232-0-711-639/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/08/07/landsmanburkesittenfeld.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4fbb139fafb829c7268b4247ba6985dca1782e6b/c=151-0-790-639/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/08/07/landsmanburkesittenfeld.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/695c7d51ebbc96ccb5aa170c4d9efd07d433fedf/c=43-0-898-639/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/08/07/landsmanburkesittenfeld.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc932ffd780a9becf62c8cf700627d7314e8c270/c=0-55-943-583&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/08/07/landsmanburkesittenfeld.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-11-05T15:16:35.120000-05:00", "shorthed": "County Dems 'got our asses handed to us'", "articleid": 18521677, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d0fbe729732d0f9f59bc001dab3ca537f0a1d450/c=0-55-943-583/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/08/07/landsmanburkesittenfeld.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d98c8ea41858074495bc2f6ab9a6371213443f45/c=290-0-651-639/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2014/08/07/landsmanburkesittenfeld.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Russell Mock, Charlie Luken, Ralph Winkler, Jerry Metz, Pat Foley, Jennifer Branch, John Williams, Charles Miller, Carl Stich, Tim Burke"}, "article_summary": "Hamilton County Democrats had a disappointing Election Day in what's supposed to be purple territory, even if they didn't do quite as badly as their statewide counterparts.\nBuy Photo Greg Landsman, center, is considering running against Hamilton County Commissioner Chris Monzel if Democrat Sean Feeney withdraws from the race.\nBurke, however, feels good about the prospects of several young Hamilton County Democrats.\nConversations are sure to continue as the reverberations of this midterm election are felt from the halls of Congress to the halls of the Hamilton County Courthouse.\nRob Richardson Jr., a Hamilton County Democratic insider, said his party needs to make changes at both the state and local levels."}
