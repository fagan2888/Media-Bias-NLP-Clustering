Again.\n\nFive-time Pro Bowl linebacker James Harrison is returning to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 36-year-old Harrison signed a two-year deal with the team on Sunday following a productive 2014 in which he had 5\u00bd sacks after being lured out of a brief 18-day retirement.\n\nHarrison tweeted \u201cI\u2019m back\u201d while posting a picture of him signing the deal to Twitter.\n\nThe 2008 NFL Defensive Player of the Year began a training program when the offseason began and was weighing another run in Pittsburgh or joining former Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau in Tennessee.\n\nThe signing gives the Steelers needed depth at outside linebacker after Jason Worilds abruptly retired at 27 two weeks ago rather than try and land a massive payday.\n\nHarrison joins Jarvis Jones as the only players with more than nominal NFL experience at the position on the roster, though the team figures to grab at least one more edge pass rusher in the draft.\n\nThe timing also gives Harrison months to prepare for a 13th NFL season. He admitted it took him a handful of games to get into proper shape when he rejoined the Steelers last September.\n\nOnce he found his legs, however, Harrison showed flashes of the man who was among the league\u2019s most feared players during his prime. He had two sacks in consecutive games in victories over Indianapolis and Baltimore at midseason.\n\nHarrison missed a pair of games with a knee injury but roared back with 1 1/2 sacks in a win over Kansas City that clinched a playoff berth for the eventual AFC North champions.\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s defense will have a slightly new look in 2015 after linebackers coach Keith Butler took over for LeBeau, a Hall of Famer whose contract was not renewed in January.\n\nThe Steelers have made creating a better pass rush a top priority after finishing with just 33 last season, 26th in the NFL.\n\nHarrison, who turns 37 in May, is second in Pittsburgh history with 69\u00bd sacks. His 17 multi-sack games are a team record.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Steelers re-sign LB James Harrison to two-year deal", "title": "Steelers re-sign LB James Harrison to two-year deal", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/22/steelers-re-sign-lb-james-harrison-to-two-year-deal/", "image": {"width": 555, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150322__9636923p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150322__9636923p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-22T11:36:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T01:03:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Five-time Pro Bowl linebacker James Harrison is returning to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nThe timing also gives Harrison months to prepare for a 13th NFL season.\nHarrison tweeted \u201cI\u2019m back\u201d while posting a picture of him signing the deal to Twitter.\nHe admitted it took him a handful of games to get into proper shape when he rejoined the Steelers last September.\nThe 36-year-old Harrison signed a two-year deal with the team on Sunday following a productive 2014 in which he had 5\u00bd sacks after being lured out of a brief 18-day retirement."}
