The state then provided to the newspaper a website link containing a listing of compliance documents of hospitals throughout the state. However, Regional Hospital\u2019s current report was not posted on the site and a department spokeswoman said it would not be posted until 41 days after the investigation is completed.\n\nRegional Hospital on Friday made arrangements to provide the compliance report Monday to the newspaper for review on site by a reporter. The state made no such accommodation and could not explain why it waits 41 days to post reports online, other than stating it has up to 41 days to post the report.\n\nThe report reveals that the hospital had nursing shortages in the Intensive Care Unit, fourth floor Telemetry Unit, and 7 East Medical/Surgical Units. As a result, the department on May 5 issued an order, which was carried out May 7, limiting the number of patients in those units.\n\nThe report said the hospital also failed to properly equip, operate and maintain eight units. For example, two rooms in the emergency department had unlocked cabinets containing syringes, needles, sutures and iodine, and two patients were unattended at the time of the inspection. These supplies have since been secured. Various maintenance issues must be addressed, such as replacing carpeting, countertops and furniture, repairing damaged walls, floors and plumbing fixtures and cleaning.\n\nA Medical Staff Executive Committee, a liaison between staff, administration and trustee board, was faulted several times in the state\u2019s report.\n\nDuring the prior 12 months, the committee had minimal discussion about nursing shortages and did not have a plan to address the problem. Staff members said they told the committee that nurses were \u201coverwhelmed,\u201d and recruitment and retention were issues, as many new employees \u201cget experience and move on.\u201d Nurses also reported to the committee that morale was low and other issues \u201csnowball\u201d from short-staffing.\n\nThe report suggests several options to reverse nursing shortages including using overtime or contract labor, transferring patients to other units or other hospitals or limiting admissions to particular units.\n\n\u201cIn response to the state survey, we have implemented more thorough documentation of our nurse staffing, which is adjusted based on the number and acuity of patients in our care,\u201d the hospital\u2019s statement said.\n\nRegarding retention and recruitment, nurse managers attended three job fairs regionally and held a job fair on campus on April 29; criteria were redefined for RN and LPN career ladders; sign-on and enhancement bonuses have begun; weekly recruitment meetings are held; and staffing assignments are better documented.\n\nContact the writer: jlockwood@timesshamrock.com, @jlockwoodTT on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"title": "State found Regional Hospital of Scranton had nursing shortages", "author": "JIM LOCKWOOD, STAFF WRITER", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "JIM LOCKWOOD, STAFF WRITER", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1884116"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "bitly-verification": "68008dbe9586", "DC.title": "State found Regional Hospital of Scranton had nursing shortages"}, "article_summary": "A recent state Department of Health surprise investigation of Regional Hospital of Scranton found nursing staff shortages in three units \u2014 including intensive care \u2014 that overwhelmed staff and led to poor recruitment and low morale.\nDuring the prior 12 months, the committee had minimal discussion about nursing shortages and did not have a plan to address the problem.\nThe report reveals that the hospital had nursing shortages in the Intensive Care Unit, fourth floor Telemetry Unit, and 7 East Medical/Surgical Units.\nThe state then provided to the newspaper a website link containing a listing of compliance documents of hospitals throughout the state.\nRegional Hospital on Friday made arrangements to provide the compliance report Monday to the newspaper for review on site by a reporter."}
