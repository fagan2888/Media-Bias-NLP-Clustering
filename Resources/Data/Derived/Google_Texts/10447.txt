Three hours after the U.S. Women’s national team defeated China on Sunday 2-0 at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park, U.S. Soccer unexpectedly fired head coach Tom Sermanni.

“We want to thank Tom for his service the last year and a half. But we felt that we needed to go in a different direction at this time.” Sunil Gulati, the president of the U.S. soccer federation, said in a news release.

After the game, Germanni certainly didn’t look like someone expecting to be fired. He was in a good mood, talking about his team’s victory.

Three hours later, U.S. Soccer made the announcement through a news release.

“I’m disappointed that things didn’t work out, but I’d like to thank U.S. Soccer for the opportunity to have coached this team and also the staff and players for all their hard work,” Sermanni said in the release.
