Harding will remain employed by Pardee and practice at Hendersonville Family Health Center.\n\nThe Flat Rock Family Health Center rented 1,700 square feet of clinical space from The Free Clinics during its five years. The Free Clinics provides health care services at no cost to individuals who are ineligible for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act or other government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.\n\n\u201cWe see this building as a community health care resource. The community built this building, and we wanted to use it as a health care resource to bridge gaps in Henderson County,\u201d said Judith Long, executive director of The Free Clinics in Hendersonville. \u201cThere has been some confusion about what this closing means for us.\u201d\n\nWith Flat Rock Family Health Center leaving at the end of the month, Long said The Free Clinics can expect to see its tenant\u2019s rent revenue, which is about $55,000 annually, depart as well.\n\n\u201cWe do have a budgetary hit of the loss of that rental income,\u201d Long said. \u201cBut we are alive and well, and open for business. We\u2019re still here and we\u2019re actually very busy.\u201d\n\nLong estimated The Free Clinics has seen a 9 or 10 percent increase in services and demand in the past year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really tried to use this facility to meet the health care needs in creative and dynamic ways for this community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re open to new possibilities.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, Long said the organization may turn its attention to partnerships rooted in wellness and prevention services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how we can bring this health care culture of screening and prevention, which has become part of our mindset for the last 2-3 years,\u201d Long said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at how we might bring the same tools you or I would get from our health insurance company or physician to the population that, quite frankly, procrastinates care the most because of fear and fear of costs. In some ways, that makes them the most fragile.\u201d\n\nThough Long said The Free Clinics is currently in talks with two or three potential partners, nothing is final, including whether the space will be shared by multiple collaborations.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly how it\u2019s going to evolve,\u201d she said of the clinical space. \u201cThe door is open, but nothing has walked through yet, and the door\u2019s not even really open yet because Flat Rock is still here until Sept. 30.\u201d\n\nReach Byrd at caitlin.byrd@blueridgenow.com or 828-694-7881.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Flat Rock medical practice with 1,500 active patients will close at the end of the month, leaving behind vacant clinical space and an opportunity for both new tenants and partnerships at The Free Clinics.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-C460D4D8-7A49-4EB6-A16E-3EBC6142AD4B-pubHT"}, "og": {"site_name": "BlueRidgeNow.com", "description": "A Flat Rock medical practice with 1,500 active patients will close at the end of the month, leaving behind vacant clinical space and an opportunity for both new tenants and partnerships at The Free Clinics.", "title": "Flat Rock Family Health Center to close", "url": "http://www.blueridgenow.com/article/20140927/ARTICLES/140929907", "image": "http://www.blueridgenow.com/global/images/fb/HT.png", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20140927, "fb": {"app_id": 123380601066653}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-140929907-pubHT"}}, "keywords": "FLAT ROCK (NC),  Yahoo,  Article,  Update"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe268e\"", "article_summary": "The Flat Rock Family Health Center rented 1,700 square feet of clinical space from The Free Clinics during its five years.\nPatients at Pardee\u2019s Flat Rock Family Health Center were notified of the closure in a letter dated Aug. 30, which falls within the minimum 30-day notice period required of medical practices by the North Carolina Medical Board.\nHarding will remain employed by Pardee and practice at Hendersonville Family Health Center.\nCrane will be joining the WNC Family Medical Center.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really tried to use this facility to meet the health care needs in creative and dynamic ways for this community,\u201d she said."}
