Sitting there was a giant statue advertising Super Bowl 50. There were similar statues around the city, including in Alamo Square Park, my childhood playground.\n\nIt is hard to articulate the revulsion I felt seeing my native city so slavishly give over a chunk of its most treasured civic land to a one-day, billionaire\u2019s orgy that isn\u2019t even being played within its borders, thanks to the 49ers\u2019 recent decampment to Santa Clara.\n\n(From all of the available evidence, it appears I wasn\u2019t alone in my hatred of the statues, or of the Super Bowl\u2019s malevolent presence in San Francisco. Legions of people have defaced the statues, causing the city to hastily remove some of them.)\n\nIn retrospect, it was probably a stupid idea to put the statues up, or to allow the NFL to do it free of charge \u2014 unlike anybody else who wants to put a giant hulking sculpture up on public land \u2014 or, really, to have San Francisco roll out the red carpet at all. The Super Bowl has landed in the Bay Area at a particularly inopportune time.\n\nSan Francisco is going through a series of political convulsions not seen for many years. For starters, the Justice Department is reviewing the activities of the San Francisco Police Department after the killing of Mario Woods, a 26-year-old black man whose death not only brought a series of protests to the city but also reminded it of the decades of injustice that its rapidly shrinking black population has suffered. Then, when he\u2019s not ducking Black Lives Matter activists, Mayor Ed Lee is weathering a growing corruption scandal that\u2019s inching closer and closer to his office. Put simply, nobody feels much like partying.\n\nBeyond that, the tension over San Francisco\u2019s wholesale transformation into a luxury playground for the tech industry, and the rich in general, has reached a boiling point. The Super Bowl, and sports in general, is a conspicuous symbol of that transformation. San Francisco is dealing with a housing crisis and skyrocketing inequality, but somehow the city, which is in the red, managed to shell out nearly $5 million it\u2019s likely never going to get back to fete the NFL, which certainly could have afforded the bill itself.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a city already plagued by sky-high wealth disparities, the biggest spectacle of the year is making things worse", "title": "Bamboozled by the Super Bowl: How the NFL spectacle became a symbol of San Francisco\u2019s disastrous inequality", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In a city already plagued by sky-high wealth disparities, the biggest spectacle of the year is making things worse", "title": "Bamboozled by the Super Bowl: How the NFL spectacle became a symbol of San Francisco\u2019s disastrous inequality", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/07/bamboozled_by_the_super_bowl_how_the_nfl_spectacle_became_a_symbol_of_san_franciscos_disastrous_inequality/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/super_bowl_police.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a city already plagued by sky-high wealth disparities, the biggest spectacle of the year is making things worse", "title": "Bamboozled by the Super Bowl: How the NFL spectacle became a symbol of San Francisco\u2019s disastrous inequality", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/super_bowl_police.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jack Mirkinson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Income inequality, Inequality, NFL, San Francisco, super bowl 50, The Super Bowl, Wealth inequality", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Income inequality, Inequality, NFL, San Francisco, super bowl 50, The Super Bowl, Wealth inequality, News, Politics NewsA few weeks ago, while I was home in San Francisco for the holidays, I passed through the Civic Center, where City Hall is located.\nSitting there was a giant statue advertising Super Bowl 50.\nThe Super Bowl has landed in the Bay Area at a particularly inopportune time.\nThe Super Bowl, and sports in general, is a conspicuous symbol of that transformation.\nSan Francisco is going through a series of political convulsions not seen for many years."}
