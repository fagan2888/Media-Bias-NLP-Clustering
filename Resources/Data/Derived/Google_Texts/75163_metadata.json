About 2.3% of all prescriptions in the U.S. last year accounted for nearly one-third of the total out-of-pocket costs for consumers, according to the report.\n\nCVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefit manager, reported last month that spending on specialty drugs increased by 15.6% in 2013. By comparison, spending on traditional medications grew by 0.8%.\n\nExpress Scripts, another drug benefit manager, predicted the country\u2019s spending on specialty drugs will increase by 63% between 2014 and 2016.\n\nThe disproportionate rise in the out-of-pocket cost of particular drugs can be attributed in part to \u201cspecialty tier\u201d pricing. Instead of paying the standard copayment for drugs, consumers whose prescriptions fall into specialty tiers are sometimes required to pay a percentage of the total cost. Specialty tier pricing produces tabs that can run into thousands of dollars per month for patients with chronic conditions.\n\nSome consumer advocates say specialty tier pricing is discriminatory and requires consumers with chronic conditions to unfairly bear a higher financial burden for drug coverage. They are calling on California policymakers to regulate specialty tier drug pricing either using the Affordable Care Act or new state policies.\n\nWe asked stakeholders and experts how California legislators and state health officials should respond.\n\nWe got responses from:", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>We asked stakeholders and health care experts how California should handle \"specialty tier\" pricing of prescription drugs, a practice that requires some consumers to pay higher out-pocket-prices for some medications.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "We asked stakeholders and health care experts how California should handle \u201cspecialty tier\u201d pricing of prescription drugs, a practice that requires some consumers to pay higher out-pock\u2026", "title": "How Should California Officials Deal With \u2018Specialty Tier\u2019 Pricing of Drugs?", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/how-should-california-officials-deal-with-specialty-tier-pricing-of-drugs/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-05-22T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-22T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5fb\"", "article_summary": "Specialty tier pricing produces tabs that can run into thousands of dollars per month for patients with chronic conditions.\nThey are calling on California policymakers to regulate specialty tier drug pricing either using the Affordable Care Act or new state policies.\nThe disproportionate rise in the out-of-pocket cost of particular drugs can be attributed in part to \u201cspecialty tier\u201d pricing.\nCVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefit manager, reported last month that spending on specialty drugs increased by 15.6% in 2013.\nSome consumer advocates say specialty tier pricing is discriminatory and requires consumers with chronic conditions to unfairly bear a higher financial burden for drug coverage."}
