On his final assignment, he must pursue the one criminal that has eluded him throughout time. PT2M7S http://www.smh.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-3ci8r 620 349 July 24, 2014\n\nEthan Hawke has too many other interests, whether it\u2019s working on the New York stage or helping raise his four children, to overly worry about the details of a successful movie career now three decades old, but recently he had an epiphany about his standing. More than ever, people were recognising him on the street.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it and it\u2019s because when I was younger and Reality Bites came out, only young people recognised me. Now I\u2019ve made so many different movies that older people have seen some,\u201d Hawke says. \u201cNow there\u2019s a certain crowd that loves Before Midnight, a certain crowd that loves The Purge, a certain crowd that love Gattaca.\u201d\n\nWide field of work: Ethan Hawke in a scene from Predestination.\n\nThe 43-year-old actor, with the familiar facial hair and wry, contemplative air, may have chosen the Boerum Hill neighbourhood in Brooklyn over life in Los Angeles, but he has become one of Hollywood\u2019s most dependable stars, making movies that are sometimes memorable and sometimes successful (and occasionally both) for each of those distinct crowds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s as likely to be in an art-house drama like last year's acclaimed Before Midnight, for which he earnt his third Academy Award nomination as one of the co-writers, as a low-budget pulp thriller or horror film, such as 2012\u2019s Sinister. The reason, as Hawke modestly sees it, is that he doesn\u2019t disappear into his roles like the true greats do.\n\n\u201cThere are certain types of actors that can shape change themselves, people like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Daniel Day-Lewis,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been the kind of performer who can do that, so one of the ways I challenge myself to be better is to be in different kinds of movies.\u201d\n\nRomantic encounter: Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke in Before Sunset.\n\nThat approach has never been in sharper focus than in the coming weeks, when Hawke memorably stars in two distinct yet impressive movies that release on successive Thursdays. The knotty science-fiction storytelling of Predestination, written and directed by Australian filmmakers the Spierig Brothers and shot in Melbourne, will be followed by the coming-of-age saga Boyhood, a study of time\u2019s passage and life\u2019s changes from Hawke\u2019s good friend and Before Midnight director, Richard Linklater.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great guy,\u201d says Michael Spierig, who on stage read out a gracious email from Hawke apologising for his absence when Predestination opened the Melbourne International Film Festival on July 31. Michael and his sibling Peter got to know Hawke when he came to Queensland to shoot their second feature, the 2009 vampire-tale twist Daybreakers, and when they sent him Predestination, their adaptation of a 1959 Robert A. Heinlein short story where Hawke plays a time-travelling policeman, he replied within 24 hours, telling them he was in.\n\nHawke\u2019s commitment matters, especially on independent film projects. With his name attached, Predestination was announced several years ago at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was sold to various international distributors with the proceeds funding production.\n\nTense moments: Ethan Hawke with the late Philip Seymour Hoffmann in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.\n\n\u201cSome actors just come on set, read the lines, and off they go. Ethan gets involved,\u201d says Michael Spierig. \u201cOur rehearsal process is more about the intention of each scene and making sure it has a value to the story, and he\u2019s very good at that. That\u2019s part of the joy of working with him: he pushes to elevate everything he can.\u201d\n\nSpierig can recall conversations with Hawke about the Star Wars movies that have lasted hours, and there are as many sides to the actor as there are parts he will play. He\u2019s a long-time Bob Dylan fan, has published two well-received novels, and in recent years has acted off Broadway in plays written by Anton Chekhov and Tom Stoppard.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have some high art or low art barometer, where one is better than the other,\u201d Hawke says. \u201cA drive-in movie like The Purge can be good if people put real thought into it, and bad if they don\u2019t. I hate art films that posture without trying to put real thought into it.\u201d\n\nComing of age: Ethan Hawke, third from left, in the 1994 film Reality Bites.\n\nOne of the few things he hasn\u2019t been is a high-wattage celebrity. The singer-songwriter Sarah Blasko once told me of arriving in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia (where an orchestra can be recorded comparatively cheaply) to find her hotel surrounded by screaming teens. They were there, she soon realised, for teen superstar (and sometimes Bieber better half) Selena Gomez, but in the foyer she chatted with an American man who complimented her on the ukulele she was carrying. Only later did she learn it was Hawke.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cEthan doesn\u2019t go to celebrity spots. He\u2019s a family man and he has a great life in New York,\u201d says Michael Spierig, who would often greet Hawke\u2019s second wife, Ryan, whom he married in 2008, and their two young daughters, Clementine Jane and Indiana, when they visited the Predestination set while the family was temporarily living in Melbourne last year.\n\nGrowing up: A scene from the film Boyhood.\n\nHawke was first married to actress Uma Thurman, from 1998 until their divorce in 2005, the one event that has taken him into the unwelcome realm of celebrity tabloids. They met on the set of another science-fiction movie, 1997\u2019s Gattaca, and have a 16-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son. While Hawke was defined publicly for years by his role as the sardonic, disaffected anti-hero Troy opposite Winona Ryder in the 1994 Generation X touchstone Reality Bites, he says he always knew that he wanted to be a father.\n\nHe credits Ryan with keeping him grounded \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s the most intense friendship I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he recently said \u2013 and Hawke sounds content describing how his daughters are asleep and his wife is in the next room writing emails while he talks on the phone late at night.\n\nBeing a parent is integral to his work on the astounding Boyhood, easily the best reviewed movie released in the US so far this year. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty special,\u201d says Hawke, who signed on 12 years ago when Linklater decided that the best way to capture the passing of time on film was to simply shoot for a week once a year. Every 12 months or so, Hawke and actress Patricia Arquette would join Linklater in Austin, Texas, where they played the divorced parents of Mason (Ella Coltrane), whom we see from ages six through 18, maturing into a young man as you measure the change.\n\nFirst wife: Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman married in 1998 and divorced in 2005.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no movie that\u2019s more personal to me than Boyhood,\u201d Hawke says. \u201cRick and I both have fathers who were Texan men who worked in insurance, they had us young and both went on to have happiness in their second marriage. When I was presented with the task of creating a portrait of fatherhood in Boyhood, it was really clear what we both wanted to do. It just took a damn long time to do.\u201d\n\nAs Boyhood was slowly accumulated \u2013 Hawke says his 16-year-old daughter, Maya, can\u2019t remember a time when he wasn\u2019t making it \u2013 Hawke added elements of his own life to the movie. He sings songs that he wrote over the years, and a letter to Maya became the basis of a scene involving a music compilation his character makes for his fictional son.\n\nHawke says his first reaction on seeing the film was one of \u201cimmense pride\u201d in Linklater\u2019s achievement, but he acknowledges that it\u2019s a powerful thing for an actor to literally see themselves age. The actor had just appeared alongside Denzel Washington in Training Day when Boyhood began, and over the course of the movie Hawke\u2019s face loses its boyishness as his character matures.\n\n\u201cTime is something that has clearly been on my mind a lot,\u201d Hawke says. \u201cI ask myself the question of am I wasting my life working? Or am I not working enough? I don\u2019t know the answer, but it is definitely a curious age I\u2019m at.\u201d\n\nIn the next year alone Hawke will play a drone pilot, a biker in a contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s Cymbeline, a spaghetti western cowboy and a father accused of a crime he can\u2019t remember. By working so widely, he\u2019s eased into his 40s without having to worry about his leading-man status and mainly kept up the quality (there are exceptions, such as Getaway, the terrible car chase movie he made with Selena Gomez).\n\n\u201cHopefully I\u2019m not at the peak of what I can do,\u201d Hawke says. \u201cBut what I\u2019m doing right now, with my work and with my family, is emblematic of where I am in life. Right in the middle.\u201d\n\nPredestination opens in cinemas on August 28 and Boyhood opens on September 4.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Movies", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Ethan Hawke has too many other interests to overly worry about the details of a successful movie career now three decades old, but recently he had an epiphany about his standing.
