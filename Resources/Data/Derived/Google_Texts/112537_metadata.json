Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) leads Sen. Mark Kirk Mark KirkGOP senators propose sending ISIS fighters to Gitmo VA chief 'deeply' regrets if Disney comment offended vets Senate GOP gears up for fight over Gitmo transfers MORE (R-Ill.) by 6 points in a new polling matchup of what\u2019s expected to be one of the tightest Senate races of the 2016 cycle.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDuckworth leads the one-term senator and former House member by a margin of 42 percent to 36 percent in a new poll by the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling. The numbers show a sharp drop among Kirk\u2019s unfavorable ratings, up to 42 percent now compared to 32 percent in February.\n\nIllinoisans who are familiar with Duckworth hold a favorable view of her, with her favorable/unfavorable rating at 34 percent to 23 percent. But a plurality of voters haven\u2019t yet formed an opinion on her, leaving significant room for either candidate to shape the race.\n\nThe poll also shows Duckworth holding a substantial lead over her Democratic primary rival, former Chicago Urban League president Andrea Zopp \u2014 by a margin of 59 percent to 10 percent. Duckworth is seen as the establishment Democrats\u2019 ideal candidate, having won an endorsement from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nZopp, who is black, panned that decision as showing \u201ctotal insensitivity to Chicago, African American women and the democratic process.\"\n\nDespite Zopp\u2019s role at the helm of the Urban League, a civic organization that promotes \u201ceconomic, education and social progress for African Americans,\u201d Duckworth holds a 57 percent to 13 percent edge with black voters, according to the poll.\n\nEven with the election more than a year away, Duckworth and Kirk have already had their share of dustups. She slammed Kirk for his comments referring to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) as a \u201cbro with no ho\u201d because he running for president as a bachelor.\n\nThe campaign doubled down with ads last week that mocked Kirk\u2019s \u201coutrageous statements\u201d including comparing the Iran nuclear deal to Europe\u2019s appeasement of Hitler.\n\nKirk\u2019s team fired back with an ad late last week, first reported by RealClearPolitics, that centered on a whistleblower trial related to Duckworth's time as the director of Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs. That ad pans her \u201cdesperate and negative attack ads\u201d and calls her \u201cjust another Chicago politician headed for trial.\u201d\n\nIllinois regularly backs the Democratic presidential candidate in presidential years, so Democrats are hopeful that the trend will continue and help boost Duckworth\u2019s chances at the polls. The PPP poll found that Clinton holds a substantial lead against her Republican presidential rivals, with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush running the closest at a 9-point deficit.\n\nFor the Republican nomination, Gov. Scott Walker (R-Wis.) leads with 23 percent of the vote, followed closely by Donald Trump\u2019s 18 percent. Bush is in third with 11 percent.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Duckworth leads Kirk in Senate race poll", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-29T11:42-04:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Duckworth leads Kirk in Senate race poll", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/249605-duckworth-leads-kirk-in-senate-race-poll", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/duckworthtammy_110214getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-29T11:42:36-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/249605-duckworth-leads-kirk-in-senate-race-poll", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-29T11:24-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cheryl Segal", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Ben Kamisar", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Tammy Duckworth, Mark Kirk,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-29T11:24:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-29T11:42:36-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/249605-duckworth-leads-kirk-in-senate-race-poll", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Duckworth leads Kirk in Senate race poll"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2cbd\"", "article_summary": "Even with the election more than a year away, Duckworth and Kirk have already had their share of dustups.\nDuckworth is seen as the establishment Democrats\u2019 ideal candidate, having won an endorsement from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\nADVERTISEMENTDuckworth leads the one-term senator and former House member by a margin of 42 percent to 36 percent in a new poll by the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling.\nBut a plurality of voters haven\u2019t yet formed an opinion on her, leaving significant room for either candidate to shape the race.\nThe PPP poll found that Clinton holds a substantial lead against her Republican presidential rivals, with former Florida Gov."}
