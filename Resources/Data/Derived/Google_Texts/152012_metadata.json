But from a moral standpoint, it\u2019s hard to reconcile his decision with surveillance video that shows the deputy coldcocking the inmate seemingly without provocation.\n\nAt a time when there is intense concern about Denver jail operations and the sheriff\u2019s department, this decision won\u2019t go over well.\n\nThe controversy began when a video surfaced showing Denver Sheriff Deputy Thomas Ford striding up to an inmate in the jail and striking him in the face.\n\nThe description of the July altercation, included in Morrissey\u2019s letter about the case to interim Sheriff Elias Diggins, bears little resemblance to how the incident looks to have unfolded.\n\nFord said he intended to move the inmate, Kyle Askins, from the bench where he was sitting and put him in a cell. The deputy walked purposefully toward Askins, who stood up.\n\nAccording to the letter, Ford said he felt threatened: \u201cI had no intention of getting into a physical altercation with this guy. \u2026 He popped up off the bench in an aggressive manner.\u201d\n\nThe inmate certainly doesn\u2019t look aggressive to us, arms at his side, holding what looks to be some papers.\n\nTo be sure, Morrissey had evidence beyond the video, including witness statements and a description of the profane and ugly threats Askins was making at the time.\n\nMorrissey said Colorado law gives deputies the right to defend themselves before they are struck, so long as they believe force is about to be used against them and the deputy\u2019s use of force is reasonable. The DA said prosecutors would have had to prove Ford wrong in order to get a conviction.\n\nMorrissey\u2019s decision may be legally justified, but we\u2019re pretty sure it won\u2019t pass muster in the court of public opinion.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Questionable call by DA on latest Denver jail incident", "title": "Questionable call by DA on latest Denver jail incident", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/22/questionable-call-by-da-on-latest-denver-jail-incident/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140822__Denver-DAp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140822__Denver-DAp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-22T18:34:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:04:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "At a time when there is intense concern about Denver jail operations and the sheriff\u2019s department, this decision won\u2019t go over well.\nThe controversy began when a video surfaced showing Denver Sheriff Deputy Thomas Ford striding up to an inmate in the jail and striking him in the face.\nMorrissey\u2019s decision may be legally justified, but we\u2019re pretty sure it won\u2019t pass muster in the court of public opinion.\nThe Denver district attorney\u2019s decision last week not to bring charges against a deputy who punched an inmate was an unsettling end to a disturbing episode.\nThe DA said prosecutors would have had to prove Ford wrong in order to get a conviction."}
