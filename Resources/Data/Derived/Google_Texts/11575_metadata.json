Reporter Rebecca Smith answers some questions about the article:\n\nThis attack happened in April \u2013 why haven\u2019t we heard about it before?\n\nThere were some local media reports at the time about vandalism at the substation. But the utility that owns the substation, PG&E, investigators and federal agencies didn\u2019t want to draw attention to the attack, for fear it would inspire copycats.\n\nSo why is The Wall Street Journal publicizing it?\n\nAmericans have a right to know about serious threats to their security. And Jon Wellinghoff, the former head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, decided to go public with his concerns about the attack because he fears not enough has been done to protect the grid.\n\nWhy can\u2019t we just put bullet-proof shields around transformers?\n\nActually, that\u2019s under consideration \u2013 but there are problems. Transformers get very hot; bullet-proof cladding might interfere with cooling, making them work less well. Some people have suggested installing concrete barriers around some equipment. Transformers can be very big, though, and they have parts that stick out that would be hard to protect.\n\nHow about fences around substations, like ones that gunmen couldn\u2019t see through?\n\nSome utilities are considering this, as well. But substations are typically kept lit at night, so intruders can be seen by passersby or security details. Opaque fences would make it harder to see if vandals or other unauthorized people were inside.\n\nHow may substations should be upgraded?\n\nDozens, not hundreds, security experts say. The electric system has lots of redundancy built in, so grid operators usually have lots of ways to get electricity to any given spot. But few massive substations function like linchpins and make it possible for the system to operate smoothly; they are the ones that need better protection.\n\nHow many big substations would have to be knocked out to bring down the grid?\n\nIt\u2019s probably not smart to say, but federal officials think it\u2019s not a huge number.\n\nThen the question is, how long would it take to put the pieces back together again?\n\nSome grid officials think they could restore power service in a few hours. Others think it could take days or even weeks, depending on the level of damage.\n\nWhat would be the hang up? We lose power as a result of storms, all the time, and it usually comes back on pretty quickly.\n\nTrue, but that\u2019s not always the case; just ask the people who lost power during Super Storm Sandy. Some equipment is hard to replace. Big transformers are hand-built and it often takes months to complete one. And they\u2019re hard to move, often requiring special rail cars and cranes.\n\nIsn\u2019t the utility industry doing anything?\n\nYes. But there aren\u2019t federal standards for physical protections. So it\u2019s up to each company to decide how to protect wires, substations and generating stations. That means more than 1,800 companies can make their own decisions.\n\nCould this have been the work of people who wanted to manipulate power prices?\n\nProbably not. The incident occurred at a time of year \u2013 and a time of day \u2013 when demand for power is very low. Anyone interested in skewing prices would probably strike during the hottest days of the summer, when demand for electricity is very high.\n\nSee also:\n\nMystery Assault On Power Grid \u2013 WSJ", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Reporter Rebecca Smith answers some of the big questions raised following her article on a sniper attack on a power transmission station in California last spring.", "title": "Q&A: What You Need to Know About Attacks on the U.S. Power Grid", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/02/05/qa-what-you-need-to-know-about-attacks-on-the-u-s-power-grid/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AG628_MKTLED_P_20140117165703.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Q&A: What You Need to Know About Attacks on the U.S. Power Grid", "description": "Reporter Rebecca Smith answers some of the big questions raised following her article on a sniper attack on a power transmission station in California last spring.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tom Gara", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "Reporter Rebecca Smith answers some of the big questions raised following her article on a sniper attack on a power transmission station in California last spring.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-02-05T18:43:36-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/02/05/qa-what-you-need-to-know-about-attacks-on-the-u-s-power-grid/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-3669", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Reporter Rebecca Smith answers some of the big questions raised following her article on a sniper attack on a power transmission station in California last spring.", "title": "Q&A: What You Need to Know About Attacks on the U.S. Power Grid", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/02/05/qa-what-you-need-to-know-about-attacks-on-the-u-s-power-grid/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AG628_MKTLED_P_20140117165703.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-3669", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-02-05T18:47:11-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d4c\"", "article_summary": "See also:Mystery Assault On Power Grid \u2013 WSJ\nSome grid officials think they could restore power service in a few hours.\nThe incident occurred at a time of year \u2013 and a time of day \u2013 when demand for power is very low.\nWe lose power as a result of storms, all the time, and it usually comes back on pretty quickly.\nTrue, but that\u2019s not always the case; just ask the people who lost power during Super Storm Sandy."}
