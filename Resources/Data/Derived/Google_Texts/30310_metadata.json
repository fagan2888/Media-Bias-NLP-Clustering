Kasich hasn\u2019t had any. There have been 92 TV ads that ran about 57,000 times against Trump and 18 ads that ran about 9,400 times against Kasich, according to Kantar Media, which tracks political advertising.\n\nIn fact, Trump himself ran an ad in Ohio attacking Kasich. It ran 755 times.\n\nTrump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, has criticized Kasich, who trails in third place, for staying in the race. Kasich, meanwhile, has pointed out that he, not Trump, beats Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in polls on a hypothetical general election matchup. According to a Real Clear Politics average of polls from March 24 to April 14, Clinton leads Trump nationally by 9.3 percentage points, while Kasich leads Clinton by an average of 7.8 percentage points. (The other Republican presidential candidate, Ted Cruz, trails Clinton by an average of 2.3 percentage points.)\n\nTrump says that\u2019s only because Kasich hasn\u2019t been tested yet with negative ads, a point he made during a rally in Ocean City, Maryland, on April 20 (at the 37:38 mark).\n\n\u201cAs far as Kasich is concerned, he will get slaughtered by Hillary,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s never had one negative ad against him. I\u2019ve had 55,000 negative ads. Kasich hasn\u2019t had one negative ad. As soon as he has the first 10 ads against him, he will drop like a rock, believe me.\u201d\n\nTrump repeated the claim in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show the following day (at the 40-second mark).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hit by 55,000 ads,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI saw it on your show, 55,000 negative ads, and nobody else has. You know, you look at a guy like Kasich. He\u2019s never been hit by an ad because nobody cares, frankly. No, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s so true.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with the ad the Trump campaign itself ran against Kasich in Ohio in March.\n\nThe ad said Kasich \u201chelped Wall Street predator Lehman Brothers destroy the world economy,\u201d a claim that earned a dubious four Pinocchios from the Washington Post Fact Checker, who described the claim as \u201cpreposterous.\u201d The Post noted that Kasich, who worked at Lehman Brothers, was \u201cone managing director out of 700, in a firm of 25,000.\u201d\n\nThe ad included another misleading attack, that Kasich \u201cincreased [Ohio\u2019s] budget more than any other governor in the U.S.\u201d It\u2019s a claim that is based on skewed data, as we wrote when a similar charge was made in an ad by a pro-Jeb Bush super PAC.\n\nAccording to Andrew Fitzgerald, Kantar Media\u2019s senior political and environmental media analyst, that Trump campaign ad against Kasich ran 755 times in Ohio.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the first time Kasich has been targeted by ads in the presidential campaign. In fact, we have written about several ads attacking Kasich.\n\nThere was the ad we mentioned from the pro-Jeb Bush Right to Rise super PAC that relied on skewed data to falsely label Kasich as having the \u201cworst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat.\u201d A similar claim was raised in several ads attacking Kasich.\n\nAnother ad from Right to Rise \u2014 which targeted Kasich in four different ads \u2014 attacked Kasich for voting to \u201ccut troop levels and military funding,\u201d which is true, but fails to mention that those votes in the early to mid-1990s came at a time in U.S. history \u2014 post Cold War \u2014 when the debate on Capitol Hill was not whether to reduce troops or cut defense spending, but by how many and how much. That ad, and others, have also noted Kasich\u2019s support for a Medicaid expansion made possible by the Affordable Care Act. Kasich has said he opposes the Affordable Care Act, but he supports the Medicaid expansion, which took effect Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nAnother attack ad came from a pro-Ted Cruz group that falsely claimed that Democratic donor George Soros gave \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d to Kasich. (The ad was later revised, but still relied on guilt by association to make its point.) An ad from the conservative American Future Fund claimed Kasich \u201craised taxes by billions\u201d in Ohio, ignoring that Kasich\u2019s overall plan resulted in a net tax cut.\n\nAll told, there have been 18 ads run against Kasich (though some attack multiple candidates), according to Kantar Media data. Those ads have aired just under 9,400 times, Fitzgerald told us. While only one came directly from the Trump campaign, ads attacking Kasich have been lobbed from groups supporting Cruz, Bush, Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio.\n\nTrump certainly has a point that he has been the biggest target of attack ads. According to Fitzgerald, Trump actually undershot slightly when he said there have been 55,000 negative ads run against him. According to Kantar data, as of April 21, there have been 92 separate ads targeting Trump \u2014 11 from the Clinton campaign \u2014 and those ads have aired just under 57,000 times.\n\nSo using Trump\u2019s measure \u2014 the number of times negative or comparison ads have aired \u2014 the score is 57,000 against Trump and 9,400 against Kasich. That\u2019s a big disparity, but it\u2019s not 55,000 to zero.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "While only one came directly from the Trump campaign, ads attacking Kasich have been lobbed from groups supporting Cruz, Bush, Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio.\nAccording to Fitzgerald, Trump actually undershot slightly when he said there have been 55,000 negative ads run against him.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hit by 55,000 ads,\u201d Trump said.\nThere have been 92 TV ads that ran about 57,000 times against Trump and 18 ads that ran about 9,400 times against Kasich, according to Kantar Media, which tracks political advertising.\nAccording to Andrew Fitzgerald, Kantar Media\u2019s senior political and environmental media analyst, that Trump campaign ad against Kasich ran 755 times in Ohio."}
