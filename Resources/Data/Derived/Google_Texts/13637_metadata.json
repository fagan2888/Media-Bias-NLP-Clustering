Well, maybe it\u2019s not. I may be wrong here, I don\u2019t know. I just know that some kids are dying. And they\u2019re dying for no reason. They\u2019re dying because the state of Maine is being ineffective.\n\n\u201cI could care less about putting an addict in jail, because I don\u2019t want them in jail. We have too many in jail. We\u2019ve got to find ways to get them treated.\n\n\u201cBut I am very interested in getting at the business side of the supply chain, which is the people that come in from Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania\u2014and sell their poison to our kids.\u201d\n\nLePage said the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency recently arrested a 31-year old from Conn. who goes by the street name Smooth on charges of heroin trafficking.\n\n\u201cSmooth is not an addict. Smooth doesn\u2019t even touch the stuff. He\u2019s the guy I want. I want to have him in Maine for the next 25 years. I want him to be my guest.\u201d\n\nDuring her remarks later in the day, Mills said that Maine saw 208 deaths in 2014 from pharmaceutical opiods and heroin, up 18 percent from 2013.\n\n\u201cAnd you know that the deaths are just the tip of the iceberg\u201d of the problem, she said.\n\nAddiction is not limited to young adults; the average age of overdose victims in the state is 43. Five percent of Maine babies are currently born \u201cdrug-affected.\u201d\n\nMills told the doctors that a large majority of Mainers arrested for heroin possession say they \u201cstarted on pills,\u201d any of a variety of prescription medications that contain opiates.\n\nTrafficking of prescription drugs such as oxycodone is a priority for her office. The boards that license professionals such as nurses handle lots of cases of prescription drug diversion and misuse, she said.\n\n\u201cThe Maine criminal code is a tool that can be used in your offices,\u201d she said. \u201cRemind patients that it\u2019s a crime to possess a drug that\u2019s not in its prescribed container or to use a drug in a manner other than how it was prescribed.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no patient privilege when a doctor or pharmacist suspects an attempt to obtain drugs by deception, she said.\n\nMills encouraged the doctors to support drug education in schools and other venues. \u201cIt should be part of health education that you don\u2019t take heroin, it takes you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe need your help getting these kinds of messages to the schools and communities; we need your help promoting treatment programs and funding treatment; we need your help reducing opiod prescriptions,\u201d Mills told the group. \u201cWe\u2019ve partnered so much before, so many times on such good causes: tobacco, domestic violence, elder abuse. Let\u2019s put our heads together again. Let\u2019s make Maine the first state to successfully address the scourge of opiod abuse.\u201d\n\nMedicaid\n\nThe Maine Medical Association has opposed the LePage administration\u2019s decision not to expand MaineCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, under the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s a member of the Cover Maine Now coalition advocating expansion.\n\nDr. Cathleen London, a physician at Calais Regional Medical Services, asked the governor why his administration has chosen not to expand MaineCare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a rural hospital that is threatened every day, and as you said, we\u2019re a very large state. So we have these critical access hospitals that are dependent on Medicaid dollars,\u201d she said.\n\nThe governor responded by saying increased funding would not solve the issue of a lack of coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just put money at it. Free is not always good. If you don\u2019t have stake in the game it\u2019s not good. You have to have self-respect and self-control. And that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with Medicaid.\u201d\n\nHe said Maine is more in need of federal funding from the Medicare system, given the age of the population, than from Medicaid. \u201cThey took $800 million out of Medicare\u201d to fund Medicaid expansion, he said, \u201cwhich is where we need the help.\u201d\n\nMaine uses the federally-operated health insurance exchange established by the Affordable Care Act, having opted not to create a state-run exchange.\n\n\u201cRight now, with the exchanges, we\u2019re down to about 40,000 people uninsured,\u201d LePage siad. \u201cSome people are paying $1.74 to $20 a month for their healthcare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "BAR HARBOR \u2014 Questions of how to respond to increasing opiate abuse in Maine and whether the state should expand MaineCare were central when Governor Paul", "og": {"site_name": "Mount Desert Islander", "description": "BAR HARBOR \u2014 Questions of how to respond to increasing opiate abuse in Maine and whether the state should expand MaineCare were central when Governor Paul", "title": "LePage, Mills discuss opiate abuse, Medicaid expansion - Mount Desert Islander", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.mdislander.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/09/lepage-mills-1-1200x630.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2015-09-12T18:13:28-04:00", "url": "http://www.mdislander.com/uncategorized/lepage-mills-discuss-opiate-abuse-medicaid-expansion", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100002128785475}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mdislander/", "section": "Uncategorized", "tag": "News", "published_time": "2015-09-12T15:38:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-12T18:13:28-04:00"}, "thumbnail": "http://www.mdislander.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/09/lepage-mills-1-1024x722.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fcb\"", "article_summary": "The boards that license professionals such as nurses handle lots of cases of prescription drug diversion and misuse, she said.\nLePage said that education, prevention, law enforcement and treatment are all important in combating drug abuse, but he would like to see more resources for enforcement.\n\u201cIt should be part of health education that you don\u2019t take heroin, it takes you,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve partnered so much before, so many times on such good causes: tobacco, domestic violence, elder abuse.\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with Medicaid.\u201dHe said Maine is more in need of federal funding from the Medicare system, given the age of the population, than from Medicaid."}
