There are fewer people in the country than in Staten Island, the air is so clean that you can see for many miles on a good day, and several of the bankers who brought the country to the brink of collapse in 2009 have gone to jail. Without the drastic cuts being imposed upon Europe\u2019s other troubled economies, Iceland has experienced solid economic growth over the past few years. (The economist Paul Krugman contends that the country is some kind of economic miracle.) It is also, in many respects, one of the most socially advanced countries in the world: having topped the World Economic Forum\u2019s rankings for gender equality for the past six years, Iceland has become known as the most feminist country in the world.\n\nOne sign of this egalitarianism can be found in Icelandic attitudes toward motherhood. In contrast to the competitive, anxious parenting of middle- and upper-class Americans, there is an ease to being a mother in Iceland, at least among the native population. This can be explained, in part, by the fact that Icelandic parents receive extensive social benefits, including nine months of paid leave to be shared between parents and affordable preschools. Most people also have networks of relatives available nearby to pick up the slack. Lacking \u201cstranger danger\u201d fears, eight-year-olds are encouraged to cross roads to play at the playground, or walk home from school without adult supervision. As almost all Icelandic mothers work, there are no \u201cmommy wars,\u201d and few women seem to suffer from the overwrought desire to \u201chave it all.\u201d There is also relaxed sexual morality: two-thirds of the country\u2019s babies are born to unwed mothers\u2014the highest rate of out-of-wedlock births in the world\u2014with couples often having children together and then getting married, or deciding not to.\n\nThe distinctive culture of single motherhood in Iceland forms the subject of a new series by the Canadian photographer Annie Ling, who first travelled to the country last winter, on an artists\u2019 residency. Ling has so far photographed six women\u2014three who live in Reykjav\u00edk and three who live in the north of the country\u2014spending time in their homes observing their lives and their interactions with their children. Ling, whose work was recently shown in an exhibit, entitled \u201cIndependent Mothers,\u201d that opened in Akureyri, Iceland, on June 19th, the country\u2019s hundredth anniversary of women\u2019s suffrage, says that she became interested in Icelandic attitudes toward single mothers, especially as they compare to those in the U.S. The six women she has photographed are teachers, artists, and students. Two of them have five children with three different partners; one is raising two autistic children on her own. \u201cThese women aren\u2019t getting judgment from the outside,\u201d Ling said. \u201cSo, because they\u2019re accepted, they\u2019re much more at ease in their situations.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the reality of Icelandic women\u2019s lives is more like that of American women than first meets the eye. Over the past few years, women have gone public with allegations of sexual abuse, including against a former foreign minister and the former bishop of Iceland\u2019s state church. While new laws against gender-based violence were recently passed, the criminal-justice system has been slow to respond, and young women this year turned a Facebook group on \u201cbeauty tips\u201d into a twenty-five-thousand-member forum for sharing stories of abuse. Despite its egalitarian culture, Iceland has a gender wage gap among the highest in Europe, leaving female-headed households with too few resources. Striking nurses, almost all women, were recently forced back to work by an act of parliament, with wage increases that did not come close to the contracts given to doctors, who are mostly men.\n\nLing\u2019s stark portraits capture some of these tensions as well. Single mothering may be less fraught in Iceland, but the women she photographed are not what we Americans would see as comfortably well off. You can see the independent mothers living in nondescript apartment blocks, in chock-full homes, in a sparse landscape\u2014not easy lives, but full ones. \u201cThis one mother I photographed had had a pretty hard day when I showed up,\u201d Ling said. \u201cShe told me this guy she was dating had broken up with her. Her mom was in the hospital, so she was on the phone with her. She was feeding the kids, bathing them, putting them to bed, and then heating up food at the end of the night.\u201d The photograph Ling captured shows the woman, Katr\u00edn, a kindergarten teacher and mother of two living in Reykjav\u00edk, standing on a chair, delivering a plate of food to a microwave wedged on top of the fridge. \u201cI caught that moment of exhaustion,\u201d Ling said. \u201cIt was kind of incredible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160525190933, "description": "Janet Elise Johnson writes on Annie Ling\u2019s portraits of single mothers in Iceland, and the country\u2019s gender politics.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "A new series by Annie Ling focusses on single motherhood in Iceland, where two-thirds of babies are born out of wedlock.", "title": "The Independent Mothers of Iceland - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IcelandMothers_01-1200-630-26150604.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2016-05-06T19:01:21-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/the-independent-mothers-of-iceland", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new series by Annie Ling focusses on single motherhood in Iceland, where two-thirds of babies are born out of wedlock.", "creator": "@newyorker", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IcelandMothers_01-1200-630-26150604.jpg", "title": "The Independent Mothers of Iceland - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3072210\",\"title_alt\":\"The Independent Mothers of Iceland\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/06\\/IcelandMothers_01-728-375-26150604.jpg\",\"post_format\":\"gallery\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "Photo Booth", "tag": "Single Mothers", "published_time": "2015-07-12T11:49:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-06T19:01:21-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3072210, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Children, Equal Rights, Feminism, Gender Wage Gap, Iceland, Motherhood, Photography, Single Mothers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ce2\"", "article_summary": "Ling, whose work was recently shown in an exhibit, entitled \u201cIndependent Mothers,\u201d that opened in Akureyri, Iceland, on June 19th, the country\u2019s hundredth anniversary of women\u2019s suffrage, says that she became interested in Icelandic attitudes toward single mothers, especially as they compare to those in the U.S.\nYou can see the independent mothers living in nondescript apartment blocks, in chock-full homes, in a sparse landscape\u2014not easy lives, but full ones.\nCredit Photograph by Annie LingFor Americans, Iceland can feel like another planet, and not only because of the moonscape lava fields.\nSingle mothering may be less fraught in Iceland, but the women she photographed are not what we Americans would see as comfortably well off.\nWithout the drastic cuts being imposed upon Europe\u2019s other troubled economies, Iceland has experienced solid economic growth over the past few years."}
