And although his head was under the cart and he was bleeding badly, he was conscious, Cleveland said.\n\nThe three quickly lifted the cart and someone arrived with a first-aid kit, he said.\n\nThe caddy\u2019s name was not released, but he was the only injury from the frightening seconds at the course. He was in stable condition at a hospital, said Aurora Fire Capt. Diane Lord.\n\nThe twister also flipped a 10-foot-by-30-foot construction trailer on its roof at the course Sunday.\n\nTracy Cologne, the tournament director for the Rocky Mountain Junior Golf Tour, said 97 golfers were on the course, along with seven staff members armed with air horns to signal if there was trouble.\n\n\u201cOur job is to keep them safe,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when we saw the black cloud, we decided to call (off) the tournament.\u201d\n\nLightning struck a tree and caused an injury to a person near East Iliff Avenue and South Buckley Road, authorities said.\n\nWind, thousands of lightning strikes and quarter-sized hail pounded the eastern metro area between 1 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA line of thunderstorms developed over the Front Range, as a cold upper-level system moved across the Rockies from Utah. The storms were moving east at 30 mph at 3 p.m., posing a risk for bad weather on the Eastern Plains late Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe system caused seven tornado warnings in different parts of the state Sunday, including a tornado that touched down in Park County at about 11:15, said National Weather Service meteorologist Kyle Fredin.\n\nNo injuries were reported.\n\nA Park County law enforcement agent told the weather service that the tornado damaged a roof but caused no injuries.\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Teen golfer recounts brush with tornado at Aurora tournament", "title": "Teen golfer recounts brush with tornado at Aurora tournament", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/08/teen-golfer-recounts-brush-with-tornado-at-aurora-tournament/", "image": {"width": 629, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140608__radar4p1.jpg", "height": 406}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140608__radar4p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-08T12:25:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:20:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce24\"", "article_summary": "A Park County law enforcement agent told the weather service that the tornado damaged a roof but caused no injuries.\nThe system caused seven tornado warnings in different parts of the state Sunday, including a tornado that touched down in Park County at about 11:15, said National Weather Service meteorologist Kyle Fredin.\nWind, thousands of lightning strikes and quarter-sized hail pounded the eastern metro area between 1 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.\nAnd although his head was under the cart and he was bleeding badly, he was conscious, Cleveland said.\nA line of thunderstorms developed over the Front Range, as a cold upper-level system moved across the Rockies from Utah."}
