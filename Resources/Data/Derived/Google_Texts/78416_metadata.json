For more information on the comp plan, go to www.bouldervalleycompplan.net.\n\nBoulder's current zoning would allow for an additional 18,490 jobs to be added to the city by 2040, with additional capacity for another 36,000 jobs beyond that, while the city could only add 6,260 dwelling units.\n\nThat imbalance \u2014 Boulder's position as a regional employment center, the high number of in-commuters and the difficulty of finding housing here, especially housing that most workers can afford \u2014 has been at the heart of the city's growth debate for decades.\n\nThose projections, which are based on the maximum capacity for additional residential and commercial growth under existing land use regulations, are part of an analysis the city's Community Planning and Sustainability Department has carried out to prepare for the 2015 update to the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We have a lot more capacity for non-residential growth than for housing,\" said Lesli Ellis, Boulder's comprehensive planning manager. \"We think that's something the community might want to talk about.\"\n\nThe comprehensive plan is the region's \"land use bible,\" adopted jointly by the city and the county, that describes the values and policies that guide decisions around land use regulations in Boulder and the surrounding county areas known as the city's \"service area.\"\n\nBoulder is hosting a kick-off event Monday evening at Chautauqua to present some of the data and forecasts prepared so far, explain the process for public participation going forward and hold small group discussions about people's vision for the future.\n\nEllis said it's important for the public to understand the projections are just one of many possibilities. Changes to land use policy could change how many jobs a future Boulder has and who can live here, and the comp plan update process is where people can advocate for the changes they want to see.\n\n\"These number are not fixed in stone,\" she said. \"These are intended to give a sense of what our land use policies would create. They give us a sense of where we are headed. We can change our policies and get different numbers. That's part of the comprehensive plan update process.\"\n\nThe projections are based on the amount of land zoned for industrial or commercial mixed use development, including many places that currently have low-rise buildings on them but could be redeveloped with much more square footage. That's been the trend over the last decade, as 992,000 square feet of commercial and mixed use space was demolished and reborn as 2.7 million square feet between 2003 and 2014and 68,000 square feet of industrial space was demolished and turned into 440,000 square feet.\n\nPlanners looked at historic growth rates, which parts of the city have tended to see the maximum allowable square footage and which see less, constraints on development like floodplain, open space and rights-of-way and the typical square footage per employee to come up with the capacity for additional jobs and housing.\n\nBut the numbers have already become a source of contention for some.\n\nFeeling 'a little bit of a stalemate'\n\nCity Council members earlier this week wondered if future projections took into account the concessions often granted during the site review process. Ellis said she believes the numbers capture those trends without assuming every property would go through site review.\n\nThe 2015 community profile estimates the number of jobs now at 98,510. That makes it appear that only 1,700 new jobs were added between 2010 and 2014, while information presented last year showed an increase of 7,000 jobs in the same time period.\n\nEllis said the city changed its methodology because officials realized jobs counted at companies with Boulder addresses sometimes were physically located in other cities in the region, while for planning purposes, it's more important to know how many people come into the city each day.\n\nIt creates an anomaly in the data, she said, but the old numbers were probably too high as well. Ellis believes the new approach, confirmed with Brian Lewandowski at the Leeds School of Business and the Boulder Economic Council is more accurate and will be used going forward.\n\nSteve Pomerance, an activist on growth issues, as well as a former City Council member and Daily Camera columnist, said the new jobs number may be more accurate, but changing the methodology raises questions and undermines public trust in the process.\n\nEllis said the city didn't apply the new methodology to old jobs numbers because it would be a very time-consuming process. However, the city wants to build future projections off an accurate current number.\n\nThe growth in commercial and industrial square footage also tells the story, with more than 500,000 square feet added just in 2014.\n\nThe 2015 community profile also describes trends many residents have already experienced: rising home prices and dropping rental vacancies.\n\nThe city had 42,960 housing units in 2010 and 44,725 in 2014. That number could reach 52,000 in 2040, but that would be the limit's of the city's residential capacity. At the same time, population trends would take the city's population from 104,810 today to 123,000 in 2040.\n\nEllis said Monday's meeting will deal with trends and forecasts at a high level, with more detailed information posted on the project website, www.bouldervalleycompplan.net. Planners intend to hold open office hours in the coming months to explain methodology and dig into questions about the numbers with people who want that level of detail.\n\nJohn Tayer, president and CEO of the Boulder Chamber of Commerce, said there may be costs to Boulder being a jobs center, but there are advantages and benefits as well, particularly to Boulder's tax revenue.\n\nTayer said he's \"excited\" to begin the comprehensive plan process, which he said is the appropriate place to have the discussion around jobs and housing.\n\n\"I'm not interested in talking about restrictions on the commercial sector, but I do want to talk about developing vibrant communities where we can have a mix of residential and commercial uses,\" he said.\n\nZane Selvans, chair of the city's Transportation Advisory Board, but also an advocate for denser, more urban development, said the city can add more housing, but it will require pushing forward with changes. Selvans had high hopes for the Envision East Arapahoe planning process, which called for commercial and industrial areas in eastern Boulder to be redeveloped as mixed use communities along a transit corridor. That process was set aside in the face of intense community opposition.\n\n\"I wonder if people who bring up the jobs-housing balance, which is a real issue that makes it really difficult to address the in-commuting, do they want to open up eastern Boulder for more residential growth?\" he asked. \"I feel like we're in a little bit of a stalemate. The existing zoning is not what we want but we're torn about whether we want to do something that would allow for something different or just shut it down.\"\n\nSelvans said he would also like the city to consider placing land in trust for affordable housing, so that land prices could come out of the calculation for housing costs, and find more opportunities for small units scattered in existing residential neighborhoods.\n\n'We're going to have show up to those meetings'\n\nThese ideas and others that came out of the Housing Boulder process have galvanized some Boulder residents behind two growth-related charter amendments, one of which would allow neighborhoods to vote on changes to land use regulations and the other of which would require that new development pay to offset impacts to levels of service.\n\n\"This whole thing is about the city trying to upzone our neighborhoods,\" Ruth Blackmore, a longtime activist on growth issues said at a PLAN-Boulder County forum Friday on the initiatives. \"That's why we need a vote.\"\n\nSelvans said the comprehensive plan process provides an opportunity to help make housing policy ideas reality.\n\n\"This is the next step,\" he said. \"We're going to have show up to those meetings.\"\n\nLand use changes don't happen during the comp plan process itself, but changes there often set the stage for new ordinances and rezonings later. If the charter amendments pass, those ordinances could be voted on by neighborhoods where at least 10 percent of registered voters sign a petition.\n\nPomerance, for his part, doesn't put much stock in the comprehensive plan or the update process. He believes the projections are too mushy and imprecise, but more importantly the wrong place to start.\n\nThe question, he said, isn't whether Boulder should have 20,000 more jobs but what kind of quality of life residents want?\n\nAn author of Development Shall Pay Its Own Way, Pomerance cast the real issues in terms of what the charter amendment would do, establish levels of service and require the city to maintain them.\n\n\"I don't start my planning on 'here are the numbers, how do we change them?'\" he said. \"I start it with what kind of city do I want to live in, what kind of quality of life do I want to have. And with that comes what level of service do I want to have? And then I say if I'm going to have more growth, who is going to pay for the services that will give me that quality of life?\"\n\nPomerance said he doesn't believe a city of 120,000 would be \"tolerable\" to live in.\n\n\"People will have to live in boxes to handle the impacts,\" he said. \"I don't see this comprehensive planning process gong anywhere because it doesn't face up to the costs and constraints that exist.\"\n\nBut Pomerance still thinks people should participate.\n\n\"If people don't participate, it will be even worse,\" he said.\n\nEllis said city planners aren't going into the process with pre-conceived ideas.\n\n\"We're really looking for people to tell us what matters to them,\" she said.\n\nErica Meltzer: 303-473-1355, meltzere@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/meltzere", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28724800/boulder-kicks-off-comp-plan-process", "sailthru.author": "By Erica Meltzer \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28724800:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-29T10:44:16-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Boulder's current zoning would allow for an additional 18,490 jobs to be added to the city by 2040, with additional capacity for another 36,000 jobs beyond that, while the city could only add 6,260 dwelling units.", "title": "Boulder kicks off comp plan process", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28724800/boulder-kicks-off-comp-plan-process", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0829/20150829__30DCACOMw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "modificationDate": "2015-08-29T17:01:53-0600", "endDate": "2025-08-29T10:44:16-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Erica MeltzerStaff", "pubDate": "2015-08-29T10:48:13-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-29T10:44:16-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder kicks off comp plan process", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0829/20150829__30DCACOMw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Boulder's current zoning would allow for an additional 18,490 jobs to be added to the city by 2040, with additional capacity for another 36,000 jobs beyond that, while the city could only add 6,260 dwelling units.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28724800/boulder-kicks-off-comp-plan-process", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Boulder's current zoning would allow for an additional 18,490 jobs to be added to the city by 2040, with additional capacity for another 36,000 jobs beyond that, while the city could only add 6,260 dwelling units.", "title": "Boulder kicks off comp plan process"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0829/20150829__30DCACOMw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Land use changes don't happen during the comp plan process itself, but changes there often set the stage for new ordinances and rezonings later.\nSelvans said the comprehensive plan process provides an opportunity to help make housing policy ideas reality.\nPomerance, for his part, doesn't put much stock in the comprehensive plan or the update process.\nThat's part of the comprehensive plan update process.\"\nTayer said he's \"excited\" to begin the comprehensive plan process, which he said is the appropriate place to have the discussion around jobs and housing."}
