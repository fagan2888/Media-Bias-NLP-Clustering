University of Colorado at Boulder police believe a man found dead Saturday on campus is a local transient who didn’t attend the school.

“We believe we have an ID but we’re not releasing it at this time. We believe he is 51,” university police Cmdr. Robert Axmacher said Sunday.

Passers-by spotted the man, who they believed was unconscious, at about 8:40 p.m., outside the Bruce Curtis Building at the west end of the campus near Broadway, Axmacher said.

CU police and paramedics responded to the report, and paramedics determined that the man was deceased.

The cause and manner of the man’s death have not been determined.

It was the second time since Friday that someone has been found dead in a public space in Boulder.

On Friday night, a woman’s body was found in the Boulder Creek path underpass near Broadway and Arapahoe Avenue.

The Boulder County coroner’s office has not yet identified either of the deceased. “I’m guessing we will be able to release a name at least on the guy from last night tomorrow before noon,” said Wendy Kane, deputy coroner.

Kane said she didn’t know how long it will take to identify the woman.

Police said they found no signs of foul play in her death.
