There\u2019s no doubt that the man knows what he\u2019s doing when it comes to the operating room, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to politics. Sure, he has many loyal conservative fans, but it\u2019s difficult for others to ignore some rather far reaching metaphors and statements he\u2019s made in previous years when considering Obama\u2019s successor.\n\n[Warning: If you are one of those loyal Ben Carson fans, you probably won\u2019t like this list.]\n\nHe\u2019s touched on some controversial subjects \u2013 some of which have led him to state that he will no longer address topics \u2013 like gay marriage and homosexuality to avoid any more slack from the media on the matter. So why don\u2019t we go ahead and start with those.\n\nIn April of 2013, Carson compared same-sex marriage to pedophilia and bestiality.\n\n1. \u201cMy thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It\u2019s a well-established, fundamental pillar of society, and no group \u2014 be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter what they are \u2014 they don\u2019t get to change the definition.\u201d\n\nAnd he more recently spoke about his opinions of the choice of sexual orientation (which, yes, he later apologized for).\n\n2. \u201cBecause a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight\u2014and when they come out, they\u2019re gay. So, did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question.\u201d\n\nHe has also willingly shared his thoughts about Obama, Obamacare and slavery, the state of our country, a connection between ISIS and students taking AP history classes, the IRS vs. Gestapo, his thoughts on the Veteran\u2019s Affairs waiting list scandal, and saying Obamacare is worse than 9/11.\n\n3. [On Obama\u2019s attire]: \u201cLike most psychopaths. That\u2019s why they\u2019re successful. That\u2019s the way they look. They all look great.\u201d He later said: \u201cBut he knows he\u2019s telling a lie! He\u2019s trying to sell what he thinks is not true! He\u2019s sitting there saying, \u2018These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.'\u201d\n\n4. \u201cObamacare is the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery. In a way, it is slavery, because it is making all of us subservient to the government.\u201d\n\n5. \u201cI mean, [America is] very much like Nazi Germany. And I know you\u2019re not supposed to say \u2018Nazi Germany,\u2019 but I don\u2019t care about political correctness. You know, you had a government using its tools to intimidate the population. We now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe.\u201d\n\n6. [On Advanced Placement history courses]: \u201cI think most people, when they finish that course, they\u2019d be ready to go sign up for ISIS.\u201d\n\n7. [On the IRS]: \u201cYou know, we live in a Gestapo age, people don\u2019t realize it.\u201d\n\n8. \u201cI think what\u2019s happening with the veterans is a gift from God to show us what happens when you take layers and layers of bureaucracy and place them between the patients and the health care provider. And if we can\u2019t get it right, with the relatively small number of veterans, how in the world are you going to do it with the entire population?\u201d\n\n9. \u201cBecause 9/11 is an isolated incident. Things that are isolated issues as opposed to things that fundamentally change the United Sates of America and shift power from the people to the government. That is a huge shift. You have to take a long-term look at something that fundamentally changes the power structure of America.\u201d\n\nAnd last but not least, Carson shared his thoughts on the potential of Ebola being used as a biological weapon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Ben Carson has said a lot of controversial things that are inevitably coming up (and have been for a while) since he announced his presidential candidacy.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson has said a lot of controversial things that are inevitably coming up (and have been for a while) since he announced his presidential candidacy.", "title": "10 Ben Carson quotes: The GOP presidential candidate hasn\u2019t always had a way with words", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/bencarson_flickr_gageskidmore.jpg", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/05/ben-carson-quote-gop-republican-presidential-candidate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/bencarson_flickr_gageskidmore.jpg", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson has said a lot of controversial things that are inevitably coming up (and have been for a while) since he announced his presidential candidacy.", "card": "summary", "title": "10 Ben Carson quotes: The GOP presidential candidate hasn't always had a way with words - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,2016 presidential candidacy, Ben Carson, Dr. Benjamin Carson, Johns Hopkins Hospital, presidential candidate quotes, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "presidential candidate quotes", "published_time": "2015-05-13T16:38:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd84e0\"", "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate and former Johns Hopkins Hospital neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson has faced quite a bit of heat for saying many things that just might be considered offensive to some.\n[Warning: If you are one of those loyal Ben Carson fans, you probably won\u2019t like this list.]\nIn April of 2013, Carson compared same-sex marriage to pedophilia and bestiality.\nIn a way, it is slavery, because it is making all of us subservient to the government.\u201d5.\n\u201cBecause a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight\u2014and when they come out, they\u2019re gay."}
