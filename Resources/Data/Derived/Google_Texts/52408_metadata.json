Rainwater was, after all, preoccupied at the time with Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s priority project, that of privatizing the Office of Group Benefits (OGB).\n\nYou may remember the controversy surrounding the OGB. First, the state brought in Goldman Sachs to help write the specifications of the request for proposals (RFP) for the privatization scheme and then (drum roll please) Goldman Sachs was the only bidder at $6 million.\n\nAfter Goldman Sachs withdrew in a dispute over the issue of indemnification, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana finally got the bid but in between all that, there was that $49,999.99 contract to Chaffe and Associates for a study that failed to produce the results sought by the administration\u2014not to mention questions about the possibility of the existence of two Chaffe reports. http://louisianavoice.com/2011/06/20/was-leaked-chaffe-report-real-or-a-doa-misdirecton-ploy/\n\nThen there was the little matter of own confirmation hearings and that of a new OGB director before the Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee that almost certainly demanded much of Rainwater\u2019s attention.\n\nBut the confirmation hearing for Bruce Greenstein as Secretary of Health and Hospitals by the same committee a week later should have served as a red flag and should have set off all sorts of alarms within the Jindal administration\u2014beginning with Rainwater.\n\nhttp://louisianavoice.com/2011/06/09/jindals-appointees-arrogant-bureaucrats-or-simply-a-multitude-of-misunderstood-misbehavin-miscreants/\n\nThe warnings were clear and the track record of CNSI was readily available. Apparently no one in this administration ever heard of vetting a company before awarding it the largest single contract in the state\u2019s history.\n\nThat, it turned out, was a mistake of monumental proportions.\n\nThe awarding of the contract to Greenstein\u2019s former employer now reads like some kind of Tom Clancy espionage novel\u2014complete with secret communications, bid-rigging, lavish entertainment of state officials, death threats, creative accounting principles, money laundering, ghost employees, payments of non-existent loans, posh homes of questionable ownership, possible tax evasion, and claims of an ancestral link between Gov. Jindal\u2019s Indian heritage and CNSI\u2019s Indian ownership.\n\nThrow in the fact that CNSI is one of the subcontractors working on the Obamacare website, and you\u2019ve got all the makings of a real suspense story.\n\nTo say the CNSI story is complex would be to belabor the obvious which is all the more reason that Jindal and Rainwater should have taken a closer look at the qualifications of CNSI before committing to such a contract.\n\nIt turns out that every state might want to take a long, hard look at CNSI\u2019s credentials now that the company is in position to bid on billions in new contracts with individual states that, in order to receive new grants for expanded Medicaid rolls, will be required to update outdated IT systems in order to more readily share data. Michael Volpe recently had a story that dealt with that very issue in Frontpage Mag. http://www.frontpagemag.com/2013/volpe/billionaire-swindlers-line-up-for-obamacare/\n\nIn examining CNSI, these states might wish to begin with Maryland where CNSI\u2019s problems began as far back as 2001. In was that year that Maryland hired CNSI to develop its new web-based Main Medicaid Claims System for the processing of $1.5 billion per year in Medicaid Claims. CNSI has submitted the lower of two bids for the project. The company\u2019s $15 million bid was exactly half the $30 million bid by the other company. Experts say the state should have known right then that the low number of bidders and the disparity between bids were red flags.\n\nCNSI, it turned out, had zero experience in developing Medicaid claims systems. It was given 12 months to develop the system, which was finally put online in January of 2005, four years late.\n\nProblems occurred almost immediately. The company\u2019s costs quickly grew to $25 million but even worse for the state, there were an unusually high number of rejected claims from the outset and the number of suspended claims quickly reached 300,000\u2014a rejection rate of about 50 percent\u2014and by June the number had grown to 647,000, representing about $310 million in back payments to medical providers. Some facilities had to close their doors because of non-payments while others had to take out loans to keep their doors open and others simply stopped seeing Medicaid patients altogether.\n\nIn 2008, South Dakota awarded CNSI a $62.7 million contract for a new Medicaid processing system. By 2010\u2014nearly a year before Louisiana hired CNSI\u2014work was halted on the project after costs had grown to $80 million and the system was still two to three years from completion.\n\nA year ago, the Southeast Michigan Health Information Exchange (SEMHIE) filed suit against CNSI over a $1.8 million contract to develop a Social Security e-Disability project for SEMHIE. One of the stipulations of that contract was that any software developed for the project would become the property of SEMHIE. The lawsuit says that SEMHIE \u201crepeatedly, both orally and in writing,\u201d demanded delivery of the software but that CNSI has refused to turn over the software or even to communicate with SEMHIE.\n\nSEMHIE says it had been negotiating to provide the Michigan Health Information Network (MHIN) with the software but that CNSI\u2019s refusal to turn it over resulted in MHIN\u2019s termination of the agreement, thereby costing SEMHIE \u201csubstantial\u201d revenue.\n\nThe latest twist in the CNSI saga is that the State of Arkansas has, on the basis of the FBI investigation of CNSI\u2019s contract with Louisiana, disqualified CNSI from doing business with that state.\n\nBut the really interesting details of the CNSI contract and the company\u2019s links to former employee Greenstein, who was DHH Secretary at the time the contract was awarded, can be found in a series of interviews conducted by the FBI in Maryland FBIReportsCNSI in which two former employees, Vice President and Corporate Counsel Matthew Hoffman and Vice President of Accounting and Finance Jeffrey Weisenborne, reported bookkeeping irregularities, falsification of asset statements to bankers, the purchase of secret homes in Maine, Michigan and Washington State which were not carried on the CNSI books, non-existent loans for which the four CNSI partners received monthly payments, the hiring of CNSI partners\u2019 family members who did no work, bid-rigging, and threats to Hoffman that he would be killed if he disclosed company misconduct. dt.common.streams.StreamServer\n\nThe Louisiana Attorney General\u2019s office also conducted an interview with a CNSI employ who originally was a contract employee but who was subsequently hired full time by the company. The employee, identified only as Kunego, which was said to be a pseudonym, was conducted on May 10\u201411, 2012.\n\nHe testified that CNSI\u2019s bid was structured so that it could \u201cshave off\u201d about $40 million from its bid, thus allowing the company to win the contract after which it could get the terms of the contract changed. \u201cIn many states this alone would lead to disqualification of the CNSI proposal,\u201d he said. Additionally, he said DHH \u201cfront-loaded\u201d the contract, meaning CNSI got money up front because \u201cCNSI was close to being insolvent and needed this change to keep them afloat.\u201d\n\nKunego said in January of 2011 he and CNSI officials were in North Dakota to prepare their pricing for the Louisiana proposal when they were told by CNSI cofounder and CEO Bishwajeet Chatterjee that the number they had to beat was under $199 million. \u201cThis indicated that CNSI officers knew ahead of time the dollar amount that they had to propose to win the contract,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAfter the contract was awarded and during the protest period, Greenstein went to DC (Washington) and was picked up by CNSI officers and entertained to dinner,\u201d the witness said.\n\nHe said that during the Greenstein confirmation hearings, CNSI Vice President of Government Affairs \u201cwas very concerned that the Senate committee would subpoena their phone records. Carroll told Kunego that they deleted many text messages between CNSI officers and Greenstein to avoid them being subpoenaed.\u201d Moreover, he said Carroll used his wife\u2019s cell phone for most of the \u201coff channel communications\u201d with Greenstein.\n\nAlso during the Greenstein confirmation hearings, CNSI\u2019s lobbyist Alton Ashy was texting Greenstein in an effort to help him with his answers to questions being asked by committee members.\n\nKunego said that when Greenstein worked for CNSI he lived in a CNSI-owned townhome and that he \u201cgot the impression from Chatterjee that Greenstein had ownership in CNSI.\u201d He said 80 percent of CNSI is owned by the four founders\u2014Chatterjee, Chief Strategic Officer Adnan Ahmed, Chief Financial Officer Jaytee Kanwal, and Chief Administrative Officer Reet Singh\u2014while the remaining 20 percent is owned by 23 different people.\n\nThe Attorney General report quoted Kunego as saying Jindal has \u201can India to India ancestor-driven background and network of connectors that brought CNSI and Jindal together\u201d (a characterization the governor\u2019s office labeled as \u201cinsulting\u201d) and that \u201cJindal\u2019s public persona does not jive (sic) with what is going on at DHH.\u201d LDOJ Interview Report on CNSI from 051412\n\nFinally, we have to raise a couple of other questions here about the sequence of events that don\u2019t exactly shine the best light on the Jindal administration.\n\nWas the timing of the personnel change in the Division of Administration (DOA) coincidental or was it somehow tied to the pending investigation?\n\nRainwater was brought over to the governor\u2019s office on Oct. 15, 2012, to serve as Jindal\u2019s Chief of Staff and has not been heard from since while Deputy Chief of Staff Kristy Nichols left the governor\u2019s office to move across the street to the Claiborne Building to take over Rainwater\u2019s former duties.\n\nIn January, the FBI served a subpoena on DOA for all records pertaining to the CNSI bid and contract, including the RFP. And while Jindal certainly knew of the subpoena (and if he did not know, Nichols should be run off by a mean, biting dog for not informing her boss), the subpoena did not become public knowledge until early March. Once the news broke, Jindal acted with all deliberate speed (and yes, that\u2019s sarcasm) to announce the termination of the contract, saying his administration would \u201cnot tolerate corruption.\u201d\n\nA week after that, Greenstein announced his resignation, but incredibly, was allowed to remain on the job for another month.\n\nSo, did the administration initiate the personnel change at DOA in October in anticipation of the FBI and Attorney General investigations and the subpoena that would come down in three months?\n\nWhy did the administration try to keep a lid on the news of the subpoena for some two months and cancel the CNSI contract only when the subpoena\u2019s existence became public knowledge?\n\nAnd most important, why was Greenstein allowed to remain on the job for a full month after news of the subpoena and the cancellation of the CNSI contract?\n\nSomething here just doesn\u2019t pass the smell test.\n\nby Tom Aswell, Louisiana Voice\n\n(Photo: Bruce Greenstein)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Latest US, Louisiana News, political and business buzz  for New Orleans, Baton Rouge and other Louisiana cities", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Tom Aswell", "og": {"url": "http://www.bayoubuzz.com/buzz/latest-buzz/item/560204-cnsi-deal-not-passing-jindal-s-louisiana-healthcare-smell-test", "type": "article", "description": "Latest US, Louisiana News, political and business buzz  for New Orleans, Baton Rouge and other Louisiana cities", "title": "CNSI deal not passing Jindal's Louisiana healthcare smell test"}, "title": "CNSI deal not passing Jindal's Louisiana healthcare smell test", "keywords": "US, Louisiana News, Louisiana political, Louisiana politics, Louisiana business, New Orleans, Baton Rouge,  Louisiana cities, US politics, US news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda579\"", "article_summary": "The company\u2019s $15 million bid was exactly half the $30 million bid by the other company.\nOne probably can understand former Commissioner of Administration Paul Rainwater for not putting the kibosh on that ill-fated $194 million contract with CNSI in mid-2011.\nIn January, the FBI served a subpoena on DOA for all records pertaining to the CNSI bid and contract, including the RFP.\nIn 2008, South Dakota awarded CNSI a $62.7 million contract for a new Medicaid processing system.\nA year ago, the Southeast Michigan Health Information Exchange (SEMHIE) filed suit against CNSI over a $1.8 million contract to develop a Social Security e-Disability project for SEMHIE."}
