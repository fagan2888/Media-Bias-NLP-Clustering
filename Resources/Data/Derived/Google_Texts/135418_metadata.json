Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania-- following the December 2012 Newtown, Connecticut shooting.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who sponsored the bill to use the terrorist watch list to regulate gun purchases, slammed her Republican colleagues for voting against the legislation.\n\n\"If you need proof that Congress is a hostage to the gun lobby, look no further than today's vote blocking a bill to prevent known or suspected terrorists from buying guns and explosives,\" she said in a statement. \"Congress has been paralyzed by the gun lobby for years, while more and more Americans are killed in mass shootings. The carnage won't stop until Congress finds the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and protect the nation.\"\n\nDemocrats raised the bills as amendments during the scheduled Obamacare debate after demanding action to address gun violence. Following Wednesday's shooting, several liberals took Republicans to task for doing nothing aside from offering their \"thoughts and prayers\" after mass shootings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the wake of the San Bernardino, California shooting, lawmakers voted on a series of gun bills as part of an Obamacare debate", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-rejects-a-series-of-gun-control-bills/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/12/03/00e40c3c-d65d-47aa-b790-ac7f8895a375/thumbnail/1200x630/366b7dc0c64beb6277871c7ba4e8ef23/cbsnprayervsgunpolicy473022640x360.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "In the wake of the San Bernardino, California shooting, lawmakers voted on a series of gun bills as part of an Obamacare debate", "title": "Senate rejects a series of gun control bills"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the wake of the San Bernardino, California shooting, lawmakers voted on a series of gun bills as part of an Obamacare debate", "title": "Senate rejects a series of gun control bills", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/senate-rejects-a-series-of-gun-control-bills/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/senate-rejects-a-series-of-gun-control-bills/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-rejects-a-series-of-gun-control-bills/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "creator": "@http://twitter.com/stephcondoncbs", "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/12/03/00e40c3c-d65d-47aa-b790-ac7f8895a375/thumbnail/1200x630/366b7dc0c64beb6277871c7ba4e8ef23/cbsnprayervsgunpolicy473022640x360.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-rejects-a-series-of-gun-control-bills/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/senate-rejects-a-series-of-gun-control-bills/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "keywords": "san bernardino, san bernardino shooting, gun control, congress", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/Political-Hotsheet/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "san bernardino, san bernardino shooting, gun control, congress"}, "article_summary": "In the wake of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California that left 14 people dead, the Senate on Thursday voted on -- and rejected -- a series of gun control bills.\nThe carnage won't stop until Congress finds the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and protect the nation.\"\nBy a vote of 52 to 47, the Senate rejected a proposal to strengthen treatment for mental illness and substance abuse disorders.\n\"Congress has been paralyzed by the gun lobby for years, while more and more Americans are killed in mass shootings.\nDemocrats raised the bills as amendments during the scheduled Obamacare debate after demanding action to address gun violence."}
