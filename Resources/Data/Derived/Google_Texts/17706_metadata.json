Hall, who is Edmonton\u2019s star left winger and leading scorer, had just put his seventh shot on Varlamov, and he and his linemates had 15 through two periods.\n\n\u201cI saw that,\u201d Varlamov said of Hall\u2019s gesture. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see this very often, I can tell you. Huge respect there by Taylor. He\u2019s a good player, the leader of the Edmonton Oilers and when he\u2019s on the ice his line is creating a lot of scoring chances.\u201d\n\nHall\u2019s public plaudit of Varlamov suggested the Oilers were beyond frustrated, and somewhat appreciative of the red-hot goalie from Russia. Varlamov was just that good in Colorado\u2019s 5-1 victory at the Pepsi Center.\n\nThe Avs built a 3-0 lead to support Varlamov\u2019s stellar play and went on to secure their fifth consecutive win to improve to 17-16-1 on the season. The winning streak is the longest since Colorado won six in a row in coach Patrick Roy\u2019s first season of 2013-14, when it captured the Central Division and finished second in the Western Conference.\n\n\u201cVarly is playing so well right now,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at him, it seems very easy. He\u2019s under control. He\u2019s moving well. He sees the puck big. He\u2019s in a zone right now and we feed off him.\u201d\n\nThe Avs got short-handed, power-play and even-strength goals from Blake Comeau, Tyson Barrie and Nick Holden to take a 3-0 lead into the third period. It marked the fifth consecutive time Colorado scored first and the fourth time during that stretch it built a 2-0 lead.\n\nEdmonton got within 3-1 early in the third period with a bar-down goal from defenseman Andrej Sekera before Edmonton native Jarome Iginla, the Avs\u2019 right winger, scored his 598th career goal to reestablish the three-goal lead. Iginla is two goals away from becoming the 19th player to score 600 goals.\n\nIginla ended a nine-game goal-less drought. Comeau scored on a short-handed breakaway 1:12 into the game after the Avs were whistled for too many men while making their first shift change of the game. Barrie and Holden beat goalie Anders Nilsson with long shots through traffic.\n\n\u201cWe stuck together for the last two or three weeks and we\u2019ve grown, learning how everyone plays. We\u2019re all really comfortable with each other,\u201d Comeau said. \u201cWe\u2019re a confident group. We\u2019ve been doing really good things.\u201d\n\nFourth-line winger Jack Skille beat Nilsson with a wrist shot late in the third period.\n\nThe Avs continue their four-game homestand Monday against the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\n\u201cWe had a tough schedule and our players deserve a lot of credit. They work hard, they believe in themselves. I am very proud of our players,\u201d Roy said.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Semyon Varlamov saves 39 as Avalanche cruises to win over Oilers", "title": "Semyon Varlamov saves 39 as Avalanche cruises to win over Oilers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/19/semyon-varlamov-saves-39-as-avalanche-cruises-to-win-over-oilers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151219__Semyon-Varlamov-Oilersp1.jpg", "height": 494}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151219__Semyon-Varlamov-Oilersp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-19T22:40:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:23:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Taylor Hall gave goalie Semyon Varlamov a complimentary tap on the left leg pad after the right one stoned him at the second-period buzzer Saturday.\nWe\u2019ve been doing really good things.\u201dFourth-line winger Jack Skille beat Nilsson with a wrist shot late in the third period.\nComeau scored on a short-handed breakaway 1:12 into the game after the Avs were whistled for too many men while making their first shift change of the game.\nVarlamov was just that good in Colorado\u2019s 5-1 victory at the Pepsi Center.\nEdmonton got within 3-1 early in the third period with a bar-down goal from defenseman Andrej Sekera before Edmonton native Jarome Iginla, the Avs\u2019 right winger, scored his 598th career goal to reestablish the three-goal lead."}
