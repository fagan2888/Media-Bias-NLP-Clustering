Twenty-two girls showed off their holiday cheer Saturday afternoon - all vying for the title of Miss Merry Meridian Queen.

Girls of all ages were at Union Station for the miss merry meridian pageant. 14-year-old Kiera Nicole Morgan from Newton County Academy was chosen as this year's queen. She'll help out with the Merry Meridian festivities. Newscenter 11's own Brian Hutton, Jr., was one of the judges for this event.
