Kidney transplants cost the least, averaging $263,000, Seattle-based consulting firm Milliman found. International patients typically pay more to transplant centers than U.S. payors and insurers, experts said.\n\n\u201cSome medical centers see foreigners as a source of income. They don't bring people from abroad out of generosity and love. They make a bundle,\u201d said Dr. Gabriel Danovitch, medical director for the kidney and pancreas transplant program at University of California, Los Angeles, and former chairman of the international relations committee of the United Network for Organ Sharing.\n\nThe 224 transplants that surgeons performed on noncitizen and nonresident patients in 2013 represented a 20 percent jump from 2012, when transplant experts sanctioned by the government lifted a rule intending to curb such operations.\n\nUNOS, the nonprofit that runs the nation's organ transplant system, does not track payments from international patients. Prospective recipients negotiate fees with transplant centers that often throw in services extending beyond medicine, such as financial counselors and translators.\n\nSome hospitals provide concierges to coordinate appointments, medical records and visa requirements.\n\nThe practice elicits passionate criticism from some people.\n\n\u201cIf you're not a U.S. citizen, you shouldn't be over here getting our organs. We should get first choice,\u201d said Amanda Eisenhauer, 29, of Selinsgrove, north of Harrisburg, who has cystic fibrosis. In July, she went on a wait list for a double lung transplant at UPMC Presbyterian.\n\nAdvocates say allowing foreigners to receive organs in the United States can be a matter of life or death.\n\nVery sick children\n\nSumika Nagao, a toddler from the Japanese city of Imizu, received a heart in May at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Weakened by cardiomyopathy, a chronic disease of the heart muscle, the 18-month-old girl would have died, her family said.\n\n\u201cIn Japan, we just don't have donors for that young age. They told us that if we wanted a transplant and wanted her to live, we'd have to leave the country. If that gives her hope to live, that's what we had to do,\u201d her mother, Mika Nagao, 38, told the Tribune-Review through an interpreter.\n\nOfficials at Children's, affiliated with transplant giant UPMC, crafted a package deal for Sumika costing nearly $1 million, according to the family. It included flying her from Japan on a specialized jet staffed with two doctors, a nurse and a respiratory therapist.\n\n\u201cThe question that should be asked is: Did she get special treatment because she could pay the money?\u201d said George Annas, a professor and chairman of the Department of Health Law, Bioethics and Human Rights at Boston University.\n\n\u201cI don't think anybody should second-guess the family for bringing their child here. The question for Pittsburgh is: How often are you going to do this?\u201d\n\nDr. Peter Wearden, surgical director for pediatric heart and lung transplantation at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said the hospital is selective of international cases it accepts \u2014 typically very sick children.\n\nOf 32 patients added to the heart transplant wait list in 2012 and 2013, only one was a nonresident; seven nonresidents went on the liver transplant list.\n\n\u201cObviously, we'd love to be able to help everybody we could. We have to be cognizant of the fact that these donated organs are really a gift, and we have to be good stewards of that gift,\u201d Wearden said.\n\nPrepaid care\n\nThe severity of Sumika's illness shocked her parents, a psychiatrist and a nurse who have two older children. Doctors told them that only a transplant would save Sumika, whose plight became national news in her country.\n\nOrgan transplants are rare in Japan. In 2013, Japanese surgeons performed fewer than 300 organ transplants using deceased donors, compared with more than 22,000 in the United States.\n\nThe variation stems from cultural differences over when it's best to harvest organs and whether the practice is acceptable at all, according to medical scholars.\n\nMany Japanese believe people need to keep their organs intact, even in death, so the body can be recycled for another life, said Dr. Ayano Kiyota, a geriatric medicine specialist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu.\n\n\u201cCertainly, if we could take care of our people in Japan, that's the best way to go,\u201d said Kiyota, a UPMC-trained physician who is returning to practice this year in her native Japan. She said the Japanese government in 2010 began allowing organ donation from patients younger than 15, although the practice remains uncommon.\n\nAs Sumika got sicker, doctors hooked her to a machine, the Berlin Heart, to assume the heart's function and restore blood flow.\n\nResearchers tested the device in Pittsburgh before the Food and Drug Administration approved it in 2011. Wearden trained colleagues at Osaka Medical Center in Japan on using the device. Sumika's parents, Mika and Masahisa Nagao, raised $1.4 million in donations to pay for their daughter's care, including the transplant.\n\nBefore they arrived in the United States, the family gave the hospital an $800,000 deposit, Mika Nagao said. The fee covered the cost of transporting Sumika in a leased jet, the transplant and a hospital stay for a number of days based on similar cases.\n\n\u201cThey are required to deposit the money into an account prior to them flying in,\u201d said Mourad Hanna, a manager in the international medical services department at Children's. Expenses not prepaid are offered at a 35 percent discount, Hanna said.\n\nChildren's officials would not discuss details of the arrangement, saying only that the discounts make their transplant program competitive with others in the United States.\n\nPatients get quality care and competitive pricing that is \u201ccost-effective for international families,\u201d said Mariel Garcia, director of international and telemedicine services.\n\n\u2018We did it just for her'\n\nSumika and her mother arrived in Pittsburgh in March.\n\n\u201cWe were scared. We didn't know what was going to happen. We did it just for her,\u201d Mika Nagao said.\n\nThey waited roughly two months for an available heart. The median wait time for a heart for children ages 1 to 5 is 104 days, according to UNOS.\n\nDr. Francis Delmonico, a professor of surgery at Harvard University and leading transplant expert, said Sumika \u201cshould not be denied a chance to live, but the country should not require her to go to the United States.\u201d\n\nPatients and their families undergo a rigorous interview process before they are cleared for transplants, said Dr. Victor Morell, Sumika's surgeon and chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Children's. Because the surgery is so expensive, economic factors can be an issue, he said. Morell said Sumika was accepted as a candidate because doctors at Children's knew her doctors in Japan. The family's ability to pay did not move her up the list.\n\n\u201cThat would be completely crazy to consider that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not like we are looking for kids from outside the United States for transplants. We have plenty of kids.\u201d\n\nDoctors told Sumika's family to stay in Pittsburgh for at least six months, but they have not determined when they'll go back to Japan.\n\n\u201cWe didn't expect to find the donor that quick. ... I thought about the parents who lost their child. It just crushed my heart,\u201d Mika Nagao said.\n\nLuis F\u00e1bregas is Trib Total Media's medical editor.
