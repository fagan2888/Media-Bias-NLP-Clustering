The economy remains the biggest concern for Americans, despite record numbers on U.S. stock market exchanges.\n\n\n\nThe president renewed his call for increasing the minimum wage, and urged Congress to reach a \"responsible\" budget deal that eliminates harmful spending cuts known as the \"sequester, and extends unemployment insurance.\n\n\n\nHe said important social programs for the jobless, seniors and the poor must be sustained, and the American \"safety net\" reinforced, while Social Security must be strengthened to ensure its promise for future generations.\n\n\n\nThe president said public frustration with Washington is at an all time high because of the \"admittedly poor execution\" of his health care law, popularly known as \"Obamacare,\" and blamed what he called the \"reckless\" government shutdown on congressional Republicans.\n\n\n\nObama challenged Republicans to propose \"concrete plans\" that would help reduce inequality, build the middle class and provide opportunity to the poor.\n\n\n\n\"If you still do not like Obamacare, and I know you do not, even though it is built on market-based ideas of choice and competition and the private sector, then you should explain how exactly you would cut costs, and cover more people and make insurance more secure,\" he said. \"You owe it to the American people to tell us what you are for, not just what you are against.\"\n\n\n\nIn a written statement, Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner said Obama's speech acknowledged \"the failure of his economic policies.\"\n\n\n\nBoehner also spoke on the House floor, asserting congressional Democrats are to blame for blocking Republican-sponsored legislation and \"serious good faith efforts.\"\n\n\n\n\"Every single one of these bills has been blocked by Washington Democrats,\" he said. \"The Senate [and] the president continue to stand in the way of the people's priorities.\"\n\n\n\nOn the budget, currently being negotiated by key lawmakers, Obama said, \"We should not be stuck in a stale debate. A relentlessly growing deficit of opportunity,\" he said, \"is a greater threat to our future than a rapidly-shrinking fiscal deficit.\"\n\n\n\nObama's speech was also a preview of the sorts of themes he is likely to address in his State of the Union address next year.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "USA, Economy, World News, USA, economy, Obama", "Author": "Dan Robinson", "og": {"site_name": "VOA", "description": "President says since the late 1970s, the US economy has doubled in size -- but wealth has spread among a select few", "title": "Obama: US Economic Inequality a 'Defining Challenge'", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/content/obama-economic-inequality-is-hurting-americas-future/1803524.html", "image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/27E87B9B-00BC-4E64-B0FC-775F9C38283E_cx0_cy2_cw0_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/27E87B9B-00BC-4E64-B0FC-775F9C38283E_cx0_cy2_cw0_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "site": "@voanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Obama: US Economic Inequality a 'Defining Challenge'", "google-site-verification": "xhlpWO2mj7cS-CLSz4sliKEzNLqoRguHlaJnb1PFuBs", "keywords": "voa, voice of america, voanews, voanews,voianews, english news, voa special english, special english, voa\u5b98\u7f51, voanews.com, china, iran the voice of america, syria, \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voiceofamerica"}, "abstract": "The Voice of America is one of the world's most trusted sources for news and information from the United States and around the world.
