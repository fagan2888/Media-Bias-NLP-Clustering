She called the facility multiple times and even stopped by, but has gotten no results.\n\n\"I've had some call backs on mammograms. That's one reason I'm doubly concerned because I want them to see what my history has been,\" said Harding, who wants the records for her new doctor. \u201cThose records, I feel like, belong to me, and there\u2019s no way I can get them. I\u2019m representing one of thousands of people that are in the same situation\u2026and none of us have gotten any direction on what to do.\u201d\n\nHarding and other patients wondered how hard it is to call or e-mail them or post a note on the door.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating, and it\u2019s very aggravating,\u201d Harding said.\n\nDeparting doctors have a professional obligation to notify patients and give them an opportunity to obtain their medical records, according to the state Medical Board.\n\nThe facility eventually posted a sign on its front door listing when patients can pick up their records \u2013 Monday through Friday of this week from 10 a.m. to noon.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Christopher Tharrington, who took over the facility eight years ago and filed for bankruptcy in April, said he would extend those hours after 5 On Your Side reached out to him. An employee who handled patient issues left unexpectedly and Tharrington said he has been scrambling since.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-07-23 18:36:00", "description": "Patients at Cary Diagnostic Radiology are frustrated at the process to obtain their medical records after the facility closed in June.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-23 18:39:15", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13835619|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Patients at Cary Diagnostic Radiology are frustrated at the process to obtain their medical records after the facility closed in June.", "title": "Patients frustrated at records access after Cary medical facility closes :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/patients-frustrated-at-records-access-after-cary-medical-facility-closes/13835619/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/5oys/2014/07/23/13835637/13835637-1406152970-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-23T18:36:00-04:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Patients at Cary Diagnostic Radiology are frustrated at the process to obtain their medical records after the facility closed in June.", "title": "Patients frustrated at records access after Cary medical facility closes :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/patients-frustrated-at-records-access-after-cary-medical-facility-closes/13835619/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/5oys/2014/07/23/13835637/13835637-1406152970-646x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "pinterest": "nohover", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5a77\"", "article_summary": "Departing doctors have a professional obligation to notify patients and give them an opportunity to obtain their medical records, according to the state Medical Board.\nHarding has been unable to retrieve 15 years of her medical records.\nThe facility eventually posted a sign on its front door listing when patients can pick up their records \u2013 Monday through Friday of this week from 10 a.m. to noon.\nShe called the facility multiple times and even stopped by, but has gotten no results.\n\u201cThose records, I feel like, belong to me, and there\u2019s no way I can get them."}
