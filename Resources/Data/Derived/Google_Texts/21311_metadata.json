What they don\u2019t do is provide a market advantage. A successful provider network will look to cost-effective cloud-based solutions to complement EHRs, broaden and connect the care community, grow revenue, create workflow efficiencies and, ultimately, provide a truly competitive advantage.\n\nThe problem with EHRs\n\nSince their inception, EHRs have been a touchy subject. Operating executives have acknowledged the importance of upgrading outdated analog tools and implementing effective instruments for retrieving patient data, entering orders, receiving results and documenting visits. But they have also admitted their disappointment in the resources \u2013 both financial and operational. Physicians have also been vocal in their dislike of EHRs, pointing to the technology\u2019s disruptive nature and time-consuming requirements.\n\nHospital executives that expected to see returns on their EHR investments have been disillusioned, knowing now that new revenue opportunities originate outside of those walls. Inpatient admissions and surgical procedures are no longer contributing needed revenue growth, as volumes are being reclassified and transitioned to outpatient settings.\n\nAs Moody\u2019s Investors Service has reported, nonprofit hospitals\u2019 income declined for the second straight year in 2013. Hospitals must turn their attention to technologies that can connect the broader community of independent providers, uncovering the value in new referral sources and effective care coordination. EHRs were not designed to meet this need.\n\nThe cloud-based solution\n\nRegardless of EHRs\u2019 deficiencies, the initial decision to digitize was not wrong \u2013 it was necessary to improve efficiency. But that action was a one-time occurrence and should not be viewed as a competitive strategy.\n\nThough arguably useful in the long term, investments into EHR technologies do not improve outpatient revenue and associated contribution margins. And with the shift to value-based care, it is more important than ever that health systems prioritize care coordination across organizational boundaries. EHRs\u2019 limitations in this area can be detrimental to a health system\u2019s business strategy.\n\nNetwork providers must turn to additional tools that can help fill the holes left by EHRs. Inexpensive cloud-based software can help supply what EHRs lack \u2013 the ability to quickly grow outpatient volume, curtail network leakage and lift contribution margins. These tools act as referral management platforms and assist in scheduling and analytics. They are designed to interoperate with EHRs, adding new value to the tool and potentially helping create the investment returns that were originally expected.\n\nHealth system executives who want to create a competitive advantage will think beyond EHRs, unlocking value unknown to those who simply implement the same cookie-cutter tools as their competitors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Somehow health systems have adopted the notion that electronic health records are central to their competitive strategies -- viewing the technology's capabilities beyond their original design and intent.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "Somehow health systems have adopted the notion that electronic health records are central to their competitive strategies -- viewing the technology's capabilities beyond their original design and intent.", "title": "EHRs are not a business strategy", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/blog/ehrs-are-not-business-strategy", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/hitn-defaultlogo-700x357.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-23T14:16:43-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/blog/ehrs-are-not-business-strategy", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/hitn-defaultlogo-700x357.jpg"}, "description": "Somehow health systems have adopted the notion that electronic health records are central to their competitive strategies -- viewing the technology's capabilities beyond their original design and intent.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "EHRs are not a business strategy"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-23T14:16:42-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-23T14:16:43-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "EHRs\u2019 limitations in this area can be detrimental to a health system\u2019s business strategy.\nThough arguably useful in the long term, investments into EHR technologies do not improve outpatient revenue and associated contribution margins.\nIn fact, once all health systems inevitably implement EHRs, they become another toolset within the hospital; they become expected assets of the institutions, not unlike thermometers, stethoscopes or examining rooms.\nAnd with the shift to value-based care, it is more important than ever that health systems prioritize care coordination across organizational boundaries.\nThey are designed to interoperate with EHRs, adding new value to the tool and potentially helping create the investment returns that were originally expected."}
