However, Davis, who returns to work Monday, could face sanctions if she again interferes with eligible couples receiving licenses.\n\n\n\nWill Davis see the billboard? Quite possibly. It is placed in the middle of a long road in the rural town of 7,000 people and will be erected for one month.\n\n\"We have been told members of the local community have been taking photos and selfies in front of the billboard,\" Jackson said. \"We are excited that they've embraced our message.\"\n\nPlanting Peace is the same group that launched the Equality House in 2013, a rainbow-painted house across from the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan., where a lesbian couple held their wedding.\n\nBillboard erected in Kim Davis' hometown of Morehead, Ky.
