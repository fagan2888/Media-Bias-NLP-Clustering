To take advantage of the popularity of “Jane the Virgin,” CW will pair that hour with “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” this fall.

Both fanciful, high concept shows premiere Oct. 12.

The returning “Jane the Virgin” will get a casting boost from Britney Spears, who will play herself as the nemesis of Rogelio.

The hour leading into “Jane” will be “Crazy Ex” starring Rachel Bloom (until now a YouTube favorite) as an unhappy lawyer who quits her job and moves across the country in search of love, with an inner monologue running full-tilt, complete with splashy musical production numbers. (Bloom’s ode to West Covina is one of the standout bits of any pilot this fall.) Expect two or three musical numbers per episode, ranging across all genres.

“I’m still not sure this isn’t a prank by my middle-school bullies,” Bloom said of making the leap from the Internet to TV.

She was also stunned to film in a Southern California outdoor mall.

The show takes shots at SoCal, where Bloom grew up feeling that “depression was against the law.”
