Cozy relationships between state legislators and utility giant Dominion Resources threaten property rights to develop the wrong kind of energy, said House of Delegates candidate Ellen Arthur.

Arthur, a retired Lexington attorney, is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican Ben Cline for the 24th District House seat.

Gas pipelines are dangerous to landowners and the environment, and developing fossil fuels in an investment in obsolete and dwindling energy resources, Arthur said in a statement.

"We should be using that money to create well-paying jobs harnessing other energy resources such as solar and wind power," said Arthur, 68.

She also thinks the state should expand Medicaid to free billions in federal dollars available through the Affordable Care Act. Failing to do so foregoes money that Virginia taxpayers have paid into and denies health insurance to 400,000 Virginians, Arthur said.

"Virginians currently are paying federal taxes for Medicaid expansion and getting nothing in return," she said.

She is a New Jersey native who graduated from Washington and Lee Law School. Arthur practiced family law and worked for the Legal Aid Society of the Roanoke Valley, according to a release that accompanied her campaign kickoff. She has lived in the 24th District for 39 years.

Equal pay for women, a higher minimum wage and expansion of high-speed Internet to rural communities are other goals for Arthur.
