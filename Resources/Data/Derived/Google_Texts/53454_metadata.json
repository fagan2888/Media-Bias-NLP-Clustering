It deals with a rather obscure federal plan known as 340B Drug Pricing Program. Established during the Clinton administration, it requires pharmaceutical companies to make certain critical prescription drugs available at affordable prices in primarily rural, low income areas, most frequently in agriculturally focused regions of the country. This is a requirement the suppliers must meet in order to remain eligible for reimbursements through entitlement programs such as Medicaid.\n\nAs Mike explains, this bit of largesse actually represents only a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the total revenue of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nDrug companies were \u201cencouraged,\u201d as the government would no doubt phrase it, to participate in the program by winning access to other government programs in exchange. Just over 2,000 hospitals, many in rural areas, participate in the program, but the overall impact of the discounts on big PhRMA are modest. The entire program purchases only around $7 billion worth of discounted drugs a year, around 2 percent of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s revenues.\n\nAs we head into the next election cycle, the pharmaceutical companies have banded together to begin lobbying to downgrade or remove this federal requirement, no doubt hoping to charge full price for all medications even in these more remote areas with lower incomes and limited access to healthcare. They\u2019re doing it through a new group called the Alliance for Integrity and Reform 340B. (You always have to work the word \u201cintegrity\u201d in the name of such things.)\n\n\u201cThe 340B program has grown tremendously in the past ten years, and it\u2019s concerning to see projections that continue this unsustainable trajectory,\u201d said Stephanie Silverman, spokesperson for AIR 340B, a coalition of patient, clinical and manufacturing interests. \u201c Some entities use the program responsibly; however, 340B already lacks sufficient oversight for generating profits for well-funded hospitals that don\u2019t primarily serve the uninsured as the program intended. Now is the time to establish needed oversight for the program.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting in the pitch being made by this \u201ccoalition\u201d is the fact that they cite the success of Obamacare as the reason for proposing \u201cneeded oversight\u201d of the program. (The phrase needed oversight doesn\u2019t need a lot of translation to see that it means scaling back or curtailing entirely.) The pharmaceutical companies were some of the biggest pitchmen for Obamacare and have profited the most handsomely from it. And now they\u2019re claiming that since so many more people have health insurance there\u2019s clearly not as much need for a bunch of grubby farmers to get a discount on drugs when they fall ill since they can just charge the bill to their insurance anyway.\n\nI\u2019m not generally a huge fan of government entitlement programs to begin with, but this is some pretty cynical maneuvering if you ask me. We\u2019re talking about a tiny slice of the total medical reimbursements going on around the country and they\u2019re going to people who are largely left behind if and when the jobs picture improves in the industrial sector. We certainly have bigger fish to fry on the Obamacare front than this, so perhaps it\u2019s best to leave the 340B program as is for the time being.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Because you didn\u2019t get enough cash out of Obamacare already?", "title": "Pharmaceutical lobby moving to end rural drug discount program", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/10/20/pharmaceutical-lobby-moving-to-end-rural-drug-discount-program/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-20T14:01:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-20T12:53:41+00:00"}, "keywords": "drugs, farmers, health care, ObamaCare, pharmaceuticals, rural,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4cad\"", "article_summary": "(The phrase needed oversight doesn\u2019t need a lot of translation to see that it means scaling back or curtailing entirely.)\nThe pharmaceutical companies were some of the biggest pitchmen for Obamacare and have profited the most handsomely from it.\nWe certainly have bigger fish to fry on the Obamacare front than this, so perhaps it\u2019s best to leave the 340B program as is for the time being.\n\u201cThe 340B program has grown tremendously in the past ten years, and it\u2019s concerning to see projections that continue this unsustainable trajectory,\u201d said Stephanie Silverman, spokesperson for AIR 340B, a coalition of patient, clinical and manufacturing interests.\nEstablished during the Clinton administration, it requires pharmaceutical companies to make certain critical prescription drugs available at affordable prices in primarily rural, low income areas, most frequently in agriculturally focused regions of the country."}
