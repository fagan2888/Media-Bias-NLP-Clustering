Open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is ongoing and Get Covered Illinois has created a series of ads aimed at getting even the healthiest among us to register for health insurance, because you never know when you’ll need it.

Isn’t that the truth?

Clearly aimed for millennials and anyone who believes affordable health care is a socialist affront to the American Way, the ads for the “Luck Health Plan” feature several people in their seeming physical primes dealing with the fallout of their health woes without health insurance. The tag line for the ads: "You'll be okay. Probably."

Peep, peeps.

There's even a website associated with the ads listing the advantages of the Luck Health Plan including "No monthly premiums, followed by crippling death for life" and the trollish "Obamacare: we put this here for web traffic."

The Luck Health Plan website does function as an entry point into Illinois' health care marketplace where residents looking to buy health care can shop for the plans that best suit them. More than 700,000 Illinoisans registered for health insurance through Get Covered Illinois in its inaugural open enrollment period, there are even more options available in Year Two and more than 77 percent of residents qualified for financial aid to lower their premiums.

People who don't buy health insurance before Feb. 15, 2015 are subject to a $325 fine or 2 percent of their annual household income, whichever is greater.

We believed we were indestructible in our 20s and thought we didn't need health insurance back then. Thankfully we matured and saw the benefits of having it. We aren't saying you need to buy health insurance, but you don't know when you'll need it and it's nice to have it handy when you do take ill.
