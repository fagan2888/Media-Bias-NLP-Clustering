Blumberg, Institute Fellow John Holahan and Senior Research Associate Matthew Buettgens examine health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs and the total financial burdens for consumers with different characteristics who are enrolled in \u201cACA-compliant non-group coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe show that despite the additional assistance available, individuals across the income distribution who are ineligible for Medicaid can still face very high expenditures,\u201d Blumberg, Holahan and Buettgens write.\n\nInsurance coverage among nonelderly adults has increased by 15 million people, or by 42.5 percent, since coverage reforms under the Affordable Care Act took effect, (comparing September 2013 with March 2015,) according to the report.\n\nDuring the same time period, the percentage of nonelderly adults reporting problems paying their medical bills improved from 22 percent to 17.3 percent, respectively.\n\n\u201cThis decrease in financial hardship, a 21 percent decline, represents a significant improvement in affordability. But with over 17 percent of nonelderly adults continuing to report challenges paying their families\u2019 medical bills, affordability remains an issue; it is central to concerns that further marketplace enrollment gains will be increasingly difficult,\u201d according to the report.\n\nAdditional key findings in the report include:\n\nAt the median level, financial burdens can be \u201creasonably high\u201d for consumers with incomes between 300 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nTen percent of consumers enrolled in nongroup marketplace plans with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, even with federal financial assistance, will pay a minimum of 18.5 percent of their income toward health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\n\nTen percent of consumers enrolled in those health insurance plans with incomes between 200 and 500 percent of the federal poverty level will spend more than 21 percent of their income on medical costs.\n\nConsumers in fair or poor health and those older than age 45 are the most likely to have high median financial burdens.\n\n\u201cIn this paper we have shown that, for those enrolling in marketplace coverage using federal financial assistance, at both the median and 90 percentile, premium payments relative to income increase as household incomes increase and the [Affordable Care Act\u2019s] premium tax credits phase down,\u201d Blumberg, Holahan and Buettgens write. \u201cWe conclude that the affordability of marketplace premiums and out-of-pocket limits need to be further addressed to reduce the risk that enrollment and reductions in the number of uninsured will be well below the law\u2019s objectives.\u201d\n\nFollow ACA on Twitter @ACAIntl and @acacollector or Facebook for news and event updates.
