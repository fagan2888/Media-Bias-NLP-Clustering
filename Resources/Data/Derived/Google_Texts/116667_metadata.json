(Diane Bondareff/AP)\n\nHealth officials have begun to predict the end of cigarette smoking in America.\n\nThey have long wished for a cigarette-free America, but shied away from calling for smoking rates to fall to zero or near zero by any particular year. The power of tobacco companies and popularity of their products made such a goal seem like a pipe dream.\n\nBut a confluence of changes has recently prompted public health leaders to start throwing around phrases like \u201cendgame\u201d and \u201ctobacco-free generation.\u201d Now, they talk about the slowly-declining adult smoking rate dropping to 10 percent in the next decade and to 5 percent or lower by 2050.\n\nActing U.S. Surgeon General Boris Lushniak last month released a 980-page report on smoking that pushed for stepped-up tobacco-control measures. His news conference was an unusually animated showing of anti-smoking bravado, with Lushniak nearly yelling, repeatedly, \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can't accept that we're just allowing these numbers to trickle down,\u201d he said, in a recent interview with the AP. \u201cWe believe we have the public health tools to get us to the zero level.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time a federal health official has spoken so boldly. In 1984, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop called for a \u201csmoke-free society\u201d by the year 2000. However, Koop \u2013 a bold talker on many issues \u2013 didn't offer specifics on how to achieve such a goal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat's different today is that we have policies and programs that have been proven to drive down tobacco use,\u201d said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \u201cWe couldn't say that in 1984.\u201d\n\nFor example, cigarette taxes have increased around the country, making smokes more expensive. On average a pack of cigarettes that would have sold for about $1.75 20 years ago would cost more than triple that now.\n\nAdditionally, polls show that cigarette smoking is no longer considered normal behavior, and is now less popular among teens than marijuana.\n\nTobacco companies, once considered impervious to legal attack, have suffered some huge defeats in court. Perhaps the biggest was the 1998 settlement of a case brought by more than 40 states demanding compensation for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. Big Tobacco agreed to pay about $200 billion and curtail marketing of cigarettes to youths.\n\nAnd retailing of cigarettes is changing, too. CVS Caremark, the nation's second-largest pharmacy chain, announced last week it will stop selling tobacco products at its more than 7,600 drugstores.\n\n\u201cI do think, in another few years, that pharmacies selling cigarettes will look as anachronistic\u201d as old cigarette ads featuring physician endorsements look today, said CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden.\n\nThe goal is to reduce U.S. smoking-related deaths to fewer than 10,000, from the current level of 480,000. But even if smoking rates dropped to zero immediately, it would take decades to see that benefit, since smoking-triggered cancers can take decades to develop.\n\nBut while some experts and advocates are swinging for the fences, others are more pessimistic. They say the key to reaching such goals is not simply more taxes and more local smoking bans, but action by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to regulate smoking.\n\nA 2009 federal law gave the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products. The law barred FDA from outright blocking the sale of cigarettes, but the agency was free to take such pivotal steps as prohibiting the use of appealing menthol flavoring in cigarettes and requiring cigarette makers to ratchet down the amount of addictive nicotine in each smoke.\n\nBut nearly five years after gaining power over cigarettes, FDA has yet to even propose such regulations. Agency officials say they're working on it.\n\nSo could we ever see a smoking rate of zero?\n\nSome experts doubt it. As long as cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products are legal, it's likely some people will smoke them. Efforts to prohibit them are likely to fail, they say \u2014 remember Prohibition?\n\n\u201cIt's hard to do a ban on cigarettes because you're taking something away from people they have and are using. Once you have something, you hold tight,\u201d said Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor who focuses on tobacco issues.\n\nBetter, he said, to bar people from having a product in the first place. He is intrigued by legal efforts in Singapore and a handful of other countries to ban sales of tobacco to anyone born after a certain year \u2013 2000, say. That would be constitutional, he said.\n\nBut society probably wouldn't accept it, said Ruth Malone, editor-in-chief of the scientific journal Tobacco Control.\n\n\u201cIn our culture, we tend to think we have a right to things even if they're terrible for us,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2014-02-09T11:03:33-0700", "modificationDate": "2014-02-09T11:03:41-0700", "byline": "By Mike Stobbe,", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Stobbe, The Associated Press", "description": "Health officials have begun to predict the end of cigarette smoking in America.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:25098971:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site67/2014/0209/20140209__p_340d7a56-7880-463b-9250-08e8f748832a~l~soriginal~ph.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Health officials have begun to predict the end of cigarette smoking in America.", "title": "The end of cigarette smoking in America"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Health officials have begun to predict the end of cigarette smoking in America.", "title": "The end of cigarette smoking in America", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site67/2014/0209/20140209__p_340d7a56-7880-463b-9250-08e8f748832a~l~soriginal~ph.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-09T11:03:33-0700", "endDate": "2024-02-09T11:03:33-0700", "sailthru.title": "The end of cigarette smoking in America", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2014-02-09T11:04:20-0700", "news_keywords": "Loveland news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Loveland Reporter - Herald"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90b8\"", "article_summary": "(Diane Bondareff/AP)Health officials have begun to predict the end of cigarette smoking in America.\nAdditionally, polls show that cigarette smoking is no longer considered normal behavior, and is now less popular among teens than marijuana.\nCVS Caremark, the nation's second-largest pharmacy chain, announced last week it will stop selling tobacco products at its more than 7,600 drugstores.\nThey have long wished for a cigarette-free America, but shied away from calling for smoking rates to fall to zero or near zero by any particular year.\nAs long as cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products are legal, it's likely some people will smoke them."}
