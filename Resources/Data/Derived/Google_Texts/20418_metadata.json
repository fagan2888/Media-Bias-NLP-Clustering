( Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer )\n\nDefense attorneys for Dynel Lane \u2014 the woman accused of cutting Michelle Wilkins' unborn baby from her womb in March \u2014 are seeking a gag order on the Boulder District Attorney's Office, police and witnesses, including Wilkins.\n\nLane, 35, is charged with attempted murder, unlawful termination of a pregnancy and multiple counts of felony assault. Prosecutors allege she attacked Wilkins and removed an unborn baby from her womb on March 18.\n\nWilkins, 26, survived, but her baby did not.\n\nThe defense alleges that statements made by District Attorney Stan Garnett, police officials, Wilkins, her family and a public relations firm after the incident are jeopardizing Lane's right to a fair trial and due process.\n\n\"These participants are well aware of the media's thirst for any commentary by any of the trial participants,\" a defense motion said. \"These participants have repeatedly used the media to disseminate inadmissible evidence ahead of trial.\"\n\nProsecutors dispute the claim, arguing that any statements made have been within the confines of professional ethics, and police have not made any statements since Lane was formally charged in connection with the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGarnett contends that after a March press conference when charges were announced, he has made limited comments about seeking a \"just result\" and the case being \"treated like any other,\" court records show.\n\nThe DA's office has reminded local police to not make statements that \"have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused\" and sent out a letter to this effect, records show.\n\nProsecutors contend that the court has no authority to prevent Wilkins, her family or a public relations firm representing her from making statements regarding the case, and that Wilkins' statements have not been problematic.\n\nWilkins has posted online about her recovery and friendly meetings with first responders. Family members and Wilkins' public relations firm have commented about Lane in online posts, one of which called her \"deranged.\"\n\nMost statements issued by Wilkins' public relations firm have been about Wilkins or issued after court appearances, one of which thanked the DA's office for its support or acknowledged that Wilkins knew of developments in the case.\n\nWilkins has also taped an episode of the Dr. Phil show that airs on Monday, but her public relations firm said that \"no other such interviews will occur prior to trial,\" court records show.\n\nLane remains in custody at Boulder County Jail on a $2 million bond, and her case is expected to go to trial in February. She is due back in court on Nov. 3.\n\nJohn Bear: 303-684-5212, bearj@timescall.com or twitter.com/johnbearwithme", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28797539/defense-attorneys-lane-case-seek-gag-order-against", "modificationDate": "2015-09-11T18:34:54-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0911/20150911__12TCAWILw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By John Bear \n \n  Staff Writer", "description": "Defense attorneys for Dynel Lane \u2014 the woman accused of cutting Michelle Wilkins' unborn baby from her womb in March \u2014  are seeking a  gag order on the Boulder District Attorney's Office, police and witnesses, including Wilkins.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28797539:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-12T10:32:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28797539/defense-attorneys-lane-case-seek-gag-order-against", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0911/20150911__12TCAWILw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Defense attorneys for Dynel Lane \u2014 the woman accused of cutting Michelle Wilkins' unborn baby from her womb in March \u2014  are seeking a  gag order on the Boulder District Attorney's Office, police and witnesses, including Wilkins.", "title": "Defense attorneys in Lane case seek gag order against DA, police, others"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Defense attorneys for Dynel Lane \u2014 the woman accused of cutting Michelle Wilkins' unborn baby from her womb in March \u2014  are seeking a  gag order on the Boulder District Attorney's Office, police and witnesses, including Wilkins.", "title": "Defense attorneys in Lane case seek gag order against DA, police, others", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28797539/defense-attorneys-lane-case-seek-gag-order-against", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0911/20150911__12TCAWILw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-12T10:32:00-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-09-11T16:30:02-0600", "sailthru.title": "Defense attorneys in Lane case seek gag order against DA, police, others", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By John BearStaff", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0911/20150911__12TCAWILw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-09-11T18:36:09-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca94f\"", "article_summary": "Family members and Wilkins' public relations firm have commented about Lane in online posts, one of which called her \"deranged.\"\n( Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer )Defense attorneys for Dynel Lane \u2014 the woman accused of cutting Michelle Wilkins' unborn baby from her womb in March \u2014 are seeking a gag order on the Boulder District Attorney's Office, police and witnesses, including Wilkins.\nLane, 35, is charged with attempted murder, unlawful termination of a pregnancy and multiple counts of felony assault.\nProsecutors contend that the court has no authority to prevent Wilkins, her family or a public relations firm representing her from making statements regarding the case, and that Wilkins' statements have not been problematic.\n\"These participants are well aware of the media's thirst for any commentary by any of the trial participants,\" a defense motion said."}
