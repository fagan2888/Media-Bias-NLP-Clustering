The groups are primarily composed of patients or their relatives who have had either very good or very bad hospital experiences, and hospital executives rely on them for advice about a host of patient-care issues.\n\nAnd \"as we continue to evolve, the hospital looks to us more and more,\" Jane Maier, who has served on a patient advisory panel for Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital in Boston since 2009, told KHN. She also recently helped Partners HealthCare, the large Massachusetts-based system that owns Faulkner, choose a new electronic health system.\n\nWhile it may be too early to tell if such councils widely improve healthcare quality, both Michigan-based Spectrum Health and Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital improved their patient satisfaction scores through patient-suggested measures such as speeding up call-button response times and reducing nighttime noise levels, according to the article.\n\nOne strong motivator for the trend is financial, as the federal government has strengthened the link between Medicare reimbursements and value-based measures such as patient satisfaction scores.
