We live in a world where people look at compelling events and look to do something malicious. This is just the nature of the beast,\u201d said Gary Davis, vice president of global consumer marketing at McAfee, which is owned by Intel (INTC).\n\nLike natural disasters or other major events, consumers searching for information about the new health-care exchanges are likely to be willing to disclose personal information in the coming weeks.\n\nGiven the confusion over the rollout, consumers may also be more easily fooled by deceptive messages claiming to be from the government or health-care providers.\n\n\u201cIdentity is a currency like anything else. The more information you have on a consumer, the more you make,\u201d said Davis.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe threat of phishing attacks comes in addition to glitches that have mired the insurance exchanges, which went live on Tuesday.\n\nThe federally-run site for ObamaCare, or the Affordable Healthcare Act, posted error messages for at least 25 of 36 eligible states due to heavy traffic, according to Reuters.\n\nMaryland delayed the opening of its state-run health-care exchange by four hours due to connectivity problems.\n\n\u201cIdentity is a currency like anything else. The more information you have on a consumer, the more you make.\" - Gary Davis of McAfee\n\nLike many forms of cyber attacks, phishing scams have become more sophisticated in recent years, highlighted by a number of high-profile schemes that hit media companies like The Associated Press earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting very good at what they do,\u201d said Davis. \u201cIt\u2019s important that consumers take a cautionary note before they do anything. Step back and explore a way to verify this is legitimate and the source.\u201d\n\nMcAfee warned it is seeing an increasing number of phishing schemes that try to trick users on social media sites like Facebook (FB), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Twitter, which is set to go public later this year.\n\nThe security firm lists a number of specific ways users can defend against phishing attacks.",
