Negotiations have been tense since the collective bargaining unit, which is affiliated with Service Employees International Union, announced its formation in May 2014. But the contract on which the adjuncts and the university eventually settled includes unprecedented gains for part-time instructors at Northeastern, and for most adjuncts in general (and some full-time adjuncts at the university, too).\n\nThe union said the agreement assures significant, across-the-board increases in per-course pay. Almost all adjuncts will see a pay bump of 12 percent or more over the next three years; some of the lowest-paid instructors, such as those in the College of Professional Studies, will see their pay nearly double over the life of the contract, and some of highest-paid adjuncts, including those in the School of Engineering, will see a 9 percent increase. The increases are \u201cfront-loaded,\u201d in the words of the university, so adjuncts will immediately see a big jump in pay for the first year of the contract -- 10.5 percent in some cases.\n\nThe agreement also includes compensation -- 15 percent of full-course pay -- for adjunct faculty members whose courses are canceled on short notice before the beginning of a term. That\u2019s a major concern for adjuncts, who sometimes spend hours of uncompensated time preparing for course assignments, only to have them pulled at the 11th hour.\n\nInstructors will have a larger voice in decisions that impact teaching, including a formal process to deal with workplace conflicts and violations. A modest professional development fund also has been established.\n\nThe contract assures a 50 percent subsidy for health insurance for faculty members teaching 30 or more hours per week on average. A benefit of that nature would have been required to comply with the Affordable Care Act anyway, but health care benefits for adjuncts are still rare in collective bargaining agreements, and for now, adjuncts weren't getting anything.\n\nJason Stephany, a spokesman for SEIU in Boston, called the Northeastern agreement a \u201clandmark\u201d contract that makes \u201csignificant improvements to teaching and learning conditions\u201d on campus.\n\nStephany said that as with any compromise, there was room for improvement -- namely increased access to affordable health care options for all faculty members. But the contract lays a \u201cstrong foundation\u201d for future gains.\n\nJames C. Bean, Northeastern\u2019s provost, said in a statement that \u201cthis is a fair and equitable agreement\u201d offering \u201ccompetitive salary increases for part-time faculty.\u201d\n\nNoting that the contract includes a no-strike clause for the duration of the agreement, Bean said the \u201cuniversity retains the ability in all cases to guide the academic direction of its colleges, departments and programs.\u201d\n\nSEIU is working to organize adjuncts nationwide in what it calls a metro strategy, across cities and regions. Adjuncts in Washington, D.C., where SEIU launched the strategy, have benefited from it, and the Northeastern contract suggests the strategy is working in and around Boston, too. The Northeastern contract mirrors that of adjuncts at Tufts University (who also are affiliated with SEIU) in terms of large pay bumps -- although the 2014 Tufts contract included more explicit assurances of job stability and in many cases larger salaries. Negotiations are ongoing on other Boston-area campuses where SEIU has successfully organized adjuncts, including Boston University.\n\nAlso in the Northeast, SEIU-affiliated adjuncts at St. Michael\u2019s College in Vermont saw real gains under their first union contract, ratified last month. Most instructors will see 10 percent per-course pay increase this semester, with the right to negotiate additional wage increases in the fall. They also won protections on reappointment through \u201cgood faith consideration,\u201d meaning that adjuncts who have taught a specific course for at least two calendar years and a minimum of four times within four calendar years are likely to be reappointed. A $1,000 late course cancellation fee also is included.\n\nElsewhere, SEIU-affiliated adjunct union first contract wins include those at Hamline University in St. Paul. That contract, to be ratified this month, includes pay raises for all adjuncts; a majority of instructors will receive a 15 percent increase in the first year and base pay will increase by 20 percent by 2017-18. There are additional raises for longer-serving adjuncts with a terminal degree.\n\nHamline adjuncts also will seen a professional development fund established, earlier notice for course assignments and compensation for late course cancellations. They\u2019ll have the right of first refusal to teach a course they design, or be compensated for the curriculum.\n\nJohn Matachek, Hamline's provost, told the Star Tribune, \u201cI think we landed in a fair place.\u201d While the university already offered adjuncts a \u201cfairly competitive\u201d rate, he said, \u201cwe weren't particularly proud of the fact that [some adjuncts] hadn't received an increase in 10 years. It should have been higher on the radar screen than it was.\u201d\n\nOther unions have seen strong wins for adjuncts in first contracts of late. Point Park University adjuncts, affiliated with the United Steelworkers, for example, recently ratified a three-year contract that includes a 23 percent pay increase, along with increased job security and academic freedom protections. The contract also provides for grievance and arbitration procedures and -- like Northeastern\u2019s -- payment to instructors who classes are canceled at the last minute.\n\nThe momentum may even be impacting negotiations with established chapters. At Rutgers University, for example, where adjuncts are represented by a standing union affiliated with the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers, a new contracted ratified in December includes an immediate 5 percent pay bump for adjuncts with 12 semesters of teaching experience on campus. That\u2019s in addition to regular increases of about 2 percent over the other two years of the contract.\n\nLike Northeastern, adjuncts on all campuses left some of their goals on the bargaining table. The Rutgers union\u2019s goals for its next contract, for example, include salary equity with full-time teaching faculty, full tuition remission for part-time lecturers and their children, health care benefits, and defined career paths. All of those issues rank high on adjuncts\u2019 wish lists.\n\nAnd these gains aren\u2019t to suggest that adjuncts everywhere have negotiated with ease. Some of these contracts took a year or more to reach. As for negotiations that are still ongoing, SEIU-affiliated adjuncts at Burlington College in Vermont have been without a contract since their \u201cyes\u201d union vote in late 2014; their counterparts at Washington University in St. Louis have been at the table since April.\n\nStill, adjunct activists say unions have gained momentum in recent months. Teresa Politano, president of the Rutgers part-time faculty union and a lecturer in journalism, said she attributed adjuncts\u2019 contract successes to increased support from the full-time faculty and that they\u2019re \u201choping to use that alliance for future gains.\u201d\n\nMaria Maisto, president of the New Faculty Majority, a national adjunct advocacy group, said she thinks the metro strategy -- which she called \u201cvery effective\u201d -- is driving some of the growth. That\u2019s because as adjunct networks expand at the local, regional and national levels, she said, there\u2019s \u201cmore sharing of resources and advice and training on how to negotiate more effectively.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, Maisto said, it\u2019s important to make sure that many adjuncts\u2019 goal of eliminating a \u201cpredominantly contingent\u201d faculty hiring system doesn\u2019t get lost.\n\n\u201cThere is always the danger that short-term gains will obstruct the long-term goals of quality and equality that are really most in the interest of the profession of teaching and the quality of education for students,\u201d she said.\n\nRobin Sowards, an adjunct instructor of linguistics and a full-time organizer for the Steelworkers, said the two most important issues for adjunct faculty members arguably are always job security and pay. Regarding pay, he said, all these first contracts make significant improvements but none have ensured equal pay for equal work on a pro rata basis, meaning that an adjunct would get paid the same to teach a course as would any other faculty member. That\u2019s a goal of many part-time instructors who say they\u2019re drastically underpaid in comparison to their full-time colleagues.\n\nOn job security, Sowards said, all or most of these first contracts make some improvements to the general terms of contingent employment, but none establish a way out of it entirely. Obviously longer-term contracts, such as those of one to three years, \u201care better than semester-to-semester contracts, but longer-term contracts palliate the symptoms rather than curing the disease.\u201d\n\nOf course, Sowards, added, such contracts are platforms on which to build. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect that all a union\u2019s problems would be solved in its first contract, he said, but this crop of agreements \u201crepresent strong steps in the right direction.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/15/does-new-crop-first-adjunct-union-contracts-include-meaningful-gains", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Northeastern is latest university where first contract with adjunct union has included substantial salary increases and other key benefits -- such as payments for classes that colleges cancel.", "title": "Does the new crop of first adjunct union contracts include meaningful gains?"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "Northeastern is latest university where first contract with adjunct union has included substantial salary increases and other key benefits -- such as payments for classes that colleges cancel.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ab4\"", "article_summary": "Averting a strike threatened for next week, Northeastern University\u2019s adjunct union settled on a tentative first contract with the administration early Thursday.\nElsewhere, SEIU-affiliated adjunct union first contract wins include those at Hamline University in St. Paul.\nAlso in the Northeast, SEIU-affiliated adjuncts at St. Michael\u2019s College in Vermont saw real gains under their first union contract, ratified last month.\nThe agreement also includes compensation -- 15 percent of full-course pay -- for adjunct faculty members whose courses are canceled on short notice before the beginning of a term.\nRobin Sowards, an adjunct instructor of linguistics and a full-time organizer for the Steelworkers, said the two most important issues for adjunct faculty members arguably are always job security and pay."}
