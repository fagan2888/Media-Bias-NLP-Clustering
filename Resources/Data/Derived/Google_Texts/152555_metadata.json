Manuel P\u00e9rez (D-Coachella) last week said it\u2019s imperative to restore $25 million in funding for senior services cut from previous budgets, particularly from the 2011-12 budget. He wants an Assembly budget subcommittee to put that money back.\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years, state funding for senior programs within the Older Californians Act has been slashed to the bone,\u201d P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThat includes elimination or reduction of a long list of senior services, he said, including Alzheimer\u2019s Day Care Resource Centers, Senior Companion, Linkages, Respite Care, Brown Bag, Caregiver Resource Centers and the Long-term Care Ombudsman program.\n\nFully restoring funding for all of those services would come with a relatively low price tag, P\u00e9rez said \u2014 $25 million of general fund dollars would translate into $41 million, when matched with federal money, P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe issue is expected to be reviewed at next week\u2019s hearing of the Assembly Budget Subcommittee on Health and Human Services.\n\nP\u00e9rez said life has changed for seniors in California in recent years \u2014 and not for the better.\n\n\u201cCommunity-based programs \u2026 enable seniors to remain independent in their own homes, avoiding costly placement into institutional settings,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cThe drastic cuts \u2026 have done serious harm to the infrastructure of the aging services network.\u201d\n\nP\u00e9rez cited statistics from the Kaiser Family Foundation that rank California seniors as having the second-highest poverty rate in the nation. One in five California seniors live in poverty, he said, and more than half the seniors in the state live below 200% of poverty. The number of seniors is increasing in California so over the next few decades the overall number of people affected likely will climb dramatically, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe the restoration of funds to the Older Californians Act fits squarely with the core values of the [Democratic] Caucus\u2019 Blueprint for a Responsible Budget,\u201d P\u00e9rez said.\n\n\u201cEspecially now with the state\u2019s older population on the rise,\u201d he said, \u201cwe must make essential state investments to repair and revitalize this network of flexible, locally driven, person-focused services.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Funding for the Older Californians Act has been cut from previous California budgets but this year it's time to restore money to the wide-ranging program, according to one Assembly member.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Funding for the Older Californians Act has been cut from previous California budgets but this year it\u2019s time to restore money to the wide-ranging program, according to one Assembly member.", "title": "Lawmaker Pushes for Restoration of State Funds for Senior Services", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/lawmaker-pushes-for-restoration-of-state-fund-for-senior-services/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-03-17T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-17T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That includes elimination or reduction of a long list of senior services, he said, including Alzheimer\u2019s Day Care Resource Centers, Senior Companion, Linkages, Respite Care, Brown Bag, Caregiver Resource Centers and the Long-term Care Ombudsman program.\n\u201cI believe the restoration of funds to the Older Californians Act fits squarely with the core values of the [Democratic] Caucus\u2019 Blueprint for a Responsible Budget,\u201d P\u00e9rez said.\nOne in five California seniors live in poverty, he said, and more than half the seniors in the state live below 200% of poverty.\n\u201cOver the last 10 years, state funding for senior programs within the Older Californians Act has been slashed to the bone,\u201d P\u00e9rez said.\nAssembly member V.
