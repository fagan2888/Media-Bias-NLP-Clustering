Cornyn. \u201cWe must give those on the ground the tools they need to proactively address this threat, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support the commonsense, fiscally-responsible approach towards averting a potential health crisis.\u201d\n\nIn order to provide funding, $1.2 billion is being cut from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s FY 2017 and FY 2018 Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n\nThe legislation also includes a provision that would waive the Clean Water Act permit requirement. Because of this, state and local authorities will also be able to more efficiently spray to protect against mosquitos year-round.\n\nA local Frisco woman recently tested positive for Zika virus.\n\n(\u00a92016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
