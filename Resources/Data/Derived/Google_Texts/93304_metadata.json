Alan Grayson becomes the latest politico, joining Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Harry Reid, to call for Sen. Marco Rubio to resign from the U.S. Senate for missing votes in order to campaign for president.\n\nGrayson writes that Rubio receives close to $15,000 a month in pay, but instead of doing the job voters elected him to do, Rubio is \u201cplaying hooky\u201d from the Senate.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAlan Grayson has just launched his ResignRubio.com website, demanding that Rubio immediately quit the Senate.\n\nHere is what Grayson stated in one of his fundraising emails:\n\nEven before he [Marco Rubio] announced his Presidential campaign, he had the worst attendance record in the Senate.

That\u2019s just ridiculous.\n\nMost Republican voters don\u2019t seem to mind that Rubio has missed the most votes of any U.S. Senator this year. His colleague in the Senate, as well as GOP presidential opponent, Ted Cruz, has also missed a bunch of votes.\n\nWhat is more \u201cridiculous\u201d is Grayson\u2019s belief that the broken Veteran\u2019s Affairs health care system should be the standard in health care coverage for all Americans:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alan Grayson is the latest politico to call for Marco Rubio to resign from the Senate for missing votes in order to campaign for president.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Alan Grayson is the latest politico to call for Marco Rubio to resign from the Senate for missing votes in order to campaign for president.", "title": "Alan Grayson Calls for Marco Rubio's Resignation - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/alan-grayson-tallahassee-florida-AP-e1448571332841.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/05/alan-grayson-calls-marco-rubios-resignation/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Alan Grayson is the latest politico to call for Marco Rubio to resign from the Senate for missing votes in order to campaign for president.", "creator": "@THESHARKTANK1", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/alan-grayson-tallahassee-florida-AP-e1448571332841.jpg", "title": "Alan Grayson Calls for Marco Rubio's Resignation - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Alan Grayson, Florida, Harry Reid, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, obamacare, Ted Cruz, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Senate, Veterans Affairs,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,alan grayson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Veterans Affairs", "published_time": "2015-11-05T21:18:40-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Jeb Bush and Sen.
