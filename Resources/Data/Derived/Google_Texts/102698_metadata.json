Nine other counties -- Alameda, Los Angeles, Riverside, Fresno, San Francisco, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Mateo and Ventura -- already provided health care services beyond emergency care for undocumented immigrants.\n\n\n\nOn a press call last week, Health Access California\u2019s executive director, Anthony Wright, said counties participating in the expansion include those north of the Bay Area to the Oregon border, many in the Sierra Nevada mountains and in the Central Valley. Several other counties are also considering coming on board.\n\n\n\nCurrently, 11 counties in California offer only emergency care for their undocumented populations: Placer, San Joaquin, Merced, Stanislaus, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare, Kern, San Bernardino, Orange County and San Diego.\n\n\n\nThe expansion program is detailed in a new report released by Health Access California, titled, Profiles of Progress: California Counties Taking Steps to a More Inclusive and Smarter Safety Net.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just expanding care to the undocumented; it\u2019s providing a smarter safety net that offers a medical home focusing on primary preventive care,\u201d Wright said.\n\n\n\nThe 35 counties will offer limited care that goes beyond emergency care by expanding their eligibility requirements. This includes raising the income level eligibility from 200 percent to 300 percent of the federal poverty level ($60,480 for a family of three). The counties will offer enrollees earning between 138 percent and 300 percent of the federal poverty level three doctor visits per year and up to $1,500 in pharmacy coverage, regardless of immigration status.\n\n\n\n\u201cPotentially, thousands of Californians will benefit,\u201d Wright said, adding: \u201cOur rural communities and our health system are stronger if more Californians have access to primary and preventive care.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut undocumented immigrants earning below 138 percent of the federal poverty level ($20,160 for a family of three) will not be eligible for the counties\u2019 expanded programs, Wright noted.\n\n\n\nAsked why, he said, \u201cTheir answer is that their computer systems consider undocumented folks under 138 percent FPL [federal poverty level] as covered under emergency Medi-Cal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cwe all know that doesn\u2019t provide primary/preventive care and isn\u2019t really coverage.\n\n\n\nThe counties plan to evaluate their current expansion, he said, after which they will consider whether to extend the primary care benefit to those making below 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\n\n\nThe report cites the success of six counties that adjusted their safety net programs through pilot programs in recent years.\n\n\n\nContra Costa County Supervisor John Gioia said Contra Costa Cares, the one-year pilot program his county launched last December, has provided 3,000 residents access to health care. He said the program would be evaluated at the end of the year before funding is reauthorized.\n\n\n\nCarmen, a patient at Gardner Family Health Network in San Jose, said she has finally been able to get comprehensive treatment for the diabetes she was diagnosed with a few years ago, thanks to her county\u2019s safety net program, Santa Clara Primary Care Access Program (PCAP).\n\n\n\n\u201cIt brings peace of mind to know that I will no longer have to seek care in emergency rooms,\u201d Carmen said in Spanish through an interpreter.\n\n\n\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) cut California\u2019s uninsured population by half, but it left its nearly 3 million undocumented residents uninsured. But the momentum generated by the ACA seems to have influenced counties to establish or improve their own safety net programs to cover those left out of the federal program.\n\n\n\nIt also motivated California lawmakers to introduce bills to cover the state\u2019s \u201cremaining uninsured.\u201d\n\n\n\nSen. Ricardo Lara\u2019s (D-Bell Gardens) Health For All Kids program, launched May 16, will allow about 185,000 of undocumented children under 19 from low-income families to enroll in full-scope Medi-Cal, California\u2019s name for Medicaid. Other bills are currently being considered to provide coverage for the state\u2019s undocumented adults.\n\n\n\nWright noted that good as the county programs are, they will only cover residents as long as they are in the county where they are enrolled. And not all counties have come on board to provide safety nets for their undocumented residents.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s access to health care should not have to depend on what counties they live in,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "undocumented, california counties, safety net expanded, health care, adults and children", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
