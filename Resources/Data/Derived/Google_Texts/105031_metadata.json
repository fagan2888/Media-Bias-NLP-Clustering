(Photo: H. Darr Beiser/USA TODAY)\n\nStories like Jake David\u2019s are maddening.\n\nThe Vietnam War veteran from De Pere is waiting on hip replacement surgery. Press-Gazette reporter Paul Srubas detailed David\u2019s ordeal to get care while being left to hobble around on crutches and try to manage the pain.\n\nIs this how we should be treating our veterans?\n\nThe answer is no.\n\nThe story becomes even more maddening when you realize the problem was self-inflicted.\n\nThe Veterans Choice Program was set up so veterans could get their health care needs met in their communities instead of traveling to faraway facilities or waiting more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA clinic/hospital.\n\nIt seems like a logical solution. Get veterans the care they need where they live and in a timely matter.\n\nHowever, the VA farmed out that work and added another layer of bureaucracy to an overly bureaucratic process to begin with.\n\nInstead of the VA negotiating with local or regional health care providers and approving referrals, a third party was hired to handle the work.\n\n\u201cThe VA has injected a middle man that doesn\u2019t have all the data to get things done quickly,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Sherwood.\n\nRibble said on Friday it was never the intent of Congress for this task to be handled by an outside provider.\n\nThe usual way Congress deals with these kinds of issues is through the \u201cpower of the purse,\u201d Ribble said. In other words, lawmakers threaten to cut funding if fixes aren\u2019t made.\n\nIn this situation, however, you can\u2019t cut funding for veterans health care. In fact, Congress should probably look to add funding as our Vietnam veterans age and require more assistance with their health.\n\nWhat Congress should do is bring the VA around to its way of thinking.\n\nRibble said letters have been sent to the VA and there\u2019s legislation in the House and Senate that will clarify statutorily how Congress would like to see the Choice program run.\n\nWe believe that the sooner Congress does this, the better.\n\nOr, even better, the VA could just comply with what was intended instead of wasting more time.\n\nThe Veterans Choice Program was created in November 2014, the same year the public learned about the long wait times many veterans endured when seeking care.\n\nAt the time we urged Congress to find solutions and to refrain from finger-pointing at the other party and playing politics with veterans\u2019 health care.\n\nYet here we are two years later and we\u2019re still running into problems. A story on Friday showed that Congress can\u2019t even agree on whether to confirm the VA\u2019s inspector general position, which hasn\u2019t been filled since December 2013.\n\nIt won\u2019t happen overnight, but that shouldn\u2019t be an excuse to drag it out. We need to uphold the promises we made to our veterans and address this issue with the speed and importance it deserves.\n\nThe Green Bay Press-Gazette is part of the USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1NfCIC1", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "VA needs to drop third party provider in its Veterans Choice Program", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "VA needs to drop third party provider in its Veterans Choice Program", "title": "Cut out the VA middleman", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/04/16/cut-out-va-middleman/83096626/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "VA needs to drop third party provider in its Veterans Choice Program", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ff13f0e9f01a70f04ce04e3ffb806899aaf35cec/c=168-0-855-687&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/15/WIGroup/GreenBay/635963363988303938-dva.jpg", "title": "Cut out the VA middleman", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "va, veterans affairs, healthcare, navy, marines, army, air force,"}, "article_summary": "In this situation, however, you can\u2019t cut funding for veterans health care.\nInstead of the VA negotiating with local or regional health care providers and approving referrals, a third party was hired to handle the work.\nThe usual way Congress deals with these kinds of issues is through the \u201cpower of the purse,\u201d Ribble said.\nThe Veterans Choice Program was created in November 2014, the same year the public learned about the long wait times many veterans endured when seeking care.\nAt the time we urged Congress to find solutions and to refrain from finger-pointing at the other party and playing politics with veterans\u2019 health care."}
