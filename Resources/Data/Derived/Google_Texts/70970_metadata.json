This is because onlookers knew the ship was doomed long ago, and swimming rats signify that the drawn-out tragedy is nearing an end. A collective sense of relief is a natural response.\n\nThe rats who propped up the broken boat of Obamacare are a collection of liberal and labor groups who frittered away their group\u2019s resources\u2014and integrity\u2014 to sell a crappy product to the American people.\n\nThose in the deepest denial went \u201call in\u201d for Obamacare\u2014 such as some unions and groups like Moveon.org\u2014 while the more conniving groups and individuals\u2014like Michael Moore\u2014 playacted \u201ccritical\u201d of Obamacare, while nevertheless declaring it \u201cprogressive\u201d, in effect adding crucial political support to a project that deserved none.\n\nBut of course Obamacare was always more barrier than progress: we\u2019ve wasted the last several years planning, debating, and reconstructing the national health care system, all the while going in the wrong direction\u2014 into the pockets of the insurance mega corporations. A couple progressive patches on the sails won\u2019t keep her afloat. It\u2019s shipbuilding time.\n\nIt was painful to watch otherwise intelligent people lend support to something that\u2019s such an obviously bad idea. So it\u2019s with immense relief that liberals like Michael Moore, labor groups, and others are finally distancing themselves from Obamacare\u2019s Titanic failure. Now these individuals and groups can stop living in denial and the rest of us can proceed towards a rational discussion about a real health care solution.\n\nThe inevitable failure of Obamacare is not due to a bad website, but deeper issues. The hammering of the nails in the coffin has begun: millions of young people are suddenly realizing that Obamacare does not offer affordable health care. It\u2019s a lie, and they aren\u2019t buying it, literally.\n\nThe system depends on sufficient young people to opt in and purchase plans, in order to offset the costs of the older, higher-needs population. Poor young people with zero disposable income are being asked to pay monthly premiums of $150 and more, and they\u2019re opting out, inevitably sinking Obamacare in the process.\n\nThose young people who actually do buy Obamacare plans\u2014to avoid the \u201cmandate\u201d fine\u2014 will be further enraged when they attempt to actually use their \u201cinsurance\u201d. Many of the cheapest plans\u2014the obvious choice for most young people\u2014 have $5,000 deductibles before the insurance will pay for anything. For poor young people this is no insurance at all, but a form of extortion.\n\nAt the same time millions of union members are being punished under Obamacare: those with decent insurance plans will suffer the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax, which will push up the cost of their healthcare plans, and employers are already demanding concessions from union members in the form of higher health care premiums, co-pays, deductibles, etc.\n\nLower paid union workers will suffer as well. Those who are part of the Taft Hartley insurance plans will be pressured to leave the plans and buy their own insurance, since they cannot keep their plans and get the subsidy that the lowest income workers get. This has the potential to bust the whole Taft Hartley health care system that millions of union members benefit from, which is one of the reasons that labor leaders suddenly became outraged at Obamacare, after having wasted millions of union member\u2019s dollars propping it up.\n\nUltimately, the American working class will collectively cheer Obamacare\u2019s demise. They just need labor and other lefties to cheer lead its destruction a little more fiercely.\n\nSurprisingly, most of the rats are still clinging to Obama\u2019s hopeless vessel, frantically bailing water. Sure they\u2019ve put on their life preservers and anxiously eyeing the lifeboats, but they\u2019re also preaching about how to re-align the deckchairs.\n\nFor example, in his \u201ccritical\u201d New York Times op-ed piece, Michael Moore called Obamacare \u201cawful\u201d, but also called it a \u201cgodsend\u201d, singing his same tired tune. Part of Moore\u2019s solution for Obamacare\u2014which was cheered on in the Daily Kos\u2014 is equally ludicrous, and follows his consistently flawed logic that Obamacare is worth saving, since its \u201cprogress\u201d that we can build on. Moore writes:\n\n\u201cThose who live in red [Republican dominated] states need the benefit of Medicaid expansion [a provision of Obamacare]\u2026. In blue [Democrat dominated] states, let\u2019s lobby for a public option on the insurance exchange \u2014 a health plan run by the state government, rather than a private insurer.\u201d\n\nThis is Moore at his absolute worst. He\u2019s neck deep in the flooded hull of the U.S.S Obamacare and giving us advice on how to tread water.\n\nOf course Moore doesn\u2019t criticize the heart of Obamacare, the individual mandate, the most hated component.\n\nMoore also relies on the trump card argument of the pro-Obamacare liberals: there are progressive aspects to the scheme\u2014such as the expansion of Medicaid\u2014 and therefore the whole system is worth saving.\n\nOf course it\u2019s untrue that we need Obamacare to expand Medicaid. In fact, the expansion of Medicaid acted more as a Trojan horse to introduce the pro-corporate heart of the system; a horse that Moore and other liberals nauseatingly continue to ride on.\n\nBut Moore\u2019s sneakiest argument is his advice to blue states to \u201c\u2026lobby for a public option on the insurance exchange\u2026\u201d\n\nAgain, Moore implies that it\u2019s ok if we are \u201cmandated\u201d to buy health insurance, so long is there is a public option. But that aside, the deeper scheme here is that Moore wants us to further waste our energy \u201creforming\u201d Obamacare, rather than driving it to the bottom of the sea.\n\nMoore surely knows that very few people are going to march in the streets demanding a public option at this point; he therefore knows that even this tiny reform of the system is unachievable. He\u2019s wasting our time. Real change only happens in politics when there is a surge of energy among large sections of the population, and it\u2019s extremely unlikely that more than a handful of people are going to be active towards \u201cfixing\u201d Obamacare\u2014 they want to drown it.\n\nMoore\u2019s attempt to funnel people\u2019s outrage at Obamacare towards a \u201cpublic option\u201d falls laughably short, and this is likely his intention, since his ongoing piecemeal \u201ccriticisms\u201d of the system have only served to salvage a sunken ship.\n\nInstead of wasting energy trying to pry Obamacare out of the grip of the corporations, Moore would be better served to focus exclusive energy towards expanding the movement for Medicare For All, which he claims that he also supports, while maintaining that somehow Obamacare will evolve into Single Payer system.\n\nMost developed nations have achieved universal health care through a single payer system, which in the United States can be easily achieved by expanding Medicare to everybody. Once the realities of Obamacare directly affect the majority of the population and exacerbates the crisis of U.S. healthcare, people will inevitably choose to support the movement of Medicare for All, the only real option for a sane health care system.\n\nShamus Cooke is a social service worker, trade unionist, and writer for Workers Action (www.workerscompass.org).
