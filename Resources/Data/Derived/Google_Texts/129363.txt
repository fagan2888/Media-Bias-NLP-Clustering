A bill that would require the secretaries of State and Defense to develop a strategy to counter terrorist group Boko Haram would cost less than $500,000 over the next five years, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said Wednesday.

The legislation, introduced by Sen.(R-Maine) in June, would require the heads of the State Department and Pentagon to create a five-year strategy to help countries in Africa, including Nigeria, respond to the threat of Boko Haram.

The Islamic extremist group gained attention after kidnapping nearly 300 schoolgirls in 2014.

Under the measure, the director of National Intelligence would also be required to provide a review to Congress about the willingness of foreign governments to implement the strategy.

The CBO said based on similar activities, the legislation would cost less than $500,000 between 2016 and 2020.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee advanced the bill in late July.
