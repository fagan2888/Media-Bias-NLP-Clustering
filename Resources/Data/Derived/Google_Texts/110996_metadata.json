Ripp, an ear, nose and throat specialist in Rockwall and McKinney. He said patients without coverage often delay medical care until their symptoms become serious and cause \u201cstaggering financial problems and no chance of ever paying for them.\u201d\n\nBrianna Brown, co-director of the Texas Organizing Project\u2019s Dallas office, estimated 9,000 Texans are dying annually in the Medicaid gap. Asked how such a death toll was determined, she said it was the result of \u201cour group\u2019s research.\u201d\n\nThe demonstration featured 25 homemade tombstones, meant to represent a daily \u201cdeath rate\u201d for Texans in the gap.\n\nDeShawn Bunton, a Dallas woman who said she fell within the Medicaid gap, asked the crowd whether taxpayers were paying to insure Gov. Greg Abbott along with Texas legislators.\n\nAssured those leaders received coverage, she told the crowd, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why, if we pay for theirs, why they can\u2019t help us pay for ours.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "About 50 demonstrated at Ferris Plaza during the event held by the Texas Organizing Project, a statewide group that supports health care reform.", "og": {"description": "About 50 demonstrated at Ferris Plaza during the event held by the Texas Organizing Project, a statewide group that supports health care reform.", "title": "Downtown Dallas rally presses for Texas Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150601-downtown-dallas-rally-presses-for-texas-medicaid-expansion.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150601-topprotest_2_rab.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/TOPprotest_2_rab.jpg", "height": 895}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-06-02T03:39:24Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-06-02T03:25:23Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Downtown Dallas rally presses for Texas Medicaid expansion\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150601-downtown-dallas-rally-presses-for-texas-medicaid-expansion.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150601-topprotest_2_rab.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/TOPprotest_2_rab.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2318371\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-06-02T03:25:23Z\", \"section\": \"Metro\", \"author\": \"SHERRY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150601-topprotest_2_rab.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/TOPprotest_2_rab.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-06-02T03:25:23Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f1b\"", "article_summary": "DeShawn Bunton, a Dallas woman who said she fell within the Medicaid gap, asked the crowd whether taxpayers were paying to insure Gov.\nAs Texas legislators concluded their 2015 session in Austin, protesters gathered Monday in downtown Dallas to call for a special session that would consider a statewide Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cGovernor Abbott and the Texas Legislature, I\u2019m calling for an expansion of Medicaid so we can cover Texas citizens,\u201d called out Barbara LaToison, pastor of St. Mark AME Zion Church in Dallas.\nMore than a million Texans are falling into the Medicaid gap, LaToison told the group.\n\u201cTwo-thirds are living in households with a working individual, and they cannot afford insurance.\u201dTexas political leaders have declined to expand Medicaid coverage, saying it would cost the state too much money."}
