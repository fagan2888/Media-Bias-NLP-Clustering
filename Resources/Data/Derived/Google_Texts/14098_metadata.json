Taxpayers should never have to bail out health insurance companies that lose money under ObamaCare, and now we need to take that option off the table for good by passing my legislation to repeal the risk corridor provision in ObamaCare once and for all.\n\n\n\n\u0093The risk corridor provision was passed within ObamCare under the broken promises of lower health insurance premiums and Americans being able to keep their health insurance plans. ObamaCare is a massively flawed law with a real impact that has destroyed health insurance in America, and it needs to be repealed and replaced.\u0094\n\n\n\nRubio\u0092s ObamaCare Taxpayer Bailout Prevention Act is endorsed by the following policy advocacy groups: American Conservative Union, Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Tax Reform, Campaign for Liberty, Center for Freedom and Prosperity, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, Club for Growth, Freedom Works, Heritage Action, HSA Coalition, National Taxpayers Union, Tea Party Express and the 2017 Project.\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND: HOW RUBIO SAVED TAXPAYERS OVER $2.5 BILLION IN OBAMACARE BAILOUT FUNDS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES\n\n\n\nUnder ObamaCare, health insurance companies that lose money can seek taxpayer funds to cover their losses.\n\nPalm Beach Post: \u0093If an insurance company\u0092s medical claims exceed anticipated costs, a federal \u0091risk-corridor\u0092 program reimburses a share of those costs. It\u0092s a lesser-known piece of Obamacare intended to cushion risks for insurers between now and 2016 as companies adapt to sweeping healthcare changes.\u0094 (\u0093Florida Blue chief: GOP attacks on insurance \u0091bailout\u0092 unfair,\u0094 Palm Beach Post, 8/14/2014)\n\nLast night, the Obama Administration announced it will disburse just $362 million to health insurance companies to help cover losses under ObamaCare \u0096 well short of the $2.9 billion requested by health insurance companies that incurred a loss by participating in Obamacare\n\nPolitico Pro: \u0093Insurers will be paid $362 million from Obamacare\u0092s risk corridors program for 2014 - or just 12.6 percent of the $2.9 billion in payments they requested. HHS officials, who announced the figures Thursday evening, maintained that insurers will eventually receive the requested payments during the next two years of the temporary program.\u0094 (Risk corridor payments far below insurers\u0092 requests,\u0094 Politico Pro, 10/1/2015)\n\nHealth insurance companies immediately criticized the shortfall in bailout funding.\n\nPolitico Pro: \u0093Insurers are criticizing today\u0092s announcement by the Obama administration that they\u0092ll receive just $362 million out of $2.9 billion in requested risk corridors payments for 2014 The health law requires that insurers will eventually receive their requested payments. But it\u0092s unclear where the funds will come from to fully pay for it. A budget deal reached last year requires the program to be budget neutral. The risk corridor program was designed to protect insurers entering the Obamacare exchanges.\u0094 (\u0093Insurers criticize HHS decision to pay out a fraction of requested risk corridor payments\u0094, Politico Pro, 10/1/2015)\n\nThe Obama Administration was unable to pay the remaining $2.5 billion because of a provision which U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) fought to include in the December 2014 omnibus spending bill passed by Congress, which forced the risk corridor program to be revenue neutral \u0096 in other words, not funded by taxpayers.\n\nRubio: \u0093For over a year, I\u0092ve fought to protect Americans from having to fund massive bailouts to protect the profits of the insurance companies that helped write Obamacare. While there is much in this massive spending measure that is simply bad for America, at least the provisions protecting against a taxpayer-funded bailout of insurance companies are a step in the right direction. While the Obama administration can still administer the risk-corridor program, for one year at least, they won\u0092t be able to use taxpayer funds to bail out insurance companies. When Congress returns next year, I will fight to permanently repeal the risk corridor provisions to protect taxpayers after the current legislation expires.\u0094 (\u0093Rubio Comments On Obamacare Bailout Provisions,\u0094 Press Release, 12/10/2014)\n\nIn October 2014, Rubio had directly urged House Speaker John Boehner to use the budget process to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout of health insurance companies under ObamaCare.\n\nRubio: \u0093As you know, the current CR will expire on December 11, 2014 Though Congress will determine the expiration date of the next CR later this year, it is likely the next CR will extend to a date in 2015 when risk corridor payments are reconciled The President intends to ignore Congress\u0092s explicit and exclusive authority by spending money on the risk corridor program without an appropriation from Congress. The American people expect us, as Members of Congress, to fulfill our Oath of Office and defend the Constitution. Therefore, we must act to protect Congress\u0092 power of the purse and prohibit the Obama administration from dispersing unlawful risk corridor payments providing for an Obamacare taxpayer bailout.\u0094 (\u0093Rubio, Colleagues To Boehner: We Must Protect Congressional Authority, Prohibit Obamacare Bailout,\u0094 Press Release, 10/8/2014)\n\nRubio was the first to identify the likelihood of a taxpayer-funded bailout of health insurance companies under ObamaCare in November 2013, when he introduced legislation to repeal it. (\u0093Rubio Introduces Bill Preventing Taxpayer-Funded Bailouts Of Insurance Companies Under ObamaCare,\u0094 Press Release, 11/19/2014)\n\nHe later introduced additional legislation in April 2014 specifying that ObamaCare\u0092s risk corridor program must remain budget neutral, thus preventing taxpayer dollars from being used to bail out health insurance companies. (\u0093Rubio Introduces Legislation To Hold Administration Accountable, Protect Taxpayers From ObamaCare Bailout,\u0094 Press Release, 4/1/2014)\n\nIn February 2014, Rubio testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about the danger of taxpayers having to bail out health insurance companies under ObamaCare.\n\nVideo & Transcript.\n\nIn the current Congress, Rubio\u0092s first bill introduced would eliminate taxpayer-funded bailouts of ObamaCare for good.
