To receive an exemption, schools must show evidence of \u201chardship, including financial hardship\u201d in obtaining 50 percent whole grain foods that are \u201cacceptable to students.\u201d The bill also would keep sodium restrictions at current levels until \u201cthe latest scientific research establishes the reduction is beneficial for children.\u201d The language referring to the exemptions begins on page 99 of the lengthy spending bill.\n\nBecause the proposed bill allows, but does not require, states to grant exemptions, the bill \u201cleaves the power to the state agency to define what is a hardship,\u201d said Tracey Patterson, nutrition policy advocate for California Food Policy Advocates, an Oakland-based nonprofit organization. The California Department of Education, which administers the National School Lunch Program, has been \u201cvery supportive\u201d of improving school nutrition and is unlikely to easily grant exemptions, Patterson said.\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, many of our schools have found successful ways to implement whole grain rich pasta requirements,\u201d said Kim Frinzell, nutrition education administrator in the California Department of Education.\n\nCalifornia has a long history of support for school nutrition and often has imposed nutritional guidelines ahead of the federal government, including the state\u2019s 2009 ban on school lunch foods that contain trans fats, which have been linked to heart disease, and state regulations limiting sugary beverages and salty snacks sold in vending machines at schools.\n\nState Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson stated his support for the standards in a letter in May. \u201cIt is imperative to keep improving the nutrition standards so that we can continue to make a difference [to] our children\u2019s health,\u201d Torlakson wrote.\n\nAlready, 95 percent of school lunch programs in the state are meeting the whole grain rich standards and have been certified as in compliance with the menu standards. The National School Lunch Program provides free or reduced-price meals to students from low-income families; the meals are also available to students from higher-income families at full cost.\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, many of our schools have found successful ways to implement whole grain rich pasta requirements,\u201d said Kim Frinzell, nutrition education administrator in the Nutrition Services Division of the California Department of Education.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the phased-in standards in 2012, the department has provided technical assistance to districts struggling to provide cost-effective menus, including face-to-face workshops, webinars and culinary training.\n\nBut the department wouldn\u2019t speculate about whether it would grant exemptions to schools to opt out of using whole grain rich breads and pastas if the bill passed. \u201cWe will wait until the USDA gives us guidance\u201d on implementing the exemptions, said Julie Boarer-Pitchford, nutrition education consultant of the Nutrition Services Division of the California Department of Education.\n\n\u201cMy hope would be those [training] options would get thoroughly explored before the exemption option,\u201d said Gail Woodward-Lopez, associate director of the Atkins Center for Weight and Health at UC Berkeley. \u201cCalifornia is generally very supportive and we have a lot of innovative food service directors.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time that whole grain rich foods have been a source of conflict in the new lunch standards. In May, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it had received complaints that whole grain rich pasta wasn\u2019t holding together well during cooking, and issued a \u201cflexibility\u201d memorandum allowing states to grant schools a two-year reprieve on serving whole grain rich pasta, while schools and manufacturers figure out acceptable pasta products.\n\nCalifornia is still formulating its process under which schools could apply for a reprieve, said Frinzell at the California Department of Education. But the whole wheat rich pasta rule went into effect July 1 and \u201csince July 1, schools this school year are already implementing this requirement,\u201d she said.\n\nThe School Nutrition Association, a Maryland-based national organization of school nutrition professionals, has pressed for rollbacks on the standards, citing a federal Government Accountability Office report that found national participation in the school lunch program had dropped by 1.2 million students from 2010 to 2013. The decrease was primarily caused by a decline of 1.6 million students eating school lunch who pay full price, the report said, noting that the number of students eating school meals at free or reduced cost increased. The nutrition association said that the drop in student participation had made it difficult for some districts to meet the costs of providing more fruits, vegetables and palatable menu options using whole grain rich breads and pastas.\n\n\u201cThe escalating costs of meeting overly prescriptive regulations are putting school meal programs in financial jeopardy,\u201d said Patricia Montague, chief executive officer of the association, in a statement.\n\nBut food policy advocates say that the drop in school lunch consumption is tied in part to a recent increase in the cost of the lunches for the students who pay full price. The U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2013 required schools to achieve \u201cpaid lunch equity\u201d to ensure that districts weren\u2019t using federal funds to subsidize the full-rate meals. As a result, full-pay lunch prices increased and, in some cases, doubled.\n\nIn California, there have also been concerns about school districts\u2019 financial management of federal and state school lunch funds. Recent state reports found that some districts have diverted lunch funds for other purposes or kept excessive cash reserves. The California Department of Education has ordered 68 districts to spend millions of dollars in federal and state school lunch funds that they have failed for years to use for student meals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The healthier student lunches are unpopular in some parts of the country, but not California.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Despite New Federal Rules, California Likely to Stay with Healthy School Lunches\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/12\\/16\\/despite-new-federal-rules-california-likely-to-stay-with-healthy-school-lunches\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-12-16 08:57:00\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-12-16 23:38:55\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":22977,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"School Lunch\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/12\\/Students-salad-and-fruit-bar-school-lunch-e1418748611443.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The healthier student lunches are unpopular in some parts of the country, but not California.", "title": "Despite New Federal Rules, California Likely to Stay with Healthy School Lunches", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/12/16/despite-new-federal-rules-california-likely-to-stay-with-healthy-school-lunches/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/12/Students-salad-and-fruit-bar-school-lunch-640x482.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "school lunch", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In California, there have also been concerns about school districts\u2019 financial management of federal and state school lunch funds.\nThe California Department of Education, which administers the National School Lunch Program, has been \u201cvery supportive\u201d of improving school nutrition and is unlikely to easily grant exemptions, Patterson said.\nBy Jane Meredith Adams, EdSourceCalifornia\u2019s enthusiasm for healthy school lunches appears unlikely to change under a Congressional budget bill headed to President Barack Obama for signature that would allow states to weaken new federal school nutrition requirements.\nCalifornia is still formulating its process under which schools could apply for a reprieve, said Frinzell at the California Department of Education.\nThe California Department of Education has ordered 68 districts to spend millions of dollars in federal and state school lunch funds that they have failed for years to use for student meals."}
