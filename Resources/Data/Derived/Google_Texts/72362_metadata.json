If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Gov. John Hickenlooper \u2014 who championed the rules and won the support of environmentalists and energy producers alike \u2014 should be blushing.\n\nIn recent weeks, Pennsylvania (the nation\u2019s second-largest gas producer) and California (the third-largest oil producer) have both launched similar efforts to regulate oil and gas methane emissions. The Federal Bureau of Land Management is also moving forward with a methane rule that would tamp down on emissions from operations on federal and tribal lands.\n\nIn each of these cases, the officials are taking a key page from the Colorado book, requiring companies to find and fix methane leaks at the thousands of oil and gas wells and other equipment that are already up and running, not just facilities that will be deployed in the future. Unfortunately, the importance of addressing existing sources of pollution instead of just future sources hasn\u2019t taken hold with one of the most important players on the issue.\n\nLast August, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a draft proposal to target methane emissions from newly developed oil and gas facilities. But because the EPA leaves out existing polluters, it misses the mark on the greenhouse gas reductions the nation is striving to achieve.\n\nIn short, the EPA can learn a lot both from the BLM and leading states such as Colorado, Wyoming, California and Pennsylvania. Like Colorado, the regulators in these leading states and the BLM understand that regulating existing sources is a proven, cost-effective way to address climate change, improve air quality, reduce waste and increase operational efficiency without undermining the economic benefits oil and gas production generates for communities.\n\nThese measures enjoy strong support from the public. As the BLM moves to finalize its proposal to reduce methane leaks, excessive venting and flaring practices from new and existing drilling operations on federal and tribal lands, polling demonstrates that more than 80 percent of Westerners support these efforts.\n\nDue to the narrow focus of the BLM proposal and the existing source loophole of the EPA proposal, the administration is at risk of falling short of its goal of reducing 40 to 45 percent of oil and gas methane emissions over the next decade. In fact, with current efforts, we\u2019re unlikely to get more than 14 percent reductions across the country because the facilities and equipment that currently put more than 7 million metric tons of methane pollution in the air every year would be virtually untouched.\n\nThe job of controlling emissions can\u2019t be left to the states alone. There are more than 10,000 oil and gas companies operating in over 30 states, most of which don\u2019t have strong rules and have no intention of adopting any. Consider Texas, the leading producer of oil and gas \u2014 and, not coincidentally, the leading supplier of methane emissions, contributing to about a third of our nation\u2019s total. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has said that it has no plans to take on methane and even continues to question the science of climate change.\n\nBetween Colorado, California, Wyoming and the BLM, the American West has emerged as a champion of cleaning up the oil and gas industry. These agencies have proven that clean air and responsible energy development can co-exist. Regulating existing sources of methane pollution is a concrete way to deliver on both.\n\nIn the quest to combat climate change, we need every level of government to do its level best to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. We can\u2019t afford to have the EPA sitting on the sidelines while leading states and the BLM wage the existing source battle.\n\nDan Grossman is the national director of state programs for the Environmental Defense Fund\u2019s oil and gas work.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Controlling methane emissions", "title": "Controlling methane emissions", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/19/controlling-methane-emissions/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160219__DP_NGPS_Export20160221_Z00_OP21G_GROSSMANp1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160219__DP_NGPS_Export20160221_Z00_OP21G_GROSSMANp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-19T10:58:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:21:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In recent weeks, Pennsylvania (the nation\u2019s second-largest gas producer) and California (the third-largest oil producer) have both launched similar efforts to regulate oil and gas methane emissions.\nFebruary marks the two-year anniversary of the adoption of Colorado\u2019s groundbreaking rules aimed at reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry.\nLast August, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a draft proposal to target methane emissions from newly developed oil and gas facilities.\nConsider Texas, the leading producer of oil and gas \u2014 and, not coincidentally, the leading supplier of methane emissions, contributing to about a third of our nation\u2019s total.\nRegulating existing sources of methane pollution is a concrete way to deliver on both."}
