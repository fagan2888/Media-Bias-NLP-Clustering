Best Buy warned that keeping pace with promotional competition from rivals would cause margins to fall during the crucial holiday shopping season.\n\nBest Buy may have figured out a strategy to compete more effectively with the likes of Amazon.com, but the holiday forecast was a reminder that Wal-Mart and other rivals can also put a squeeze on Joly\u2019s plans. Wal-Mart said Tuesday it would match Black Friday prices from Target (NYSE: TGT), Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us and Best Buy on popular toys and electronics starting Friday. Shares of Best Buy fell more than 8 percent Tuesday after the company\u2019s fourth-quarter warning.\n\n\u201cYou can only cut costs for so long,\u201d said Brian Yarborough, an analyst with Edward Jones, who has a neutral rating on the stock, in an interview.\u201d We are concerned that they can\u2019t get consistent sales growth.\u201d\n\nJoly is credited by Yarborough and other analysts for bringing stability to a company that had been making headlines for all the wrong reasons. For instance, former CEO Brian Dunn was fired last year for having an affair with a female subordinate. Founder Richard Schulze was ousted from the board for failing to notify his fellow members about Dunn\u2019s relationship.\n\nSchulze later tried to buy the company but abandoned the idea and returned to Best Buy this year as chairman emeritus. Schulze has also expressed support for Joly, who has gotten kudos for revamping Best Buy\u2019s outdated website, among other things.\n\nJoly\u2019s focus on the bottom line has paid off, at least through the first three quarters of the year. During the most recent quarter, Best Buy earned net income of $54 million, or 16 cents a share, reversing a year-ago loss of $10 million, or 3 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, profit was 18 cents, beating Wall Street expectations of 12 cents. Revenue fell 0.2 percent to $9.36 billion, a hair under the level analysts had expected.\n\nDavid Strasser, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, says the latest quarterly results shouldn\u2019t cast doubt on Joly\u2019s turnaround.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they are facing the threat head on is a bonus and a positive,\u201d writes Strasser in an email.\n\nLike other retailers, Best Buy also faces a challenging economic environment that may cause consumers to be cautious in their spending.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a competitive environment and it\u2019s going to continue to be a competitive environment,\u201d Yarborough said.\n\nHeading into the holiday season, economists and executives at some retailers such as Wal-Mart have noted that consumers are keeping a tight grip on their wallets. The University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index is at its lowest level since 2011. Even more troubling for retailers is a recent National Retail Federation (NRF) survey, which found that 80 percent of shoppers plan to spend less for the holidays.\n\nUnfortunately for retailers, some view the NRF survey as being overly optimistic. Morgan Stanley recently argued that the holiday season will the worst since 2008.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Best Buy (NYSE: BBY), widely thought to be circling the drain last year, has been a surprising Wall Street success story in 2013\u2026until today.", "title": "Best Buy Turnaround Gets a Wal-Mart Reality Check", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/19/Best-Buy-Turnaround-Gets-Wal-Mart-Reality-Check", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11192013_Best_Buy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/19/Best-Buy-Turnaround-Gets-Wal-Mart-Reality-Check", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11192013_Best_Buy.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Best Buy (NYSE: BBY), widely thought to be circling the drain last year, has been a surprising Wall Street success story in 2013\u2026until today.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Schulze later tried to buy the company but abandoned the idea and returned to Best Buy this year as chairman emeritus.\nBest Buy (NYSE: BBY), widely thought to be circling the drain last year, has been a surprising Wall Street success story in 2013\u2026until today.\nShares of Best Buy fell more than 8 percent Tuesday after the company\u2019s fourth-quarter warning.\nLike other retailers, Best Buy also faces a challenging economic environment that may cause consumers to be cautious in their spending.\nWal-Mart said Tuesday it would match Black Friday prices from Target (NYSE: TGT), Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us and Best Buy on popular toys and electronics starting Friday."}
