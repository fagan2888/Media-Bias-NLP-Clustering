Their darlings Fidel Castro and Che Guevara\u2019s terror group The July 26 Movement beat ISIS to the game by 54 years. And far from expressing any \u201coutrage\u201d over those murders, the U.S. media of the time seemed delighted to act as a public relations adjunct to Castro\u2019s terror-group. (Same as today, come to think of it.)\n\nThese pictures (2nd and 3rd rows) of a Cuban peasant being murdered by Castro\u2019s terror group were published in Look Magazine in 1957. The gentleman tying on the blindfold is Raul Castro himself, whom President Obama recently felt compelled to honor with a handshake.\n\nThis knock out drag out \u201cguerrilla war\u201d in Cuba The New York Times, Look, Life, etc. were breathlessly reporting was (like practically everything else reported by the MSM about Cuba) a monumental hoax. Promptly upon the end of that hoax and the commencement of an even bigger one ( the conversion of Cuba from a miserable Mob-run dictatorship into Shangri-La by Castro) the terrorists started lining up war-criminals and their cameras\u2014just like those of ISIS-- got going, as documented in these videos.\n\nAnd note that ISIS also brands their murder victims as \u201cwar criminals.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne Thousand Killed in 5 days of Fierce Street Fighting,\u201d had read a New York Times headline on Jan 4, 1959 about the \u201cbattle\u201d of Santa Clara in central Cuba where Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara earned much of his enduring martial fame. \u201cCommander Che Guevara appealed to Batista troops for a truce to clear the streets of casualties,\u201d continues the NY Times article. \u201cGuevara turned the tide in this bloody battle and whipped a Batista force of 3,000 men.\u201d\n\nA year later, Che\u2019s own diaries revealed that his forces suffered exactly one casualty during this Caribbean Stalingrad, as depicted by the Times. Your humble servant here interviewed several eye-witnesses (on both sides) to this \u201cbattle\u201d and their consensus came to about five casualties total for this Caribbean Iwo Jima.\n\nTrue to New York Times- form, during this \u201cbattle,\u201d they didn\u2019t have a reporter within 300 miles of Santa Clara. Instead (just as today) they relied on their trusty Cuban Castroite \u201ccorrespondents.\u201d\n\nAnd true to Che Guevara-form, the genuine bloodbath in Santa Clara came a week after the \u201cbattle,\u201d when his opponents (real and imagined) were utterly defenseless. That\u2019s when Che set his goons to dragging men and boys from their homes and set his firing squads to work in triple shifts. Nothing from the New York Times\u2019 trusty correspondents on this, however.\n\nThe Castroite firing-squad bloodbath was just cranking up. \u201cCertainly we execute!\u201d boasted Che Guevara when he addressed the United Nations in December 1964. \u201cAnd we will continue executing as long as it is necessary!\u201d Those executions (murders, actually; execution implies a judicial process) had reached about 16,000 by the time of Che Guevara\u2019s boast, the equivalent, given the relative populations, of almost a million executions in the U.S. (This figure comes from \u201cThe Black Book of Communism,\u201d by the way, written by French scholars and published in English by Harvard University Press, neither an outpost of \u201cright-wing Cuban exiles.\u201d)\n\nAmong the victims of this (unreported and unlamented by the MSM bloodbath) was Carlos Machado, who was 15 years old in 1963 when the bullets from the Castroite firing squad shattered his body. His twin brother and father collapsed beside Carlos from the same volley. All had resisted Castro\u2019s and Che\u2019s theft of their humble family farm.\n\nRigoberto Hernandez was 17 when Che\u2019s soldiers dragged him from his cell in La Cabana, jerked his head back to gag him and started dragging him to the stake. Little \u201cRigo\u201d pleaded his innocence to the very bloody end. But his pleas were garbled and difficult to understand. His struggles while being gagged and bound to the stake were also awkward. The boy had been a janitor in a Havana high school and was mentally retarded. His single mother had pleaded his case with hysterical sobs. She had begged, beseeched and finally proven to his \u201cprosecutors\u201d that it was a case of mistaken identity. Her only son, a boy in such a condition, couldn\u2019t possibly have been \u201ca CIA agent planting bombs.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuego!\u201d and the firing squad volley riddled Rigo\u2019s little bent body as he moaned and struggled awkwardly against his bounds, blindfold and gag.\n\nBut the victims of this Stalinist bloodbath were not exclusively men and boys. In fact, the Castroites were well ahead of even the Taliban. On Christmas Eve 1961, a young Cuban woman named Juana Figueroa Diaz spat in the face of the executioners who were binding and gagging her. They\u2019d found her guilty of feeding and hiding \u201cbandits\u201d (Che\u2019s term for Cuban rednecks who took up arms to fight his theft of their land to create Stalinist kolkhozes). When the blast from that firing squad demolished her face and torso, Juana was six months pregnant.\n\n\u201cForeign reporters, preferably American,\u201d snickered Che Guevara in his diaries, \u201cwere much more valuable to us than any military victory. Much more valuable than rural recruits for our guerrilla force, were American media recruits to export our propaganda.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it!\u201d reply these recruits. \u201cThe pleasure is all ours!\u201d To wit:\n\n\u201cThe Toast of Manhattan!\u201d crowed Time magazine in January of 1996. \u201cThe Hottest Ticket in Manhattan!\u201d also read a Newsweek story that week. Both articles referred to the social swirl and acclaim that engulfed Fidel Castro upon his visit to New York by the very Manhattan media and business luminaries who barely escaped incineration at his hand in 1962. The occasion was UN\u2019s fiftieth anniversary celebration, but the Castromania almost recaptured the New Yorker hysteria for Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s 1981 reunion in Central Park.\n\nFirst on the Stalinist dictator\u2019s itinerary was a luncheon at the Council on Foreign Relations. After holding court there for a rapt David Rockefeller, along with Robert McNamara, Dwayne Andreas, and Random House\u2019s Harold Evans, Castro flashed over to Mort Zuckerman\u2019s Fifth Avenue pad, where a throng of Beltway glitterati, including Mike Wallace, Peter Jennings, Tina Brown, Bernard Shaw, and Barbara Walters, all jostled for photo-ops and stood in line for the warmongering mass-murderer's autograph.\n\nDiane Sawyer was so overcome in the mass-murderer\u2019s presence that she rushed up, broke into a toothy smile, wrapped her arms around Fidel Castro, and smooched him warmly on the cheek.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From the New York Times to Newsweek and everyone in between the mainstream media seems horrified and outraged by the video-murders so gleefully and frequently perpetrated by the Islamic terror group ISIS..05/27/2016 0:47:45AM EST.", "author": "Humberto Fontova", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "From the New York Times to Newsweek and everyone in between the mainstream media seems horrified and outraged by the video-murders so gleefully and frequently perpetrated by the Islamic terror group ISIS.", "title": "- Televised Murders by Terrorists Didn\u2019t Start with ISIS", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/humbertofontova/2015/02/06/televised-murders-by-terrorists-didnt-start-with-isis-n1953971", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/351/eab905f9-9e3f-4df2-bb98-441e529be2f6.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "From the New York Times to Newsweek and everyone in between the mainstream media seems horrified and outraged by the video-murders so gleefully and frequently perpetrated by the Islamic terror group ISIS.", "title": "- Televised Murders by Terrorists Didn\u2019t Start with ISIS", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/humbertofontova/2015/02/06/televised-murders-by-terrorists-didnt-start-with-isis-n1953971", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/351/eab905f9-9e3f-4df2-bb98-441e529be2f6.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Televised Murders by Terrorists Didn\u2019t Start with ISIS, Humberto Fontova, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "True to New York Times- form, during this \u201cbattle,\u201d they didn\u2019t have a reporter within 300 miles of Santa Clara.\n\u201cForeign reporters, preferably American,\u201d snickered Che Guevara in his diaries, \u201cwere much more valuable to us than any military victory.\nThis knock out drag out \u201cguerrilla war\u201d in Cuba The New York Times, Look, Life, etc.\n\u201cCertainly we execute!\u201d boasted Che Guevara when he addressed the United Nations in December 1964.\n\u201cCommander Che Guevara appealed to Batista troops for a truce to clear the streets of casualties,\u201d continues the NY Times article."}
