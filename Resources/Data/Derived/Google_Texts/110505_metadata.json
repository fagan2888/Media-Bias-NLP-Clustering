The class is still going on today. He was good \u2013 he was physical, he would flip the girls. We did a little swinging, we did the waltz, a little tango, a little rumba. So he\u2019s a well-rounded individual, you can put it that way.\u201d\n\n(I mentioned this tidbit on Twitter, and the fans quickly pondered: how could someone trained to have such graceful footwork trip twice in games against San Diego, ruining sure touchdowns?)\n\nJohnson gushed about his former student\u2019s work ethic. For all the glamour of Decker\u2019s life, seen on their reality show on E!, he\u2019s really a hard-working small-town guy. Orange-and-blue-collar.\n\n\u201cBeing in a smaller community, you see the kids in activities, and even in elementary, you knew that he had something special,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI mean, my God. He was just so talented that you knew things would look pretty good for him later in the future. But I don\u2019t think people really understood how hard he worked. He worked extremely hard to get to the level that he\u2019s playing. He had great ability, but man, he put in the time. And it\u2019s paying off for him.\u201d\n\nJohnson remembered one anecdote that summed up Decker\u2019s persona \u2014 all-star, yet grounded.\n\n\u201cHe played in the all-star football game here in Minnesota, and when there was a stoppage of play, he\u2019d run out there with water for his players,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cJust a good leader, and an all-around good kid. I\u2019m really proud of him \u2014 the whole community is proud of him. It\u2019s fun to watch him. Hopefully the Broncos can get past Tom Brady.\u201d\n\nI thanked Johnson on the phone for his time, and he said before hanging up: \u201cHey, give him a little grief about that dance class.\u201d\n\nDone.\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or on Twitter @hochman", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Eric Decker,Jessie James,Mark Johnson,Rocori High School,Super Bowl,Tom Brady", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Denver Broncos wide receiver, long before he was a reality star and NFL player, took a ballroom dancing class with a former high school teacher.", "title": "Eric Decker, Denver Broncos receiver, took ballroom dancing class", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/01/17/eric-decker-from-ballroom-dancing-to-broncos/25267/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2013/12/eric-decker.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Denver Broncos wide receiver, long before he was a reality star and NFL player, took a ballroom dancing class with a former high school teacher.", "title": "Eric Decker: From ballroom dancing in high school to the Denver Broncos", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/01/17/eric-decker-from-ballroom-dancing-to-broncos/25267/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2013/12/eric-decker.jpg", "creator": "@hochman", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Denver Broncos wide receiver, long before he was a reality star and NFL player, took a ballroom dancing class with a former high school teacher."}, "article_summary": "For all the glamour of Decker\u2019s life, seen on their reality show on E!, he\u2019s really a hard-working small-town guy.\nWe did a little swinging, we did the waltz, a little tango, a little rumba.\n\u201cSomething a lot of people don\u2019t know is that I started a ballroom dance class at the high school, and Eric was in my very first ballroom dance class,\u201d said Johnson, who taught at Rocori High School in Cold Spring, Minn. \u201cSo you get some of the athletes in there, and man, I tell you, everybody came out (to join the class).\nI can totally see this happening: Eric Decker, Super Bowl receiver, and his wife Jessie James both on \u201cDancing With The Stars.\u201dNot just because this would be the ultimate \u201cthem\u201d thing to do, but also because of this tidbit I procured from Decker\u2019s high school teacher, Mark Johnson.\nHe was just so talented that you knew things would look pretty good for him later in the future."}
