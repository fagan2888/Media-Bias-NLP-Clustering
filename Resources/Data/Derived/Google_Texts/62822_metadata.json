The guy to watch at the 2015 NFL combine was Byron Jones, a cornerback out of the University of Connecticut.\n\nJones leaped 12 feet, 3 inches in the broad jump, an NFL combine record by an astounding eight inches. It is also believed to be a world record; Arne Tvervaag of Norway is said to have jumped 3.71 meters (12 feet, 2 inches) in 1968.\n\nBut Jones didn\u2019t stop there. He came within a half-inch of tying the combine record in the vertical jump, with 44.5 inches. (Chris Conley of Georgia jumped 45 inches, tying the record set by Ohio State\u2019s Donald Washington in 2009.)\n\nPretty sure Byron Jones is Spiderman.
