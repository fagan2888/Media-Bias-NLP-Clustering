The researchers did so among Kaiser Permanente members in 13 Northern California counties. This allowed them to study health factors in relation to geography. What they learned about the demographics was remarkable. It is not necessarily the progeny of the poor, uneducated or uninsured who are not being vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThis research confirms anecdotal reports of underimmunization clusters,\u201d said Dr. Tracy A. Lieu, the study\u2019s lead author, in a release about the study. \"We found clusters in places we hadn\u2019t anticipated.\"\n\nThe surprise? Many of these underimmunization or vaccine refusal clusters were located in affluent counties such as Marin - the richest county in the state. They were also found in San Francisco and Sonoma, which are among the wealthiest. The East Bay was another such area. Clusters exist within Alameda and Contra Costa counties - also two of California's most affluent counties. All of these communities also have a highly-educated populace.\n\n\u201cThis is consistent with our experience,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and a professor of pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cGenerally, parents who choose not to vaccinate their children are typically Caucasian, upper middle class to upper class, invariably college educated, often graduate school educated, professionals, or at least people who have some level of control in their jobs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "It seems the lifestyles of the rich and educated do not include vaccinations.
