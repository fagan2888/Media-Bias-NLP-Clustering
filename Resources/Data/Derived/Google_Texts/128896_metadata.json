On Friday, he arrived in court sporting a gray ponytail.\n\nIn an unrelated case, patients of Spring Hill dentist Miranda Smith are struggling with red tape related to her recent arrest on Medicaid fraud charges.\n\nHudson resident James Reynolds, 72, is one of dozens of patients who complained of poor dental work by Smith. She recommended and pulled all his teeth and provided him with ill-fitting dentures, the Tampa Bay Times reports.\n\nThe senior who lives only on Social Security income says his health plan initially said it wouldn\u2019t help pay for a new set of dentures, according to the Times. He\u2019s been eating only soft foods in the meantime.\n\nThe Times reports that Smith\u2019s license had been suspended and her practice closed, in relation to the Medicaid fraud charges. However, her license has been reinstated and her husband said the practice is back in operation, the Times reports.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health News Florida", "description": "Miami\u2019s so-called 'Rock Doc' apologized for his involvement in a Medicare scheme on Friday, but that didn\u2019t stop a federal judge from sending him to prison", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/prison-term-rock-doc", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201406/Rock_Doc_WSJ-Alexia_Fodere.jpeg", "type": "article", "description": "Miami\u2019s so-called 'Rock Doc' apologized for his involvement in a Medicare scheme on Friday, but that didn\u2019t stop a federal judge from sending him to prison", "title": "Prison Term for 'Rock Doc'"}, "story_id": 322551938, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Health News Florida Staff", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Prison Term for &#039;Rock Doc&#039;"}, "nid": 6824, "datePublished": "2014-06-16", "keywords": "\u2018Rock Doc\u2019, Rock Doc, Medicaid fraud, dentist", "wordCount": 307, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Miami\u2019s so-called 'Rock Doc' apologized for his involvement in a Medicare scheme on Friday, but that didn\u2019t stop a federal judge from sending him to prison for six years, the Miami Herald reports.\nShe recommended and pulled all his teeth and provided him with ill-fitting dentures, the Tampa Bay Times reports.\nThe Times reports that Smith\u2019s license had been suspended and her practice closed, in relation to the Medicaid fraud charges.\nHowever, her license has been reinstated and her husband said the practice is back in operation, the Times reports.\nWayne, 54, was dubbed the \u201cRock Doc\u201d for his spiky blond hair."}
