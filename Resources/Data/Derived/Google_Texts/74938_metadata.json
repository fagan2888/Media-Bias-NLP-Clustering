Easter says about $4.6 million is budgeted for inmate health care.\n\nAnd he says people come into the jail with a variety of medical problems.\n\n\"They come in here with different diseases, with different types or stages of heart issues or kidney issues that we treat them for while in our custody,\" Easter said.\n\nEaster said one inmate suffered a stroke and wound up in a rehab center for a little over a month at a cost of $2,000 a day to the taxpayer.\n\nCitizens are sometimes split over that health care.\n\n\"It's part of our responsibility, you got to feed them also,\" said taxpayer Randy Summers. \"Clothe them and everything else that's just part of it.\"\n\nHowever, an elderly man who did not want to be identified says it sounds like some of the inmates are gaming the system. \"I think it's tough, we shouldn't be stuck for it. That's just my opinion.\"\n\nIn fact Easter said some inmates are trying to take advantage of the system.\n\n\"We have had instances where folks are needing heart transplants, kidney transplants, they go out and commit a felony crime because they don't the insurance or the funds to pay for it,\" Easter said. \"So then it falls down on us as taxpayers to pay for those.\"\n\nEaster said one of those inmates who wanted a transplant admitted what he was doing and was released from jail the day before his scheduled operation.\n\nEaster said prisoners while in the hospital must have a deputy guarding them around the clock putting a strain on his staff that is already short by 43 detention officers.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Sheriff Jeff Easter said inmates get good medical care but some try to game the system to get into the hospital", "language": "english", "author": "Mike Iuen", "og": {"description": "Sheriff Jeff Easter said inmates get good medical care but some try to game the system to get into the hospital", "title": "Sedgwick County Sheriff: Some inmates try to game medical care system", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Sedgwick-County-Sheriff-says-some-inmates-try-to-game-the-medical-care-system-306835771.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/7A0/247/7A0247E385A8482AB63147BE43CDD4D5", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/8B4/57A/8B457A7507BE47F1A013B08B89EBFC1D.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Sheriff Jeff Easter said inmates get good medical care but some try to game the system to get into the hospital", "title": "Sedgwick County Sheriff: Some inmates try to game medical care system", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Sedgwick-County-Sheriff-says-some-inmates-try-to-game-the-medical-care-system-306835771.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/sedgwick+county+jail2.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Sedgwick County Sheriff: Some inmates try to game medical care system", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Sedgwick County Sheriff Some inmates, try to game medical care"}, "article_summary": "Sheriff Jeff Easter says Sedgwick County Jail inmates get very good medical care.\nThe Sedgwick County Sheriff says over the past four months he's seen an increase in the number of inmates needing to go the hospital.\nIn fact Easter said some inmates are trying to take advantage of the system.\nHowever, an elderly man who did not want to be identified says it sounds like some of the inmates are gaming the system.\nAnd he says people come into the jail with a variety of medical problems."}
