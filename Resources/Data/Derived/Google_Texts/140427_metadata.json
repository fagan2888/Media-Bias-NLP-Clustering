Insurance companies have reported issues with the files since the law's rollout.\n\n\"The new process put in place this week is making a difference. The enrollment files are getting better, but there is more work to do to ensure consumers are covered,\" Karen Ignani, the chief executive officer of insurance industry trade group, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement obtained by the New York Post on Friday.\n\nCMS is reaching out to hundreds of thousands of consumers who have tried to enroll for health coverage but aren't enrolled, according to Bataille, who said consumers should be contacted by the insurance company for a payment after selecting a plan.\n\n\"Our clear priority is fixing any remaining bugs causing problems and working to make sure every 834 form past and present is resolved,\" Bataille said, according to The Journal.\n\nMs. Bataille said errors with the enrollment forms include duplicate files, lack of a file altogether, or a file with mistaken data such as a child incorrectly being listed as a spouse.\n\nAHIP spokesman Robert Zirkelbach told FoxNews.com last week that insurance companies have received duplicative and inaccurate forms, and \"in some cases, plans are not getting the enrollment files at all.\" Getting that fixed, he said, is \"critical.\"\n\nThough the administration has given people until the end of March to sign up for coverage if they want to avoid a fine, coverage for many is supposed to start on Jan. 1. That leaves less than 30 days to fix the remaining glitches.\n\nThe administration announced last week it is working on a system to pay insurers its portion of premiums and cost-sharing payments. A temporary workaround has been proposed that would allow insurers to estimate how much they are owed, and submit the bill to the government.\n\nClick here for more from The Wall Street Journal.",
