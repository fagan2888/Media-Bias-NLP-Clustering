Instead of devoting their energies to growing their businesses, owners must expend significant time and resources ensuring compliance with these voluminous and often vague regulations, with costly fines looming as consequences for failure to comply. \u201cThe Fourth Branch & Underground Regulations,\u201d a new report by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), details the processes by which administrative agencies skirt \u201cnotice-and-comment\u201d requirements to impose new interpretations of rules that avoid the constitutional system of checks and balances. Unfortunately, operating on this shifting field disproportionately affects small businesses, as they are most poorly equipped to lobby for favorable rules.\n\nThe Administrative Procedure Act established \u201cnotice-and-comment\u201d as a means for regulated businesses to voice concerns with or offer suggestions to improve proposed regulations. However, \u201cnon-legislative rules,\u201d or \u201cgeneral statements of policy\u201d and \u201cinterpretive rules,\u201d are not required to undergo this process. This grants administrative agencies \u2013 the \u201cFourth Branch\u201d of government \u2013 significant leeway in how \u201clegislative rules\u201d are interpreted and implemented, essentially giving them law making power. The recent Supreme Court ruling in Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association allows agencies not only to interpret rules without undergoing \u201cnotice-and-comment,\u201d but also the ability to change their interpretation at any point.(Cato filed an amicus brief in the case.)\n\nWithout a required need for transparency, agencies are thus free to issue \u201cunderground regulations\u201d that impose serious and sudden rules on regulated businesses. NFIB examines four ways in which these \u201cunderground rules\u201d are established: executive orders, guidance documents, amicus filings, and enforcement actions. Recognizing the potential dangers of this \u201cunderground\u201d system of lawmaking, NFIB argues that \u201cthe regulated public should have a right to voice concerns over any newly announced rules, policy, or administrative interpretation of law that may impose affirmative regulatory burdens on individuals or businesses\u201d and urges agencies to \u201callows some opportunity for notice-and-comment on all new rules imposing liabilities or other regulatory burdens \u2013 without regard to quantifiable compliance costs.\u201d\n\nFreed from congressional oversight and the beneficiary of considerable judicial deference, administrative agencies can pursue ideological agendas without the general public even being aware regulations are being instituted. One way this is achieved is by filing an amicus brief in a case between two private parties. An agency can offer the court its authoritative interpretation of a rule \u2013 though given the ruling in Perez, the agency can change that interpretation in a later brief in another case or court.\n\nFor example, NFIB\u2019s report details the process by which the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) reclassified McDonalds as a joint-employer with it franchisees, upending the franchise model and thirty years of established rules. In a June 2014 amicus brief, the NLRB announced it\u2019s plans to reinterpret its \u201cjoint-employer\u201d rule to \u201ctreat franchisors as joint-employers with franchisees, or other independent contracting firms, so long as they exert \u2018significant control\u2019 over the same employees.\u201d The NLRB further announced that significant control could be shown \u201csimply by demonstrating that a franchisor has significant control over every-day business operations, without regard to whether the franchisor has exercised any control over personnel decisions.\u201d Under previous rules, influence over personnel decisions dictated whether franchisors were considered \u201cjoint-employers,\u201d so given McDonalds franchisees had control over hiring and disciplinary practices, McDonalds was not considered a joint-employer.\n\nFollowing this amicus brief, the NLRB filed thirteen complaints \u2013 enforcement actions \u2013 against McDonalds, alleging misconduct on the part of some of it franchisees, presenting McDonalds with a choice: loosen quality control over its franchisees (and thus risk brand degradation) or radically alter its business model and become more involved in the personnel decisions of its franchisees. While McDonalds might not be the most sympathetic victim of underground rule making, the rule change also affects its franchisees, \u201cthreaten[ing] a successful collaborative business model that has enabled many entrepreneurs to launch their own business.\u201d\n\nReaders of this blog will be familiar with ongoing litigation over the current administration\u2019s use of executive actions to pursue its immigration policy and EPA rule-making to further its climate agenda \u2013 let alone the ongoing dispute between the House of Representatives and the president over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 but NFIB\u2019s report offers numerous examples of how \u201cunderground regulation\u201d affects businesses of all sizes in ways that don\u2019t gain media attention.\n\nResearch assistant Anthony Gruzdis contributed to this blogpost.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new NFIB report details executive-branch abuses that you don\u2019t often hear about.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "A new NFIB report details executive-branch abuses that you don't often hear about.", "title": "\"Underground Regulations\" Violate the Constitution as Much as Headline-Grabbing Executive Actions", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/underground-regulations-violate-constitution-much-headline-grabbing-executive-actions", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/underground-regulations-violate-constitution-much-headline-grabbing-executive-actions", "title": "\"Underground Regulations\" Violate the Constitution as Much as Headline-Grabbing Executive Actions", "description": "A new NFIB report details executive-branch abuses that you don't often hear about.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2015/11/11", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-11T18:01:30-05:00"}, "publication_date": "2015/11/11", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "NFIB examines four ways in which these \u201cunderground rules\u201d are established: executive orders, guidance documents, amicus filings, and enforcement actions.\nWithout a required need for transparency, agencies are thus free to issue \u201cunderground regulations\u201d that impose serious and sudden rules on regulated businesses.\nThe Administrative Procedure Act established \u201cnotice-and-comment\u201d as a means for regulated businesses to voice concerns with or offer suggestions to improve proposed regulations.\nUnfortunately, operating on this shifting field disproportionately affects small businesses, as they are most poorly equipped to lobby for favorable rules.\nHowever, \u201cnon-legislative rules,\u201d or \u201cgeneral statements of policy\u201d and \u201cinterpretive rules,\u201d are not required to undergo this process."}
