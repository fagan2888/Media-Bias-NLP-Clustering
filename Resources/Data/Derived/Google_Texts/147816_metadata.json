Over the next five days, Resto will join an estimated 20,000 people who expected to attend the gathering of the group that bills itself as the largest and oldest Hispanic organization in the United States.\n\n\u201cThese conventions are very informative - there are an array of different topics that are addressed here that you cannot find anywhere else,\u201d said Resto, a business and community liaison officer with the Brooklyn Job Corps Academy.\n\nLULAC, headquartered in Washington D.C., has over one thousand chapters around the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The nonpartisan organization's mission is to advance the economic condition, educational attainment, political influence, housing, health and civil rights of Latinos. The focus of the 2014 convention will be immigration reform as well as civil rights.\n\nBrent Wilkes, National Executive Director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, speaks at their 2014 convention in New York City on July 8, 2014. Luis Nu\u00f1o Briones / LULAC\n\n\u201cI think the big focus areas this year are going to be the bread and butter issues that the Latino community is dealing with,\u201d said Brent Wilkes, National Executive Director of LULAC. He cites the failure immigration reform and education as important topics. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re also going to see a lot of discussion on things you might not expect, like technology, and how this affects Latinos; there will be a big discussion on health care reform and the opportunities provided by the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing border crisis is of particular concern to his organization, said Wilkes. \u201cOur position is that this is a refugee crisis, it is a humanitarian crisis. We have got to make sure that we respond to it as we would any refugee situation.\u201d He believes that the influx of unaccompanied children is driven by the drug trade and the violence in Central America. \u201cThe last thing we want to do is turn them (the children) right back to the places they are trying to escape.\u201d\n\nLULAC National President Margaret Moran told NBC News that the recent anti-immigrant protests in Murrieta were \u201cmean-spirited\u201d and that the anti-immigrant protestors \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\n\nLULAC's president Margaret Moran said her organization has a special challenge to get the next generation of Latino leaders civically engaged.\n\nMoran said her organization has a special challenge to get the next generation of Latino leaders civically engaged. \u201cIf our youth and young adults don't get with it, and listen and observe the reasons why they should get involved, it is our responsibility to get them involved. We are the one electing those people in Washington who make policy, and it\u2019s not working. There is so much negativity in Congress, it needs to change.\u201d\n\nAt a Tuesday morning press conference, Wilkes announced that LULAC is partnering with the Hispanic Federation and the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement to mobilize voters in the upcoming midterms. Their joint effort, called \u201cMovimiento Hispano\u201d aims to register 50,000 Latino voters before the November elections. In addition, the groups will work to get 100,000 already-registered Latino voters to show up at the polls.\n\nAsked to grade President Obama\u2019s presidency so far, LULAC Executive Director Wilkes said, \u201cHe is the first minority president in our nation\u2019s history, and has had an awful amount of pushback from people trying to stop his agenda.\u201d He cited the Affordable Care Act as one of Obama\u2019s accomplishments that benefits Latinos. \u201cWould I like to see him push immigration reform? Yes! Would I like to see him to a jobs Bill? Yes!... But he has been blocked a lot of the time\u2026 I would give him an A-.\u201d\n\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama will be speaking at LULAC\u2019s Unity Luncheon on Thursday. Other guests and speakers during the convention include New York Mayor Bill di Blasio, Deputy Secretary of Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Small Business Administration head Maria Contreras Sweet, and entertainers Jennifer Lopez and Rita Moreno. Apart from policy seminars, the event includes a job fair and the LULAC Federal Training Institute, a career development program for government and public sector workers.\n\nFor Latinos like Nelson Resto, who has been to 7 LULAC conventions, the chance to assess the state of U.S. Latino issues on a wide variety of topics is invaluable. \u201cI keep coming because I keep learning more,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LULAC', the nation's oldest Latino civil rights group, holds it 85th convention in New York City.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/lulac-2014-tackles-latino-vote-civil-rights-immigration-n150911", "type": "article", "image": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_28/552871/140708-lulac-immigration-flyers-215p_4759fa6b81e91134865a815e427c1c21.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "LULAC', the nation's oldest Latino civil rights group, holds it 85th convention in New York City."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "LULAC', the nation's oldest Latino civil rights group, holds it 85th convention in New York City.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_28/552871/140708-lulac-immigration-flyers-215p_4759fa6b81e91134865a815e427c1c21.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "LULAC 2014 Tackles Latino Vote, Civil Rights, Immigration - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-08", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/lulac-2014-tackles-latino-vote-civil-rights-immigration-n150911", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "News,Latino"}, "article_summary": "The focus of the 2014 convention will be immigration reform as well as civil rights.\nThe nonpartisan organization's mission is to advance the economic condition, educational attainment, political influence, housing, health and civil rights of Latinos.\nLULAC, headquartered in Washington D.C., has over one thousand chapters around the U.S. and Puerto Rico.\nMoran said her organization has a special challenge to get the next generation of Latino leaders civically engaged.\nFor Latinos like Nelson Resto, who has been to 7 LULAC conventions, the chance to assess the state of U.S. Latino issues on a wide variety of topics is invaluable."}
