This would still allow House leadership to pass a budget bill without Democratic votes.\n\nThe Hill reports that it would take 28 Republicans rejecting their leadership to hold up any funding. At that point, House leaders could ask Democrats -- who for the most part have declared that they will shut down the government if Planned Parenthood isn't funded -- to support their budget, defund Planned Parenthood, or see a government shutdown.\n\nIn the Senate, Texas senator and GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz is expected to send a letter urging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY, to not fund Planned Parenthood in a budget resolution. Like 18 House conservatives, he also sent a letter to his chamber's leadership before the recess.\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\n\u201cI believe we should use every and any procedural tool available to defund Planned Parenthood,\u201d Cruz wrote a month ago.\n\nHowever, many Republicans are wary of being blamed for a government shutdown, which happened when Democrats refused to compromise on funding for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLast week, McConnell said the Planned Parenthood funding fight would have to wait until a new president is elected.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "All eyes are on the beginning of a new budget year on October 1, but the question on everyone's mind is whether a battle over Planned Parenthood funding will lead to a partial government shutdown.", "title": "Pro-lifers ready to take stand against Planned Parenthood funding as Congress resumes", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/Shutterstock/congress_storm.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/pro-lifers-ready-to-take-stand-against-planned-parenthood-funding-as-congre", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "All eyes are on the beginning of a new budget year on October 1, but the question on everyone's mind is whether a battle over Planned Parenthood funding will lead to a partial government shutdown."}, "description": "All eyes are on the beginning of a new budget year on October 1, but the question on everyone's mind is whether a battle over Planned Parenthood funding will lead to a partial government shutdown.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "article_summary": "Last week, McConnell said the Planned Parenthood funding fight would have to wait until a new president is elected.\n\u201cI believe we should use every and any procedural tool available to defund Planned Parenthood,\u201d Cruz wrote a month ago.\nThe abortion giant\u2019s funding appears to be safe: Almost every Democrat in Congress is behind it, and only 19 House conservatives have said they will stand against a budget resolution that funds Planned Parenthood.\nAt that point, House leaders could ask Democrats -- who for the most part have declared that they will shut down the government if Planned Parenthood isn't funded -- to support their budget, defund Planned Parenthood, or see a government shutdown.\nThis would still allow House leadership to pass a budget bill without Democratic votes."}
