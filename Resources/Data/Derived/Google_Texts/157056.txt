New York City health and school officials said Monday that high schools can start showing students how to use condoms during health classes in the fall, lifting a longtime ban on condom demonstrations during class periods.

Currently high school students learn about condoms during sex education in health courses, but must go to “health resource rooms” to ask for a demonstration of how to handle them.

“Condom demonstrations have long been part of the high school condom availability programs and have been shown to increase rates of condom use,” a city education department spokesman said by email. “Allowing condom demonstrations in high school health education class will provide students with medically accurate information that can help them stay healthy.”

As with other sex education lessons, parents can choose to opt their children out. Superintendents were informed in mid-May and are now telling schools about the policy change, which was first reported by “The Classic,” a student newspaper at Townsend Harris High School at Queens College.
