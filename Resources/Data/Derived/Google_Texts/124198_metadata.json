Major investments are being made in health care systems like Accountable Care Organizations and in tools like Physician Compare. Similarly, health insurers and employers are exploring new benefits designs that incentivize consumers to select providers and hospitals that provide the highest-quality care while reducing costs through value-based provider networks and tiered health plans.\"\n\nAnother key finding in the report claims that less than a quarter of consumers are receiving provider quality information. Most people are not very confident they could find provider quality information they can trust on their own, including direct comparisons of physicians.\n\nRoughly half of respondents added that they feel that higher-quality health care generally comes at a higher cost, while 37 percent say there is no real relationship between quality and cost.\n\nRegarding specifics on how important the doctor/patient relationship is, respondents said good bedside manner (8 percent), various other positive personality traits (7 percent), and time spent with patients (5 percent) all rated as very important to survey participants.\n\n\u00a9 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.
