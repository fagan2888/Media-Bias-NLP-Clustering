Major League Baseball is looking into domestic violence allegations against Chapman.\n\nA police report obtained by Yahoo! Sports said Chapman had fired gunshots in the garage of his home after arguing with his girlfriend. Chapman\u2019s girlfriend also alleged he choked her. Chapman has denied the allegations, and no arrests were made. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019re not going to continue to go after until we find out what\u2026 with how things have happened,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cSomething that we don\u2019t want to get into that because of the allegations against him. There\u2019s plenty of other targets that we have and we\u2019re going to move onto those.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Rizzo on Jason Heyward signing with Chicago Cubs: \u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment, obviously, that we didn\u2019t land Jason. \u2026 Those things are expected. We have alternative plans for everything we get done and for things we don\u2019t get done. We wish him well and we\u2019ll certainly make arrangements to improve the roster other ways.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Lucas Giolito will be in Major League camp at spring training this season. Rizzo said they will still be cautious with the 21-year-old top prospect.\n\n\u2014 Swinging Anthony Rendon back to third base prompted the Nationals to trade Yunel Escobar, Rizzo said. He was an extra piece that brought relief help. \u201cWe thought we did really well in the swap for two right-handed relief pitchers,\u201d Rizzo said.\n\n\u2014 Trevor Gott\u2019s role in the bullpen will be determined by spring training, Rizzo said.\n\n\u2014 Rizzo said the Nationals made competitive market value offers to Heyward, Ben Zobrist and Darren O\u2019Day. \u201cThings came into play that they decided to go other places,\u201d Rizzo said. The common theme as to why they didn\u2019t come to Washington? \u201cI don\u2019t see any common three between the three other than they chose the teams they chose over many, many other teams that had interesting in them,\u201d Rizzo said.\n\n\u2014 Asked if he has seen enough from Trea Turner to be the everyday shortstop, Rizzo quickly said, \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Closer Jonathan Papelbon and former closer Drew Storen will not be at Winterfest. Rizzo said each had prior plans set before the dates of the event were announced.", "article_metadata": {"description": "General manager Mike Rizzo said the Nationals will no longer pursue closer Aroldis Chapman because of domestic violence allegations against him.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "General manager Mike Rizzo said the Nationals will no longer pursue closer Aroldis Chapman because of domestic violence allegations against him.", "title": "Aroldis Chapman no longer on Washington Nationals\u2019 radar", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/12/aroldis-chapman-no-longer-washington-nationals-rad/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/04/AP_224833306183.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/04/AP_224833306183.jpg", "description": "General manager Mike Rizzo said the Nationals will no longer pursue closer Aroldis Chapman because of domestic violence allegations against him.", "card": "summary", "title": "Aroldis Chapman no longer on Washington Nationals\u2019 radar"}, "Author": "Todd Dybas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Mike Rizzo, Washington Nationals"}, "article_summary": "Washington Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo met with reporters at Nationals Winterfest on Saturday and touched on a number of topics:\u2014 Rizzo said the Nationals have suspended any pursuit of Cincinnati Reds closer Aroldis Chapman.\n\u2014 Trevor Gott\u2019s role in the bullpen will be determined by spring training, Rizzo said.\nSports said Chapman had fired gunshots in the garage of his home after arguing with his girlfriend.\nMajor League Baseball is looking into domestic violence allegations against Chapman.\n\u2014 Rizzo said the Nationals made competitive market value offers to Heyward, Ben Zobrist and Darren O\u2019Day."}
