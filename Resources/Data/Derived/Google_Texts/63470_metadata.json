It uses footage of Shaheen using the \"if you like your insurance you can keep it\" line while noting on screen that President Obama was given the \"lie of the year\" by PolitiFact for saying the same thing. A narrator points out that 20,000 New Hampshire residents have had their insurance canceled and that the Affordable Care Act offers only a single provider on the state's individual market. The ad ends with this dagger of a line: \"Next November, if you like your Senator, you can keep her. If not, you know what to do.\" Oomph.\n\n(Shaheen, to her credit, is using the Ending Spending ad buy to raise money. \"The right-wing Super PACs are desperate to take back the Senate \u2013 and they know that to do that they must win in New Hampshire,\" she wrote in a fundraising appeal sent Tuesday afternoon.)\n\nThe Ending Spending ad can be replicated in virtually every single state where an endangered Democratic Senator (or House member) is running. Find footage of said member praising Obamacare, followed by noting the \"lie of the year\" award and then follow it up with how many people in the state/district had their policies canceled because of the ACA.\n\nThe potential ubiquity of the ad is matched by its potential power. Remember that more than six in ten registered voters in the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll disapprove of President Obama's handling of health care -- including an eye-popping 50 percent who disapprove strongly. (Eighty-eight percent of Republicans and 70 percent of independents disapprove of Obama handling of the health care law.) And, nearly half (47 percent) of voters said that Obamacare is making the health care system worse while just 19 percent said the ACA had made things better.\n\nAdd it all up and you have a very scary situation for Shaheen -- and any other Democrat, which is almost all of them, on the record supporting the ACA. Get used to this ad. You are going to see it thousands of times -- in various forms -- before 2014 is over.\n\nRELATED: The 18 best political photos of 2013\n\nThe Best of The Post: Photographs, 2013", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's all about Obamacare.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chris.cillizza", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "It's all about Obamacare.", "title": "This is the ad every Democrat should be scared of in 2014", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/12/17/the-ad-every-democrat-should-be-scared-of-in-2014/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/11/04/Production/Blogs/ezra-klein/Images/2011-10-30T184011Z_01_BTRE79T1FV200_RTROPTP_3_TELEVISION-US-YOUTUBE-420.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thefix"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/12/17/the-ad-every-democrat-should-be-scared-of-in-2014/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health care repeal, health care reform, health care repeal 2011, health care reform bill, healthcare reform, healthcare vote, healthcare legislation, health care debate, cbo heal care, repeal of health care bill, republicans try to change health care, health care bill costs, obama health care, obamacare, repeal health care, health care interest groups, healthcare legislation, health care insurance, heath care reform,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chris.cillizza"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "health care repeal, health care reform, health care repeal 2011, health care reform bill, healthcare reform, healthcare vote, healthcare legislation, health care debate, cbo heal care, repeal of health care bill, republicans try to change health care, health care bill costs, obama health care, obamacare, repeal health care, health care interest groups, healthcare legislation, health care insurance, heath care reform,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce93b\"", "article_summary": "The Ending Spending ad can be replicated in virtually every single state where an endangered Democratic Senator (or House member) is running.\n(Shaheen, to her credit, is using the Ending Spending ad buy to raise money.\nThe ad, which was produced by GOP media consultant Larry McCarthy, hits all of the high notes.\n(Eighty-eight percent of Republicans and 70 percent of independents disapprove of Obama handling of the health care law.)\nThe ad ends with this dagger of a line: \"Next November, if you like your Senator, you can keep her."}
