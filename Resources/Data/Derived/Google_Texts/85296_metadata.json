When you look at Obamacare, it\u2019s a perfect example of what Washington does. It\u2019s a one size fits all approach for the whole country all driven by Washington bureaucrats. I\u2019ll bet they\u2019ve hired tens of thousands of people between the IRS and over at Health and Human Services just to run this. All of the decisions, all of the rules decided by Washington. We have a wide, diverse country, and I just think it\u2019s time for us to look at this differently. For those who don\u2019t have access to affordable health insurance. Helping those at the bottom I think we\u2019re all for it, but we don\u2019t need Washington to ruin the greatest health delivery system that the world has ever known.\u201d\n\nCBS\u2019s Scott Pelley asked again, \u201cSo how do you do it? What\u2019s the Republican plan?\u201d Boehner answered with a weak, \u201cWe\u2019re, We\u2019re working on this. Having discussions amongst our members, got a lot of divergent views about how best to go back to a doctor/patient relationship that\u2019s revered.\u201d\n\nPelley kept hammering away and said that this is one of the biggest criticisms of the Republican Party is that they know what they are against, but can\u2019t tell people what they are for. McConnell said that Pelley was mischaracterizing the success of Obamacare and claimed that the ACA will fail. McConnell said that the chances, of getting rid of Obamacare with Obama in the White House, were slim, but that Republicans were going to make the effort.\n\nPelley replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t have an alternative.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Boehner jumped back in and pushed the same old Republican ideas of letting people buy insurance across state lines and medical malpractice insurance reform. John Boehner and Mitch McConnell went on the most watched television news program in the country and promptly fell on their faces. The truth is that Republicans have no replacement plan for the ACA.\n\nBoehner and McConnell both talked about getting rid of the ACA, but what they didn\u2019t mention is that a bill that they each voted for funded Obamacare for another year. Republicans have created a new disaster for themselves on a weekly basis since they have taken over Congress. The new Republican majority was supposed to get things done, but instead has been consumed by ineptitude and infighting while being constantly outmaneuvered by President Obama.\n\nRepublicans have had almost six years to come up with an ACA alternative. They have had even longer to come up with a plan to reform health care. The Republican plan is to return the country to a system where tens of millions of Americans lack access to health care, and those with insurance are one medical crisis away from bankruptcy.\n\nThe Republican Party has no alternative. Even worse, they treat the American people like they don\u2019t have a clue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaker of the House John Boehner and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a disastrous appearance on 60 Minutes, the lowlight of which was their complete inability to discuss the Republican alternative to Obamacare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Speaker of the House John Boehner and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a disastrous appearance on 60 Minutes, the lowlight of which was their complete inability to discuss the Republican alternative to Obamacare.", "title": "Boehner and McConnell Bomb On 60 Minutes When Asked For GOP Alternative to Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/01/25/boehner-mcconnell-bomb-60-minutes-asked-gop-alternative-obamacare.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/boehner-mcconnell-obamacare.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-25T22:00:43+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,60 Minutes,John Boehner,mitch mcconnell,republican alternative to obamacare,Scott Pelley,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-01-25T20:14:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-25T22:00:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "60 Minutes, John Boehner, mitch mcconnell, republican alternative to obamacare, Scott Pelley"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd027d\"", "article_summary": "What\u2019s the Republican plan?\u201d Boehner answered with a weak, \u201cWe\u2019re, We\u2019re working on this.\nSpeaker of the House John Boehner and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a disastrous appearance on 60 Minutes, the lowlight of which was their complete inability to discuss the Republican alternative to Obamacare.\nJohn Boehner and Mitch McConnell went on the most watched television news program in the country and promptly fell on their faces.\nFor those who don\u2019t have access to affordable health insurance.\nMcConnell said that Pelley was mischaracterizing the success of Obamacare and claimed that the ACA will fail."}
