This plan usually is provided by one party's employer or independently from an insurance company. Either way, usually upon divorce, coverage for the non-employee spouse will be terminated, or if there is no longer a family unit, then coverage might change.\n\nWhile there are laws in place to protect a person from immediately losing coverage, investigate your options before negotiating your divorce settlement.\n\nDetermine how much income you will have after the divorce to choose a plan.\n\nSome plans have higher premiums and then lower deductibles, and others have lower deductibles with higher premiums.\n\nAlso determine what is important to you: For some, having counseling benefits is essential and for others, perhaps coverage for addiction treatment.\n\nDoes the plan include dental coverage?\n\nOftentimes dental coverage is much more affordable when purchased with the health insurance plan.\n\nFind out when your current health insurance will terminate and coordinate the start of your new plan.\n\nAlso, find out if you qualify for COBRA and how much the monthly payments would be to continue the current coverage and compare the cost of both policies. (Note: COBRA stands for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which is the federal law that can provide people with the right to continue health coverage.)\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act, there are a variety of health care options.\n\nVisit the website, www.obamacarefacts.com.\n\nThere are a variety of health care insurance plans available with varying premiums. There are several other online sources for procuring health insurance such as www.esurance.com.\n\nYou can also go straight to a particular company, such as Blue Cross Blue Shield or Cigna, to get quotes.\n\nIf you are the non- monied spouse and are eligible for alimony, try to get enough alimony to cover your premium.\n\nYou also can get the monied spouse to pay the premium for you separately but be sure that they are actually being paid.\n\nRegardless of whether you are the husband, the wife, the monied spouse or the non-monied spouse, be aware of what's going to happen to your health insurance coverage after divorce and planning accordingly will help to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nRebecca Zung, a family law attorney, is a founding partner of the Law Office of Zung Clough, PLLC in Naples.
