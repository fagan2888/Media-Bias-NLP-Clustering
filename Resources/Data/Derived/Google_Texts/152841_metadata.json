I\u2019ve won every election in Arizona by very large margins, quite often with the opposition of that element of the party,\u201d McCain said, referring to the state's far-right.\n\n\u201cIf anything, it fires me up,\" he added.\n\nAccording to the Arizona Republicans' resolution, McCain has leaned left on issues \"associated with liberal Democrats,\" including Obamacare and immigration reform. McCain called the hit to his Obamacare stance \"bizarre.\"\n\n\u201cI led the fight for 25 days on the floor of the Senate,\u201d McCain told Politico.\n\nMcCain, 77, now serving his fifth term in the Senate, isn't up for reelection this year.
