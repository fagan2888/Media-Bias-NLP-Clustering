From the Affordable Care Act to changes in HIPAA to ongoing initiatives to control costs, health policy and health law are central issues nationwide.\n\nThese changes are creating new opportunities for professionals looking to make a dramatic impact at the intersection of health policy and law. Developed by world-renowned institutions UCSF and UC Hastings College of Law, the new Masters of Science in Health Policy and Law prepares students to serve as industry leaders through a unique interdisciplinary education. The courses\u2014which interweave the best elements of health policy and legal education\u2014span economics, finance, policy analysis and legal reform.\n\n\u201cTo really improve peoples\u2019 live, evidence from laboratory, clinical or social research needs to be translated into real-world terms, into policy and practice,\u201d says Dan Dohan, Ph.D., co-director of the degree and professor at UCSF. \u201cFrom the UCSF health policy research side comes an ability to analyze and understand evidence. UC Hastings provides a window into the most powerful tool we have for change: the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe take the amazing research performed at UCSF and bring it to life,\u201d adds Jaime King, J.D., Ph.D., co-director of the degree and professor at UC Hastings. \u201cWhen you have interdisciplinary education and research, that\u2019s how you get progress.

Its four schools (Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy) consistently top the rankings in education, research, patient care and NIH funding support, with patients traveling from across the state, country and globe for care at UCSF\u2019s medical centers.\n\nThe University of California, Hastings College of the Law was founded in 1878 as the first law school in the University of California public university system. As a top-ranked law school, UC Hastings educates students in cutting-edge areas of the law and provides opportunities for students and practitioners to work together at the school and in the community. Hastings alumni are leaders in law, policy, government and business.\n\nAs law and health care continue to intertwine, lawyers, researchers and medical professionals must be able to navigate both worlds fluently.
