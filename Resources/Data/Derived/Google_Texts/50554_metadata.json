Flanked by a dog accessory store and a beauty salon, it is surrounded by expensive boutiques specializing in children. A quick glance reveals a children\u2019s optician, a children\u2019s photographer, a handful of children\u2019s clothing stores, and a nanny agency. Tastefully decorated and brimming with designer apparel and accessories for nursing mothers, Yummy Mummy fits right in. Its plum brown awning greets customers and passers-by with a friendly, if pointed, message: happy breastfeeding.\n\nLocated on the Upper East Side, just one block away from the mansions and penthouses of Park Avenue, Yummy Mummy is a self-styled \u201cbreastfeeding emporium.\u201d A steady stream of new mothers pushing state-of-the-art strollers flock here to buy everything from bottles and bras to \u201chip, stylish\u201d nursing clothes and breastfeeding supplements like Lactation Cookies. As it happens, Lactation Cookies look just like ordinary chocolate-chip cookies, but they include ingredients such as oats, brewers\u2019 yeast, and flax seed to boost breast-milk production. (Yummy Mummy also sells fenugreek for the same purpose, which at ten dollars a package, costs half the price.)\n\nStill, Yummy Mummy\u2019s main business is breast pumps, which it sells at the small Lexington Avenue store and through its bustling website. Although breast pump sales have been brisk ever since Amanda Cole opened her store in 2009, they soared dramatically in 2013. That year, President Obama made a bold intervention in the world of breastfeeding advocacy by reforming the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to require health insurance companies to cover the cost of breast pumps for new mothers. At first, Cole worried that making breast pumps free to anyone with health insurance would be bad for business. Even before the ACA reform went into effect, the United States accounted for 40 percent of the global market in breast pumps, with 2.3 million breast pumps sold in 2010 alone. After the reform, analysts predicted the breast pump market would expand by 50 percent, and Cole didn\u2019t want to miss out on that burgeoning growth.\n\nShe moved quickly to make the new legislation work to her advantage. Insurance companies will only reimburse customers who purchase equipment through an accredited durable medical equipment (DME) supplier. These specialized stores normally sell institutional items like hospital beds and oxygen tanks; their no-nonsense aesthetic is light years away from the boutique-y world of Yummy Mummy. But, by deftly navigating the bureaucracy necessary to have Yummy Mummy accredited as a DME, Cole positioned her store to profit from the new plan almost immediately. Only months after the breast pump benefit went into effect, consumer demand had soared to the point that she hired an additional seventeen workers and rented space for a call center to handle the national orders coming through the store\u2019s website.\n\nYummy Mummy now has established relationships with twenty-five different insurance plans and ships hundreds of pumps per week. Industry analysts expect this market to grow even more, as news of the benefit spreads. By the end of the decade, the American breast-pump market should reach almost one billion dollars\u2014and the market for the other breastfeeding equipment Yummy Mummy sells, including clothes, bras, creams, and pillows, will be roughly double that.\n\nWith a little help from President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, breastfeeding has become very big business indeed.\n\n*\n\nLike so many lifestyle companies today, from Whole Foods to the Arbor Collective skateboard company, Yummy Mummy is a compelling mixture of conscience and commerce, an enterprise dedicated to doing well by doing good. As a new mother in Manhattan, Cole was committed to breastfeeding but frustrated by the absence of good breastfeeding products and informed advice. Ultimately, that frustration exposed a market opportunity. Her neighborhood needed a place that would cater to, and support, nursing women. In 2009, Cole opened a store she envisioned as a one-stop shop for premium breastfeeding products and a community hub where expectant or new parents could consult well-informed sales associates\u2014including Cole herself, who is now a certified lactation counselor. The store also offers a range of courses. There are standard offerings such as \u201cChildbirth Preparation\u201d and \u201cBaby Safety & CPR\u201d and less standard offerings such as \u201cEat, Drink, Doula.\u201d Billed as a form of \u201cspeed dating,\u201d \u201cEat, Drink, Doula\u201d streamlines parents\u2019 search for a labor coach by introducing them to five to ten prospective doulas in a single session.\n\nThe consumer culture that has grown up around breastfeeding says a great deal about its core demographic, its lifestyle priorities, and the resources it has to dedicate to breastfeeding. As its cheeky name suggests, Yummy Mummy\u2019s mission is not confined to the worthy causes of infant and maternal health and environmental and economic well-being mentioned on its website. In contemporary slang, a yummy mummy is a sexy, glamorous mother\u2014well dressed and, usually, well heeled too. Tabloids use the term to praise celebrity moms like Miranda Kerr and Angelina Jolie for refusing to let motherhood cramp their fabulous lifestyles\u2014and wardrobes. Yummy Mummy too signals that breastfeeding is no longer just for the crunchy earth-mother crowd. Along with breast pumps and vitamins, the store offers all the trendy fashion items and accessories a mother needs to \u201cnurse in style.\u201d Breastfeeding is the new black.\n\nAt this moment in the long history of infant feeding, when maternity and breastfeeding boutiques with whimsical names\u2014like The Pumping Station in Santa Monica or Manhattan\u2019s Upper Breast Side\u2014have multiplied in desirable zip codes around the country, it\u2019s worth remembering that the very idea of \u201cnursing in style\u201d marks a dramatic cultural shift. Not very long ago, the idea of breastfeeding stylishly would have seemed patently absurd. Back in the 1970s, many of the women who revived the practice of breastfeeding in the US were making a political statement, not a fashion statement. They were taking a stand for women\u2019s right to choose how to feed their babies, and against big businesses like Nestl\u00e9 that were peddling formula in poor countries at the expense of babies\u2019 lives. But the mainstreaming of breastfeeding has generated not only countless bad puns\u2014a nursing pillow called My Breast Friend, a postpartum girdle called the Mother Tucker\u2014it has also stimulated a booming market in luxury breastfeeding paraphernalia that the earlier generation of feminists, hippies, and countercultural mavericks could never have imagined.\n\nOne of the most popular electric pumps in the US, manufactured by the Swiss company Medela, is called the Pump in Style. Anyone even remotely familiar with the mechanics of breast pumping will find the idea of pumping in style amusing, at best. Naked from the waist up, with suction cups attached to each swollen nipple as the pump yanks loudly and rhythmically to coax milk into plastic cylinders, not even Heidi Klum could look stylish. But the name is telling nonetheless. It bespeaks an ideal of motherhood that is alluring to many women\u2014and profitable to the many manufacturers and stores that promise ways of achieving it.\n\nThe trappings of contemporary breastfeeding culture\u2014including breast pumps, designer apparel from companies with names like Boob and Glamourmom, and Lactation Cookies\u2014reflect the tangled web of social, political, and commercial interests that sustain it. This new culture\u2014at once wholesome and hip\u2014is partly the result of a hard-won social pride. Many of those who revived breastfeeding in the twentieth century\u2014feminists, hippies, and members of La Leche League included\u2014encountered considerable resistance. And some still do. Sometimes these tensions are generational and subtle. New mothers who breastfeed often report that their own mothers, who didn\u2019t, are critical and defensive.
