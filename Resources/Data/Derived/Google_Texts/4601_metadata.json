They created a homeless 311 hotline for people to call and implemented daily job opportunities.\n\nNow, downtown nonprofit Healthcare for the Homeless is expanding. The organization serves about 7,000 people a year. Its board president, Jose Viramontes, said by adding on it will now be able to help hundreds more.\n\nHealthcare for the Homeless offers medical and mental health services and other basic needs to people like a place to shower, access to computers and clothes.\n\n\n\nViramontes told Action 7 News there just simply aren't enough services for the people on Albuquerque's streets.\n\n\n\nJimmy Lujan, a former client and current center advocate, said if it weren't for Healthcare for the Homeless, he would likely have died already. He said this extra downtown space is desperately needed.\n\n\n\nThe expansion is costing $3.6 million. It is being paid for through a federal grant funded by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "New Mexico News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 21 Sep 2015 07:10:16 MDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Angela Brauer", "og": {"site_name": "KOAT", "description": "The city of Albuquerque is taking another step in helping the homeless.", "title": "Albuquerque nonprofit Healthcare for the Homeless expanding", "url": "http://www.koat.com/news/albuquerque-nonprofit-healthcare-for-the-homeless-expanding/35389026", "image": "http://www.koat.com/image/view/-/35389592/medRes/3/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/sj1bspz/-/img-Non-Profit-Expanding.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.koat.com/news/albuquerque-nonprofit-healthcare-for-the-homeless-expanding/35389026", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "koat://content/article/35389026", "iphone": "koat://content/article/35389026", "googleplay": "koat://content/article/35389026"}, "name": {"ipad": "koat", "iphone": "koat", "googleplay": "koat"}, "id": {"ipad": 505246892, "iphone": 505246892, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.koat"}}, "site": "@KOATLiveUpdates", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "koat://content/article/35389026", "app_name": "koat", "package": "com.hearst.android.koat"}, "ios": {"url": "koat://content/article/35389026", "app_store_id": 505246892, "app_name": "koat"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 141082827976}, "google-site-verification": "UP7Vu_zgjLycilR22TycHT_yNOXa0R6ziN6WRB9F3rw", "keywords": "local albuquerque news, breaking albuquerque news, live albuquerque alerts, local new mexico news", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NEWSABrauer?fref=ts"}, "news_keywords": "local albuquerque news, breaking albuquerque news, live albuquerque alerts, local new mexico news", "description": "The city of Albuquerque is taking another step in helping the homeless."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96f5\"", "article_summary": "Now, downtown nonprofit Healthcare for the Homeless is expanding.\nJimmy Lujan, a former client and current center advocate, said if it weren't for Healthcare for the Homeless, he would likely have died already.\nViramontes told Action 7 News there just simply aren't enough services for the people on Albuquerque's streets.\nHe said this extra downtown space is desperately needed.\nThe city of Albuquerque is taking another step in helping the homeless."}
