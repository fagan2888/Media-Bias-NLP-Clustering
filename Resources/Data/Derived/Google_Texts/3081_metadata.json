(Many sites, including Politico, captured images of the tweet before it was deleted.) Mr. Trump had not issued a statement or sent a tweet marking the anniversary as of midmorning.\n\nThe deleted Trump tweet, as captured in a Politico screenshot.\n\nAt about 11:15 ET, Mr. Trump sent a new tweet, saying \u201clet\u2019s all take a moment to remember all of the heroes from a very tragic day that we cannot let happen again!\u201d\n\nGov. Chris Christie, whose wife worked on Wall Street at the time of the attacks, issued an executive order to lower the flags in New Jersey and mark Friday as \u201cPatriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance,\u201d in contrast.\n\n\u201cLike countless other Americans, the attacks on 9/11 hit especially close to home for Mary Pat and our family and friends, as we mourned for those that we lost and saw unimaginable grief take a toll on victims\u2019 families,\u201d said Mr. Christie, who has recounted stories of losing members of his church to the attacks while campaigning this year.\n\nFormer New York Gov. George Pataki spent much of Thursday and Friday making media appearances to mark the anniversaries. Mr. Pataki, who was governor at the time of the attacks, was slated to make 13 television and radio appearances across the two days, according to his campaign schedule. His statements often included lines about the country being divided.\n\nIt\u2019s tragic that 14 yrs later we are as so divided & our leaders in Washington have forgotten the lessons of #9/11. http://t.co/E3IgjxpXcm \u2014 George E. Pataki (@GovernorPataki) September 11, 2015\n\nMr. Christie and Mr. Pataki have also drawn criticism from victims\u2019 families for campaigning on their response to the terrorist attacks.\n\nSeveral candidates focused on remembering the victims lost in the attacks. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose brother George W. Bush was president at the time, tweeted \u201cWe should all take time today to pay tribute to the victims of 9/11, their families & the troops who\u2019ve kept us safe.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) also focused on the loss of American lives in his statement, as did Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas).\n\nToday we remember the victims of the September 11 terrorist attack: https://t.co/wxup5w1bps #NeverForget pic.twitter.com/8s5mwsXAci \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 11, 2015\n\nWisconsin Gov.
