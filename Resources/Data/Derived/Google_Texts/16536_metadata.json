Things like pellagra, caused by a B3 deficiency and characterized by delusions, diarrhea and \u201cscaly skin sores,\u201d or beriberi, which occurs in the dearth of B1 and can affect either the nervous or cardiovascular system, depending on which type you\u2019ve got.\n\nBut in North America, vitamin deficiencies are a rarity. The nutrition-related health problems we do have to worry about are a lot different: obesity comes to mind, as does diabetes and hypertension. Incredibly enough, argues science writer Catherine Price, it\u2019s the fact that we\u2019ve solved the former that\u2019s contributing to the latter: food companies add synthetic vitamins to otherwise unhealthy fare, preventing us from developing scurvy but also, at the same time, from following truly nutritious diets. \u201cWe use vitamins as insurance policies against whatever else we might (or might not) be eating,\u201d Price writes in \u201cVitamania: Our Obsessive Quest for Nutritional Perfection,\u201d \u201cas if by atoning for our other nutritional sins, vitamins can save us from ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe irony of our vitamin obsession,\u201d Price argues, is that \u201cby encouraging the idea that isolated dietary chemicals hold the key to good health, our vitamania is making us less healthy.\u201d\n\nSalon spoke with Price about this paradox, and about the best way to follow a healthy, vitamin-rich diet. (Hint: it doesn\u2019t involve shopping at GNC.) Our conversation, which follows, has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat are vitamins and, more importantly, what are they not?\n\nI\u2019m glad you started with that question, because it\u2019s something people get confused about all the time. Vitamins are technically only 13 dietary chemicals: A, C, D, E, K and then the eight B vitamins. There\u2019s actually no concrete chemical definition of what a vitamin is; they\u2019re basically these 13 chemicals that we get in small amounts from food to prevent specific deficiencies.\n\n\u201cDietary supplements\u201d is often also used synonymously with \u201cvitamins,\u201d but that\u2019s a much larger category of basically any substance that can be used to supplement your diet. What I found really interesting when I was researching the book is that when I\u2019d say I was writing a book about vitamins, most people would ask questions about things that weren\u2019t vitamins, which really showed how often we confuse those two terms.\n\n\u201cDietary supplements\u201d would be things like herbs?\n\nHerbs, botanicals, basically anything at GNC that\u2019s not one of those chemicals. It\u2019s kind of funny: now, when I go into a drugstore, I try to pay attention to the aisles. What I\u2019ve started to notice is that they\u2019ll have, like, greeting cards and then eye care and then vitamins, but if you look, it\u2019s just an entire aisle\u2019s worth of dietary supplements that they call vitamins.\n\nThere was that big scandal recently where a lot didn\u2019t even contain those herbs and botanicals, either.\n\nIt\u2019s weird because some people are saying they may have used the wrong testing methods, and there may be some validity to that, but it is true that there are huge quality-control problems with the supplement industry. It\u2019s dangerous to apply the aura of health that we associate with vitamins to all these other supplements.\n\nThat aura of health we associate with vitamins, especially when it comes to supplements \u2014 how legitimate is it? Do we over-attribute health benefits to them?\n\nI think the aura of health we give to vitamins, in terms of safety, is pretty legitimate if we\u2019re taking vitamins in the amounts we could get from our diet. A multivitamin is probably not going to hurt people, even if there\u2019s disagreement over whether it will help. We tend to think that if a little is good then more is better, and that\u2019s definitely not true with some of the vitamins like A, where there\u2019s acute toxicity: if you take too much it\u2019ll damage your liver. And then, in general, we just don\u2019t know what the long-term effects are of taking high doses of any of the vitamins over time, and some studies suggest it can be harmful; taking beta carotene was shown to increase the risk of lung cancer, which is unfortunate.\n\nIn the broader idea of health, vitamins really are miraculous to someone with a true deficiency \u2014 for someone with scurvy or rickets, it\u2019s a cure that acts almost like a drug \u2014 but there really aren\u2019t that many benefits that have been proven to be associated with taking higher-than-normal doses of them. I think a lot of the things we assume about both vitamins and supplements aren\u2019t really substantiated by science.\n\nA lot of the misconceptions you highlight in the book, like our adherence to recommended daily allowances (RDAs), seem to have occurred when vitamins jumped from scientists to food marketers.\n\nWe take RDAs as the gospel truth; someone out there knows exactly how much of each vitamin I need. It was interesting to realize that that\u2019s not the case at all. They change a lot. You know those labels on the back of food that tell you how much of your RDA of, say, vitamin E you\u2019re getting? Those are actually based on the recommendations from 1968, and there have been many updates since then. It\u2019s like, wait a second \u2014 this is based on out-of-date information.\n\nYou also argue that when we isolate vitamins in this way, we miss out on the other beneficial properties of the food that naturally contains them. Could you expand on what you mean by that?\n\nFirst of all, when we focus too much on vitamins we lose sight of the fact that there are other things in food to begin with. If you look at a breakfast cereal, for example, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s supposedly 100 percent of your RDA of these 13 chemicals and a bunch of minerals and you think, okay, my bases are covered and it\u2019s fine for me to eat whatever else I want. That does not take into account the fact that your cereal may actually have had a lot more stuff in it before it was refined and turned into cereal, and we don\u2019t understand what the potential benefits are of those other things in the wheat. So that\u2019s one thing.\n\nThere are a lot of chemicals that are now being investigated for potential health benefits. That\u2019s why you see so many headlines about resveratrol in red wine and things like that. The other thing I find particularly fascinating is the idea of how things can work differently in combination than they do when they\u2019re isolated. I mention in the book about broccoli, where giving people the particular chemical in broccoli did not work as well as when it was given to people as broccoli florets. My hypothesis is that there\u2019s some kind of enzyme or other substance in the whole broccoli that helps with the absorption and activation of this chemical, and you don\u2019t get it if you just put it in the pill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Writer Catherine Price tells Salon about America's misguided \"Vitamania\"", "title": "Vitamins are making America less healthy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Writer Catherine Price tells Salon about America's misguided \"Vitamania\"", "title": "Vitamins are making America less healthy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/21/vitamins_are_making_america_less_healthy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/shutterstock_2205126671.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Writer Catherine Price tells Salon about America's misguided \"Vitamania\"", "title": "Vitamins are making America less healthy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/shutterstock_2205126671.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, dietary supplements, Editor's Picks, Food, organic food, public health, Supplements, Sustainable food, Vitamins", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca389\"", "article_summary": "Vitamins are technically only 13 dietary chemicals: A, C, D, E, K and then the eight B vitamins.\nI think a lot of the things we assume about both vitamins and supplements aren\u2019t really substantiated by science.\nThat aura of health we associate with vitamins, especially when it comes to supplements \u2014 how legitimate is it?\nIt\u2019s dangerous to apply the aura of health that we associate with vitamins to all these other supplements.\nI think the aura of health we give to vitamins, in terms of safety, is pretty legitimate if we\u2019re taking vitamins in the amounts we could get from our diet."}
