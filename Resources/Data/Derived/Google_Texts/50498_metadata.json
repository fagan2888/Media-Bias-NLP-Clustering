Paul hits Obamas on minimum wage\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Sen. Rand Paul mocked President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama on Saturday over the reasons they recently gave for wanting their daughters to work minimum wage jobs.\n\nSpeaking at a downtown conference for libertarian and conservative technology types, the Kentucky Republican and prospective 2016 White House contender said he had an \u201copposite\u201d view from the Obamas when it comes to seeing his own sons work delivering pizzas and at call centers.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe minimum wage is a temporary\u201d thing, Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to get started. I see my son come home with his tips. And he\u2019s got cash in his hand and he\u2019s proud of himself. I don\u2019t want him to stop there. But he\u2019s working and he\u2019s understanding the value of work. We shouldn\u2019t disparage that.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The Rand Paul pile on)\n\nPaul was swinging at the Obamas over an answer they gave in a joint interview last month to Parade magazine when asked if they\u2019d like to see their daughters follow in their footsteps in working minimum wage jobs.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. I think every kid needs to get a taste of what it\u2019s like to do that real hard work,\u201d Michelle Obama answered.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for opportunities for them to feel as if going to work and getting a paycheck is not always fun, not always stimulating, not always fair. But that\u2019s what most folks go through every single day,\u201d President Obama added.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what life is,\u201d Michelle Obama added.\n\nPaul\u2019s remarks about minimum wage come at the end of his three-day trip to San Francisco \u2014 he attended a fundraiser Friday for his Senate reelection and political action campaign at a steakhouse overlooking the Bay Bridge and has participated in several round tables and private meetings with technology experts.\n\nPaul is looking to raise money from libertarian-minded tech executives and perhaps recruit talent for a future campaign, something he acknowledged is an uphill climate in such a Democratically-dominated region.\n\n\u201cI come out here and people say we loved President Obama. We\u2019re all for President Obama. We\u2019re from the tech community,\u201d Paul told several hundred attendees at the Lincoln Labs conference. \u201cWhy? Why would you be? He\u2019s not for innovation. He\u2019s not for freedom. He\u2019s for the protectionism crowd. He\u2019s for the crowd that would limit the activities of these companies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Kentucky Republican says the president supports limiting innovative companies.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Kentucky Republican says the president supports limiting innovative companies.", "title": "Paul hits Obamas on minimum wage", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/rand-paul-barack-obama-minimum-wage-109137.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/11/03/130404_rand_paul_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Economy,Rand Paul,Minimum Wage,Business", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/darrensamuelsohn"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd647\"", "article_summary": "Paul hits Obamas on minimum wageSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Sen.
