In a matter of days, the Islamic Republic is back in business.\n\nAs expected, the European Union was flying exploratory trade missions to Tehran months before the accord was signed last July.\n\nBut American businesses aren\u2019t going to party with the Iranians along with the Europeans, Russians, and Chinese. US companies, it turns out, are constrained by lingering restrictions and the still-quarrelsome atmospherics between Washington and Tehran.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Bomb the US Hopes It Never Has to Use Against Iran\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nPlainly enough, we\u2019re watching another case of ideologically driven American policies working against on-the-ground American interests. The Obama administration didn\u2019t invent this contradiction, fair to say, but it has worsened over the past seven years.\n\nEuropeans and the leading non-Western economies bear no such baggage. Here\u2019s what this looks like just two weeks after Iran was formally declared in compliance with the July agreement and sanctions were officially lifted:\n\n\u2022 On Thursday, Iran contracted to buy 118 planes from Airbus Industrie, the cross-border European manufacturer, for $25 billion. The deal also covers pilot training, airport operations, and air-traffic management. Airbus will need U.S. export licenses to cover American-made components. Washington could withhold these, in my estimation, only at the risk of a lot of bad blood across the Atlantic.\n\n\u2022 Sputnik, the Russian news service, quoted a senior civil aviation official Friday saying that Iran will begin \u201cvery soon\u201d to purchase Sukhoi Superjet-100 passenger planes from the Russian manufacturer. There have been reports since last autumn that Sukhoi is also in talks to sell the Iranian air force a fleet of Su-30 fighter jets.\n\nRelated: Kerry Just Confirmed the GOP's Worst Fears About the Iran Deal\n\n\u2022 Daimler, the German vehicle maker, just signed letters of intent with two Iranian firms, Khodro Diesel and the Mammut Group, to resume assembly of Daimler trucks in Iran after a six-year hiatus. Khodro simultaneously signed a $430 million production deal with Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn.\n\n\u2022 A\u00e9roports de Paris and Bouygues, the French construction giant, have agreed to participate with Iranian firms in the construction of a new terminal at the Tehran airport\u2014a $2.8 billion deal\u2014and in renovations and management at the airports in Mashhad and Isfahan, the nation\u2019s second- and third-largest cities.\n\n\u2022 Over the weekend the Financial Times reported that British banking regulators just started an agency to help Iranian institutions\u2014long frozen out of international markets\u2014to reintegrate. This seems a potentially ominous sign given that Treasury continues to bar U.S. banks, which are by tradition essential in global transactions from handling Iranian money.\n\nOther marquee agreements: Danieli, the Italian metal fabricator, has a new contract to supply $6 billion worth of heavy machinery; Saipem, the Italian oil and gas contractor, has a $4 billion deal to bring decrepit Iranian refineries back to life.\n\nMany of these deals were formally concluded during President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s high-profile swing through Italy and France last week. The reformist who led Iran into the nuclear accord finished up with $40 billion in new business commitments.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s How Iran Will Rejoin the Global Financial System\n\n\u201cFrance is available for Iran,\u201d Prime Minister Manuel Valls said during the Rouhani visit. That\u2019s to speak for all of Europe, but then there are non-Western nations.\n\nGiven Russia\u2019s historical advantage by way of a long, complex relationship with Iran, the Sukhoi deals are somewhat expected. Nalco, India\u2019s state-owned aluminum smelter is in talks to build a $2 billion plant for the Iranians, and this, too, is sure to prove a first-of-many.\n\nXi Jinping, the first head of state to visit Iran after sanctions were lifted, returned to Beijing with 17 investment and cooperation agreements, a commitment to increase trade tenfold, to $600 billion, and plans to integrate Iran into its ambitious Silk Road project, which is to connect China to the Middle East and the Mediterranean.\n\nWhere, oh where, are the Americans, you have to ask.\n\nThere are two answers. One, the Obama administration\u2019s insistence that the nuclear pact would bear no wider implications leaves in place many sanctions-related restrictions on business and banking. The imposition of new restrictions because of Iran\u2019s ballistic missile violation forced President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry to make as little as possible of the accord, and American companies now suffer the consequences.\n\nRelated: 4 Reasons to Worry About Iran's Oil Coming to Market\n\nTwo, so long as high-pitched political opposition to the accord continues\u2014not least among Republican presidential aspirants\u2014the investment climate will remain too uncertain. The action in Iran is in oil and gas, heavy industry, and big-ticket capital equipment. CEOs have to know their country \u201cis available to Iran,\u201d as Manuel Valls put it, to take a seat at this table.\n\nIt\u2019s early days in Iran\u2019s return to the global community but we may well be watching shifts of historic significance.\n\nFrom the C.I.A.\u2019s 1953 coup until the 1979 revolution, U.S. influence was dominant in Iran. It looks now as if the Europeans have at least a chance to re-assume something of their prewar position. We\u2019ll have to wait to see.\n\nFar more certainly, Russia and China are now announcing the non-West as a credible alternative source of capital, industrial investment, technology transfer, and manufactures for the Iranians. Over time, this is sure to play out in political, diplomatic, and strategic terms, too.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s hard to say who pounced more quickly, the Iranians or the rest of the world, when", "title": "Why US Companies Are Left Out as Iran Gets Back to Business", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/01/Why-US-Companies-Are-Left-Out-Iran-Gets-Back-Business", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iraq-oil-india_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/01/Why-US-Companies-Are-Left-Out-Iran-Gets-Back-Business", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iraq-oil-india_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@psmith7600"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "It\u2019s hard to say who pounced more quickly, the Iranians or the rest of the world, when", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The reformist who led Iran into the nuclear accord finished up with $40 billion in new business commitments.\nGiven Russia\u2019s historical advantage by way of a long, complex relationship with Iran, the Sukhoi deals are somewhat expected.\nRelated: Here\u2019s How Iran Will Rejoin the Global Financial System\u201cFrance is available for Iran,\u201d Prime Minister Manuel Valls said during the Rouhani visit.\nAs expected, the European Union was flying exploratory trade missions to Tehran months before the accord was signed last July.\nUS companies, it turns out, are constrained by lingering restrictions and the still-quarrelsome atmospherics between Washington and Tehran."}
