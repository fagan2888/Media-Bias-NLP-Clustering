Tribal member and pow wow coordinator Dominica Valencia, with piercing green eyes and a long salt-and-pepper ponytail, attributed the lower numbers to things out of the control of the tribe.\n\n\u201cFor one, it\u2019s hotter than usual,\u201d Valencia said referring to temperatures hovering around triple digits for most of the day. \u201cWe had quite a few cases of dehydration, heat stroke. We had some dogs go down too, unfortunately, they are dropping like flies.\u201d\n\nAlso, this year their pow wow fell on a busy pow wow weekend, and although the tribe offered decent prize money, they still found it difficult to compete with larger casino pow wows and their air-conditioned tents.\n\nA shirtless Oglala Lakota traditional dancer Aaron Ten Bears didn\u2019t have a problem with the heat. He was happy to be at the pow wow despite the forecasted 100-degree plus heat. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see representation of indigenous culture no matter what the conditions,\u201d Ten Bears said. He also chose the Chumash pow wow carefully, noting that it would probably not be as popular, or crowded, as other pow wows that weekend. \u201cA lot of the tribes that have big casinos, and are profitable, hold these... big contest money [pow wows] and the energy is different. The fellowships and the kind of people that come to this pow wow is very positive. I\u2019m not discounting big pow wows, but I like the smaller ones.\u201d\n\nLocated in the Live Oak Camp and not far from the affluent community of Santa Barbara, the pow wow was strewed with diverse and high-end vendors, many jammed in-between towering oaks. Some sold animal parts including fox tails, turtle shells, coyote skins, skunk pelts, and various whole paws affixed claws. Others concentrated on traditional Mexican and Guatemalan garb like knitted tops, blankets and shawls. One stand even specialized in small to medium Aztec and Mayan portraits and embellished historical scenes.\n\nJohn Grable of Whirlwind Beadworks has been coming to the Chumash pow wow for ten years. A fit older man with white locks and a sweat-stained hat, Grable primarily sells beaded embellishments like buckskin knife sheaths, medicine bags, hair-ties and luxury handbags. \u201cThere is a lot of great stuff here in this pow wow,\u201d Grable said. \u201cIt\u2019s good people, good vendors, and I don\u2019t see them as competition. We are all friends and we all do well here.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most popular attraction at the pow wow, beside the dancers themselves, was the tribal-sponsored healing circle. Under a massive oak tree surrounded by bales of hay, Adelina Alva Padilla and a few other spiritual elders used burning tobacco and sage to cleanse and bless approximately 100 visitors. As the interested parties formed a line around the circle, they were given tobacco to pray with and once they finished with the elders, could either keep the small gift or offer it to the Creator in gratitude.\n\nPadilla\u2019s son, Raymond, was in charge of keeping children and adults from wandering outside the sacred healing circle, he also made sure nobody took pictures during his tribe\u2019s holy ritual.\n\n\u201cThis is a cleansing for themselves,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cEither something is ailing them or something is missing spiritually. It\u2019s a prayer. Say you go to church; a priest blesses you when you go to communion -- this is our church.\u201d\n\nJanice Reid of nearby Arroyo Grande was compelled to attend the pow wow after a Lakota co-worker of hers told her about the positive experience she had had at the healing circle. Reid said it was neat to have traditional healers offer this service to the masses. While she was waiting in line and praying with the tobacco, she was overcome with emotion and it brought tears to her eyes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it did for me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am waiting for the Creator to tell me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just east of Lake Cachuma in Santa Barbara County, Calif., down a dusty road littered with tall spla", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/07/chumash-inter-tribal-pow-wow-offers-healing-and-high-end-vendors-157232", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/chumash_powwow6.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Chumash Inter-Tribal Pow Wow Offers Healing and High-end Vendors"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-10-07T14:50-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/07/chumash-inter-tribal-pow-wow-offers-healing-and-high-end-vendors-157232", "dc": {"title": "Chumash Inter-Tribal Pow Wow Offers Healing and High-end Vendors"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Chumash Inter-Tribal Pow Wow Offers Healing and High-end Vendors"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e28\"", "article_summary": "John Grable of Whirlwind Beadworks has been coming to the Chumash pow wow for ten years.\nHe also chose the Chumash pow wow carefully, noting that it would probably not be as popular, or crowded, as other pow wows that weekend.\nDown from 325 dancers last year, this year\u2019s pow wow only attracted 100 female and 75 male dancers.\nHe was happy to be at the pow wow despite the forecasted 100-degree plus heat.\nWe had some dogs go down too, unfortunately, they are dropping like flies.\u201dAlso, this year their pow wow fell on a busy pow wow weekend, and although the tribe offered decent prize money, they still found it difficult to compete with larger casino pow wows and their air-conditioned tents."}
