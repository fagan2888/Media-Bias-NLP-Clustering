Steep penalties

Health care providers have always been worried about liability under the False Claims Act (FCA). The FCA is a civil liability statute imposing stiff penalties for knowingly submitting false bills to federal government payors, including bills for health care services submitted to Medicare and Medicaid. The FCA authorizes penalties of triple the amount of the government's damages, plus additional penalties per claim. In-house lawyers should have enough understanding of the FCA to recognize potential issues if your business has anything to do with claims for health care services.
