You probably don't even want to think about it, but tax time is almost upon us, and there are plenty of changes taking place this year.

CPA Lloyd Leuthner joined Anchor Tom Zalaski to talk about those changes. They discussed the biggest changes people can expect this year, changes related to the Affordable Care Act, why it's a good idea to start working on your taxes now, and why people have a little extra time this year to file their taxes.



If you have tax questions, you're invited to call Lloyd at 920-468-1967.
