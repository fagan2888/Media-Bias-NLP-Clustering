An immigrant is not the same as an illegal immigrant.\u201d\n\nThese days, Magnon sometimes feels she has more in common with Americans elsewhere across the country than with Latino families here in Texas, and that started when she told people she was voting for Donald Trump.\n\nElection 2016 | Live coverage on Trail Guide | April 26 primary election results | Track the delegate race | Sign up for the newsletter\n\n\u201cThey bash you,\u201d said Gina Gil, who\u2019s also joined a small but enthusiastic group of people here on the border who like what Trump has to say \u2014 especially about immigration, a subject that, here on the banks of the Rio Grande, they feel they know as much about as anybody.\n\n\u201cI find it insulting when people say people who follow Trump are uneducated, unintelligent,\u201d said Magnon.\n\n\u201cTe aventaste!\u201d Gil exclaimed. \u201cYou hit it.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, only a small minority of Latinos have backed Trump, and even here in Texas, a plurality of Latino Republicans voted for home-grown U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who won the March 1 primary with 44% of the overall vote to Trump\u2019s 27%. Now as ever, most Latinos vote Democratic, and in Texas, where Latinos make up more than a quarter of the electorate, up to 71% of them backed Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls.\n\nIt was here on the border that Trump scored his biggest Texas victories, capturing Laredo\u2019s Webb County, which is 95.3% Latino, and Zapata County next door (94%), as well as Terrell County (49 17.4% Latino Hispanic) and Hudspeth County (78%), which are farther west.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the hardworking people,\u201d said Miriam Cepeda, 24, a history major at the nearby University of Texas-Pan American who is leading Trump\u2019s campaign in the Rio Grande Valley east of Laredo. What she hears, she says, is a lot of resentment aimed at undocumented immigrants who receive government services. \u201cThose that pay the taxes and do what they\u2019re supposed to say, \u2018Why do I have to pay?\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump supporter Patti Magnon Ilana Panich-Linsman / For The Times Trump supporter Patti Magnon of Laredo, Texas, began life across the border in its Mexican sister city, Nuevo Laredo.

(Ilana Panich-Linsman / For The Times) (Ilana Panich-Linsman / For The Times)\n\nMagnon and Gill voted for Trump in the Texas primary, plan to vote for him in the general election, and are waging their own kind of ad hoc citizens\u2019 campaign, praising him on radio shows and online, recruiting friends and family.\n\nThe two women met last summer when Trump came here, to the Southwest border\u2019s third-most populous city, behind El Paso and San Diego.\n\nMagnon drove her 7-year-old daughter, Allie, to the small local airport to see the real estate magnate. They were greeted in this majority Democratic, heavily Mexican American town by a crowd of opponents chanting into megaphones: \u201cDump Trump!\u201d\n\nSee the most-read stories this hour >>\n\nBoth Magnon, 44, and Gil, 49, are former Democrats \u2014 working mothers with community college educations who say they\u2019re alarmed about welfare fraud, illegal immigration and the rising costs of healthcare. Magnon almost lost her health insurance when Obamacare took effect. Gil seethed at paying an $800 penalty under the new federal healthcare law, but insurance would have cost even more.\n\nTrump promised to run the country like a business and repeal Obamacare. They didn\u2019t think he was racist when he promised to build a bigger border wall to keep out Mexican \u201crapists.\u201d They thought he was right \u2014 and were delighted to find that others around town agreed with them.\n\n\u201cI was surprised other people in Laredo think like I do,\u201d Magnon said.\n\nTrump's Texas\n\nGil\u2019s father was an electrician, her mother a day-care worker. Raised on the south side of town near the river, she was a cheerleader in high school but was pregnant with the first of five children at age 16. She helped her husband start a bakery. But the union was not a happy one, and Gil eventually left, working multiple jobs, training as a paralegal, buying rental properties and businesses.\n\nThe tough-talking single mother relied on undocumented Mexican migrants to watch her children and run her businesses \u2014 but at least none of them were on welfare, she says. \u201cI could never have done it on my own,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not Wonder Woman. You have to keep your boat afloat.\u201d\n\nShe says she spent many years working so hard that the only time she saw her children was when she drove by her house and waved at them through the front window.\n\nGil still lives near the Rio Grande. Tooling around in her custom 2015 white Audi recently, she pointed to homes and businesses she had bought, all for cash. When she stopped to pick up her blood pressure medication, $71.75 for a month\u2019s supply, she pointed to the button for the state welfare benefit, \u201cLone Star,\u201d for those who are receiving state assistance.\n\n\u201cDo I press \u2018Lone Star\u2019? Ha!\u201d she said, then paid out of her own pocket.\n\nGil called a local bilingual radio show recently to praise Trump\u2019s promises to crack down on welfare cheats.\n\n\u201cTrump is right. Just because he\u2019s a billionaire \u2014 well, he worked hard for what he has,\u201d she said.\n\nUnless someone stops the flow of illegal immigration and stabilizes the economy, Gil worries, \u201cOur kids are going to be working like psychos for the deadbeats.\u201d\n\nPatti Magnon with daughter Allie Ilana Panich-Linsman / For The Times Patti Magnon, with daughter Allie, 7, in Laredo, Texas.
