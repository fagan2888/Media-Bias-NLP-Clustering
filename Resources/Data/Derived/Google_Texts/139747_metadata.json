Sure, the majority of them grow early in life, but some areas of the brain continue to grow them into adulthood and beyond \u2014 a process called neurogenesis. The hippocampus is one of these areas, and it\u2019s also among the most important areas of the brain, playing roles in memory, emotion, and learning. But as we grow older, a number of factors compete with neurogenesis and kill brain cells. No, they\u2019re not smoking weed and drinking alcohol; instead, they\u2019re a little more common than you might expect. Here are seven of them.\n\nLosing Sleep\n\nThe National Sleep Foundation recommends most adults get between seven and nine hours of sleep every night, and for good reason. This gives our brains sufficient time to move through the sleep stages, which gradually become deeper, and end in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep before starting all over again.\n\nGetting to REM sleep is important because it\u2019s during this time that the brain is working hard both to keep us asleep \u2014 by causing paralysis in limbs during dream states, for example \u2014 while also activating brain regions responsible for learning. This is when memories are consolidated and stored, and energy levels are replenished. With that said, it\u2019s not surprising that someone who consistently loses sleep will have a harder time concentrating, making decisions, and engaging themselves in both learning and social situations.\n\nA study from last year shows how these effects fall in line with brain damage; it found the neurons in the energy-producing region of the brain called the locus coeruleus (LC) began to die from extended wakefulness. Without these cells to produce energy, our bodies are unable to function properly the next day. Another study found sleep deprivation could cause shrinkage in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, especially in adults over 60 years old, suggesting that sleep becomes ever more important as we age.\n\nSmoking\n\nOver 42 million adults smoke cigarettes in the United States; that\u2019s nearly one in five people. And with each drag, they\u2019re inhaling over 7,000 toxic chemicals, 69 of which have been shown to cause cancer. Smoking causes a whole range of other diseases, too, from chronic bronchitis to emphysema, to heart disease and stroke.\n\nStroke, in itself, has been shown to cause brain damage, but with all these toxins, there\u2019s bound to be at least one that specifically affects the brain, right? It turns out there are several of them. In a 2002 study from France\u2019s National Institute for Health and Medical Research, scientists found nicotine-addicted rats generated 50 percent fewer neurons in the hippocampus\u2019s dentate gyrus. Those that took higher doses of nicotine also experienced the most brain cell death. If that isn\u2019t bad enough, another study from India found a compound in cigarettes, called NNK, could cause an exaggerated response in the brain\u2019s white blood cells, forcing them to attack healthy brain cells as well.\n\nResearchers from the rat study believe their findings could explain why smokers who try to quit experience short-term cognitive problems. \u201cIt could be that while they are smoking, the stimulant effect of nicotine masks the loss of neuronal plasticity,\u201d study author Pier Piazza told New Scientist. \u201cWhen they stop smoking, these deficiencies remain.\u201d\n\nDehydration\n\nThe common misconception that alcohol will kill brain cells comes from the fact that it triggers a whole range of body processes. One of these is \u201cbreaking the seal\u201d; that moment when we have to use the bathroom after downing a couple of beers, and revisiting it more often than usual for the rest of the night. As we drink more, the alcohol suppresses the hormone vasopressin, which is responsible for retaining water in the body. This makes our bodies unable to hold our urine in, and one unfortunate result is dehydration \u2014 which also happens to be the reason we get hangovers.\n\nConsidering 75 percent of the brain is made of water, it would behoove anyone drinking to couple their vodka-cranberry with a large glass of water. Actually, we\u2019re going to recommend that glass of water being around at all times of the day, because mild dehydration can occur after only four hours. Once it starts getting bad, it can cause the brain to swell (cerebral edema) as the body tries to pull more water into the cells \u2014 some of these may eventually rupture. Seizures aren\u2019t uncommon either, as electrolyte imbalances cause neurons to miscommunicate. All of this causes the brain to work harder to function properly, which in turn can cause it to shrink, a 2011 study found.\n\nStress\n\nMost of us can agree there\u2019s been that one day or week where everything seemed to be going wrong. Trying to juggle so many problems is stressful. But because it\u2019s the body\u2019s way of rising to the challenge, it often helps us with improved concentration and focus. However, the body can only take so much of it, and after a certain point, it\u2019ll backfire, throwing off concentration, causing irritability, and killing our energy.\n\nAll of this can be blamed on the stress hormone cortisol, which is released from the adrenal gland during stressful moments. The hormone activates several biological processes with the intention of diverting energy to where it\u2019s most needed; digestion, for example, stops while heart rate increases.\n\nIn people with chronic stress, however, cortisol levels can be so excessive that the brain ends up producing more myelin-producing cells and fewer neurons, a study from last year found. Myelin is the fatty material that makes up the brain\u2019s white matter and quickens communication between neurons. But such changes in the brain, the researchers said, may contribute to a person\u2019s risk of mental health illnesses like schizophrenia and anxiety disorder.\n\nCocaine and Other Narcotics\n\nWhile marijuana won\u2019t kill brain cells, other narcotics on the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s drug schedule list certainly will. Drugs like cocaine, methamphetamine, bath salts (synthetic cathinones), and MDMA (ecstasy or molly) all activate the brain\u2019s reward systems, triggering the release of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.\n\nWhile triggering all these neurotransmitters can cause a euphoric high and make the user especially active, they also damage the neurons responsible for releasing the feel-good chemicals. As a result, the user can develop a tolerance to the drug, which forces them to take more over time to achieve the same high \u2014 further damaging the cells or even killing them. In a 2003 study on cocaine, researchers looked at brain samples from 35 deceased cocaine users and compared them to the brains of 35 nonusers. They found dopamine levels were far lower in those who had used cocaine, especially in those who were depressed as well, suggesting that there were fewer dopamine-producing neurons.\n\nResearchers believe that this damage to brain cells is what leads to drug addiction, as the user finds it progressively harder to feel good on his own.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "smoking, cocaine, and, 3, other, ways, you, can, kill, your, brain, cells", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Although the brain can produce new brain cells, there are many ways we kill them.", "title": "5 Ways You're Killing Your Brain Cells", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/smoking-cocaine-and-3-other-ways-you-can-kill-your-brain-cells-325920", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/16/brain-cell-death.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although the brain can produce new brain cells, there are many ways we kill them.", "title": "5 Ways You're Killing Your Brain Cells", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/smoking-cocaine-and-3-other-ways-you-can-kill-your-brain-cells-325920", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/16/brain-cell-death.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/16/brain-cell-death.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-03-17T07:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-17T07:00:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Although the brain can produce new brain cells, there are many ways we kill them."}, "article_summary": "Cocaine and Other NarcoticsWhile marijuana won\u2019t kill brain cells, other narcotics on the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s drug schedule list certainly will.\nBut as we grow older, a number of factors compete with neurogenesis and kill brain cells.\nContrary to popular belief, we don\u2019t have a limited supply of brain cells.\n\u201cWhen they stop smoking, these deficiencies remain.\u201dDehydrationThe common misconception that alcohol will kill brain cells comes from the fact that it triggers a whole range of body processes.\nStroke, in itself, has been shown to cause brain damage, but with all these toxins, there\u2019s bound to be at least one that specifically affects the brain, right?"}
