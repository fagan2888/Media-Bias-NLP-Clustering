(Photo: ~Courtesy of Jaffe Communications Inc.)\n\nROSELLE With nearly 200 members of the borough\u2019s Hispanic and Haitian communities in attendance, Roselle Borough Council on Wednesday night unanimously introduced an ordinance that, once passed, will launch a communitywide identification card program.\n\nThe measure represents an ongoing effort to address the needs of the borough\u2019s immigrant community, Mayor Christine Dansereau said. The program, which is expected to be ratified on a second ordinance reading Oct. 21, would produce and issue municipal identification cards for all Roselle residents, and particularly for the borough\u2019s fast-growing immigrant community.\n\n\u201cThis ID program will further level the playing field because it allows for all residents to have access to municipal amenities, with an official form of identification,\u201d said Dansereau, adding, \u201cRoselle welcomes you.\u201d\n\nMembers of council and the public also highlighted the accomplishments and vision of the borough\u2019s Office of Hispanic-Latino Affairs, a key organizer in the municipal ID program.\n\n\"Today marks an important step forward for Roselle,\" said German Vergara, member of Make the Road New Jersey, a Union County-based community organization.\n\n\n\n\"Municipal IDs will give all Roselle residents, including immigrants, seniors and students, access to ID to open bank accounts, enter government buildings and feel comfortable approaching law enforcement,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cMunicipal ID programs are a valuable resource for many disenfranchised residents,\u201d said Kevin Brown, 32BJ vice president and NJ state director. \u201cThese programs ensure all residents, including the undocumented, have proof of residency and can get access to municipal amenities. I applaud Roselle elected officials for joining a growing number of municipalities that have embraced all of its residents by proposing a municipal ID program.\u201d\n\nIn Union County, the Hispanic population increased by more than 12 percent between 2010 and 2014, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The surge in the Hispanic population has offset the decline of other demographics in many areas.\n\nFor information about Roselle\u2019s Office of Hispanic-Latino Affairs and for additional related resources, call 908-259-3038 or email his-lat@boroughofroselle.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1F6FvcT", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Roselle Borough Council Wednesday night unanimously introduced an ordinance that, once passed, will launch community-wide identification card program.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Roselle Borough Council Wednesday night unanimously introduced an ordinance that, once passed, will launch community-wide identification card program.", "title": "Roselle endorses municipal ID cards", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/union-county/2015/09/18/roselle-endorses-municipal-id-cards/72398256/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Roselle Borough Council Wednesday night unanimously introduced an ordinance that, once passed, will launch community-wide identification card program.", "title": "Roselle endorses municipal ID cards", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/57f7f70f0ac2caae728fb8d9174c2db77d94dd27/c=0-0-3456-3456&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/18/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635781733293717060-RoselleID.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Roselle, ID"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2333\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMunicipal ID programs are a valuable resource for many disenfranchised residents,\u201d said Kevin Brown, 32BJ vice president and NJ state director.\n\"Municipal IDs will give all Roselle residents, including immigrants, seniors and students, access to ID to open bank accounts, enter government buildings and feel comfortable approaching law enforcement,\u201d he added.\nThe program, which is expected to be ratified on a second ordinance reading Oct. 21, would produce and issue municipal identification cards for all Roselle residents, and particularly for the borough\u2019s fast-growing immigrant community.\nThe Roselle Borough Council on Wednesday night unanimously introduced an ordinance that, once passed, will launch a communitywide identification card program.\n\u201cThese programs ensure all residents, including the undocumented, have proof of residency and can get access to municipal amenities."}
