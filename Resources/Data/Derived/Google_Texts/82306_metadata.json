Representatives of the union local could not be reached for comment.\n\nOn Thursday, a 2,000-member UAW local for a stamping plant in Sterling Heights, Mich., rejected the contract, according to postings on Facebook, and 80 percent of production workers at a 1,300-member union local for a Trenton, Michigan engine plant rejected the proposed deal, the local's website said.\n\nKristin Dziczek, labor analyst at the Center for Automotive Research, said the UAW would have several options if the contract is rejected, including going back to the negotiating table with Fiat Chrysler, or moving on to try to get a deal with Ford Motor Co. or General Motors. A strike of some or all Fiat Chrysler UAW members is also possible, she said.\n\nBrian Rothenberg, a spokesman for the UAW, said the union would make no comment on the ratification until voting is complete at all plants. A Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe UAW on Sept. 14 extended existing contracts with the Detroit Three automakers, including Ford and GM when the four-year deals reached in 2011 expired.\n\nThe UAW and Fiat Chrysler agreed to a tentative contract on Sept. 15. Under the proposed contract, the gap between the highest-paid Fiat Chrysler first-tier plant worker and the lowest-paid second-tier would close to $8 per hour from the current $12 per hour.\n\nFiat Chrysler has the lowest per-hour labor costs among the Detroit Three, because it has the highest share of the lower paid, second-tier workers, 45 percent compared to about 28 percent at Ford and about 20 percent at GM.", "article_metadata": {"timeCrawled": "20160527_06:08:10", "description": "The proposed four-year labor agreement between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and the UAW encountered strong opposition from rank-and-file union members in early ratification voting.", "title": "Fiat Chrysler deal meets opposition in early UAW voting", "og": {"site_name": "Automotive News", "description": "The proposed four-year labor agreement between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and the UAW encountered strong opposition from rank-and-file union members in early ratification voting.", "title": "Fiat Chrysler deal meets opposition in early UAW voting", "url": "http://www.autonews.com/article/20150926/OEM01/150929840/fiat-chrysler-deal-meets-opposition-in-early-uaw-voting", "image": {"width": 450, "identifier": "http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CA/20150926/OEM01/150929840/AR/0/czxCZC.jpg", "height": 298}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The proposed four-year labor agreement between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and the UAW encountered strong opposition from rank-and-file union members in early ratification voting.", "title": "Fiat Chrysler deal meets opposition in early UAW voting", "image": {"src": "http://www.autonews.com/assets/jpg/icon/an-button.jpg"}, "site": "@Automotive_News", "card": "summary", "account_id": 14628959}, "tags": "Fiat", "year": 2015, "published_at": "2015-9-26", "summary": "The proposed four-year labor agreement between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and the UAW encountered strong opposition from rank-and-file union members in early ratification voting.", "url": "http://www.autonews.com/article/20150926/OEM01/150929840", "fb": {"page_id": 299833160103483, "app_id": 230521947020498}, "content_type": "article", "published_date": "2015-9-26", "msvalidate.01": "559498F855972429551A034E0ACBDDBE", "google-site-verification": "PJrncMiSNhK_CeZMhQkriKmQfa_KlBBc3DGosYSmHJY", "distribution": "global", "y_key": "b309030fed32c7b0", "image": "http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CA/20150926/OEM01/150929840/AR/0/czxCZC.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "categoryName": "Manufacturing"}, "article_summary": "A strike of some or all Fiat Chrysler UAW members is also possible, she said.\nRelated Stories UAW-FCA deal dooms Tier 1 if passedDETROIT (Reuters) -- The proposed four-year labor agreement between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and the UAW encountered strong opposition from rank-and-file union members in early ratification voting.\nThe UAW and Fiat Chrysler agreed to a tentative contract on Sept. 15.\nA Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman declined to comment.\nBut the pact, which would narrow but not close a pay gap between veteran workers and new hires, has run into trouble at some large Fiat Chrysler plants."}
