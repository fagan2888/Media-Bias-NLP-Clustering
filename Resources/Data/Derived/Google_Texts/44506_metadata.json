Officials said the terminations a few weeks before Medicare\u2019s Dec. 7 enrollment deadline may not have given seniors enough time to find new doctors, choose a different plan or rejoin traditional Medicare, which does not restrict beneficiaries to a limited network of providers.\n\nThe proposals would give beneficiaries more than 30 days\u2019 notice of network changes and providers at least 60 days\u2019 notice of a contract termination. Even Medicare officials need more notice \u2014 \u201cno less than 90 days\u201d \u2014 so they can ensure that the remaining providers \u201cwill continue to meet required network standards.\u201d Officials are soliciting suggestions on how plans should prove that their reconfigured networks are adequate.\n\nThe doctor terminations sparked protests to Medicare and UnitedHealthcare from patients, as well as doctor groups across the country, state officials and members of Congress.\n\nNearly 16 million people, about a third of Medicare beneficiaries, are enrolled in the private Medicare Advantage plans, which are an alternative to traditional Medicare. The government reimburses insurers to care for these seniors.\n\nAlthough the announcement does not name any insurance companies, officials prefaced the proposals by writing, \u201cRecent significant mid-year changes to MAOs\u2019 [Medicare Advantage organizations\u2019] provider networks have prompted CMS to reexamine its current guidance on these requirements and to consider augmenting such guidance in response to such changes.\u201d\n\nMedicare Advantage rules allow beneficiaries to change plans if they move out of the coverage area or for other special reasons, but not if they lose their doctors or hospitals. Otherwise, they can switch plans once a year, during the fall seven-week enrollment period. Since most beneficiaries are locked into their plans, CMS is considering whether to restrict insurers\u2019 ability to drop doctors during the plan year.\n\nIf insurers expect to drop providers in the coming year, they should say so in the letter highlighting changes that they are required to send to plan members every year before the open enrollment season. CMS would also add \u201crequired language\u201d to the letter explaining patients\u2019 rights in the event that network providers leave the plan during the plan year.\n\nFinal rules are expected as early as April 7.\n\n\u201cThese are exactly the things we talked about with CMS back in the fall,\u201d said Mark Thompson, executive director of the Fairfield County (Conn.) Medical Association, which, along with the Hartford County Medical Association, sued UnitedHealthcare to block the terminations. The American Medical Association and 35 state medical associations and doctor advocacy groups filed legal papers in support of the doctors.\n\n\u201cSomeone was paying attention and listening to us,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nA federal judge in December issued an injunction halting the cancellations in those counties, and a panel of three federal appeals court judges in February upheld that decision until the doctors had time to challenge their terminations before independent arbitrators.\n\nRepresentatives for UnitedHealthcare and Humana, the two leading Medicare Advantage insurers, declined to answer questions or provide copies of their comments to CMS related to the proposals. UnitedHealthcare said earlier that the cancellations were partly the result of cuts in federal reimbursements required by the Affordable Care Act and also part of an effort to improve quality and reduce costs.\n\nHowever, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, which represents more than 1,300 health insurers, warned CMS that the proposed rules could hinder insurers\u2019 contract negotiations with providers, which \u201coccur throughout the year\u201d and could also weaken enforcement of contract terms that allow for provider terminations. In addition, notifying beneficiaries of potential terminations before contracts may be successfully completed \u201cwould be unnecessarily disruptive,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u2014 Kaiser Health News\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.
