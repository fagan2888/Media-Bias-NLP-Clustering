He\u2019s on the red team in this video, with the black Avalanche helmet (no number) and black Avalanche breezers. Just look for the biggest guy on the ice, and a left shot.\n\nI missed Zadorov after the skate, mostly because I was talking to others and the entire locker-room facilities at Magness Arena are being rebuilt from the June flooding of the building. Many of the guys were undressing in a curtained-off area beside the Zamboni room, with no showers. Others were doing so in the neighboring rink, Joy Burns Arena. The Murray Armstrong Hockey Complex and the basketball locker rooms are all being re-done.\n\nBut good showing Tuesday at DU, for Day 1 of the camp that continues through Friday, from 10-11:30 a.m. each day. Twenty-six guys scrimmaged for the last 45 minutes of the skate, including incoming DU freshman Troy Terry of Highlands Ranch and a handful of veteran Pioneers. The amateur guys can\u2019t be on the ice during the first 45 minutes, when DU coach Jim Montgomery and his staff conduct drills.\n\nThe NHLers include former DU stars Paul Stastny (St. Louis Blues), Tyler Bozak (Maple Leafs), Matt Donovan (Sabres) and Nick Shore (Kings). The former Avalanche include Kyle Quincey (Red Wings), John-Michael Liles (Hurricanes) and Peter Budaj (free agent). DU\u2019s 2015 graduating class was well represented with Josiah Didier, Matt Tabrum, Ty Loney, Zac Larraza, among others, and former DU recruit Cal Foote \u2014 Adam\u2019s oldest son, who is heading to the WHL\u2019s Kelowna Rockets \u2014 was probably the youngest skater. Cal Foote turns 17 in December.\n\nThe camp is open to the public \u2014 and free.\n\nI\u2019m writing a Stastny story for Wednesday. We talked for a while, including his take on Zadorov (which will be in Wednesday\u2019s story). Here\u2019s a quick Q&A for this space:\n\nA year after leaving Colorado to sign with St. Louis, you must be better settled? \u201cThis summer and going into next season, we\u2019re a lot more comfortable. You see that in all sports. You move forward. You still have three or four of your best friends on your old team, but for us going forward we\u2019re just a lot more comfortable. Last summer was just hectic with bachelor parties, weddings, and July 1 (free agency). There was a lot of traveling and this summer is a lot more low-key.\u201d\n\nWhy did the Avalanche struggle so much last season? \u201cThat Western Conference is so tough. If you\u2019re not consistent for 75 out of 82 games and you go without points, you don\u2019t make the playoffs. It\u2019s crazy that six or seven teams finished with over 100 points. It seems every team gets better in the Western Conference, no matter what. The good teams get better and the bad teams make moves and play better hockey. That Western Conference just keeps getting deeper and forces you to be good day in and day out.\u201d\n\nYour take on the Ryan O\u2019Reilly trade to Buffalo?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s business. Look at the Brandon Saad situation with Chicago. They win the Cup and say Saad will be there forever, a Blackhawk for life. Then five days (later) he gets traded. Both parties have to look at their interest \u2026 O\u2019Reilly is a very smart player. We\u2019ll see how it turns out.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t appear like you were the leader, on the ice and off, in St. Louis, as you were with Colorado. Fair?\n\n\u201cBy the end of the year I started speaking up. The first year with a new team, you kind of fly under the radar and be quiet. But as you get older you have to speak up. You want to win. If you see something go wrong, you\u2019re not going to sit there and not say anything. (Leadership), it\u2019s another attribute and ability that you\u2019re good at, and feel like you\u2019re not being used for it and kind of hindering yourself and not being involved as much as you should be. But at same time when you come to a new team, especially a team that\u2019s good and has been built from the bottom, they already have their leaders.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Buffalo,Colorado Avalanche,DU hockey,NHL,Nikita Zadorov,Paul Stastny,Ryan O'Reilly", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Avalanche defenseman Nikita Zadorov is skating in the University of Denver's annual pro alumni camp.", "title": "Nikita Zadorov skating in DU's annual pro alumni camp", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/08/11/avalanche-d-nikita-zadorov-skating-in-dus-annual-pro-alumni-camp/21925/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2010/04/paul-stastny-2010-player-colorado-avalanche.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Avalanche defenseman Nikita Zadorov is skating in the University of Denver's annual pro alumni camp.", "title": "Nikita Zadorov skating at University of Denver\u2019s annual pro alumni camp", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/08/11/avalanche-d-nikita-zadorov-skating-in-dus-annual-pro-alumni-camp/21925/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2010/04/paul-stastny-2010-player-colorado-avalanche.jpg", "creator": "@mikechambers", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Avalanche defenseman Nikita Zadorov is skating in the University of Denver's annual pro alumni camp."}, "article_summary": "Avalanche defenseman Nikita Zadorov is participating in the University of Denver\u2019s annual pro alumni camp at Magness Arena.\nBut good showing Tuesday at DU, for Day 1 of the camp that continues through Friday, from 10-11:30 a.m. each day.\nThat Western Conference just keeps getting deeper and forces you to be good day in and day out.\u201dYour take on the Ryan O\u2019Reilly trade to Buffalo?\n(Leadership), it\u2019s another attribute and ability that you\u2019re good at, and feel like you\u2019re not being used for it and kind of hindering yourself and not being involved as much as you should be.\nHe\u2019s on the red team in this video, with the black Avalanche helmet (no number) and black Avalanche breezers."}
