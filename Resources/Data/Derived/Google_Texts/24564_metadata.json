That\u2019s turning out not to be the case with Blue Cross coverage in Monterey and other counties in the state. Mike in Carmel Valley asked, \u201cDear Jon, why doesn\u2019t my doctor take my Blue Cross insurance? He did last year.\u201d What I found out is disturbing for many patients.\n\nI called Blue Cross and spoke to company representative Darrel Ng, and what I\u2019m told is that many with Blue Cross before the Affordable Care Act had a different network of doctors. The reimbursements for doctors were higher last year as well. When the ACA went into force this year, those Blue Cross customers who signed up through Covered California were transferred to ACA-compliant plans. Ng says these customers received a letter in the mail that this would be happening.\n\nWhat occurred with the transfer was essentially moving patients to a new and smaller network of doctors. These doctors have signed a contract saying they\u2019ll accept the new rate structure from Blue Cross, which is a lower reimbursement than other plans Blue Cross offers. Some of these doctors refused to sign the deal and were left off the Covered California Blue Cross plan. That means patients were left holding the bag.\n\nNg also said that Blue Cross did a survey of customers and the No. 1 factor with these customers was lower-price health insurance. So to achieve this, Blue Cross lowered it's pricing for Covered California and also lowered it's coverage, which forced the lower reimbursements for doctors. This turn of events forced many doctors on the Central Coast to opt out of signing on with Anthem Blue Cross\u2019 ACA complaint plan.\n\nBlue Cross spokesperson Darrel Ng was quick to point out that the State Insurance Commissioner has approved the rate structure for the ACA-compliant Blue Cross plans. Even so, one of my sources in the health care field told me that 46 doctors in Monterey opted out of taking the Covered California-offered Anthem Blue Cross plan.\n\nSo if you want to find a doctor that takes your Blue Cross plan, call the number on your health insurance card or go online with the Blue Cross web tool.\n\nIf you still want to see your same doctor and he/she doesn\u2019t take your Anthem Blue Cross plan, the doctor may see you as an \u201cout of network\u201d patient at a higher cost to you. Or you could pay cash at a negotiated rate with your doctor.", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "You would think that if you sign up for insurance through the health exchange known as Covered California that your doctor would take your insurance.
