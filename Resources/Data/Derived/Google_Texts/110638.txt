An Arlington Sam Houston High School sophomore died after a car accident Sunday.

Grand Prairie police said Caitlyn Carlile, 16, was killed after the driver of the Ford Taurus she was in did not stop at a stop sign at westbound SW 14th Street and the southbound frontage road of Highway 161. An SUV struck the passenger side of the car about 2:53 p.m.

The driver of the Taurus, Caitlyn’s mother, Ann Carlile, 42, and front seat passenger, Brittany Carlile, 19, were transported to Medical Center of Arlington with non-life threatening injuries. Caitlyn was also taken to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at 3:18 p.m.

The SUV driver was not injured.

No charges have been filed yet against Ann Carlile, said police spokesman Sgt. Eric Hansen. Hansen said it is still early in the investigation and they will have to consult with the district attorney’s office.

The accident was the city’s 19th traffic fatality of the year.
