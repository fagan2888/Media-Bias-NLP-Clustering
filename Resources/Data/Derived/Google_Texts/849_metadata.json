Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, who in December asked Stenehjem for his legal opinion.\n\nThe issue stems from the state\u2019s selection of a benchmark health insurance plan for coverage sold under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace, the so-called \u201cmetallic plans,\u201d with gold, silver and bronze coverage tiers.\n\nNorth Dakota\u2019s benchmark plan, recommended by Hamm and approved by federal officials, does not require coverage for residential treatment of adults for substance abuse.\n\nAs a result, Blue Cross Blue Shield had to \u201cadjust to the benchmark plan,\u201d Dinneen said in her statement, reducing the level of coverage under its \u201cgrandfathered plans.\u201d\n\nKurt Snyder, executive director of Heartview Foundation in Bismarck, which provides residential treatment for substance abuse, said the North Dakota Blues\u2019 traditional plans dropped two of three levels of adult residential treatment for substance abuse.\n\nThe new metallic plans sold through the marketplace provide no adult substance abuse coverage, nor does the Sanford Health Plan, adopted as North Dakota\u2019s benchmark plan, Snyder said.\n\nAs a result, he said, many adults who need residential treatment for substance abuse are going without coverage, which can mean they seek treatment in emergency rooms or end up in jail, he said.\n\nBenefits for adult residential treatment for substance abuse will be required of all plans in North Dakota beginning Jan. 1, Hamm said, including both \u201cmetallic\u201d and \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans.\n\nChanges in benefits and premiums can only be made once a year, under federal law, and the deadline already had passed when plans had to be approved for 2014, Hamm said.\n\nBenefits and premiums can\u2019t be increased in the middle of a plan year, because that is not allowed by law and because increasing coverage would add costs not covered by premiums, he said.\n\nWhether the traditional Blue Cross Blue Shield plans lose their \u201cgrandfather\u201d status rests on several legal or administrative interpretations Hamm now believes are essentially moot.\n\nOne is whether dropping two levels of adult residential treatment qualifies as \u201cthe elimination of all or substantially all benefits to diagnose or treat\u201d a particular condition, Stenehjem wrote.\n\nHowever, Dinneen noted in her statement, \u201cgrandfathered plans are able to make routine changes that do not violate\u201d certain requirements, which also include raising co-insurance charges or significantly raising co-payments.\n\nShe also noted, however, that the Blues continue to provide other levels of care for adult substance abuse, including inpatient care and outpatient care.\n\nMeanwhile, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which enforces the Affordable Care Act, is reviewing North Dakota\u2019s benchmark plan for the new \u201cmetallic plans\u201d to see if their failure to cover adult residential substance abuse treatment violates a federal law requiring \u201cparity\u201d for physical and behavioral health.\n\n\u201cCMS is currently reviewing this issue and will provide more information when we have concluded our analysis,\u201d Richard Allen, an associate regional administrator in Denver, wrote Snyder in a letter dated Aug. 5 and received Monday.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,region,North Dakota,Health care", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Patrick Springer", "og": {"site_name": "Grand Forks Herald", "description": "A degree of uncertainty hangs over more than 237,000 consumers covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota whose policies were in effect before passage of the Affordable Care Act.
