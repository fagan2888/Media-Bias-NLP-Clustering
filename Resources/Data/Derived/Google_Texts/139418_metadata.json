The photo captures that one, shining moment at Omaha\u2019s Rosenblatt Stadium when the Longhorns beat South Carolina to win the College World Series. Garrido asks recruits to pick out the future major-leaguers in the photo. Huston Street, the former Rockies and current San Diego Padres all-star closer, is pretty easy to spot. Some of the recruits pick out third baseman Omar Quintanilla, another former Rockie.\n\nNone of the recruits identifies the 14-year-old kid wearing a T-shirt and a Texas ballcap.\n\nThe kid was Brett Anderson, the son of Texas pitching coach Frank Anderson. Now 26, the self-described \u201cbaseball nerd\u201d is the Rockies\u2019 big offseason pitching acquisition. The left-hander is being counted on to fortify the rotation and help lift the Rockies from the depths of the National League West basement.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s everything I expected, and more,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cI\u2019m so impressed with his feel for the game and his conviction when he pitches. He\u2019s a student of the game. He understands what he wants to accomplish on the mound.\u201d\n\nWhen the Rockies acquired Anderson from Oakland in an offseason trade for Drew Pomeranz, all Weiss really knew was that Anderson, when healthy, was a special talent with a biting slider. But he had been hurt a lot.\n\nAnderson has proceeded to wow Weiss in spring training, along with his new teammates. Right fielder Michael Cuddyer calls Anderson a \u201cbona fide ace.\u201d Shortstop Troy Tulowitzki raves about Anderson\u2019s ability to work quickly and induce groundball outs.\n\nIt\u2019s clear where Anderson\u2019s baseball acumen comes from. His father has been a college baseball coach for more than 30 years and is currently the pitching coach at the University of Houston. Anderson\u2019s mom, Sandra, was an All-America softball player at Nebraska Kearney.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been the baseball equivalent of a gym rat,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt seems like a coach\u2019s kid can go one of two ways. He can embrace that life or despise it. I was all in, right from the start. I was climbing on batting cages, pestering all those college kids. I was playing catch with anyone that would play catch with me. I guess I\u2019m just a baseball nerd. You might think it would get stale, but it hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnderson, 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds, grew up a big kid who could hit for power. At age 12, he won a home run derby against the likes of future big-leaguers Travis Snider and Hank Conger in Steamboat Springs. But at age 14, unbeknownst to his dad, he started perfecting his slider.\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s about the age when I knew he had a chance to be good at this game, if he really wanted to be,\u201d Frank Anderson said. \u201cI never pushed him, but it was pretty clear he loved baseball.\u201d\n\nWith his dad busy coaching baseball, it was Anderson\u2019s mom who drove him to practice and critiqued his game. She still does.\n\n\u201cMy mom is one of the most competitive, intimidating people I\u2019ve known in my life,\u201d Anderson said with a laugh. \u201cMy mom knows more about the games than probably 95 percent of the women out there. She knew when I wasn\u2019t playing right or not playing hard enough. Even now, she\u2019ll question my pitching calls. And the fact that she knows that, and the fact that she\u2019s usually right, makes it even worse.\u201d\n\nAnderson talks to his dad or texts him almost every day, saying, \u201cI guess it\u2019s kind of a clich\u00e9, but we\u2019re best friends.\u201d\n\nAdded his father: \u201cWe don\u2019t always talk about baseball. We talk about movies, TV, music, whatever. We\u2019ve stayed close. My wife always makes fun of it, says, \u2018It\u2019s really corny that you guys talk every day.\u2019 \u201c\n\nWhen Anderson underwent Tommy John surgery on his left elbow in July 2011, his dad got permission from Dr. James Andrews to view the procedure.\n\n\u201cI was just hoping I wouldn\u2019t faint,\u201d Frank Anderson said. \u201cI wanted be there for Brett. Plus, it was a unique experience.\u201d\n\nAnderson came back strong from the surgery and was tabbed as the opening-day starter last year. But early in the season, he suffered a stress fracture in his right foot that landed him on the disabled list for four months. For all of Anderson\u2019s talent, he has made more than 19 starts just once in his career.\n\n\u201cI feel really good,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI like this team and like the place I\u2019m in right now.\u201d\n\nThe man who taught him the love of the game believes he\u2019s in a good place. \u201cThe move from Oakland to Denver was a good move,\u201d his dad said. \u201cI think Brett needed a fresh start.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies pitcher Brett Anderson proud to be a \u201cbaseball nerd\u201d", "title": "Rockies pitcher Brett Anderson proud to be a \u201cbaseball nerd\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/22/rockies-pitcher-brett-anderson-proud-to-be-a-baseball-nerd/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140322__20140323_C1_SP23BBNROCKIES1p1.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140322__20140323_C1_SP23BBNROCKIES1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-22T20:10:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T21:09:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s clear where Anderson\u2019s baseball acumen comes from.\nThe kid was Brett Anderson, the son of Texas pitching coach Frank Anderson.\nNow 26, the self-described \u201cbaseball nerd\u201d is the Rockies\u2019 big offseason pitching acquisition.\n\u201cMy mom is one of the most competitive, intimidating people I\u2019ve known in my life,\u201d Anderson said with a laugh.\nHuston Street, the former Rockies and current San Diego Padres all-star closer, is pretty easy to spot."}
