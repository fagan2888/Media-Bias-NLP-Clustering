This week, the supermarket chain Kroger announced it will offer its roughly 400,000 employees full health coverage for trans-related surgeries and drug therapy in 2016. And with new Obamacare regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity, many cities and states are beginning to offer all-inclusive health care plans covering trans-related procedures.\n\nClinics, hospitals, and even medical schools are now scrambling to get up to speed. But a general lack of comprehensive research, academic instruction, and cultural competency leaves many health care professionals empty-handed. At times, the best information comes from trans patients themselves \u2014 a burden that can discourage them from returning for needed check-ups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to tell people what their experience will be in a doctor\u2019s office, it can be all over the map,\u201d said Harper Jean Tobin, the director of policy at the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE).\n\nIt\u2019s critical providers and health care systems understand that any health care to a trans person is trans health care.\n\n\n\nA 2011 NCTE study found 50 percent of trans patients had to educate their provider about basic trans health. Nineteen percent were simply refused medical care. Unless changes are made at the most basic levels, many advocates say trans health options may take much longer than expected to catch up to the national standard.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this perception that this is such a small part of the population, that it\u2019s not a priority,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a population that is especially threatened. And it\u2019s growing.\u201d\n\nIn September, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced new proposed regulations on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that would prohibit discrimination in health coverage on the basis of a person\u2019s gender identity. This is the first time that federal law has prohibited sex discrimination in health care \u2014 but, like most nondiscrimination protections, it\u2019s mostly at the regulatory level. Health facilities and insurance providers are only assessed for compliance once a complaint has been made against them.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s becoming clear that this specific area of the ACA \u2014 Section 1557 \u2014 is particularly important for transgender patients. The first resolution agreement that the HHS Office for Civil Rights made under Section 1557, as well as the first court case to look at its protections in detail, were both related to the experiences of trans individuals.\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to trans coverage lies in the technical details. Current medical coding practices don\u2019t include a way to differentiate a patient\u2019s gender identity from the gender they were assigned at birth. This makes it difficult, for instance, for a trans man to be covered for a pap smear, or a trans woman to get a prostate exam.\n\nIn this May 29, 2014 photo, Denee Mallon takes part in the Trans March to Morningside Park in Albuquerque, N.M.

This means most patients have to either research coverage options beforehand or go through a lengthy appeals process.\n\nSome health care producers are wary of treating trans patients at all because they don\u2019t want to wade into complicated insurance processes. But this could leave patients turned away for simply wanting basic, universal care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical providers and health care systems understand that any health care to a trans person is trans health care,\u201d said Kelly Duchney, director of behavioral health services at Howard Brown Center in Chicago, which has a specific trans health program. \u201cThis includes a flu shot. This includes hormone treatments.\u201d\n\nBut to understand these issues, along with the more trans-specific procedures, health providers need a stronger source of medical research to lean on. Still seen as a specialty area, there\u2019s little funding going towards trans health research, and there\u2019s no mandatory trans training in most health facilities. This doesn\u2019t just affect the ability for current physicians to understand trans health needs \u2014 it also keeps future ones in the dark.\n\n\u201cMost medical universities address trans health as an elective,\u201d said Kristen Eckstrand, co-founder of the LGBTI health program at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \u201cThey say they want students to understand \u2018basic patients\u2019 before \u2018complicated patients\u2019.\u201d\n\nVanderbilt joins a handful of other universities that make trans health a core piece of its medical school curriculum and research. Aside from providing up-to-date medical findings, Eckstrand said these classes also cover comprehensive care issues, like learning what words trans patients may use to address their bodies or how to be sensitive to the emotional and physical trauma they may have experienced.\n\nCREDIT: National Center for Transgender Equality\n\n\u201cWe want our students be prepared to engage in long-term care \u2014 beyond just learning correct pronouns,\u201d Eckstrand said.\n\nAs an example, she explained how some trans patients don\u2019t want to be engaged with procedures that involve their genitals, especially if they represent the gender they no longer identify as.\n\n\u201cWe have students play music or allow patients to have someone in the room with them for support. It can be traumatizing. But it can be overlooked,\u201d Eckstrand said.\n\nShe said that the biggest barrier at the university level is getting university faculty up-to-date on modern trans health care. For most, it\u2019s an optional piece of continuing education they can access through online accreditation services \u2014 if they have time. Eckstrand has been working with the Association of American Medical Colleges to create videos and trainings around the trans topics that faculty \u201cshould be talking about.\u201d\n\nNot all trans health providers think this type of universal education is critical, pointing out that\u2019s where specialty clinics can play a role. Barbara Lewis, a physician\u2019s assistant at D.C.\u2019s LGBT health provider, Whitman-Walker, said she doesn\u2019t believe trans health school be an integral part of every medical student\u2019s education.\n\nProviders need to be educated about specific areas of trans health, the burden shouldn\u2019t be on the patient.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should expect all practitioners to know how to treat trans health procedures,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a specialty area and requires specific knowledge. A lot of primary care practitioners are not comfortable with it.\u201d\n\nLewis said many of her patients come to Whitman-Walker because they don\u2019t feel like their primary care doctor will understand their needs \u2014 even if it\u2019s just for regular care. To keep her finger on the pulse of trans health care, Lewis said she attends a variety of conferences each year and relies on the internet for specific updates. And an increasing amount of health centers and university health services have asked Whitman-Walker staff to provide trainings on both medical and cultural competency.\n\nUntil federal and academic research catches up with trans health needs, case-by-case regulation \u2014 sparked by patient complaints \u2014 may be the fastest way to reform and educate both health providers and insurers. NCTE\u2019s Tobin said he hopes the inertia from national trans advocates and nonprofits will get the ball rolling before then.\n\n\u201cWe need a higher standard of understanding. Trans people have systematically be ignored and excluded for far too long. Providers need to be educated about specific areas of trans health, the burden shouldn\u2019t be on the patient,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think given the health disparities in trans patients, it\u2019s going to be well worth their time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to tell people what their experience will be in a doctor\u2019s office, it can be all over the map.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to tell people what their experience will be in a doctor\u2019s office, it can be all over the map.\"", "title": "Can Doctors Keep Up With The Growing Demand For Trans Health Care?", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/10/15/3712793/trans-health-care-compliance/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15141939/lgbthealth.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to tell people what their experience will be in a doctor\u2019s office, it can be all over the map.\"", "title": "Can Doctors Keep Up With The Growing Demand For Trans Health Care?", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15141939/lgbthealth-320x213.jpg", "creator": "@alex_zee", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15141939/lgbthealth-99x66.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15141939/lgbthealth-540x303.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-15T14:30:51+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/alexzielinskireporter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s critical providers and health care systems understand that any health care to a trans person is trans health care.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical providers and health care systems understand that any health care to a trans person is trans health care,\u201d said Kelly Duchney, director of behavioral health services at Howard Brown Center in Chicago, which has a specific trans health program.\nA 2011 NCTE study found 50 percent of trans patients had to educate their provider about basic trans health.\nStill seen as a specialty area, there\u2019s little funding going towards trans health research, and there\u2019s no mandatory trans training in most health facilities.\nShe said that the biggest barrier at the university level is getting university faculty up-to-date on modern trans health care."}
