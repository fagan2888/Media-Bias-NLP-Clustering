And since it\u2019s been nearly a month since her highness announced her intent to rule over America like a feudal lord, it\u2019s about time they start using hardened Hillary supporters to recruit you into the collective. After all, the longer you hold out, the more painful it will be.\n\nThis Mother\u2019s Day, why give your mother flowers or perfume like every year when you can give her the gift of female solidarity? After all, she\u2019s the woman who created you to be the woman that you are, and if there\u2019s any chance our gender, which is now 51% of America, hopes to survive, we must join together to lift up a politican who proves that women can be just as corrupt, entitled, and out of touch as any man.\n\nSo if you\u2019re truly serious, why not have Hillary Clinton call your mom on her special day to explain to her exactly that.\n\n[[{\u201ctype\u201d:\u201dmedia\u201d,\u201dview_mode\u201d:\u201dmedia_large\u201d,\u201dfid\u201d:\u201d97629\u2033,\u201dattributes\u201d:{\u201calt\u201d:\u201d\u201d,\u201dclass\u201d:\u201dmedia-image\u201d,\u201dheight\u201d:\u201d324\u2033,\u201dtypeof\u201d:\u201dfoaf:Image\u201d,\u201dwidth\u201d:\u201d480\u2033}}]]\n\nThere will be five lucky winners, you guys. And by the looks of it, only 282 shares. That means, if everyone who shares it also enters, your chances of winning are pretty solid! Or rather, your chance of giving your mother the Mother\u2019s Day that she\u2019ll never forget because therapy for this kind of problem costs just too much, and no one can afford extraneous medical care under Obamacare, your chances of winning are pretty solid!", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "So if you\u2019re truly serious, why not have Hillary Clinton call your mom on her special day to explain to her exactly that.\nThis Mother\u2019s Day, why give your mother flowers or perfume like every year when you can give her the gift of female solidarity?\nObviously, if you\u2019re female and you haven\u2019t yet declared your ladyparts to be in the service of Hillary Clinton, your true gender is in question.\nThat means, if everyone who shares it also enters, your chances of winning are pretty solid!\nOr rather, your chance of giving your mother the Mother\u2019s Day that she\u2019ll never forget because therapy for this kind of problem costs just too much, and no one can afford extraneous medical care under Obamacare, your chances of winning are pretty solid!"}
