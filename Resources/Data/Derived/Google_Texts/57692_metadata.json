You got the Democrats; you got the Republicans. You got the Bloods; you got the Crips. Everything is red and blue in this country. You know what else is red and blue? Blood. Blood is blue in your body until air hits it, and then it turns red. That means there's unity. There's gonna be unity. So when you think about a night where there's late-night talk-show hosts and it's mostly women, that's a different world. Right? A world where seventy-five percent of the prime ministers and the presidents were women: That's a different world. That's gonna happen, and it's gonna happen when Hillary wins.\"\n\nPharrell continued his endorsement, noting Clinton's pro-choice stance and contrasting the abortion rights movement with outer space exploration.\"No matter how staunch of a supporter you are of no-abortion, whatever you are: You're a woman, and there's no way in the world you're going to vote for somebody that's going to try to tell you what to do with your body,\" said Pharrell. \"When we are a country and we are a species that has had a martian Rover traveling up and down the crevices of this planet looking for water and ice, okay, and we've had a space station that's been orbiting our planet for 16 years\u2014but we still got legislation trying to tell women what to do with their bodies? Hillary's gonna win. Listen, I'm reaching out to her right now. She's gonna win.\"\n\nThe multi-hyphenate musician noted that \"everybody laughed at me when I said Obama was going to win, but I knew what he represented\" and was impressed with Clinton's performance as Secretary of State.\n\nThe producer has been ubiquitous this past month, releasing his second album Girl, performing at the Academy Awards and, last week, celebrating International Day of Happiness by encouraging fans to make donations to the United Nation Foundation's Central Emergency Response Fund.\n\nPharrell is scheduled to perform on Saturday Night Live on April 5th.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Producer makes bold prediction in 2016 presidential race", "og": {"site_name": "Rolling Stone", "description": "Producer makes bold prediction in 2016 presidential race", "title": "Pharrell: 'Let Me Tell You Why Hillary's Going to Win'", "url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pharrell-let-me-tell-you-why-hillarys-going-to-win-20140325", "image": {"width": 1401, "identifier": "http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/story/pharrell-let-me-tell-you-why-hillarys-going-to-win-20140325/pharrell-306-1395756724.jpg", "height": 788}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RollingStone", "image": {"src": "http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/story/pharrell-let-me-tell-you-why-hillarys-going-to-win-20140325/pharrell-306-1395756724.jpg"}, "description": "Producer makes bold prediction in 2016 presidential race", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pharrell: 'Let Me Tell You Why Hillary's Going to Win'"}, "fb": {"app_id": 107978575944240}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rollingstone", "published_time": "2014-03-25T14:15:00Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, target-densityDpi=device-dpi", "news_keywords": "pharrell, pharrell hillary, pharrell hillary clinton, pharrell politics, pharrell president, pharrell interview"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca10\"", "article_summary": "Pharrell Williams Creates First 24-Hour Music Video\"Let me tell you why Hillary's going to win,\" said Pharrell after a discussion about Barack Obama.\nThat's gonna happen, and it's gonna happen when Hillary wins.\"\nA world where seventy-five percent of the prime ministers and the presidents were women: That's a different world.\nHillary's gonna win.\nShe's gonna win.\""}
