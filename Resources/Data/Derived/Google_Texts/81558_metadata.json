I\u2019m a Presbyterian and I had mentioned that, and I did say I don\u2019t know about it. And in fact those are my exact words,\" Trump said. \"So I just really don't know about the Seventh-day Adventists.\"\n\nSomething Trump did know about Sunday was Obamacare, which he called a disaster of a law that needs to be repealed.\n\n\"The one thing we have to do is repeal and replace Obamacare,\" Trump told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. \"It is a disaster. People\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know if you have been watching lately over the last couple of weeks -- people\u2019s premiums, George, are going up 35, 45, 55 percent. Their deductibles are so high nobody\u2019s ever going to get to use it. So ... Obamacare is turning out to be a bigger disaster than anybody thought.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that premiums \"are going up 35, 45, 55 percent\" rates Half True.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with a brief primer on premium hikes. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers planning to increase their rates by more than 10 percent have to submit proposals for federal review. In many states, the companies also have to negotiate their prices with a state insurance commissioner.\n\nGenerally, the finalized premiums will be equal to or lower than the proposed rates, according to Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading nonpartisan health policy research center. With five days left before open enrollment begins on Nov. 1, rates are likely already approved or amended, but not all them have been publicized.\n\nTrump has a point that some insurers have requested increases that hit high double digits.\n\n\"Yes, some people in some plans through some carriers in some states are, indeed, looking at rate hikes of \u201835 to 50 percent\u2019 if they stick with those plans in 2016,\" said Charles Gaba, who runs the popular blog ACAsignups.net, which tracks Obamacare enrollment.\n\n\"This is not completely off the wall. Many of the popular plans requested high increases,\" said Gail Wilensky, a health economist and the head of Medicare and Medicaid under George H.W. Bush. \"Those hikes will affect more people than some may think.\"\n\nShe pointed out that Blue Cross Blue Shield, a prominent insurer with a significant amount of enrollees, proposed rate hikes of 14 to 38 percent in Illinois and 50 to 65 percent in New Mexico.\n\nBut that\u2019s not telling the entire story either, according to the data.\n\nLooking at finalized rates for the lowest and second-lowest cost marketplace plans in the silver category \u2014 which are the basis for federal premium subsidies and chosen by 68 percent of enrollees \u2014 the average increase is nowhere near 35 to 55 percent.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation found that the cost of a benchmark silver plan will be 4.4 percent more expensive on average across major cities in 13 states and Washington, D.C. (That is a smaller annual increase than what had been occurring before Obamacare became law.)\n\nAccording to Kaiser, enrollees in Minneapolis will see the biggest premium increase at 28.7 percent. On the other end of the spectrum, plans will actually decrease by 10.4 percent in Seattle.\n\nAll the experts we spoke to warned us that there\u2019s significant variation from plan to plan, from region to region, and from insuree to insuree. That\u2019s why neither Trump\u2019s claim nor averages tell the whole story.\n\nThe disparity in rate increases are more likely adjustments insurers are making, rather than evidence that Obamacare is a \"disaster,\" as Trump says.\n\nAfter all, 2016 is the first year that insurers are looking at actual claims data instead of \"essentially guessing at what their costs were,\" Levitt said. \"Some insurers guessed better than others, which leads to variations in premium changes.\"\n\nEnrollment figures are different from state to state, which affects the risk pool and the premium changes. Premium rate increases can also be unique to an individual\u2019s circumstances, not necessarily reflective of a national average.\n\nRubio on abortion\n\nAlso on ABC\u2019s This Week, liberal pundit and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm was asked if Democrats fear that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio becomes the establishment alternative to Carson and Trump.\n\nNot really, Granholm said. \"He\u2019s one of the most extreme,\" she said. \"For example, he doesn\u2019t agree with a woman\u2019s right to choose even in the case of rape or incest.\"\n\nThat claim rates Mostly True.\n\nRubio says he will support anti-abortion legislation that includes an exception for rape and incest, but he prefers that the procedure be illegal even in cases of rape and incest.\n\nRubio recently discussed his position on abortion during the first Republican presidential debate, Aug. 6, 2015, in Cleveland. Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly set up a question by saying Rubio favored a \"rape and incest exception to abortion bans.\"\n\n\"Well, Megyn, first of all, I'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record. I would go on to add that I believe all \u2026 \" Rubio started before being cut off.\n\n\"You don't favor a rape and incest exception?\" Kelly asked.\n\n\"I have never said that,\" Rubio responded. \"And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass a law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nRubio never definitively answered Kelly\u2019s question about whether he favors such an exception. But he clearly bristled at the suggestion that he favors an abortion exception for rape and incest.\n\nHe tried to explain himself a few days later on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\n\n\"I'll support any legislation that reduces the number of abortions, so that means a 20-week abortion ban. At five months, a child -- you'll recognize it as a human being in an ultrasound image. And I'll support that. That doesn't obviously cover the whole gamut, but it reduces the number of abortions,\" Rubio said.\n\n\"I'll support any legislation that reduces the number of abortions and there are those that have that exception in it. What I've never done is said I require that it must have or not have exceptions.\"\n\nIn November 2013, Rubio was one of 40 co-sponsors of a Senate bill entitled \"Pain-capable unborn child protection act.\" Several GOP presidential candidates backed the bill, including main sponsor Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and co-sponsors Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky. The bill bans abortions at 20 weeks or greater but includes exceptions, including rape and incest.\n\n\"I personally and deeply believe that all human life is worthy of the protection of our laws, I do,\" Rubio said in his Meet the Press interview. \"And I believe that irrespective of the conditions by which that life was conceived or anything else, and for me to be consistent on that belief, that's why I feel so strongly about it.\n\n\"That being said, I recognize that in order to have a consensus on laws that limit the number of abortions, a lot of people want to see those exceptions and that's why I've supported those laws in the past, as has every pro-life group in America.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "New polls that show Ben Carson leading Donald Trump in Iowa have put Trump on the defensive in recent days, subtly questioning Carson&rsquo;s Seventh-day Adventist religion and Carson&rsquo;s energy to lead the country.
