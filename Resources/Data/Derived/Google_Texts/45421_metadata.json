The status update focuses on access to preventive services like cancer screenings and immunizations.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act provides funding for public health efforts to increase immunizations and to prevent tobacco use, obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Dr. Robert Rolfs is Deputy Director of the Utah Department of Health.\n\n\u201cUtahns in general are very healthy people, but one of the areas that Utahns have not fared as well as other parts of the country have been in use of what we call clinical prevention services, so cancer screening, immunizations, cholesterol screening,\u201d Rolfs says. \u201cI think this is an area where we can improve relative to the rest of the country, and this should help us do that.\u201d\n\nEarly indications are that use of preventive services has increased in Utah. For example, colorectal cancer screening went up from around 65% in 2010 to 75% in 2013. Rolfs says the effects of the ACA are difficult to quantify, but there is data on the impact of preventative screenings.\n\n\u201cWe know that if you do it, you will be saving lives,\u201d Rolfs says. \u201cI think we can safely say that it\u2019s made people healthier.\u201d Under the ACA, insurers are required to cover many preventive services free of co-pays or cost sharing.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "State health officials released a report this week concluding that public health in Utah has benefited from the Affordable Care Act \u2013 otherwise known as", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kuer.org/post/utah-department-health-update-aca-has-made-people-healthier", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuer/files/styles/medium/public/201312/stethoscope_0.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "State health officials released a report this week concluding that public health in Utah has benefited from the Affordable Care Act \u2013 otherwise known as", "title": "Utah Department of Health Update: ACA has \"Made People Healthier\""}, "story_id": 413762914, "twitter": {"site": "@KUERNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@KUERNews"}, "author": "Andrea Smardon", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Utah Department of Health Update: ACA has &quot;Made People Healthier&quot;"}, "nid": 63708, "datePublished": "2015-06-11", "keywords": "ACA, Affordable Care Act, preventive health, obamacare", "wordCount": 258, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "State health officials released a report this week concluding that public health in Utah has benefited from the Affordable Care Act \u2013 otherwise known as Obamacare.\nThe status update focuses on access to preventive services like cancer screenings and immunizations.\n\u201cI think we can safely say that it\u2019s made people healthier.\u201d Under the ACA, insurers are required to cover many preventive services free of co-pays or cost sharing.\nFor example, colorectal cancer screening went up from around 65% in 2010 to 75% in 2013.\nDr. Robert Rolfs is Deputy Director of the Utah Department of Health."}
