(Roberto Rodriguez, St. Louis Post-Dispatch via Religion News Service)\n\nST. LOUIS \u2013 Hollywood star Denzel Washington, the son of a pastor, preached a sermon of gratefulness Saturday evening to hundreds of members of the Church of God in Christ at their annual Holy Congregation in downtown St. Louis.\n\n\u201cI pray that you put your slippers way under your bed at night, so that when you wake in the morning you have to start on your knees to find them. And while you\u2019re down there, say thank you,\u201d he told the crowd at a $200-a-plate banquet at the Marriott St. Louis Grand Hotel to raise money for the denomination\u2019s charity work.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to be grateful and hateful at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have an attitude of gratitude.\u201d\n\nThe acclaimed actor grew up in the Church of God in Christ. He, his wife and children still attend the denomination\u2019s West Angeles church in Los Angeles.\n\nHis father, Denzel Washington Sr., was a pastor and, according to his son, a good father. The actor talked of the comfort he got in hearing his father\u2019s car pull into the driveway every evening. It gave him a sense of stability.\n\nA church woman also gave him a hint of his career to come, he said.\n\nWashington remembered sitting in his mother\u2019s beauty shop as a young man. He was flunking out of college with a 1.7 grade point average. \u201cI had no future. I was sitting in the chair looking in the mirror,\u201d he said, when he heard a woman speak from under a hair dryer.\n\n\u201cYoung man, you\u2019re going to travel the world and speak to millions of people,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are going to preach.\u201d\n\nHis mother told him that the woman was thought to have the gift of predicting the future.\n\n\u201cI guess she was right,\u201d said Washington. These days he is trying to go beyond speaking through his movies by speaking more often to groups about his faith and \u201cwhat God has done for me.\u201d\n\nWashington, whose roles have ranged from civil rights icon Malcolm X to an Oscar-winning role as a corrupt police detective, led the church members in reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\n\n\u201cFaith and optimism can add years to your life,\u201d he told those at the banquet. \u201cA bad attitude is like a flat tire. Until you change it, you\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d he said, urging the audience to \u201cuse the power of prayer in everything we do.\u201d\n\nThe Church of God in Christ is the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination, with about 12,000 congregations. This is the sixth time its annual Holy Convocation has been in St. Louis. The meeting is one of the largest events held at America\u2019s Center.\n\n\u2014 Written by Jim Gallagher, St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/11/09/denzel-washington-preaches-gratitude-to-church-members-at-pentecostal-convention/", "article_author_name": "Religion News Service", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/denzel-preaches-e1454000435802.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "church of god in christ, denzel washington, holy congregation, Religion News Service, st. louis"}, "description": "Hollywood star Denzel Washington preached a sermon of gratefulness to hundreds of members of the Church of God in Christ at their annual Holy Congregation in", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/denzel-preaches-e1454000435802.jpg"}, "keywords": "denzel washington,church of god in christ,holy congregation,st. louis,religion news service", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bd0\"", "article_summary": "Denzel Washington preaches gratitude to church members at Pentecostal conventionPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2015/11/09/denzel-washington-preaches-gratitude-to-church-members-at-pentecostal-convention/Denzel Washington speaks during the Church of God In Christ Charities banquet at the Marriott Grand Hotel, Saturday, November 7, 2015.\nA church woman also gave him a hint of his career to come, he said.\n\u2014 Written by Jim Gallagher, St. Louis Post-DispatchPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\nThis is the sixth time its annual Holy Convocation has been in St. Louis.\n\u201cWe have to have an attitude of gratitude.\u201dThe acclaimed actor grew up in the Church of God in Christ."}
