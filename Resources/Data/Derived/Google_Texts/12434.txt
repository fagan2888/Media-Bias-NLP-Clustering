The Bergen County hospital that is considered the safety net for poor and uninsured patients in the county provided less charity care last year than it did the year before, a report released Friday by the state department of health concluded. Most other New Jersey hospitals treated a higher number of impoverished patients, the report found.



Bergen Regional Medical Center, in Paramus, reported providing nearly $6.2 million less in charity care in 2012 than in 2011. By contrast, St. Joseph’s Regional Medical Center in Paterson had the highest amount of charity care in the state, nearly $83 million.



Executives at the for-profit company running the hospital declined to comment on the drop. So did Robert Garrison, the executive director of the Bergen County Improvement Authority, which oversees the hospital.



Overall, hospitals statewide spent $998 million in charity care last year, up from $995 million in 2011 but a drop from the $1 billion they reported in 2010. Hospitals’ obligation to provide nonemergency care to the poor is a murky area of the law.



“What this says is that a significant amount of uninsured patients in the State of New Jersey are being treated,” said Sean Hopkins, vice president for health economics of the New Jersey Hospital Association. “In the grand scheme of things, it looks like there was a significant increase in charity care during the great recession starting about 2008 and then after that it started to flatten out.”



At least one North Jersey hospital has been trying to reduce its charity-care cases. Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck attributes its nearly $1 million reduction in charity cases in 2012 to an effort, begun in 2010. The Catholic-based hospital hired additional staff and “employed an improved process to qualify patients for Medicaid — thus decreasing the charity care number in 2012,” said Jane Ellis, a hospital vice president. “The result has been a win-win for both Holy Name and those former charity-care patients who are now covered by Medicaid.”



Several other medical centers also had a decline in charity care, but Bergen Regional had the largest drop among North Jersey hospitals. In 2010, the county-owned hospital reported nearly $42.7 million in charity care. By 2011, that number had dropped to $39 million and in 2012 it had slipped to nearly $32.8 million.



Tracy Zur, the freeholder liaison to the hospital, said “Bergen Regional is our safety-net hospital and has a duty and responsibility to provide care for the most needy in our community,” referring to the hospital’s long history of caring for the poor. “This substantiates what we’ve been hearing — that they aren’t meeting their responsibility, and this is unacceptable.”



Meadowlands Hospital in Secaucus, which is now a for-profit institution, reduced charity-care work by only about $10,000 between 2011 and 2012. But the previous owners reported spending $2.1 million in 2010, just over $500,000 more than the 2012 amount, , on indigent patients.



“We can’t speak to the 2010 numbers, because we can’t talk about numbers that were submitted by other people,” said Ben Martin, a spokesman for the hospital. But he said that the difference between the 2011 and 2012 numbers was “really statistically insignificant.”



Administrators at St. Mary’s in Passaic declined to comment on the hospital’s $1 million reduction between 2011 and 2012 and the $5 million drop from 2010.



St. Joseph administrators also did not comment on the $8 million increase from 2011 to 2012.



“Keep in mind that charity care is reimbursed based on Medicaid rates, which is about 30 percent below the cost of care,” said Hopkins, of the hospital association.



The state awarded $675 million in charity care to be divided among the New Jersey hospitals in 2012 to help reimburse charity-care costs.



Hospital administrators are hoping that implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which is expected to cover a large portion of New Jersey’s 900,000 uninsured, will reduce the number of charity-care patients.
