Social media played a key role in introducing millions of people to the Health Insurance Marketplace and available health insurance options. CMS has leveraged Twitter hashtags #GetCovered and #YoungInvincibles to reach a wide audience with targeted messages about enrollment, coverage benefits, deadlines and personal stories.\n\nThe Role of Social Media\n\nSocial media has become a common method of communication among our diverse partners as they share information with their networks. Our group often acts as an intermediary by gathering social media content from experts and forwarding relevant content to our partners, who share the messages through their social media channels.\n\nIt is important to be able to \u201cspeak\u201d the social media language with partners who are well-versed in it, while also being able to explain terminology like \u201chashtags\u201d for partners who may not have as strong a social media presence, but who want to learn more.\n\nGetting Started\n\nWe asked AIDS.gov to give us an introduction to social media. The training helped us gain a basic understanding of the most popular social media channels, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. We learned how we can improve our existing social media efforts by understanding terms, like \u201cre-tweeting ,\u201d as well as tools to create URL shortcuts. We also learned about how different audiences interact with each social media platform, to understand which platforms would most appeal to our target audience. For example, we learned that the audience currently on Facebook has a much wider age range, while Instagram currently caters to a younger audience.\n\nOne of the participants shared some feedback with us: \u201cEarlier this year, I participated in a Social Media 101 workshop conducted by AIDS.gov. Communication channels are changing dramatically (since I was in college nearly 40 years ago!), and it is imperative for anyone with an education and outreach role to know about the different platforms for unique social messaging. Apart from that, the workshop was a blast and presented multiple new communication channels/methods to bring our mission to the public.\u201d\n\nLessons Learned\n\nHere are some takeaways from our Social Media 101 training with AIDS.gov:\n\nLearn a few simple essentials about some of the main social media platforms. Doing so helps you to stay in the loop about how information is being communicated, can help you recognize when social media is the best way to share your content, and which platforms are most relevant.\n\nDoing so helps you to stay in the loop about how information is being communicated, can help you recognize when social media is the best way to share your content, and which platforms are most relevant. Don\u2019t be ashamed to ask questions \u2014we all start somewhere. Several of us asked questions that seemed \u201cbasic\u201d but then realized that others also benefitted from the response!\n\n\u2014we all start somewhere. Several of us asked questions that seemed \u201cbasic\u201d but then realized that others also benefitted from the response! You don\u2019t have to be the one \u201ctweeting\u201d or \u201cgramming\u201d\u2014but understanding Twitter, Instagram, and other social media platforms helped us to complete the broader communications picture we work towards.\n\nThe training gave us better understanding of various social media channels and provided answers to our questions.\n\nAre you new to social media?
