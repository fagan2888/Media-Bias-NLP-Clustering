Marco Rubio added another Christian conservative and business leader to his list of Oklahoma endorsements on Sunday as David Green, the founder and CEO of Hobby Lobby, praised the Florida Republican.\n\nGreen, whose family is known for a nationwide chain of crafts stores and for a Supreme Court victory against the birth control mandate in Obamacare, issued a statement that was nearly equal parts endorsement of Rubio for the GOP presidential nomination and condemnation of billionaire Donald Trump.\n\nGreen said, \"Our family business that we began with $600 has quite possibly been more successful than Mr. Trump's, but that doesn't make either of us qualified to be president.\n\n\"And unlike Mr. Trump, we give all the credit to God. Marco Rubio has impressed us with his preparation and the way he carries himself. But most importantly, Marco regularly exhibits humility and gives the glory to God. Humility is what brings success. I don't see humility in Mr. Trump, and that scares me to death. I want a president that my kids, my grandkids and my great-grandkids can emulate.\"\n\n\"In Marco Rubio, I see a man who has achieved great things from humble beginnings, but gives the glory to God, where it belongs. I see a man who is prepared to be president, and someone I would be proud for my children to emulate.\"\n\nRubio has now secured two of Oklahoma City's top business leaders. Devon Energy executive Larry Nichols is also backing him. Numerous elected officials in the state have endorsed him, and former U.S. Sen. Don Nickles, a longtime favorite of Christian conservatives, announced his support on Friday.\n\nRubio, who spoke at an Oklahoma City rally on Friday, is scheduled to return to the state on Monday, just hours before Oklahomans and voters in a dozen other states go to the polls.\n\nRubio is set to speak at 6 p.m.. at Putnam City North High School and at 8:30 p.m. in Tulsa.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
