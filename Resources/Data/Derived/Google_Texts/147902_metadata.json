In 2010 they were tasked with defending appointed Sen. Michael Bennet in a race against Tea Party-backed Ken Buck. They won with some innovate turnout tactics, but they pummeled Buck's image by portraying him as extreme on abortion. This stuff works in a purple state that's inclined toward libertarian candidates. It's working again, as first Rep. Cory Gardner (who's running for Senate) and now Rep. Mike Coffman (who's trying to get re-elected in a swing seat) have been goaded into reversing their endorsement of \"personhood amendments.\" Eli Stokols reports that Gardner, and then Coffman, have denounced the old ballot measure that would have defined \"personhood\" at the moment of conception, then denounced Democrats for trying to (I should really have a keyboard shortcut for this attack) distracting voters from Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason Democratic Senator Michael Bennet called Speaker Romanoff\u2019s attacks sleazy in 2010 \u2013 Romanoff is the Czar of sleaze,\u201d said Tyler Sandberg, Coffman\u2019s campaign manager. \u201c\u2018Supported it at every turn?\u2019 Mike didn\u2019t in 2012. And he doesn\u2019t in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe voters have spoken twice, and the question is settled. The initiative is over-broad and full of unintended consequences, sort of like Obamacare, which let\u2019s be honest, all of this sleaze from Romanoff is meant to be a distraction from.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Coffman has never disavowed personhood until today.\n\nAnd doing so has earned the ire of Personhood USA, the national organization that campaigns for these amendments. First it denounced Gardner. Now it's after Coffman.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "The Personhood Movement Is Tired of Republican Congressmen Betraying It", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "Colorado Democrats wrote the \"war on women\" playbook.
