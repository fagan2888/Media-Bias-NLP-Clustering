Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), in a press release from his congressional office, likewise lauded the court\u2019s \u201ccommonsense reading of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Then, Sanders said, \u201cWhat the United States should do is join every other major nation and recognize that healthcare is a right of citizenship. A Medicare-for-all, singlepayer system would provide better care at less cost for more Americans.\u201d\n\nTherein lies the difference between Clinton and Sanders. She supports reforms within the narrow parameters of Washington liberalism. He seeks unapologetically progressive structural change.\n\nYet, the purist Left\u2014and the Green Party and its socialist supporters in particular\u2014opposes Sanders\u2019s electoral ambitions. Jill Stein tossed her Green Party hat into the presidential race on June 22 during an appearance on Democracy Now! She admitted that she and Sanders share a similar vision, but explained that when she loses on Nov. 8, 2016, \u201cthat vision will not die, it will not be absorbed back into a party that is essentially hostile to that vision.\u201d This begs the question: What has the Green Party and its \u201cvision\u201d accomplished in the 15 years since Ralph Nader\u2019s 2000 campaign?\n\nThe Green Party and its supporters count talented writers and activists within their ranks (some of whom contribute to this magazine), but their theory of national electoral politics is as defective as their understanding of the long and discouraging history of third-party campaigns. The Green Party motto appears to be: \u201cIf at first you don\u2019t succeed, keep doing exactly the same thing.\u201d\n\nIn our electoral system, third-party presidential campaigns do not challenge the bipartisan neoliberal establishment. On the contrary, such quadrennial rituals only reinforce the political impotence of the Left, while preserving the purity of the third-party voter. The fact that Sanders is attracting massive crowds in the early primary states is far more unsettling to the guardians of the status quo than any Green Party candidate. Reporting on Sanders\u2019s success in Iowa, the New York Times observed: \u201cClinton is far ahead, in the polls, fundraising and name recognition. \u2026 Her mix of centrist and progressive Democratic views may yet prove more appealing to the broadest number of party voters as well, while some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s policy prescriptions\u2014including far higher taxes on the wealthy and deep military spending cuts\u2014may eventually persuade Democrats that he is unelectable in a general election.\u201d Apparently, if his policies fail to convince Democrats he is unelectable, the New York Times will try its best to do so.\n\nSanders\u2019s relentless social democratic message that all citizens of this rich and powerful country should expect and demand high-quality public services\u2014like single-payer healthcare\u2014fosters political awareness among a real-world audience. This audience should be the subject of our politics\u2014not the Green idealist voting their vision, nor the imaginary worker marching under a red banner.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://inthesetimes.com/article/18142/holier-than-bernie", "image": "http://inthesetimes.com/images/made/images/16305933820_734afc892a_k_500_333_s.jpg", "description": "Which campaign matters more: Bernie Sanders's or Jill Stein's?", "title": "Holier than Bernie"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceacf\"", "article_summary": "Jill Stein tossed her Green Party hat into the presidential race on June 22 during an appearance on Democracy Now!\nYet, the purist Left\u2014and the Green Party and its socialist supporters in particular\u2014opposes Sanders\u2019s electoral ambitions.\nWhich campaign matters more: Bernie Sanders\u2019s or Jill Stein\u2019s?\nA Medicare-for-all, singlepayer system would provide better care at less cost for more Americans.\u201dTherein lies the difference between Clinton and Sanders.\nReporting on Sanders\u2019s success in Iowa, the New York Times observed: \u201cClinton is far ahead, in the polls, fundraising and name recognition."}
