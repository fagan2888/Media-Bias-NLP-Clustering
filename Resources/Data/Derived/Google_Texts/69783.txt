The four-legged stars of “Anchorman 2” and hit TV show “Glee” were out on Thursday night, as Baxter and Lord Tubbington joined Congressional staffers to celebrate the cutest pets on Capitol Hill.

The Animal Health Institute hosted its 17th annual Celebrity Pet Night, where the winners of the 5th annual Cutest Pets on Capitol Hill contest were announced. The contest was open to all animals owned by a member of Congress, their staff or committee staff working on the Hill.

Lily, owned by Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), won the title of cutest dog this year. Avon Barksdale, owned by Aly Lubov, a legislative correspondent for Rep. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), nabbed the top spot in the cutest cat category. Senator, a tortoise owned by Megan Thompson, a legislative assistant for Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), won cutest exotic pet.

The most adorable animals were selected by judges Benny Johnson of BuzzFeed, Kate Bennett of Washingtonian Magazine and Nikki Schwab of U.S. News & World Report.

Guests of the event could get their photos taken with Quince, who plays Baxter, and Aragon, who plays Lord Tubbington, and were given free, printed copies to take home.
