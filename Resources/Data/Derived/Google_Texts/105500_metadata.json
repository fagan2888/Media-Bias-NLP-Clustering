Issues surrounding the morality of rejecting health coverage 100% paid for by the federal government for three years and never less than 90% thereafter have been widely explored. In addition, the fact that NC is giving up 25,000 jobs by turning down these billions, has also been noted. Less visible however are the statewide job cuts among hospitals \u2013 especially rural hospitals \u2013 that are forming a sort of slow motion disaster caused in large part by McCrory and the NC General Assembly.\n\nI\u2019ve assembled just a few of the recent stories from across the state to illustrate what is going on in our rural communities as a result of NC\u2019s failure to expand coverage. So far I\u2019ve found eleven hospitals and health clinics across our state that have already announced significant layoffs or even closure of facilities and I only expect this number to grow. Together there are over 560 layoffs already. All cite as a major reason for their layoffs the decision by Governor McCrory and the General Assembly not to expand Medicaid.

He estimates the impact of the decisions on Randolph Hospital will be $5 million.\u201d [Read more.]\n\nColumbus Regional Hospital: 28 jobs cut (Columbus County)\n\n[Why?]\n\n\u201c\u2022 The state\u2019s decision not to expand Medicaid coverage for the uninsured; and\n\n\u2022 The state\u2019s recent decision to dramatically cut Medicaid reimbursements. \u201c [Read more.]\n\nSoutheastern Health: 5 jobs cut, pay reductions for 95 nurses (Robeson County)\n\n\u201cState Sen. Michael Walters, who represents Robeson and Columbus counties, said this morning that he is concerned about the financial effect, especially on the state\u2019s rural hospitals, of reductions in Medicare and Medicaid payments. He also said the state \u201cmade a big mistake\u201d when it failed to approve Medicaid expansion.\u201d [Read more.]\n\n\u201cHad the legislature voted differently, Southeastern would have picked up about $3.7 million in reimbursements, Johnson said.\u201d [Read more.]\n\nMission Hospital: 70 jobs cut (Buncombe County)\n\nAs all of you know, we face numerous challenges: healthcare reform, federal sequestration, lack of Medicaid expansion and Medicaid cuts.
