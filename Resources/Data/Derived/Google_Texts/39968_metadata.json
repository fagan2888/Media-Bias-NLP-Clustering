Steve Beshear\u2019s $20 billion budget included nearly $190 million for Kindergarten-through-grage 12 education, even at the expense of broad 5 percent cuts to almost 20 state agencies. But while Beshear is being praised for his commitment to reinvest in education in actuality, he\u2019s paying for that investment with $800 million dollars owed to the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System.\n\nThat pension\u2019s unfunded liability could wreck financial apocalypse for the state.\n\nTobe is a former trustee of the Kentucky Retirement Systems turned whistleblower with over 30 years of public and private experience in financial investments.\n\nFor more than a decade, Tobe said, legislators and governors from both parties have underfunded the Kentucky Employee Retirement System\u2014which provides pensions to state employees\u2014to its current abysmal rate of 23.2 percent funding for non-hazardous pay, making it one of the worst in the nation.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to be \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 for a long time,\u201d Tobe said. \u201cWe\u2019re all gonna keep saying, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re just fine,\u2019 and we\u2019re gonna be \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 for a long, long time. \u2026 The KERS is definitely a zombie pension, and then we\u2019ve got others that are working their way to that area.\u201d\n\nThe effect has caused the state\u2019s credit rating to plummet, increased interest rates on bond debt used to fund construction projects and forced lawmakers to seriously consider tax reform.\n\nIn other words, Tobe says, the undead chickens are coming home to roost: Kentucky\u2019s pension liability remains one of the worst in the nation, at upwards of tens of billions of dollars, and Tobe says that an attempted legislative fix pass by the General Assembly last year is only slowing the decay in lieu of massive structural changes in Kentucky\u2019s revenue stream.\n\nTobe has written a book called \u201cKentucky Fried Pensions.\u201d In it, he alleges willful ignorance by the executive branch regarding improprieties within KRS, which included playing exorbitant fees to private middlemen to secure investment opportunities.\n\nThe federal Securities and Exchange Commission investigated KRS, and while it criticized the pension for its lack of transparency in its employment of highly paid \u201cplacement agents,\u201d it did not find evidence of pay-to-play schemes. The investigation remains open and concluded that parties at KRS are not exonerated.\n\nBut for our purposes, Tobe\u2019s book details how elected officials from both parties systematically underfunded the pension to balance the budget. Since then, he\u2019s been interviewed by journalists from Rolling Stone magazine to The New York Times, and works as a private consultant on investments from public pensions to hedge funds.\n\n\u201cIf you take all the pensions for teachers and retiree health together, you probably have to put in, I think it\u2019s around $2.5 billion a year to make what the actuaries say is a normal payment. We\u2019ve only been putting in $1.5 billion, so we\u2019ve been shorting it a billion a year. And the people in Frankfort have been doing it so long, they think that\u2019s the normal.\u201d\n\nLast yea,r the General Assembly passed a pension reform bill that aims to contribute $100 million toward the KERS pension according to the actuarially recommended contribution, which is accountant-speak for the amount of money needed to pay into the pension fund in order to make it solvent.\n\nBut the pension reform bill only stipulates that that money be deposited straight into the state\u2019s general fund without mandating that it be spent on the pension liability.\n\nAnd even if the money is spent on the pension, $100 million isn\u2019t enough to cover the total $1.5 billion a year liability that KERS initially requested from the legislature, Tobe said. Pension advocate Jim Carroll, a state retiree, agrees, but said the pledge to start funding system is a step in the right direction.\n\nBut without a much larger, dedicated revenue stream, the pension issue becomes a problem that threatens to drag two of the state\u2019s other largest pension systems\u2014the Kentucky Teacher Retirement System and the County Employee Retirement System\u2014down with it.\n\nBy underfunding pensions to such low levels, Tobe said, the pensions can enter a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d whereby a pension doesn\u2019t have enough money to make investments, and instead drains money from other areas just to keep the checks going out the door. And in the interconnected world of finance, large liabilities can impact the state\u2019s credit rating, making it more expensive to issue bonds, therefore impacting toll rates on construction projects like the Ohio River Bridges or the Mountain Parkway Expansion.\n\nHere\u2019s Tobe again:\n\n\u201cBasically, the deficit\u2019s been like a billion a year, and then you know when the governor comes forth and says, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got another $100 million for pensions,\u2019 that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a hundred million: It means we\u2019re only going under $900,000 instead of a billion a year.\u201d\n\nGary Harbin, head of the teachers retirement system, told lawmakers in September that that pension will need $800 million over the next two years to prevent it from ballooning into a $23 billion liability due in part to changes in federal accounting practices.\n\n\u201cThis is our projections for what we need into the pension plan for the next biennium: $390 million in the first year, and $400 million in the second year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe situation is dire enough that Harbin told lawmakers he is considering selling state land to shore up the fund.\n\nBut Beshear\u2019s budget proposal passed on the issue, which affects about 140,000 current and retired educations, effectively kicking the can down the road to whoever is unlucky enough to get elected governor of Kentucky in 2015.\n\nWhen asked why, Beshear said, simply:\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the money gonna come from?\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, the short answer is we don\u2019t have any extra money to infuse into that system.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s budget director, Jane Driskell, explained that the governor\u2019s budget proposal does include language to address the issue, just not any time soon.\n\nBeshear explained:\n\n\u201cThe language expresses our intent to create that mechanism that will eventually start putting money in there. But, uh, in all honesty, over the next two years, there is no money created with that intent to put into the system.\u201d\n\nHarbin has said that he will ask lawmakers to borrow more money in the form of pension obligation bonds to help shore up the pension.\n\nIn order for the state to finally get serious about putting its financial house in order, Tobe said, it must commit itself to transparency when it comes to decisions that affect Kentucky\u2019s economy.\n\nHe said decisions made in darkness only cause concern for national credit ratings and investors who might be wary of doing business with a state that doesn\u2019t disclose the totality of its finances.\n\nBeyond that, lawmakers would have to raise taxes well beyond even the most extreme tax increases recommended by the state\u2019s Blue Ribbon Commission on Tax Reform. Or, at worst, federal bailouts that come in the form of spending programs not unlike the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t believe you when you say you need money because they felt they\u2019ve been lied to for so long,\u201d Tobe said. \u201d So there is a whole cultural thing there that I think we need to at least get started on trying to get honest with people about what the situation is. And maybe the next governor probably might be doing that. Because, I mean, he is starting in a very big hole.\u201d\n\nBut as both chambers of the General Assembly gear up for closed-door budget talks, it\u2019s more likely you\u2019ll run into a zombie first.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "\u201cThey was saying on the news, some kind of virus\u2026 things got crazy\u2026 man, you won\u2019t believe the panic\u2026 the broadcasts stopped, and that was the last we...", "title": "Kentucky's Zombie of a Pension Problem - 89.3 WFPL", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 346, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kentucky_State_Capitol3.jpg", "height": 379}, "updated_time": "2014-10-14T11:54:56-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/kentuckys-zombie-pension-problem/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cThey was saying on the news, some kind of virus\u2026 things got crazy\u2026 man, you won\u2019t believe the panic\u2026 the broadcasts stopped, and that was the last we...", "title": "Kentucky's Zombie of a Pension Problem - 89.3 WFPL", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kentucky_State_Capitol3.jpg", "creator": "@WFPLNews", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Local News", "published_time": "2014-01-24T12:47:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-14T11:54:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf9c\"", "article_summary": "Tobe is a former trustee of the Kentucky Retirement Systems turned whistleblower with over 30 years of public and private experience in financial investments.\nBut without a much larger, dedicated revenue stream, the pension issue becomes a problem that threatens to drag two of the state\u2019s other largest pension systems\u2014the Kentucky Teacher Retirement System and the County Employee Retirement System\u2014down with it.\nBut the pension reform bill only stipulates that that money be deposited straight into the state\u2019s general fund without mandating that it be spent on the pension liability.\nBut for our purposes, Tobe\u2019s book details how elected officials from both parties systematically underfunded the pension to balance the budget.\nPension advocate Jim Carroll, a state retiree, agrees, but said the pledge to start funding system is a step in the right direction."}
