Talk about knowing the difference between the good stuff and the cheap stuff.

City police are looking for a man who allegedly stole a secured bottle of cognac, worth $2,849, from a Routes 1 & 9 liquor store.

According to police, a bottle of Remy Martin Louis XIII cognac stored in a secured cabinet at the Pied Piper Liquor store in Aviation Plaza shopping center, Routes 1 & 9, was reported stolen around 8:55 p.m. Saturday.

When the store owner reviewed video surveillance, a man was observed removing the lock on a cabinet and taking the high-priced liquor bottle. The owner told police that the man had previously been in the store and allegedly removed other bottles of liquor without paying.

Detectives believe the man may be a local resident.

Anyone with information on the theft or who can identify the man is asked to call Detective Michael Burnette at 908-474-8535 or email crimetips@lpdnj.org.
