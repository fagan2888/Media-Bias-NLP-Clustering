Why To Exercise Today: It Could Make Your Wine Work For You

Ah, this study is as delicious as a heady red Burgundy. Just presented at the European Society of Cardiology conference in Barcelona, it found that both red and white wine are good for your health — but only if you exercise. The Atlantic reports here on the study, titled “In Vino Veritas”:

Among those who worked out twice per week and drank wine, there was significant improvement in cholesterol levels (increased HDL and decreased LDL) after a year of wine—red or white, no matter. “Our current study shows that the combination of moderate wine drinking plus regular exercise improves markers of atherosclerosis,” said Táborský, “suggesting that this combination is protective against cardiovascular disease.”

The Atlantic piece is redolent of other rich flavors, and worth a full read — but for now, just think, if these findings are borne out, your workout could transform your (moderately consumed) mead into medicine.
