Afrezza has not been before an Advisory Committee before this round.

All eyes are now on the FDA, which has scheduled a Prescription Drug User Fee Action (PDUFA) date of July 15, 2014.\n\nAnd if the FDA approves the drug, commercialization awaits. MannKind has not yet announced a marketing partner, and Pfizer's past difficulty marketing its own inhaled insulin, Exubera, is enough to give some investors pause.\n\nIn the video below, from Wednesday's edition of Where The Money Is, Motley Fool health care analyst Michael Douglass lays out why he is comfortable avoiding the stock for the time being.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "18:30", "description": "Even if the FDA approves Afrezza, there are still plenty of questions about the stock and its opportunity.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_single-control_50", "author": "Michael Douglass and Dave Williamson", "promo": "Even if the FDA approves Afrezza, there are still plenty of questions about the stock and its opportunity.", "twitter": {"title": "Is It Time to Buy MannKind? --  The Motley Fool", "description": "Even if the FDA approves Afrezza, there are still plenty of questions about the stock and its opportunity.", "site": "@themotleyfool"}, "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "Even if the FDA approves Afrezza, there are still plenty of questions about the stock and its opportunity.", "title": "Is It Time to Buy MannKind? --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/05/23/is-it-time-to-buy-mannkind.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffool%2Ftmf-logo.png&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "headline": "Is It Time to Buy MannKind?", "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-health-care", "STORY_UID": "41ca9d78-e270-11e3-a3e1-0050569d32b9", "pitch": 681, "date": "2014-05-23T22:30:00Z", "gsa_date": "2014 05 23", "tickers": "MNKD", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0e5\"", "article_summary": "Editor's Note: In the video, analyst Michael Douglass incorrectly states that Afrezza had a previous Advisory Committee positive recommendation.\nThe Motley Fool and the analyst regret the error.\nAfrezza has not been before an Advisory Committee before this round.\nIn the video below, from Wednesday's edition of Where The Money Is, Motley Fool health care analyst Michael Douglass lays out why he is comfortable avoiding the stock for the time being.\nMannKind (NASDAQ:MNKD) has been on a tear since the beginning of the year, with the stock up over 50% year to date in large part due to a positive Advisory Committee recommendation for its inhaled insulin drug Afrezza."}
