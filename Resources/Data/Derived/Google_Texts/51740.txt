Furred, feathered and finned residents will have to share the stage when a la Carte festival returns to the Milwaukee County Zoo from Thursday to Sunday, with national and local music acts, 28 restaurant vendors and activities for children.

Besides more than 50 local bands performing throughout the grounds, headliners will include country singer Cassadee Pope on Thursday, BoDeans co-founder Sam Llanas and the Gin Blossoms, both Friday, and longtime Eagles guitarist Don Felder on Saturday.

Restaurants at a la Carte this year include newcomers Vagabond, Burke's Irish Castle, Milwaukee Brat House, Miss Beverly's Deluxe Barbeque and Peter Sciortino Bakery.

Admission, which includes entertainment, is $14.25 for adults, $11.25 for ages 3 to 12 and $13.25 for those 60 and older. Children 2 and younger are admitted for free. Tickets for food, zoo rides and special attractions can be bought separately.

More information about the event, sponsored by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and presented by Meijer, is at milwaukeezoo.org.
