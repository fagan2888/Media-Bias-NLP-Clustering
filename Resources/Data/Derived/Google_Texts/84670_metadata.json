When asked specifically about President Obama\u2019s handling of foreign policy, the percentage of those who approve drops to 38 percent, while a majority of Americans\u201451 percent\u2014disapprove of his handling of foreign policy. These results remain largely unchanged since August.\n\nA third of political independents (includes partisan leaners) say they approve of both President Obama\u2019s job performance and his handling of foreign policy. Roughly 54 percent disapprove of his handling of both.\n\nDemocrats are more likely to favor Obama\u2019s overall job performance (76%) than foreign policy handling (65%).

Only about 12 percent of Republicans approve of either the president\u2019s overall job performance or foreign policy.\n\nYoung people still like the President: 49 percent of Americans between the ages of 18-34 approve of the way Barack Obama is handling his job as President. This number slightly declines to 40 percent who approve of his foreign policy. Americans over 55 are nearly equally likely to both disapprove of the president\u2019s foreign policy and overall job performance (56% disapprove, 36% approve).\n\nSignificant perception differences remain across race and ethnicity.
