He was one of four experts who testified of the risks of 500 million lines of untested Healthcare.gov computer code.\n\nThose experts testified that the personal information of millions of Americans is at risk, including Social Security numbers, birthdays, incomes, home mortgages, and addresses. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., called it the \u201cmother lode for identity theft.\u201d\n\nMorgan Wright, a cyberterrorism expert and CEO of Crowd Sourced Investigations, said trying to fix a line of code could open up a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d of unintended consequences and security risks, and that changing a website on the fly was not a good idea.\n\n\u201cYou create an unintended series of cascading events you have no control over because you don\u2019t have a grasp of what the code is actually doing,\u201d he said.\n\nFred Chang, distinguished chair in cybersecurity at Southern Methodist University, testified that security seemed almost an afterthought in the website design.\n\nBut aside from technical vulnerabilities is the fact that the \u201cnavigators\u201d supposed to guide enrollees, including former members of Acorn, have been hired without basic background checks. At least one had an outstanding arrest warrant for check fraud.\n\nWorse, Henry Chao, deputy chief information officer of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that operates HealthCare.gov, said that up to 40% of the website, including the payment system, has yet to be built.\n\nSo we weren\u2019t surprised to hear that Shane Smith, of Fort Collins, Colo. says his dog Baxter received a letter informing him that a health insurance account had been opened in his name. His dog\u2019s name was supposed to be one of the security questions designed to keep his information private and secure.\n\nAsked whether \u201cany of you advise an American citizen to use this website as the security issues now exist,\u201d each of the experts said no.\n\nIndeed, it shouldn\u2019t happen even to a dog.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Security: Computer security experts testify that the unfinished health care marketplace portal places the personal information of millions at risk on a poorly", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Security: Computer security experts testify that the unfinished health care marketplace portal places the personal information of millions at risk on a poorly designed and built site that is a hack\u2026", "title": "ObamaCare Website Is Like \u2018IdentityTheft.Gov\u2019", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/obamacare-website-has-major-security-flaws/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDeditorials"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2013-11-20 15:43:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-20T15:43:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Fred Chang, distinguished chair in cybersecurity at Southern Methodist University, testified that security seemed almost an afterthought in the website design.\nHe was one of four experts who testified of the risks of 500 million lines of untested Healthcare.gov computer code.\nNot only is the poorly designed and still only partially built ObamaCare website, Healthcare.gov, vulnerable to attack by computer hackers, it already may have been comprised, cybersecurity expert David Kennedy told a House Science, Space, & Technology Committee hearing on Tuesday.\nAsked whether \u201cany of you advise an American citizen to use this website as the security issues now exist,\u201d each of the experts said no.\nThose experts testified that the personal information of millions of Americans is at risk, including Social Security numbers, birthdays, incomes, home mortgages, and addresses."}
