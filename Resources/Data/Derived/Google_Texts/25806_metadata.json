Wayne Neal, passed away.\n\n\"I lost the two most important people in my life in a very short time,\" Neal said.\n\nNeal acknowledged that the months and weeks that followed those two deaths were \"a very dark time for me.\" But what helped her get through those times were three things that Neal said have always surrounded her \u0097 family, faith and music.\n\nThe Nettleton twins grew up in Topeka, Kan., and began studying piano at age 5. They gave their first recital at age 6.\n\n\"It really started earlier than that,\" Neal said. \"Our mother was very musical and played the piano. She would teach us songs when we were 2 1/2.\"\n\nThe sisters performed at churches and local functions, then went on to study at the Kansas City Conservatory of Music with the composer and pianist Victor Labunski.\n\n\"We started out doing four-hand pieces,\" Neal said. \"And those can be fun to play, working out how to stay out of each other's way. But we both really loved having the entire keyboard to ourselves. It made it more fun and made for a much larger, orchestral sound.\n\n\"We would do performances with orchestras,\" she said. \"But for the most part, we preferred to do our own music \u0097 just the two pianos. That just felt more natural for us \u0097 just the two of us together on stage.\"\n\nAnother reason was that the sisters liked to switch sides during the course of a program, without informing the audience of the change.\n\nOne of their New York concerts was attended by Maxim Shapiro, a noted Russian pianist during the 1940s and '50s.\n\n\"We met him after the concert and asked him what he thought of the performance,\" Neal said, laughing. \"He thought about it for a while, then said he thought the girl on the right had more musical personality. When we told him that we had switched sides, he was very embarrassed.\"\n\nWhen they were 20, they made their debut at New York's Town Hall. Their performance caught the attention of Hurok, one of the country's leading impresarios, who would work with the twins for much of the next decade.\n\n\"In those days,\" said George Strella, Neal's brother-in-law, \"they would make a 78-rpm recording right from the microphone on stage. As people performed, the recording people would be cutting the disc in a room right underneath the Town Hall stage. When you were done, they'd brush the vinyl shavings off and hand you the disc.\"\n\nThat was about as close to a recording studio as the Nettleton Twins got. \"Those opportunities just didn't happen,\" Neal said.\n\nHowever, the twins did have those old vinyl records transferred to CD, and as Neal talked about the past, the music she and her sister performed that night \u0097 selections by Poulenc and Rachmaninoff \u0097 played in the background.\n\n\"I think we played the best we played that night,\" she said. \"You would think that we would be nervous, but we had no qualms at all. We dearly loved to play this music, and we were going to have a good time, and it went great.\"\n\nThe twins were later part of the \"Alaska Music Trail,\" a concert series designed to bring artists from the lower 48 states to what was soon to become United State No. 49.\n\n\"We were the first duo piano act to perform as part of that series,\" Neal recalled. \"And I think we were a bit unique. There were always piano duo act, some of which were siblings. But there weren't many twins who were doing this.\"\n\nThese days, there are several sets of twins \u0097 male and female \u0097 who are performing as duo-piano artists. One of the most acclaimed in recent years is Christina and Michelle Naughton, who will perform Saturday at the Tulsa PAC with the Tulsa Symphony Orchestra.\n\nOne of the pieces the Naughtons will perform Saturday is \"Carnival of the Animals\" by Saint-Saens.\n\nIt's a piece the Nettleton twins performed \u0097 but only once.\n\n\"We were asked to play that with an orchestra in St. Louis,\" Neal recalled. \"Ogden Nash, who wrote the words for the piece, was going to be there to recite his poetry, and it was all to broadcast on local television. But that was the only time we played that piece.\"\n\nThe sisters married in the late 1950s and began to put more emphasis on family than performing, \"although we kept playing. We both would play sacred music in church.\"\n\nThe bond between the sisters was such that they would either make it a point to live in the same town, or at least live close enough to allow for frequent visits.\n\nThe families moved to Tulsa in 1968, when Neal's husband, a cardiologist, was offered a position at Tulsa's St. John Hospital.\n\n\"We knew we wanted to make sure we could live our lives out together,\" Neal said. \"Jeanne and I had been together from the womb, and we did everything together. We enjoyed, we loved our twinship. We also have wonderful families. We've had a very rich life.\"\n\nThe music that's been playing came to a stop \u0097 a break between movements.\n\n\"Still,\" Neal said, with a sad smile, \"a part of myself is missing.\"\n\nNaughton Twins at PAC\n\nThe Tulsa Symphony Orchestra will present one of the leading piano duos as part of its upcoming concert, when the Naughton Twins perform with the orchestra 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Tulsa PAC, 101 E. Third St.\n\nTwin sisters Christina and Michelle Naughton are graduates of the Juilliard School of Music, and have performed with orchestras and in recitals around the world.\n\nTheir debut performance in Asia, with the Hong Kong Philharmonic, prompted one critic to say, \u201cJoining two hearts and four hands at two grand pianos, the Naughton sisters created an electrifying and moving musical performance.\u201d\n\nFor their first performance in Tulsa, the Naughtons will be featured in two works \u2014 Saint-Saens\u2019 \u201cCarnival of the Animals\u201d and the Concerto for Two Pianos by Mozart.\n\nGuest conductor Sarah Ioannides will also lead the orchestra in a performance of Saint-Saens\u2019 Symphony No. 3, the \u201cOrgan.\u201d\n\nTickets are $15-$70. 918- 596-7111, myticketoffice.com.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "When Joanne Nettleton Neal sits down at one of the two Baldwin baby grand pianos in her mid-Tulsa home and begins to play, the sound fills the room.", "title": "Pianist talks about career with her twin, whose piano is now silent", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/artsandentertainment/pianist-talks-about-career-with-her-twin-whose-piano-is/article_3e9b2bef-bb7e-5e22-aef4-40b02039715e.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/cf/acfebc47-6493-54b9-adbb-16e4efbbfdee/52edfc3fcaf59.preview-500.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "When Joanne Nettleton Neal sits down at one of the two Baldwin baby grand pianos in her mid-Tulsa home and begins to play, the sound fills the room.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "neal,pianos,piano,tulsa,twins,music,nettleton,sisters,performance,performed,artsandentertainment,scene,scenelatest", "news_keywords": "neal,pianos,piano,tulsa,twins,music,nettleton,sisters,performance,performed,artsandentertainment,scene,scenelatest"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecca\"", "article_summary": "It's a piece the Nettleton twins performed \u0097 but only once.\nTheir performances earned praise from critics and fellow pianists, such as the legendary Arthur Rubenstein, who said of the Nettleton Twins, \"They are absolutely wonderful.\"\nThe Nettleton twins grew up in Topeka, Kan., and began studying piano at age 5.\nThat was about as close to a recording studio as the Nettleton Twins got.\nThe sisters performed at churches and local functions, then went on to study at the Kansas City Conservatory of Music with the composer and pianist Victor Labunski."}
