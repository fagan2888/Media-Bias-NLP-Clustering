But does it also face a health care crisis?\n\nJesse Roman, who was born in Puerto Rico and is now chair of medicine at the University of Louisville, believes it does. Roman writes in an essay published online in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society that \u201cPuerto Rico appears to be spiraling into what some have characterized as the collapse of the island\u2019s health care system.\u201d\n\nRoman points to recently published news reports that indicate:\n\n\u2022 Medicare reimbursement rates in Puerto Rico are 70 percent less than in the 50 U.S. states.\n\n\u2022 Half of all the island\u2019s residents depend on Medicaid, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage. Islanders eligible for Medicare are more than twice as likely to be enrolled in Medicare Advantage than their fellow citizens living in the states (60 to 80 percent compared to 31 percent). CMS\u2019s planned 11 percent cut to Medicare Advantage will fall particularly hard on Puerto Rico.\n\n\u2022 Because of a cap placed in 1968 on Medicaid spending in U.S. territories, Puerto Rico will receive $400 million less this year than it would if it were a state.\n\n\u2022 Roman writes that the Puerto Rican health care system is further hurt because the Affordable Care Act as implemented in Puerto Rico did not require insurers to cover those with pre-existing conditions or impose an individual mandate to purchase insurance. As a result, many living on the island lack insurance.\n\n\u201cWithout intervention, it has been estimated that Puerto Rico\u2019s health care system will suffer the immediate loss of half a billion dollars, hospitals will lose $150 million, doctors will lose $115 million and pharmaceutical companies will lose $65 million\u2026.,\u201d Roman writes, adding that there is \u201clittle hope\u201d that the Puerto Rican government can close the gap.\n\nRoman notes that last year, 361 (about 3.6 percent) of the physicians practicing in Puerto Rico emigrated, according to the Puerto Rican Medical Association. As a specialist in respiratory medicine and critical care, he is particularly concerned that there are only 102 specialists in these areas serving the needs of 3.5 million residents.\n\n\u201cPuerto Rican children living on the island show a higher prevalence of asthma than Puerto Rican children living in the South Bronx,\u201d he writes. \u201cDeath rates [in Puerto Rico] for influenza and pneumonia are among the highest in the U.S.\u201d\n\nRoman notes in his essay that the Puerto Rican Healthcare Crisis Coalition proposes restoring Medical Advantage reimbursement rates, providing federal funds for local health insurance and asking the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to \u201cre-engineer\u201d the Puerto Rican health care system\u2019s \u201cpatchwork\u201d of rules.\n\n\u201cClearly this is a complex problem, but one that needs tackling soon before it spirals out of control,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile politics, race, and economics may cloud the issue, let\u2019s remember that the health of Americans is at stake.\u201d\n\nDr. Roman\u2019s article has been published online: http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201508-531PS\n\nContact: Reporters can contact Dr. Roman at j.roman@lousville.edu (This email address is not for publication.)\n\nThe Annals of the American Thoracic Society (AnnalsATS) is an online international journal that delivers up-to-date and authoritative coverage of adult and pediatric pulmonary and respiratory sleep medicine and adult medical critical care.
