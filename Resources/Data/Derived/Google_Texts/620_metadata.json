Small group plans could also increase by nearly 14 percent.\n\nUnitedHealthcare is seeking a 24.5 percent increase for its 2016 rates.\n\nSeveral other states are also experiencing severe rate increase requests, with rate hikes of up to 51 percent in New Mexico and more than 30 percent in Tennessee and Maryland.\n\nThe rate increase requests must be reviewed by federal agencies before being approved. Tuesday is the deadline for filing rate increase requests.\n\nThese rate hikes well outpace the rate of inflation and wage growth, making health care more and more expensive for Alabamians.\n\nOne researcher from the Heritage Foundation said these large price increases were to be expected because insurers underpriced for the first several years of the exchanges.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a phenomenon of insurers that priced more optimistically instead of defensively,\u201d said Ed Haislmaier, a senior research fellow in health policy studies at The Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cInsurers that were more optimistic in setting their premiums wound up having to play catch up. On one level, it\u2019s completely ObamaCare. It\u2019s catch-up by the ones who underpriced. The ones who had higher rates had realistic responses to ObamaCare, and the others are playing catch up.\u201d\n\nAll this occurs as the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) is poised to make a decision on whether the federally-run healthcare exchanges are permissible under the law. If SCOTUS rules against ObamaCare, it could effectively hobble the President\u2019s namesake legislation by shutting down exchanges in 34 states.\n\nLike this article? Hate it?
