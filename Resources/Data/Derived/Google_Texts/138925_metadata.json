About 41 percent of independent voters now say they approve of Mr. Obama\u2019s handling of economic issues. In November, just 24 percent approved, surveys show.\n\nLiberals also have jumped back on the bandwagon as Mr. Obama gears up for a two-year fight with Republicans who now control both the House and Senate. Seventy-seven percent of liberals now approve of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance, compared with 67 percent in early November, according to Gallup.\n\nBut analysts say the reasons for the rebound are complex and include indifference toward the lame-duck president.\n\n\u201cSome of the Democrats have returned to the fold. But I also think there\u2019s another interesting phenomenon,\u201d said Lara Brown, a political science professor at George Washington University. \u201cThe president is going to become irrelevant \u2026 the energy and intensity that people put on judging the president \u2014 either for or against \u2014 will literally start to move on to the [2016] candidates. So there will be this increasing irrelevance and indifference, and usually how it shows up is some level of sympathy, or recovery\u201d in the polls.\n\nThere are signs that the president\u2019s recovery in the polls is limited in its scope.\n\nFor example, the bounce hasn\u2019t extended to key swing states such as Iowa, Virginia and Colorado, where Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings are below the national average, a Quinnipiac survey released Thursday shows.\n\nStill, Mr. Obama remains far ahead of his predecessor, George W. Bush, whose approval rating was 37 percent at this point in his tenure.\n\nWithin Mr. Obama\u2019s larger recovery in the polls are better marks on several specific issues such as foreign policy \u2014 an improvement that even has extended to Republicans.\n\nIn November, just 7 percent of Republicans approved of the president\u2019s performance on national security. That number now stands at 12 percent, according to Gallup.\n\nThe president\u2019s overall approval rating on national security now is 36 percent, up from last fall\u2019s low 30s when Mr. Obama admittedly was struggling to develop a strategy to defeat the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria.\n\nBut perhaps the most notable jump has come among Hispanic voters, a key voting bloc that helped propel Mr. Obama to the Oval Office in 2008 and secured his reelection in 2012.\n\nLast year\u2019s executive action on immigration, despite its murky legal future, has had a dramatic impact on the president\u2019s approval ratings. About 65 percent of Hispanics now approve of Mr. Obama\u2019s job performance, compared to just 49 percent in early November, before the president announced he would half deportations for millions of illegal immigrants, according to Gallup figures.\n\nSpecialists say that number could begin to trend downward if it becomes clear Mr. Obama\u2019s actions will not be implemented.\n\nA federal judge this week halted the president\u2019s amnesty move, saying Mr. Obama had overstepped his bounds in attempting to grant legal status and benefits to millions of illegal immigrants.\n\nWhile Mr. Obama\u2019s poll numbers hit a record a low during the week of last November\u2019s midterm elections, the president argues his specific policies weren\u2019t to blame.\n\nHe contends that voters punished Democrats at the ballot box last November not because they disapproved of the administration\u2019s handling of the economy, its foreign policy or any other specific issues. Instead, he said Democrats flamed out in the midterms because of voter apathy and general frustration with government.\n\n\u201cWe had a very challenging midterm, despite good news, in part because two-thirds almost of eligible voters didn\u2019t vote,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser last week. \u201cAnd part of the challenge is that people have felt so cynical about government for so long, and the gridlock in Washington has been so fierce, that at a certain point, people just opt out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's approval ratings have spiked over the past two months, recovering from an election-season low as he's made inroads with independents, won back key allies such as ardent liberals and Hispanics and has even earned something of a sympathy vote, political analysts say.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s approval ratings have spiked over the past two months, recovering from an election-season low as he\u2019s made inroads with independents, won back key allies such as ardent liberals and Hispanics and has even earned something of a sympathy vote, political analysts say.", "title": "Obama\u2019s approval ratings on rise in 2015", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/19/obamas-approval-ratings-on-rise-in-2015/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/19/APTOPIX_Obama_National_Monuments.JPEG-04ae5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/19/APTOPIX_Obama_National_Monuments.JPEG-04ae5.jpg", "description": "President Obama's approval ratings have spiked over the past two months, recovering from an election-season low as he's made inroads with independents, won back key allies such as ardent liberals and", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama\u2019s approval ratings on rise in 2015"}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "article_summary": "Seventy-seven percent of liberals now approve of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance, compared with 67 percent in early November, according to Gallup.\nLast year\u2019s executive action on immigration, despite its murky legal future, has had a dramatic impact on the president\u2019s approval ratings.\nSpecialists say that number could begin to trend downward if it becomes clear Mr. Obama\u2019s actions will not be implemented.\nFor example, the bounce hasn\u2019t extended to key swing states such as Iowa, Virginia and Colorado, where Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings are below the national average, a Quinnipiac survey released Thursday shows.\nAbout 41 percent of independent voters now say they approve of Mr. Obama\u2019s handling of economic issues."}
