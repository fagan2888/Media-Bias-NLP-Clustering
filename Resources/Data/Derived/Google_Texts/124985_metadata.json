You\u2019ve gone all this time without something, so you\u2019re not going to risk that you lose a family member just to get it.\u201d\n\nImmigrants living in the United States illegally are prohibited from buying coverage on the state and federal exchanges and are not eligible for Medicaid. But their American-born children are eligible for federal subsidies or Medicaid, depending on their income. Immigrant advocates say that the parents often assume that their children are ineligible, or fear that they could be deported if they applied for coverage.\n\nUnlike other states, California allows young people who were granted deportation deferrals by the Obama administration to sign up for Medicaid. State Senator Ricardo Lara is expected to introduce legislation this week that would allow immigrants living here illegally to sign up for the exchange and receive state subsidies.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven among those living here legally, there is fear that receiving Medicaid or insurance subsidy will jeopardize their chance at citizenship by labeling them a \u201cpublic charge,\u201d a term used to refer to immigrants dependent on the government, experts say. The Obama administration has issued guidelines assuring immigrants that receiving medical assistance will not affect their immigration eligibility, but many health care officials say the guidelines have done little to quell fears and confusion.\n\nLatinos now make up nearly 50 percent of the overall population in California. Covered California officials and other outside experts have projected that Latinos should account for at least one-third of all those who sign up for coverage through the exchange. California is the only state to release enrollment numbers by ethnicity.\n\nMarisa Nu\u00f1ez first heard about the health care exchange from her daughter\u2019s teacher at school, and she was eager to find a counselor to help answer her questions. But after a week of making calls and being placed on hold for nearly an hour, Ms. Nu\u00f1ez gave up. Only her daughter\u2019s complaints about stomach pains for several days prompted Ms. Nu\u00f1ez to try again, when she discovered she would not be eligible to purchase insurance through Covered California, because she immigrated here illegally.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere I can go for help for me, which is scary,\u201d Ms. Nu\u00f1ez said. Although her oldest daughter, who came with her from Mexico a decade ago, is also barred from assistance, her two youngest children, both born in the United States, most likely qualify for Medicaid, an option she is exploring. \u201cI still do not know what my children can get or not,\u201d she said. \u201cI want the same thing as everybody else: a place for them to be able to go when they are sick.\u201d\n\nFor those like Ms. Nu\u00f1ez who have relied on walk-in clinics, cost is also a deterrent. Amanda Aguirre, the president of the Regional Center for Border Health in Yuma, Ariz., said many Latinos there felt the private plans available through the exchange were too expensive, even if they qualified for federal subsidies.\n\n\u201cThey still feel it\u2019s a very high premium, like it\u2019s another car payment or another mortgage payment, and they will not accept it,\u201d Ms. Aguirre said. \u201cThey go uncovered.\u201d\n\nMs. Aguirre said that in border communities like Yuma, many Latinos were accustomed to traveling to Mexico for \u201cvery cheap care\u201d and thus did not see the need for insurance. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to say, \u2018Hey, you don\u2019t have to go across the border,\u2019 \u201d she said. Many immigrants who have spent decades without insurance may also have difficulty understanding why they should pay for it now, experts said.\n\n\u201cYou need someone to sit down and explain why they really need comprehensive care, how they will be able to come into a doctor\u2019s office differently, how they can put this to their use,\u201d said Howard Kahn, the chief executive officer of L.A. Care, the largest public health insurance plan in the country and among the most successful in attracting Latino customers.\n\nCalifornia has begun taking steps to increase enrollment among Latinos, including adding enrollment counselors to its Spanish-language hotline center. Health plans have also begun advertising on food trucks that cater to Latino neighborhoods, and marketing campaigns are being reformulated to convey a message that officials believe will resonate there.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the lack of dollars that\u2019s the problem here, but there\u2019s obviously something missing in the execution,\u201d said Elvia Delgado, the vice president for AltaMed, a clinic in eastern Los Angeles that has signed up more than 11,000 patients in Medicaid and Covered California in the past four months. \u201cWe need to effectively communicate to people that this is something for them.\u201d\n\nMayra Alvarez, the associate director of the Office of Minority Health at the Department of Health and Human Services, said that the Spanish version of the federal exchange website, www.cuidadodesalud.gov, was now \u201cfully functional\u201d and that the Obama administration was ramping up efforts to draw Hispanics to it, including running a Spanish-language television ad in heavily Hispanic markets.\n\n\u201cSurvey after survey tells us the interest is there, and when you talk to folks and answer their questions, that\u2019s when their interest is even more piqued,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a matter of getting out there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140213201450, "twitter": {"description":
