Trey Radel (R-Fla.), who was busted last fall for cocaine possession.\n\nThe announcement came on Radel's first day back on Capitol Hill after a leave of absence he spent at a drug rehabilitation facility. In a statement announcing his candidacy, Kreegel, a Punta Gorda doctor, took a shot at Radel's October arrest.\n\n\u201cFrom Obamacare to Washington\u2019s out-of-control spending to the breaches of national security, the issues facing our country are serious matters that deserves serious, sober representation,\u201d Kreegel said. \u201cSouthwest Florida should expect a Congressman who can lead, a Congressman without distractions, a Congressman they can trust.\u201d\n\nShortly after Radel pleaded guilty to cocaine possession in November, the Values are Vital PAC was created to raise funds for a potential Republican challenger in the 2014 primary. The political action committee raised more than $1 million in December.\n\nThough the group has not yet thrown its support behind a specific candidate, Values are Vital chairman Anthony Farhat made a contribution to Kreegel in the 2012 primary, which Radel won. Farhat told the Tampa Bay Times last Thursday that he believed Radel \"created his own demise.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to scare or intimidate anybody. I\u2019m just trying to do what I can as a business owner in this district,\" Farhat said. \"I\u2019m trying to say, 'Hey, I don\u2019t want to see our district continue to make mistakes.'\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Senate Seats Up For Grabs In 2014 Senate Seats Up For Grabs In 2014\n\n1 of 33 Sen.
