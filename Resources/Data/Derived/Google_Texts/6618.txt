Friends and loved ones of the victims from last weekend's shooting rampage hold memorial services and fundraisers to help the victims' families.

Three separate events were held Sunday in Colorado Springs; one for each of the shooting victims from the deadly shooting rampage Halloween morning.

Friends of Andrew Myers held a small memorial service to remember the Army veteran. They say he was a good friend, who would give you the shirt off his back.

Friends of Jennifer Vasquez opened up their barber shop to host a fundraiser to help her family with funeral expenses. One Stop Shop barber shop donated all of the money they made for haircuts today as well as customer donations to Jennifer's family.

Christy Galella's family and friends held a fundraiser dinner and memorial service. The money will go to help her two young children and to pay for her final expenses.

Jennifer Vasquez's funeral services were held Saturday afternoon. Both Christy and Andrew's bodies have been transported back to their home states to be buried.

You can still donate to the victim's families through online donation pages. We have those links on KKTV.com under the Find It tab.
