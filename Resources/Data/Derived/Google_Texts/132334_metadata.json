Coupled with the \u201cbusy nature\u201d of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s compliance requirements, all parties are demanding technology-based solutions, a panel of experts said Thursday at Employee Benefit Adviser\u2019s Dig|Benefits conference in Austin, Texas.\n\nToday\u2019s \u201cintense\u201d regulatory environment is setting the stage for innovation in benefits as \u201ccompetitive pressures due to high costs are creating an appetite for alternatives, even in the traditionally immune small-business sector,\u201d said David Reid, founder and CEO of EaseCentral.\n\nAlthough individual small businesses may not have many employees, the sector itself is a large market, with close to 98% of all employers in the United States totaling more than 60 million employees, according to Reid.\n\nThese small businesses are looking for innovative, tech-based solutions, Reid explained. Further, as more millennials enter the workforce, they are eager for more information and want more choice with their employer-provided benefits. \u201cTechnology provides the ability to do that,\u201d Reid said. \u201c[Technology] can take difficult or complex processes to roll out to a group and make it simple.\u201d\n\nEveryone is busy and benefits are complicated, Reid said. \u201cWith [technology,] you can show each employee what their [insurance] options are and what their cost is.\u201d\n\nFor a small broker who wants to be nimble and compete with the big firms, \u201ctechnology combined with innovative approaches allows the smallest broker within the small business sector to take an approach only large [brokers] could [previously] take,\u201d Reid added.\n\nMaking the leap\n\nOne example of a newer tech solution is One Medical Group, a provider of primary care physician services.\n\nEmployees will say they don\u2019t believe they can call their primary care physician when something goes wrong, but One Medical aims to be \u201chyper-accessible,\u201d through technology, said Sandeep Acharya, VP of growth at the San Francisco-based company.\n\nFinding healthcare is about patients making better choices, he explained. \u201cWe want patients to make thousands and millions of better choices \u2013 but on their own, patients don\u2019t know how to make those choices and the result is disastrous,\u201d he said.\n\nTo date, employers and brokers have rolled out programs, such as high deductible health plans, which are not achieving the goals they set out to achieve. \u201cThey make the patient accountable for navigating care but [patients] don\u2019t know the difference between a urgent condition and not,\u201d Acharya said.\n\nOne Medical aims to make great care accessible, which can \u201cchange the equation,\u201d he said. \u201cMore prevention plus better quality and experience of care, equals lower cost.\u201d Employers who partner with One Medical have had a 7% total cost of care reduction, according to a survey by insurer Anthem.\n\nIt is a similar story at Oscar, a health insurer in New York, New Jersey and Texas, which uses technology to better engage employees. \u201cWe believe we can do better as an industry,\u201d by engaging employees and simplifying benefits, which are a complex topic full of jargon, said Vijay Kedar, general manager, Texas, for Oscar Health Insurance.\n\n\u201cAt its core, the role of health insurance is more than building a network and connecting members,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is aligning members and providers through a backbone of technology.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"displaytag": "Technology", "sailthru.author": "Brian M.
