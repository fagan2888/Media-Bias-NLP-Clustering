What\u2019s going on? And why can\u2019t the press get this kind of thing right?\n\nHere are 9 things to know and share . . .\n\n1) What is the basis of this story?\n\nIn July and August, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica ran a pair of open letters to the pope by Dr. Eugenio Scalfari, an atheist commentator.\n\nIn his open letters, Dr. Scalfari asked the pope a number of questions.\n\nMuch to everyone\u2019s surprise, though thoroughly in keeping with his way of doing things, Pope Francis wrote a response, which the paper also published.\n\nThe Italian original is on the Vatican web site.\n\nHere\u2019s a (not very well-edited) English translation from La Repubblica.\n\n2) What did Pope Francis say in the letter?\n\nBasically, he attempts to enter into a cordial and constructive dialogue, which is exactly what you\u2019d expect.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t go through Scalfari\u2019s previous open letters point by point (presumably, that would make his own reply overly long), but he makes some general points and then attempts to answer some questions Scalfari posed.\n\nOne of these concerns the salvation of atheists.\n\n3) How did the press and blogosphere react to what he said?\n\nLa Repubblica itself gave the story a quite accurate headline: \u201cPope Francisco writes to La Repubblica: \u2018An open dialogue with non-believers.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a good summary of what the pope wrote.\n\nIn England, however, The Independent headlined it \u201cPope Francis assures atheists: You don\u2019t have to believe in God to go to heaven.\u201d\n\nThis was inaccurate, as we will see.\n\nThe matter got further twisted in the blogosphere, when Evangelical blogger Jay Younts did a piece on it headlined \u201cThe Pope declares Man can save himself.\u201d\n\nThis piece was then quoted by Kirk Cameron, who gave it the same headline and helped it go viral.\n\n4) What did Pope Francis actually say about atheists and salvation?\n\nHere is the passage:\n\nFirst of all, you ask if the God of the Christians forgives those who do not believe and do not seek faith.\n\nGiven that\u2014and this is fundamental\u2014God's mercy has no limits if he who asks for mercy does so in contrition and with a sincere heart, the issue for those who do not believe in God is in obeying their own conscience.\n\nIn fact, listening and obeying it, means deciding about what is perceived to be good or to be evil.\n\nThe goodness or the wickedness of our behavior depends on this decision.\n\nIn this passage, you\u2019ll note that after introducing the topic of salvation, Pope Francis begins by saying God\u2019s mercy has no limits \u201cif he who asks for mercy does so in contrition and with a sincere heart.\u201d\n\nThis statement appears to apply to believers\u2014the ones you would expect to ask God for mercy with contrition, etc.\n\nPope Francis then pivots to discuss \u201cthe issue for those who do not believe in God.\u201d\n\nHe says that for them \u201cthe issue\u201d is following their conscience, which will result in good behavior.\n\nThis is what the press, etc., have been interpreting as him saying that they can be saved.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t actually say that.\n\nBelievers also need to follow their conscience, and doing so will result in them having right behavior. But if they don\u2019t follow their consciences then they sin and need to ask for mercy with contrition and a sincere heart.\n\nWhat are atheists supposed to do if they don\u2019t follow their consciences?\n\nPope Francis does not address this question.\n\n5) That\u2019s confusing. What is going on here?\n\nThere has already been one case in which Pope Francis made remarks that the press took as saying atheists could be saved, yet when his remarks were examined closely, they didn\u2019t say that at all.\n\nYou can read about that case here.\n\nNow we have something similar happening.\n\nWhy?\n\nOne reason, I suspect, is that the pope may be trying to remain within what the Magisterium has already said.\n\n6) What has the Magisterium already said on the subject of atheists and salvation?\n\nIn Lumen Gentium 16, the Second Vatican Council addressed the subject of \u201cthose who, without blame on their part, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God and with His grace strive to live a good life.\u201d\n\nThis passage, like Pope Francis, stops short of saying that people in this condition can be saved. Instead, it says:\n\nWhatever good or truth is found amongst them is looked upon by the Church as a preparation for the Gospel.\n\nShe knows that it is given by Him who enlightens all men so that they may finally have life.\n\nThis passage speaks of the elements of \u201cgood and truth\u201d found among those who have \u201cnot yet\u201d arrived at a knowledge of God as \u201ca preparation for the Gospel\u201d so that \u201cthey may finally have life.\u201d\n\nThus when the text says that divine providence does not \u201cdeny the helps necessary for salvation\u201d to these people, it may not mean that they can be saved without faith but that God is giving them the helps that they need to come to the point of faith and thus be saved.\n\nThe fact that the text is open to both of these interpretations was noted by Cardinal Aloys Grillmeier, who was one of the authors of Lumen Gentium, in his commentary on this part of the document (see Herbert Vorgrimler, ed., Commentary on the Documents of Vatican II, vol. 1, p. 184).\n\nThe same point is made by Ralph Martin in his recent book Will Many Be Saved?\n\n7) Why would the Council not answer this question?\n\nOne possibility is that the Council fathers were not agreed on the matter.\n\nThere had already been magisterial interventions which indicated that non-Catholics could be saved if they were innocently (invincibly) ignorant and had at least an implicit desire for baptism.\n\nBut there had not been such statements made about people who apparently have no faith in God whatsoever and who may consciously oppose belief in God.\n\nThe Magisterium also tends to move slowly, allowing the Holy Spirit to guide the Church and its doctrinal development over time.\n\nMany of the Council fathers may thus have thought it was not yet time to pronounce on the question of whether atheists can be saved without coming to explicit faith in this life.\n\nIt thus appears that the Council left this an open question in Catholic theology.\n\n8) Why wouldn\u2019t Pope Francis just settle the matter?\n\nOne reason might be that he doesn\u2019t think adequate study has been given to the question yet, and so he didn\u2019t want to go beyond what the Council said.\n\nThen there is the fact that letters to newspapers aren\u2019t the place for doctrinal development to take place.\n\nAnother possibility is that he didn\u2019t want to appear to tell Dr. Scalfari and other atheists that they\u2019re fine where they are, and so he spoke in a very measured way that would invite them to consider what they really need to do when they have sinned: ask for mercy \u201cin contrition and with a sincere heart\u201d\u2014in other words, to come to faith.\n\nHis intent may have been to engage in a cordial, public dialogue that sidestepped the question of whether atheists can be saved without coming to explicit faith and that implicitly encouraged them to come to faith and ask for mercy.\n\nThis also may have been a reason that Vatican II phrased itself the way that it did.\n\n9) So the media and Evangelical blogosphere reaction was wrong?\n\nYes.\n\nContrary to claims otherwise, Pope Francis did not say that atheists can go to heaven without coming to faith, and he most certainly did not say that man can save himself by his own efforts.\n\nIndeed, he speaks of the need for God\u2019s mercy.\n\nWhat Now?\n\nIf you like the information I've presented here, you should join my Secret Information Club.\n\nIf you're not familiar with it, the Secret Information Club is a free service that I operate by email.\n\nI send out information on a variety of fascinating topics connected with the Catholic faith.\n\nIn fact, the very first thing you\u2019ll get if you sign up is information about what Pope Benedict said about the book of Revelation.\n\nHe had a lot of interesting things to say!\n\nIf you\u2019d like to find out what they are, just sign up at www.SecretInfoClub.com or use this handy sign-up form:\n\nJust email me at jimmy@secretinfoclub.com if you have any difficulty.\n\nIn the meantime, what do you think?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The press is full of accounts that, once again, claim that Pope Francis has said you don\u2019t need to\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "The press is full of accounts that, once again, claim that Pope Francis has said you don\u2019t need to believe in God to go to heaven.\n...", "title": "Did Pope Francis say atheists don\u2019t need to believe in God to be saved?
