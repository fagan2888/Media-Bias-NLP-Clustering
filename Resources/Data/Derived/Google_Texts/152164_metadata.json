His father also worked for the local health department, and his mother was a schoolteacher. From an early age, it was clear that Tom was an unusual boy. Focused, intense, and serious, Tom impressed adults with his discipline and maturity. He worked hard, studied diligently, and seemed to have little appetite for frivolity. Tall and gangly by his sophomore year, he played on the small school\u2019s basketball team as well as a regional team, where he compensated for a lack of innate ability with a ferocious dedication to practice and became the Sand Lizards\u2019 starting center. Early in his high-school career, friends say, he decided he would go to Harvard. He pursued the goal with single-minded passion. When he arrived in Cambridge in 1995, he was one of two rural Arkansans in his class.\n\nHarvard opened the eyes of the idealistic young man to a new world of intellectual possibility. \u201cAt Harvard College, I discovered political philosophy as a way of life,\u201d Cotton wrote, a few years later, on the dedication page that preceded his 92-page senior thesis on the Federalist Papers. The thesis, whose contents are revealed here for the first time, provides a window into a political candidate who is otherwise something of a cipher. Cotton, now a 37-year-old first-term congressman challenging Arkansas\u2019 incumbent senior senator, Mark Pryor, has largely been defined by his r\u00e9sum\u00e9: the impressive credentials, from Harvard to the elite echelons of the military, and the conservative philosophy, illustrated by a record of votes in Congress that puts him on the rightward extreme of today\u2019s Republican Party. He unites the factions of the Republican civil war: The establishment loves his background, while the Tea Party loves his ideological purity. The Weekly Standard\u2019s editor, William Kristol, considers him one of the GOP's most promising new faces; Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus calls him one of the party\u2019s top recruits; conservative bloggers long to speed the day when he appears on a national ticket. Yet Cotton retains an air of impenetrability, a blankness that has puzzled voters and pundits alike. And his failure to dominate the race has prompted prominent Republicans to worry that something is missing. Cotton\u2019s thesis fills in some of these gaps\u2014in ways some might find disturbing. A cogent and tightly argued document, it reveals the depth and intellectual roots of his reverence for American traditions. It also reveals a contrarian devotion to some ideals that seem out of date today. Cotton insists that the Founders were wise not to put too much faith in democracy, because people are inherently selfish, narrow-minded, and impulsive. He defends the idea that the country must be led by a class of intellectually superior officeholders whose ambition sets them above other men. Though Cotton acknowledges that this might seem elitist, he derides the Federalists\u2019 modern critics as mushy-headed and naive.\n\n\u201cAmbition characterizes and distinguishes national officeholders from other kinds of human beings,\u201d Cotton wrote. \u201cInflammatory passion and selfish interest characterizes most men, whereas ambition characterizes men who pursue and hold national office. Such men rise from the people through a process of self-selection since politics is a dirty business that discourages all but the most ambitious.\u201d In his Harvard senior thesis, Cotton insisted that the Founders were wise not to put too much faith in democracy, because people are inherently selfish, narrow-minded, and impulsive. Cotton was only summarizing the views of Publius, the collective pseudonym used by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay in the Papers. His reading is neither outr\u00e9 nor revisionist. Yet it seems significant that, out of all the ideas outlined in the Papers, these were the concepts Cotton chose to focus on and to defend forcefully against what he saw as more modish, inclusive ideas. To be sure, these words were written when Cotton was a mere undergraduate. But when I spoke to him in Arkansas recently\u2014sitting in his campaign RV, which is decorated with a camouflage motif and a large red, white, and blue combat-boot print, as he prepared to give a speech in Hot Springs\u2014he was eager to defend his views of a decade and a half before. He recited many of the thesis\u2019s contentions nearly word for word, including the quotation from Abraham Lincoln that appears on page 70: \u201cI have no [ambition] so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow-men,\u201d Lincoln said, \u201cby rendering myself worthy of their esteem.\u201d Men who seek national office, Cotton wrote in his thesis, are the most ambitious men, seeking the headiest sort of power over a nation\u2019s commerce, finance, and affairs of state. Self-selection ensures that they have \u201ca superior intelligence compared to the unambitious and to the lesser ambitious.\u201d This does not necessarily mean that they are wise, he notes, but \u201cit does imply some amount of sheer, raw brainpower. National officeholders will all possess something akin to shrewdness, cleverness, or perhaps even cunning.\u201d\n\nFrom the time he was a teenager, Cotton has been nurtured and groomed by conservative institutions\u2014scholars, think tanks, media, and advocacy groups\u2014to be the face of their political crusade. Pure, upright, and ideologically correct, he is their seemingly flawless mascot. (Conservatives would surely argue that a potent network consisting of regular academia and the mainstream media nurtures left-wing candidates.) And now he is finally on the cusp of achieving the platform consummate to his talents, a seat in the U.S. Senate. Cotton is a beanpole of a man, six foot five and rail-thin, with a long face, prominent nose, and eyes that tilt down at the corners. His affect is polite and polished; since a spate of articles earlier this year speculated that he suffered from a personability deficit, observers say he has become more diligent about smiling at people, asking them questions, and lingering over handshakes. (The effort can be a little forced: One voter complained to The Arkansas Times that Cotton had introduced himself to her twice at the same event.) His stump speech is a canned recitation of policy points, delivered in a near-monotone. Cotton\u2019s attempts to inject levity reveal a bitingly sarcastic sense of humor. At a Lions Club meeting in Conway, a midsize town north of Little Rock, I heard him open a recent speech with a lament about his wife\u2019s dog being insufficiently macho to serve as a campaign prop. (The dog is small, white, and fluffy, and its name is Cowboy, Cotton recounted in mock dismay.) To a voter who raised his hand to ask about the debt burden borne by future generations, Cotton retorted, \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll give you a better answer this time than I did the last time,\u201d an allusion to the fact that he\u2019d already discussed the issue in his speech. The candidate chuckled; the voter did not. \u201cNo, it\u2019s the same answer,\u201d Cotton continued, repeating his earlier spiel about the need to reduce spending. \u201cIf you have to vote against legislation that might bring home the bacon, then do so,\u201d he said.\n\nAt this appearance and others, many voters asked Cotton about his vote against $300 million in federal funding for the Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital in Little Rock. The vote had been featured in a dramatic recent Democratic commercial that said his priorities were \u201cnot with Arkansas children.\u201d Cotton laughed it off and told them not to believe those nasty negative ads. \u201cThe legislation had no specific funding\u201d for Arkansas, he said, and \u201cI don\u2019t support giving the president more leeway.\u201d He added, \u201cI ultimately did support later versions of the legislation, and I fully support Children\u2019s Hospital, of course. Next week, when you hear I don\u2019t support puppies, don\u2019t believe that either.\u201d But as John Brummett, the left-leaning columnist for The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, has pointed out, Cotton\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d votes were on meaningless, doomed budget bills; the one time the hospital appropriation was specifically at stake, Cotton voted against it. Every other Republican in the Arkansas congressional delegation voted in favor of the funding. \u201cHe voted against money for the hospital but won\u2019t admit it,\u201d Brummett wrote, in a column that was pressed into my hand by an 89-year-old Conway Lions Club member who urged me to read it. \u201cThus he obfuscates in the style of any other politician.\" His is a harsh, unyielding, judgmental political philosophy. \u201cI don\u2019t think Arkansas needs to bail out the Northeast,\u201d Cotton said of his vote against the Hurricane Sandy relief bill. It is not the only time Cotton has outdone even other Republicans with his conservative absolutism. He was the only Arkansas Republican to vote twice against the farm bill and five times against disaster-aid funding\u2014two initiatives that national conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation see as symptoms of big government, but that many rural Southerners rely on heavily. Cotton also was the only Arkansan to vote for a budget drafted by the Republican Study Committee that would slash spending, voucherize Medicare, and raise the eligibility age for Social Security to 70.\n\nThe day after his speech in Conway, I spoke to Cotton in Hot Springs. I asked him whether it was important to stand on principle even when doing so might be unpopular. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth, even in an election year, and that\u2019s what people are ready for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want traditional politicians like Mark Pryor, who\u2019ve been hanging around for 24 years, who trim and hedge and won\u2019t level with you.\u201d If that was the case, I asked, why not own the unpopular votes\u2014against the hospital funding, or the farm bill, or disaster relief\u2014as necessary medicine for an out-of-control federal budget? \u201cLook at what I\u2019ve said about disaster relief,\u201d Cotton replied. \u201cI support the traditional disaster-relief program FEMA administers. It is done by neutral, transparent criteria, and when communities like Vilonia or Mayflower are hit by a tornado, they can apply and receive that assistance.\u201d Sixteen people were killed and the two towns were nearly destroyed by a tornado in April of this year. Mayflower\u2019s mayor subsequently criticized Cotton for his disaster-aid votes. But, Cotton continued, \u201cWhat I don\u2019t support is a bill like Hurricane Sandy [relief] that is rushed through, that has $60 billion in new spending, much of which is not related to the disaster at all.\u201d Cotton\u2019s explanation sounded sensible enough; many House Republicans opposed the Sandy bill for similar reasons. Yet Cotton also voted against one bill that contained nothing but funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Cotton's campaign said he opposed that bill because the spending in it was not offset by budget cuts elsewhere.) In elections all over the country this year, a markedly more ideological class of Republican candidates, urged on by conservative donors and advocacy groups, promises to transform the Senate if elected. Many are nominees in red states like Arkansas, Louisiana, and North Carolina. Their candidacies pose a test to the zeal for extreme purity that has so consumed the Republican Party in recent years: Will it finally go too far, even for Republican voters? Recent polls have shown Cotton pulling ahead of Pryor. Yet the fact that Cotton\u2014the man with the golden r\u00e9sum\u00e9, running in a deep-red state, with the collective hopes of the American right on his shoulders, against an amiable, rather bland Democrat of no particular distinction\u2014is not running away with the contest has stoked a perception that he is underperforming. By this point four years ago, Arkansas\u2019 last incumbent Democratic senator to seek reelection, Blanche Lincoln, was behind by 20 points.\n\nCotton\u2019s legislative record may cost him votes: It is the principal subject of the millions of dollars in television advertisements his opponent and Democratic groups are airing against him. But it is in keeping with the rigidly idealistic persona, and the starkly moralistic worldview, he has exhibited since he was an undergraduate. It is a harsh, unyielding, judgmental political philosophy, one that makes little allowance for compassion or human weakness. \u201cI don\u2019t think Arkansas needs to bail out the Northeast,\u201d Cotton once said of his vote against the Hurricane Sandy relief bill. He has dismissed the potential for default if the debt ceiling was not raised as a desirable \u201cshort-term market correction,\u201d and said food stamps should be cut because too many recipients live high on the hog: \u201cThey have steak in their basket, and they have a brand-new iPhone, and they have a brand-new SUV.\u201d I asked Cotton about his senior thesis and whether he thought humans were too selfish by nature to make good collective decisions. \u201cWe\u2019re all sinners, certainly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all fall short of perfection. Part of our constitutional form of government is that we have checks and balances, so we don\u2019t have simple majority rule.\u201d After quoting Margaret Thatcher and praising the Founders, he added, \u201cThe Constitution has proven, over 230 years, to be the best form of government. That\u2019s why we need to respect our constitution, unlike Barack Obama and Mark Pryor, who just runs roughshod over it.\u201d When I asked if he still supported the notion that elected officials tend to be superior to the people they govern, he joked, \u201cYou just have to look around Congress to realize that\u2019s not always the case.\u201d But he stood by the view expressed in the thesis.\n\nTom Cotton barely spoke until he was three years old, his older sister, Sarah Cotton Patterson, told me. Even after that, he had a speech impediment so severe that few could make out what he was saying. \u201cI could understand him, but most others could not,\u201d Patterson told me. \u201cHe\u2019d say something and I translated, and people would bend down to hear it.\u201d Cotton was in intensive speech therapy through much of elementary school.\n\nPerhaps as a result of these early experiences, Patterson said, Cotton was a bookish, stoic, inward-directed boy, determined to overcome whatever obstacle he faced. It\u2019s not clear how his conservative orientation developed, but it, too, came to him in boyhood. He did not inherit his politics from his parents like most people do: Len and Avis Cotton are longtime Democrats who supported Bill Clinton as their governor and president. (\u201cThey are genuine, honest, hardworking people\u2014big supporters of mine!\u201d Arkansas\u2019 popular two-term Democratic governor, Mike Beebe, told me with some glee.) Yet Cotton told me it was the Clinton presidency, during his high-school years, that turned him against liberalism\u2014specifically \u201cthe tax increases that passed in the summer and fall of 1993, and also cutting and running from Mogadishu after the battle of Mogadishu.\u201d Whatever the genesis, by the time he got to Harvard, Cotton\u2019s political compass was firmly set. \u201cIt may be that the only way to get through Harvard as a conservative is to show up as one,\u201d he told me. Harvard\u2019s conservative-leaning undergraduates tend to gravitate to the lectures and seminars taught by Harvey Mansfield, one of the few conservatives on the faculty. The author of influential books on Burke, Tocqueville, Machiavelli, and Jefferson, Mansfield is an ardent traditionalist who advocates for the Western canon and against multiculturalism and affirmative action. (Liberals particularly disliked his 2006 book Manliness, an apologia for traditional gender roles.) The New York Times once called Mansfield \u201ca kind of Father Confessor to students of politics for nearly four decades\u201d who had \u201cquietly shaped the thinking of a generation of conservative writers, academics and public figures.\u201d Cotton\u2014\"this tall guy from Arkansas\u201d\u2014made an impression on Mansfield, he told me recently. \u201cHe was very smart, but not a future professor\u2014a man of action,\u201d Mansfield recalled. \u201cHe was always very political, wanting to be engaged.\u201d With Mansfield\u2019s help, Cotton sought out other conservative mentors at Harvard, including Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom, a husband-and-wife team of conservative legal scholars whom Cotton assisted with research. \u201cHarvard is full of operators,\u201d Abigail Thernstrom told me recently. \u201cOne of my students was supposed to have written a thesis for me, but he managed to wriggle out of the requirement. That was Lloyd Blankfein,\u201d the Goldman Sachs CEO, who graduated in 1975. Thernstrom continued, \u201cTom was on the opposite end of the spectrum. He wanted to do things right.\u201d\n\nIn 1997, the Thernstroms published America in Black and White, a sweeping critique of affirmative action and other race-based policies. That fall, Cotton reviewed the book glowingly for Harvard\u2019s conservative magazine, the Salient, writing that \u201crace-hustling charlatans like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton\u201d had a vested interest in obscuring the great progress African Americans had already made. \u201cIf race relations are better now than at any time in our history and would almost certainly improve if we stopped emphasizing race in our public life,\u201d Cotton wrote, \u201cwhat would the self-appointed \u2018civil rights leaders\u2019 have to do with themselves?\u201d Abigail Thernstrom would go on to serve as vice chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights under George W. Bush. Cotton did not inherit his politics from his parents like most people do: Len and Avis Cotton are longtime Democrats who supported Bill Clinton as their governor and president. The summer before his final undergraduate year at Harvard, Cotton was admitted to the Publius Fellowship, a prestigious summer program for undergraduates at the Claremont Institute, a California-based conservative think tank known for its heady intellectualism and insistence on conservative absolutism. Admirers include Clarence Thomas and Pat Sajak. The institute\u2019s president at the time, Larry Arnn, was also from a small town in Arkansas, and he took an immediate liking to Cotton. Within 10 minutes of their meeting, Arnn guessed that Cotton was preparing to enter politics, he told me recently; Cotton seemed especially interested in tapping Arnn\u2019s contacts back in Arkansas. Arnn now serves as the president of Michigan\u2019s Hillsdale College and a trustee of the Heritage Foundation, the Washington-based conservative policy powerhouse. Of Cotton\u2019s early promise, Arnn told me, \u201cRemarkable human beings have a way of making remarkable preparation.\u201d After graduating from Harvard in three years, Cotton returned to Claremont to pursue a master\u2019s degree, but abandoned it after a year, finding academic life \u201ctoo sedentary.\u201d Instead, he enrolled in Harvard Law School. On September 11, 2001, he had just begun his final year. He wanted to serve his country, but first, he had student loans to pay off. Three years later, with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan intensifying, Cotton left the Washington law firm where he was working to join the Army. He did not want to be a military lawyer; he wanted to fight. He became an infantry officer. He was sent to Iraq.\n\nCotton was in Baghdad in 2006 when The New York Times published a report on a secret U.S. program to trace and stifle terrorist financing networks. In publishing it, the Times defied the pleas of the Bush administration, which claimed national security would be compromised. Cotton composed a letter to the Times that was thick with righteous indignation. \u201cYou may think you have done a public service,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut you have gravely endangered the lives of my soldiers and all other soldiers and innocent Iraqis here.\u201d He promised to think of the Times next time he heard a roadside bomb go off, and to wonder whether it could have been prevented \u201chad you not instructed terrorists how to evade our financial surveillance.\u201d\n\nIn closing, Cotton cited his Harvard Law degree, his work as clerk for a federal judge, and his service with \u201ctwo Washington law firms\u201d to support his claim that the Times had \u201cplainly violated\u201d espionage laws. \u201cBy the time we return home,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmaybe you will be in your rightful place: not at the Pulitzer announcements, but behind bars.\u201d Cotton emailed the letter to the Times, which ignored it. He also copied a prominent conservative blog run by two Minnesota lawyers, Power Line, which published it. Appearing out of nowhere with his impeccable credentials, his battlefield credibility, and his perfectly articulated rage, Lieutenant Cotton became an immediate sensation in conservative media, his letter a viral email forward. Liberals doubted he was even real (there happens to be a hobbit in Tolkien also named Tom Cotton); the myth-busting website Snopes.com posted an entry verifying that he did exist. The letter was Cotton\u2019s first taste of political fame. The Power Line bloggers, also Claremont Institute fellows, began corresponding with him and encouraging him to run for office. While in Iraq, Cotton also struck up a correspondence with Kristol\u2014a fellow former student of Mansfield at Harvard\u2014and when he was subsequently stationed at Arlington National Cemetery, in a prestigious unit called the Old Guard that oversees the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the two men met frequently over drinks and dinner at Washington\u2019s downtown Mayflower Hotel. Kristol saw a kindred spirit in Cotton\u2019s aggressive national-security hawkishness, and the men developed what Kristol describes as \u201ca bond beyond pure policy.\u201d When Cotton had finished his Army commitment and was debating a last deployment to Afghanistan, Kristol was among those he consulted. (The Weekly Standard has since become an ardent promoter of Cotton\u2019s political career, though it is hardly an outlier in this regard: Shortly before Cotton was elected to the House, National Review published a fawning six-part series on his life and candidacy.)\n\nSoon after Cotton left the Army, in 2009, and took a job with the management-consulting firm McKinsey, Arnn introduced him to a Hillsdale alum and former congressman named Chris Chocola, the president of the Washington-based Club for Growth. One of the most influential of the right-wing pressure groups hoping to purify the Republican Party from within, the Club advocates a staunch free-market philosophy that seeks to radically reduce the size and influence of government. Its bundled campaign donations and flights of television ads have been instrumental in shepherding candidates like Ted Cruz through tough GOP primaries. Chocola immediately recognized in Cotton a man with a bright future in national politics. Power Line also continued to promote Cotton, and there was an attempt to draft him for Arkansas\u2019s 2010 Senate race. Finally, in 2011, when the Democratic congressman who had represented his home district for 12 years retired, Cotton could no longer resist the pressure to enter politics. \u201cSome of my friends who are in politics began to encourage me to run,\u201d he would later tell the Hot Springs Sentinel-Record. The Club for Growth became the first national group to support him. Of the $2.2 million Cotton would raise for that campaign, the Club\u2019s donors were responsible for $315,000. The collective powers of the conservative movement were ready to make Cotton their new star. Today Cotton, in his 19 months in office, has earned a 92 percent on the Club\u2019s scorecard. The votes that marked him an outlier in the Arkansas Republican delegation\u2014the farm bill, disaster aid, the Children\u2019s Hospital\u2014were all in keeping with the Club\u2019s austere philosophy. \u201cIf every member of Congress was like Tom Cotton, the world would be a better place,\u201d Chocola told me approvingly. Some D.C. Republicans wish Cotton weren\u2019t quite so pure. One GOP strategist involved in the midterm elections complained about Cotton\u2019s failure to leap decisively ahead of Pryor, telling me, \u201cHis problem is, his voting record was scripted by the Heritage Foundation.\"\n\nScorecards like the Club\u2019s frustrate House Speaker John Boehner, who believes that it and other pressure groups\u2014the Heritage Foundation keeps a similar tally\u2014encourage Republicans against constructiveness and compromise. But the groups\u2019 tough-minded ideology has found willing acolytes in the House\u2019s most staunchly ideological crop of members, many of them elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010 that handed Republicans the House majority, and more, like Cotton, elected since. Politico last year dubbed Cotton the face of the \u201chell no caucus\u201d that was making Boehner\u2019s life difficult by refusing to entertain any inkling of gun control or immigration reform. Abigail Thernstrom worries that Cotton\u2019s votes have hurt his popularity. \u201cFor political reasons, I would have been less principled than he has been on the farm bill,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut he seems willing to vote his principles even when it\u2019s not politically wise.\u201d\n\nArkansas was a Democratic state for a long time, and then Barack Obama was elected. In 2012, Republicans took over both houses of the state legislature for the first time since Reconstruction. A congressional delegation that in 2008 consisted of five Democrats and one Republican shifted after 2012 to five Republicans and one Democrat: Pryor, whose father was a popular governor and senator, and who had no Republican opponent in his 2008 reelection. Some Arkansas Democrats believe the damage to their party will be long-lasting. \u201cYou go to liberal dinner parties in Little Rock, and you hear Democrats say this is their last stand,\u201d Brummett, the newspaper columnist, told me. \u201cIf they lose this year, they\u2019re done for a generation.\u201d The only exception to the rightward march in recent years was Beebe, the Democratic governor, who won reelection by 30 points in 2010 and remains one of the country\u2019s most popular executives. \u201cWe\u2019ve turned pretty red,\u201d Beebe acknowledged, leaning back in a tall leather chair behind his desk in the governor\u2019s mansion in Little Rock. \u201cIt\u2019s all about Obama, in my opinion\u2014this visceral opposition to him.\u201d\n\nI heard this loathing for Obama frequently in several days traveling around Arkansas, often from voters who described themselves as lifelong or former Democrats. Some also were unimpressed by Cotton\u2019s credentials: \u201cI don\u2019t have much in common with a Harvard lawyer,\u201d said Jill Hatcher, a 48-year-old city councilwoman from Shannon Hills who nonetheless planned to vote for him. Judy Curry, a 68-year-old hairdresser from Pine Bluff and a Democrat of long standing, recoiled as if stung when I asked if she\u2019d voted for Obama. \u201cHeavens no,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s one of us Americans.\u201d She had voted for Pryor in the past and thought he was someone who \u201cworks for the people,\u201d but was reconsidering based on his support for Obamacare. Cotton\u2019s campaign strategy seems to consist entirely of tapping this sentiment. His ads and speeches are exercises in putting \u201cPryor\u201d and \u201cObama\u201d in the same sentence as many times as possible; his advisers and allies believe there\u2019s just no way Pryor can overcome the fundamental partisan dynamics in a state Mitt Romney won by 23 points. Ironically, Cotton, the candidate touted by so many conservatives as a star for his special qualities, is running the most generic possible campaign, hoping the only thing voters see when they look at him is his party affiliation. Despite the state\u2019s conservative turn, Beebe has been able to govern by exploiting the divisions within the Republican Party. In the statehouse, he has orchestrated a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans to elect a moderate Republican speaker and marginalize the small but vocal Tea Party caucus. And he has been able to get his program largely passed\u2014including accepting the Medicaid-expansion grant from Obamacare, a program that has insured more than 200,000 Arkansans\u2014by the three-quarters vote required by the state constitution. The health-care vote became a rallying cry for the right, and this year, two Republican state legislators who supported it lost primaries to right-wing challengers. Beebe evinced no pity for these men, who sacrificed their political careers for a policy unpopular with their own party. \u201cThey voted the way they needed to vote,\u201d he told me coolly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tom Cotton is the ultimate product of today&#39;s hard-edged, ideologically driven Republican Party.
