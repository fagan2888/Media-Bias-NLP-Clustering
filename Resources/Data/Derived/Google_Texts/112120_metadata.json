The union said the ads will also run in Capitol Hill publications and online this fall.\n\n\u201cOpen Skies only works when all countries play by the same rules, and most countries do just that,\u201d ALPA President Tim Canoll said in a statement about the ad campaign.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Qatar and the UAE are breaking the Open Skies agreements by pumping billions of dollars in government subsidies and unfair benefits into their state owned carriers in an effort to dominate global aviation,\" Cannoll continued. \"Now that the government docket is closed, it\u2019s time for the Obama Administration to address the subsidies that are putting tens of thousands of American aviation jobs at risk.\u201d\n\nThe fight over foreign airline subsidies has become a turbulent battle that has engulfed the nation\u2019s aviation industry.\n\nMajor U.S. airlines like Delta, United and American, known as the Big Three, are pushing the Obama administration to launch a review of the claims with the Middle Eastern governments, which would involve a delicate set of negotiations that critics have said would upset other areas of foreign relations.\n\nThe Gulf carriers have denied violating the Open Skies agreements, and they have argued that U.S. airlines have historically received subsidies from the federal government at times of distress, such as the period after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\n\"People simply can't believe that we have an airline of this size in 30 years, buying huge numbers of aircraft, brand new, successfully deploying them on markets all over the world and making quite a lot of money,\" Emirates CEO Tim Clark said in an interview with the British BBC network in June.\n\n\"That's kind of not how the airline industry has performed over the last 50 years, I'm sorry to say,\" Clark concluded then.\n\nTravel industry and consumer groups have largely sided with the Persian Gulf carriers in the Open Skies flight, accusing the airlines of trying to reduce competition for international flights.\n\nUnions that represent major U.S. airline workers like ALPA, meanwhile, have formed campaigns to pressure the Obama administration to question the Persian Gulf carrier subsidies.\n\n\"For the past 10 years, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates have received more than $42 billion in unfair subsidies and benefits from the governments of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar, distorting the global aviation marketplace,\" the pilots' union said Wednesday.\n\n\"This violation of these international agreements threatens the careers of thousands of highly trained U.S. pilots and others in the aviation industry,\" the statement continued.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The union is running ads at Ronald Reagan
