Her focus has been on UnitedHealthcare, which is already selling plans to businesses on the marketplace, and Tufts Health Plan, which has said it expects to join HealthSource RI for 2015 and sell to both individuals and businesses.\n\nA study released last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggested it\u2019s \u201cunsurprising\u201d that Rhode Island\u2019s highly concentrated pre-Obamacare individual market has turned into a highly concentrated post-Obamacare individual market. The study also argued other Rhode Island health insurers may have better luck in the future if they compete with Blue Cross on price:\n\nThe long-term success of the exchanges and other ACA provisions governing market rules will be measured in part by how well they facilitate market competition, providing consumers with a diversity of choices and hopefully lower prices for insurance than would have otherwise been the case. With the first open enrollment period not yet completed, it is too soon to tell how well the exchanges will work to improve competition in the individual insurance market, which historically has been highly concentrated and dominated by a small number of insurers in most states. Exchange enrollment will certainly change \u2013 especially during this last month of open enrollment, but also throughout the year as enrollees gain and lose eligibility \u2013 and it will be several years before we can truly evaluate the success of the new markets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News on WPRI.com is Providence, New Bedford, Fall River news and weather.
