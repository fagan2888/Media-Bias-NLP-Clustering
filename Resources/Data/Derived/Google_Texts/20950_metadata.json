Hawaii topped the list as the healthiest state in the U.S. Indiana ranked 41st, down from 37th last year.\n\nKentucky ranked 47th last year.\n\nDr. Julie Daftari, Kentucky market medical director for United Healthcare, said the state\u2019s improvement on the list may be attributed to people making better lifestyle choices.\n\n\u201cGetting out and walking for 10 to 15 minutes over their lunch break or encouraging their neighborhood and family member to increase their activity and increase their overall health,\u201d she said.\n\nDaftari said the challenges Kentuckians face may be related to the shortage of physicians in the state.\n\n\u201cEven though it looks like the communities in Kentucky have better access to health care coverage, it looks like there is still a shortage of primary care physicians in the state as a whole,\u201d she said. \u201cAccess to health care has some bearing on the overall outcomes of a population.\u201d\n\nThe report said in the past two years, lack of health insurance decreased by 24 percent in the state, from 15 percent uninsured to 11.4 percent.\n\nKentucky has drawn accolades for its implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s provisions. Citing costs and other concerns, Kentucky\u2019s new governor, Matt Bevin, has vowed to roll back the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion and dismantle the state\u2019s health care exchange.\n\nJust before leaving office this month, then-Gov. Steve Beshear issued a report touting improvements in the state\u2019s health standings.\n\nThe report also ranks Kentucky 49th for its smoking rate of 26.2 percent. Kentucky ranked 50th for cancer deaths.\n\n\u201cSmoking is actually directly related to numerous types of cancers. It\u2019s been linked to not only lung cancer but oral cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer. So smoking does play a role in overall health,\u201d Daftari said.\n\nThe report lists Kentucky\u2019s strengths as having a low rate of violent crime, high rate of high school graduation, and a low rate of excessive drinking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the overall health rankings will improve. I think it\u2019s important that we all look to the future and do what we can to improve each other\u2019s health,\u201d Daftari said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The report attributes Kentucky's low marks to a high prevalence of smoking, a high rate of cancer deaths, and a high rate of preventable hospitalizations.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "The report attributes Kentucky's low marks to a high prevalence of smoking, a high rate of cancer deaths, and a high rate of preventable hospitalizations.", "title": "Kentucky Ranks 44 Among States In Health Ranking", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1600, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4927466850_0f231ee608_o-e1441850166507.jpg", "height": 656}, "updated_time": "2015-12-17T07:10:06-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/kentucky-moves-up-a-few-spots-in-americas-health-rankings/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The report attributes Kentucky's low marks to a high prevalence of smoking, a high rate of cancer deaths, and a high rate of preventable hospitalizations.", "title": "Kentucky Ranks 44 Among States In Health Ranking", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4927466850_0f231ee608_o-e1441850166507.jpg", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2015-12-16T14:19:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-17T07:10:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Citing costs and other concerns, Kentucky\u2019s new governor, Matt Bevin, has vowed to roll back the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion and dismantle the state\u2019s health care exchange.\nIt\u2019s been linked to not only lung cancer but oral cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer.\nSteve Beshear issued a report touting improvements in the state\u2019s health standings.\nThe report, America\u2019s Health Rankings, attributes Kentucky\u2019s low marks to a high prevalence of smoking, a high rate of cancer deaths, and a high rate of preventable hospitalizations.\nKentucky is the 44th healthiest state in the U.S., according to a recent report analyzing the health of the nation."}
