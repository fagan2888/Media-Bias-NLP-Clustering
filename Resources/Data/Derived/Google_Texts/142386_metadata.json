The federal law also includes retailers that sell prepared food, which compete directly with restaurateurs.\n\nThe law had initially been passed in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act. But the rules, the required guidance and the enforcement have been delayed several times over the years.\n\nThe rules were published in 2014, but the agency also must publish formalized guidance that helps show companies how to comply with the law.\n\nThe rules could also get a Congressional-driven change. The House in February approved a bill that would give restaurants and grocers more flexibility in how they label the calorie counts on menus, while also enabling to-go restaurants like pizza chains the ability to post calories on smartphone apps.\n\nThat bill, which has yet to pass the Senate and get a presidential signature, also includes some lawsuit protections and provides flexibility for posting the calories of customized options.\n\nContact Jonathan Maze at jonathan.maze@penton.com\n\nFollow him on Twitter: @jonathanmaze\n\nClarification: March 11, 2016 This article has been changed to clarify that the FDA will release guidance on the menu labeling rules, but the timing of the action is uncertain.", "article_metadata": {"description": "FDA pushes back menu labeling enforcement at least a year, after Congress requires delay", "title": "FDA postpones menu labeling enforcement", "og": {"url": "http://nrn.com/government/fda-postpones-menu-labeling-enforcement", "image": "http://nrn.com/site-files/nrn.com/files/uploads/2016/03/stockmenu2015.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Agency pushes back enforcement at least a year, after Congress requires delay", "title": "FDA postpones menu labeling enforcement"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "7d22d9073ed6d094c7c5d663db02d457"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=593080516", "keywords": "Government, Latest Headlines, Health & Nutrition"}, "article_summary": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has officially delayed enforcement of new menu labeling rules, after Congress included a delay in a spending bill in December.\nThe FDA\u2019s announcement brings at least some certainty to the often-delayed rules over menu labeling.\nContact Jonathan Maze at jonathan.maze@penton.comFollow him on Twitter: @jonathanmazeClarification: March 11, 2016 This article has been changed to clarify that the FDA will release guidance on the menu labeling rules, but the timing of the action is uncertain.\nThe law has the backing of the restaurant industry, which had pushed for a federal menu labeling standard as opposed to a smorgasbord of laws in states and localities across the country.\nBut the rules, the required guidance and the enforcement have been delayed several times over the years."}
