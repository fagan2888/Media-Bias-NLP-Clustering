But in an unusual twist, an atheist activist is galvanizing support for a legal campaign to use the federal RFRA to remove the phrase \u201cIn God we trust\u201d from U.S. coins and paper bills.\n\nEven more unusual: it just might work.\n\nMichael Newdow, who unsuccessfully sued to have \u201cUnder God\u201d removed from the Pledge of Allegiance in 2004, published a guest post on the The Friendly Atheist blog last Friday outlining a new initiative to challenge the decades-old policy of printing the religiously themed American national motto on U.S. currency. He explained that while courts have dismissed claims that the phrase violates the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution \u2014 which prohibits Congress from passing laws that establish one religion above others \u2014 his new legal argument is rooted in RFRA\u2019s stipulation that religious activity cannot be \u201csubstantially burdened\u201d without a \u201ccompelling government interest.\u201d The government\u2019s interest in emblazoning currency with \u201cin God we trust,\u201d Newdow argues, is suspect.\n\n\u201cBecause Constitutional principles can be twisted and perverted, the challenges to this practice under the Establishment Clause have, so far, failed,\u201d Newdow wrote. \u201cChallenges under RFRA, however, are not as susceptible to misapplication. This is because every Supreme Court justice involved in the three RFRA cases heard to date has agreed that, under RFRA, religious activity may not be substantially burdened without a compelling governmental interest and laws narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\u201d\n\nNewdow, who plans to file the case in 7 federal court circuits, told ThinkProgress that although many Americans simply ignore the motto, it can be infuriating for those who don\u2019t believe in God.\n\nImagine if Christians had to carry on their body something they disagree with religiously, like \u201cJesus is a lie\u201d \u2014 how long do you think that would stand?\n\n\u201cImagine if Christians had to carry on their body something they disagree with religiously, like \u2018Jesus is a lie\u2019 \u2014 how long do you think that would stand?\u201d Newdow said. \u201cBut atheists are so denigrated in this society that people accept this without a second thought.\u201d\n\nUse of \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d has long frustrated hardline supporters of the separation of church and state, who often note that its inclusion on U.S. paper currency is a relatively recent phenomenon that emerged out of a specific historical context. The phrase didn\u2019t even become the official U.S. national motto until 1956, for example, replacing the mantra \u201cE pluribus unum\u201d during the early years of the Red Scare \u2014 an era when the U.S. was locked in a Cold War with Russia and its officially atheistic communist government. Paper bills began bearing the aphorism the following year, joining several kinds of metal coins that had been imprinted with it since 1864. The phrase \u201cUnder God\u201d was also added to the Pledge of Allegiance during this time, and the state of Ohio changed its motto in 1959 to \u201cWith God, all things are possible.\u201d\n\nAlthough initially uncontroversial, the constitutionality of these terms has been questioned by several groups over the years, atheist and otherwise. Yet judges have historically rebuffed their objections: The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared in 1970 that \u201cIn God we trust \u2026 has nothing whatsoever to do with the establishment of religion,\u201d adding, \u201cIts use is of patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise.\u201d More recently, a federal judge dismissed a similar 2013 lawsuit decrying the adage, saying that while the nonreligious plaintiffs were clearly perturbed by its religious themes, their frustration did not constitute a \u201csubstantial burden.\u201d\n\nBut Newdow\u2019s case is not a simple rehashing of these failed arguments. He told ThinkProgress he hopes to take advantage of the Supreme Court\u2019s new interpretation of RFRA, specifically their 2014 Hobby Lobby decision, which granted the craft store giant Hobby Lobby a religious exemption from the Affordable Care Act. The controversial ruling constricted the federal government\u2019s ability to impede the actions of religious Americans, which, in turn, expanded the way the law can be used by faith groups.\n\nThis potentially gives Newdow at least two new options for getting the term removed from coins and bills. First, he could claim that atheism is a \u201creligion\u201d unto itself, legally speaking, and thus deserving of exemption under RFRA. This may sound far-fetched, but there is already legal precedent for granting atheists the same protections as religious Americans: last October, a federal district court in Oregon issued a preliminary ruling that regarded secular humanism as \u201ca religion for Establishment Clause purposes.\u201d\n\nWho is the \u201cwe\u201d in \u201cIn God we trust\u201d?\n\nAlternatively, he could corral plaintiffs whose religious beliefs are implicitly spurned by the phrase. Newdow cited the example of a devout Jewish man \u2014 who he said may become a plaintiff in his case \u2014 that ascribes to a specific strain of Judaism that restricts the use of the word \u201cGod\u201d out of respect for the divine. Consequently, the man has rejected the use of physical American currency bearing the national motto, making it difficult for him to travel or frequent businesses that do not take credit cards. In addition, Hindus, Neopagans, Wiccans and many other Americans are polytheistic, meaning they believe (and trust) in more than one god, which is not reflected in the the current iteration of the motto.\n\n\u201cWho is the \u2018we\u2019 in \u2018In God we trust\u2019?\u201d Newdow asked. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous, and it\u2019s time to stop.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen how courts will react to Newdow\u2019s argument, but he\u2019s not the only one testing the limits of laws supposedly designed to protect religious freedom. The Satanic Temple, a group whose professed beliefs closely mirror secular humanism, challenged Missouri\u2019s 72-hour abortion waiting period earlier this month by citing the state\u2019s RFRA. They argued that the waiting period is unconstitutional because it violates their sincerely held belief that \u201cone\u2019s body is inviolable, subject to one\u2019s own will alone.\u201d And in Indiana, the newly-formed First Church of Cannabis is planning to begin smoking marijuana as part of their religious services in July, claiming that their otherwise illegal drug use is exempted under Indiana\u2019s version of RFRA.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\u201cWho is the \u2018we\u2019 in \u2018In God we trust?\u2019\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\u201cWho is the \u2018we\u2019 in \u2018In God we trust?\u2019\u201d", "title": "How Atheists Are Turning \u2018Religious Freedom\u2019 Laws Against Religion", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/05/19/3660284/atheists-trying-use-religious-freedom-laws-remove-god-trust-us-currency/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP0703080135.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cWho is the \u2018we\u2019 in \u2018In God we trust?\u2019\u201d", "creator": "@jackmjenkins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP0703080135-321x214.jpg", "title": "How Atheists Are Turning \u2018Religious Freedom\u2019 Laws Against Religion", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP0703080135.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP0703080135.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-19T08:00:47+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jackiswriting"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWho is the \u2018we\u2019 in \u2018In God we trust\u2019?\u201d Newdow asked.\nFirst, he could claim that atheism is a \u201creligion\u201d unto itself, legally speaking, and thus deserving of exemption under RFRA.\nJustice How Atheists Are Turning \u2018Religious Freedom\u2019 Laws Against Religion CREDIT: APFor almost a year now, the nation has been locked in almost constant debate over various state and federal versions of the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (RFRA), a 20-year-old law that was broadened by the Supreme Court in 2014 and has since been embraced by right-wing politicians and pundits \u2014 especially religious conservatives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous, and it\u2019s time to stop.\u201dIt remains to be seen how courts will react to Newdow\u2019s argument, but he\u2019s not the only one testing the limits of laws supposedly designed to protect religious freedom.\nAlternatively, he could corral plaintiffs whose religious beliefs are implicitly spurned by the phrase."}
