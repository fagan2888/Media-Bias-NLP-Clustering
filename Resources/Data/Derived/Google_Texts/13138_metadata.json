You are one of the few. For those of us who have never aspired to reach Superman-level strength, professional strongman Chris \u201cWonder\u201d Schoeck is here to demonstrate some of the easiest ways to impress our friends by tearing phonebooks in half, ripping into decks of plastic covered cards, and bending seemingly indestructible nails.\n\nNow, clearly, tearing a phonebook or a deck of cards in half is going to require some physical strength, especially in the wrists and forearms. However, Shoeck demonstrates that tearing and bending these objects is also a matter of having a good grip, leverage, and showmanship. Eating a 20,000 calorie strongman diet could also help you get a leg up on the competition.\n\nSchoeck \u2014 who was the focus of the 2013 documentary Bending Steel \u2014 is no behemoth. At 5-foot-7, 155 pounds, this Coney Island native is probably not what you envision when it comes to some of the strongest men in the world. What Schoeck lacks in size, he more than makes up for in brawn. You don\u2019t have to take my word for it. Watch the \u201cWonder\u201d show of his amazing strength by tearing through phonebooks and decks of cards with incredible ease.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "super, strength, pro, strongman, chris, wonder, schoeck, shows, us, how, rip, phonebook, and, bend", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Coney Island-based professional strongman Chris \u201cWonder\u201d Schoeck demonstrates how to rip a phonebook and bend a nail.", "title": "Pro Strongman Shows Us How To Rip A Phonebook And Bend Nails [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/super-strength-pro-strongman-chris-wonder-schoeck-shows-us-how-rip-phonebook-and-bend-348816", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/08/20/super-strength-pro-strongman-chris-wonder-schoeck-shows-us-how-rip-phonebook-and-bend.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Coney Island-based professional strongman Chris \u201cWonder\u201d Schoeck demonstrates how to rip a phonebook and bend a nail.", "title": "Pro Strongman Shows Us How To Rip A Phonebook And Bend Nails [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/super-strength-pro-strongman-chris-wonder-schoeck-shows-us-how-rip-phonebook-and-bend-348816", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/08/20/super-strength-pro-strongman-chris-wonder-schoeck-shows-us-how-rip-phonebook-and-bend.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/20/super-strength-pro-strongman-chris-wonder-schoeck-shows-us-how-rip-phonebook-and-bend.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-20T16:55:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T16:55:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Coney Island-based professional strongman Chris \u201cWonder\u201d Schoeck demonstrates how to rip a phonebook and bend a nail."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfbd7\"", "article_summary": "Watch the \u201cWonder\u201d show of his amazing strength by tearing through phonebooks and decks of cards with incredible ease.\nHowever, Shoeck demonstrates that tearing and bending these objects is also a matter of having a good grip, leverage, and showmanship.\nEver see a muscle-bound meathead tear apart a phonebook and think, \u201chey, I can probably do that\u201d?\nNow, clearly, tearing a phonebook or a deck of cards in half is going to require some physical strength, especially in the wrists and forearms.\nEating a 20,000 calorie strongman diet could also help you get a leg up on the competition."}
