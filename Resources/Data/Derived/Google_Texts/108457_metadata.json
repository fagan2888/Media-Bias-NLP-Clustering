In fact, Texas has the highest rate of uninsured in the nation. Yet there are some who will seemingly stop at nothing to deter Texans \u2014 and those who assist them \u2014 from obtaining coverage or even learning about their new options under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhat opponents of the new law could not do legislatively, at the ballot box, or even by shutting down the federal government, they\u2019re now trying to do through other means. Case in point is Monday\u2019s congressional hearing in Dallas, designed to stifle, intimidate and impugn the reputation of people who have been working hard to help their fellow Texans get covered.\n\nJust who are these people working to assist their fellow Texans? Those I\u2019ve met are dedicated, civic-minded Americans who have opened their hearts to their neighbors, because they want to help.\n\nNavigators and other assisters work to educate people about their new options. They\u2019re not paid to sell insurance. Rather, they work to help people understand what financial help is available, and to learn about their choices, so they can make good decisions for themselves and their families.\n\nNavigators in Texas must complete at least 20 hours of training (including training on privacy protection and security), pass a rigorous exam, demonstrate they don\u2019t have a conflict of interest, and participate in weekly training sessions.\n\nCertified application counselors working at hospitals, community health centers and social service agencies must also go through rigorous training before they can provide assistance to consumers.\n\nMore than 19,000 trained assisters, counselors and navigators have worked with more than 450,000 Americans in their communities, to help them understand the options available under the new law.\n\nHelping people obtain health coverage is not about politics, it\u2019s about people. Millions are counting on finally being able to obtain affordable coverage. And in the first two months of a six-month open enrollment, 1.2 million Americans either selected a health plan or received an eligibility determination or assessment for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nNow that HealthCare.gov is working smoothly for the vast majority of users, we expect more Americans to shop for plans and enroll in quality, affordable coverage.\n\nIn the first week of December alone, HealthCare.gov was visited 5 million times. In November and October, more than 5 million Americans dialed into the Marketplace call center (1-800-318-2596).\n\nBut many prefer to meet with someone face to face in their own community who can answer their questions and lend a helping hand. That\u2019s where navigators and other trained assisters come in.\n\nIn Texas, their work is particularly important. Nearly one in four Texans is uninsured: 4.9 million in all, 1.1 million in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. And there are more uninsured children in Texas than in any other state.\n\nNavigators and other assisters are working to help these folks get covered so they\u2019ll no longer have to forgo cholesterol and cancer screenings, risk bankruptcy, or have to choose between putting food on the table and taking their kids to the doctor.\n\nThrough the Marketplace, a Dallas family earning $50,000 per year can obtain affordable coverage for as little as $26 per month. And there is choice and competition that quite simply were not available to Texans before the Affordable Care Act. In North Texas alone, there are 43 qualified health plans offered on the Marketplace.\n\nMany currently uninsured Texas families will be able, for the first time, to get some financial help paying their premiums, since they don\u2019t have affordable coverage at work.\n\nAs more Texans get covered, it benefits everyone: Fewer people are forced to rely on the emergency room for care (which raises costs across the board), and the Texas economy benefits from a healthier workforce.\n\nTexas could benefit even further if the state expanded Medicaid, and with it access to coverage for 2.5 million people, many of whom work in jobs which either don\u2019t offer insurance or don\u2019t pay enough to make it attainable.\n\nWith so many Texans lacking affordable coverage, now is not the time to be putting up roadblocks. We should be helping navigators and other assisters in their important work, not demonizing, demoralizing or deterring them.\n\nKathleen Sebelius is the U.S. secretary of health and human services.
