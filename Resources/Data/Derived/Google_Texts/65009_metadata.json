GuideSpark co-founders (left to right): Keith Kitani, Joe Larocque, and John Wolff.\n\nGuideSpark Inc. wants to make dull employee handbooks, seminars and brochures a thing of the past by turning these materials into more engaging video, mobile and interactive content.\n\nThe Menlo Park startup just raised $15 million in a Series B round of venture funding led by New Enterprise Associates, with participation by GuideSpark\u2019s earlier backers Storm Ventures and IDG Ventures.\n\nGuideSpark Chief Executive Keith Kitani, who co-founded the company with John Wolff and Joseph Larocque, said that a workforce preference for video, mobile and interactive content over paper, text-based websites and email is driving his startup\u2019s growth. So is national health care reform that has affected just about every business in the U.S. this year, he said.\n\nClients of GuideSpark range from large employers to growing startups including: 7-Eleven Inc., Adobe Systems Inc., L\u2019Or\u00e9al SA, Box Inc. and News Corp. (owner of The Wall Street Journal), he said.\n\nGuideSpark takes old training materials and files from its clients and uses a proprietary content creation platform to turn these into videos and interactive materials, quickly.\n\nThe company charges for a year-long subscription to its software-as-a-service, and assigns internal, creative experts to help employers customize their materials.\n\nGuideSpark Inc. GuideSpark\u2019s geographic report detailing where a company\u2019s employees\u2019 have viewed an informational or training-related video.\n\nGuideSpark\u2019s system also gives human resources teams the ability to see when and where employees have watched their videos, for example, or taken their online and mobile polls or quizzes.\n\nLori Brown, an assistant vice president of human resources with L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA in Berkeley Heights, N.J., said she used GuideSpark to reach \u201ca very diverse workforce in terms of functions, geographies and cultural backgrounds.\u201d\n\nBefore using GuideSpark, her team delivered health and retirement benefits information via an \u201cemployee portal,\u201d a call center, plasma screens, an internal website, and in break rooms, emails and printed materials for employees.\n\nWhen L\u2019Or\u00e9al began to use GuideSpark in 2013, she says, it helped the team save money and time on research, graphic design, printing, legal review of benefits materials and more. More importantly, she said, \u201cabout half [of L'Or\u00e9al USA's employees] watched the videos in the first year of the program.\u201d\n\nNEA\u2019s Peter Sonsini said his firm backed GuideSpark because of the pedigree of its founding team\u2013veteran tech executives who worked together before at Adobe Systems Inc.\u2013 and GuideSpark\u2019s traction.\n\nThe startup\u2019s software-as-a-service is \u201cnot about paving the way to a new market, or changing behavior,\u201d he said, but \u201creplacing an existing business\u2026with something better.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, he noted, GuideSpark grew from 60 clients to 240.\n\nStorm Ventures Managing Director Ryan Floyd said that GuideSpark\u2019s success so far reminds him of one of his firm\u2019s earlier portfolio companies, Marketo Inc. The marketing automation software business held an IPO in April 2012 and boasts a $1.59 billion market cap today.\n\nMr. Floyd said, \u201cWe invested in Marketo in July 2008, and GuideSpark in April 2013. Marketo tripled its revenue in 2008, 2009 and 2010, reaching $14 million then. GuideSpark tripled in 2013, will triple in 2014 and we are investing in the Series B round to help them scale and triple revenue again in 2015. They\u2019re also growing [by number of employees] at a similar pace.\u201d\n\nExecutives and investors declined to comment on valuation and other terms of the deal. However, Mr. Kitani said that GuideSpark planned to use its new capital on hiring, especially in the sales and marketing department, and to develop new technology, improving the speed of content creation and its analytics platform in 2014.\n\nThe company competes with traditional HR consultancies like Mercer LLC, startups that offer workplace training online, like Open Sesame Inc., and tech firms helping employers create their own videos, like Kaltura Inc.\n\nWrite to Lora Kolodny at lora.kolodny@wsj.com.
