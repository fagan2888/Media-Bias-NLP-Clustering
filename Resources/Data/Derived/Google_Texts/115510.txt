An elderly African elephant making her way across the country to find a new home — and new friends — in Colorado Springs has died, officials at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo said Sunday.

Joni, who was 44 years old, was being moved from the Greenville Zoo in South Carolina to the Front Range to provide the animal with better geriatric care and more opportunities for socialization.

“We knew there was risk involved in transporting Joni because of her age,” Bob Chastain, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo president and CEO, said in a news release. “But we also knew that she deserved the very best end-of-life care and we wanted the chance to give that to her.”

Joni was traveling with a caravan that included the Greenville Zoo’s veterinarian and head elephant keeper. Nine zoos along the way were on standby to help the crew transporting if needed, according to the release.

Joni was found dead by a zoo employee during a fuel stop between Amarillo, Texas, and Colorado Springs, The Associated Press reported.

Animals rarely pass away during transport, but with larger, older animals there comes more risk, according to the release. Officials from both zoos say the decision to move Joni was in the elephant’s best interest.

“Despite this loss, we still know in our hearts that moving Joni to Colorado was the right decision,” Chastain said.

A necropsy will be performed by veterinary staff members from both zoos to determine a cause of death.
