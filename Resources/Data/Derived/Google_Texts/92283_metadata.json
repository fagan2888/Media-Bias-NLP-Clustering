The investigation indicated that someone from another vehicle had fired his gun at the victim.\n\nPolice are still investigating the circumstances of the shooting, Read said.\n\nU.S. 36 was closed for about two hours during the investigation.\n\n\u201cWe are aware the community may be concerned about the circumstances of this shooting,\u201d Read wrote in his news release. \u201cTherefore, we want to reassure the public this was a vehicle-to-vehicle incident.\u201d\n\nAuthorities are asking anyone who may have information regarding this shooting to call the Westminster Police Department at 303-658-4360.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell, denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Westminster investigation: Man shot while driving on U.S. 36", "title": "Westminster investigation: Man shot while driving on U.S. 36", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/11/westminster-investigation-man-shot-while-driving-on-u-s-36/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-11T08:50:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-11T08:50:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb322\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are aware the community may be concerned about the circumstances of this shooting,\u201d Read wrote in his news release.\nAn unidentified suspect traveling in a car on eastbound U.S. 36 shot a man in another car Friday night, causing the injured driver to crash his car near an overpass, police say.\nPolice would later learn that the man was the only one in his car when he was shot and crashed.\nPolice are still investigating the circumstances of the shooting, Read said.\nThe crash happened at about 8:30 p.m. on U.S. 36 near the West 80th Avenue overpass, Read said."}
