While Californians overall reported surprise bills at a lower rate than was seen across the country (23 percent vs. 30 percent), the out-of-network issue was reported more frequently in the state than in the U.S. as a whole (23 percent vs. 15 percent).\n\nConsumer Reports also asked how people dealt with these surprise bills. While the majority (60 percent) said they attempted to resolve the matter in some way, forty percent of Californians responding said they took no action at all. More than half (51 percent) said they did not believe it would make a difference. Nearly one in five (19 percent) said they didn\u2019t have time or it wasn\u2019t worth their time.\n\nAnd it can take a lot of time, as Kelilyn McKeever can attest. But in her case, it netted her thousands of dollars.\n\nMcKeever was 8 months pregnant when she and her husband moved from California to Portland, Oregon last May. She promptly found a new obstetrician and a hospital that were both in-network with her Blue Shield of California plan.\n\n\u201cI absolutely knew to look for in-network providers,\u201d she told me.\n\nShe went into labor in June and ended up needed a c-section. Two different anesthesiologists provided care to her.\n\nIn September she received a$3,300 bill for their services. Blue Shield had denied the claim. McKeever had no idea why.\n\nHer broker advised her to pay the bill so it wouldn\u2019t affect her credit rating. Then, she started fighting.\n\nShe first mailed a grievance to Blue Shield of California and heard nothing for 90 days.\n\nThen she tried everything she could. She called, repeatedly. She tweeted at a Blue Shield and got a reply with a link to the online grievance form. She called again to customer service and was told \u201cnothing can be done.\u201d She says she asked to speak to a supervisor and then \u201cthe conversation got heated.\u201d McKeever said she was left on hold and was never transferred.\n\nThat\u2019s when she contacted me.\n\nLong story short: I called Blue Shield and the matter was resolved within a couple weeks. A Blue Shield spokeswoman said the problem was that the bill was coded incorrectly by the doctors\u2019 office. They later sent McKeever a check for the full $3,300 she had paid the doctors.\n\nI shared this story with Imholz, and she cautioned that people need to be prepared. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing the stamina that you have to have to resolve those things,\u201d she said. But there are other avenues for consumers besides contacting reporters, she added.\n\nStarting with either the doctor\u2019s office or the health plan is a good first step, she said.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s not working,\u201d she says, \u201cthere are assisters out there that are helping people with bills.\u201d\n\nConsumers may also file a complaint with state regulators, \u201cbecause if the state doesn\u2019t get these complaints, they\u2019re never going to have a record and a full sense of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nCalifornians can file complaints for billing problems at the Department of Managed Health Care or the Department of Insurance, depending on the type of coverage they have.\n\nConsumers Union supports two California bills that would help protect consumers from receiving surprise bills. AB 533 would require in-network payments (and co-pays for consumers) for care received at any in-network facility. SB 137 would require that all provider directories are up to date, so that consumers can confirm that providers are in-network.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Of those who received a bill that surprised them, 23% were for out-of-network doctors they thought were in-network.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Nearly 1 in 4 Californians Hit By Surprise Medical Bills\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/05\\/07\\/nearly-1-in-4-californians-hit-by-surprise-medical-bills\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-07 17:16:04\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-07-23 14:26:37\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":25351,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Health Costs\",\"health insurance\"],\"categories\":[],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/05\\/iStock_000001843418_Large-e1431043835252.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Of those who received a bill that surprised them, 23% were for out-of-network doctors they thought were in-network.", "title": "Nearly 1 in 4 Californians Hit By Surprise Medical Bills", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/05/07/nearly-1-in-4-californians-hit-by-surprise-medical-bills/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/05/iStock_000001843418_Large-1440x1080.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "health costs,health insurance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd977f\"", "article_summary": "Consumers Union supports two California bills that would help protect consumers from receiving surprise bills.\nShe tweeted at a Blue Shield and got a reply with a link to the online grievance form.\nLong story short: I called Blue Shield and the matter was resolved within a couple weeks.\nShe promptly found a new obstetrician and a hospital that were both in-network with her Blue Shield of California plan.\nShe first mailed a grievance to Blue Shield of California and heard nothing for 90 days."}
