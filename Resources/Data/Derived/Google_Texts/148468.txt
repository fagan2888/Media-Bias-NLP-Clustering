Thirteen workers at a Subway location in Bloomsbury, N.J., will soon be members of a union, a move some observers say will inspire others to do the same.

The workers voted eight to five in favour of unionizing, and will soon be members of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.

The Subway employees work for Pilot Flying J, which runs the rest area where the Subway location is located. The company doesn’t seem to be objecting to the move, and issued only very neutral comments.

"We would simply like to reiterate that we value all of our team members and appreciate their hard work and commitment to serving our customers," the company said in a statement.

The move comes amid reports of fast food workers losing their jobs amid efforts to unionize.

This isn’t just an issue in the U.S. The Supreme Court of Canada recently ordered Walmart to compensate former workers after closing a Quebec location that had voted to unionize.
