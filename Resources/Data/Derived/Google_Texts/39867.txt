The JoAnn McDonald Health and Wellness Center opened this week at St. Luke Tabernacle Community Church, 1261 Dewey Ave.

The center is open from 4 to 7 p.m. Tuesdays through Thursdays, with a different free walk-in service each night.

“The reality is that even with the Affordable Care Act and increased access, there still are large numbers of the community that find themselves without basic medical treatment and preventive counseling and care,” said Rev. James H. Evans Jr., pastor of St. Luke.

On Tuesdays, nurses will provide basic health screenings. On Wednesdays, medical students and attending physicians will perform basic tests and conduct physicals. On Thursdays, help will be available for English- and Spanish-speakers who want to sign up for health insurance, and social workers will be on site.

St. Luke Community of Care, Inc., includes the James Perkins Youth Development Center, People Inc. Finger Lakes After School Respite Program and the St. Luke Community Foundation.
