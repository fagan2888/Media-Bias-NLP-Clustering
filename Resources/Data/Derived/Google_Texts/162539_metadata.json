Paul Ryan, R-Wis., unveiled a tendentious audit (PDF) of U.S. anti-poverty programs, is an especially gory day.\n\nMy colleague Joan Walsh gets at why credulous coverage of Ryan et al. is so frustrating:\n\n\u201cHow many times are we going to be told that there\u2019s a \u201cnew\u201d Paul Ryan who really, really, really cares about the poor \u2013 and whose budget proposals consistently slash programs designed to help them.\u201d\n\nThis is an especially large challenge because when (likely) future presidential candidates do stuff, reporters can\u2019t just ignore them and, anyhow, who\u2019s to say Ryan hasn\u2019t had a change of heart?\n\nActually the evidence is right there on the first page of his new report. \u201cDespite trillions of dollars in spending, poverty is widespread,\u201d it reads. \u201cIn 1965, the poverty rate was 17.3 percent. In 2012, it was 15 percent.\u201d Sounds like a huge bust, right?\n\nExcept, there\u2019s a footnote at the end of that sentence, and it reads, \u201cThe Official Poverty Rate does not include government transfers to low-income households.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m surprised Ryan included this caveat, even though it\u2019s more honest to include it than to leave it out. Because it also reveals that his critique of federal anti-poverty programs is premised on a metric designed to create a false impression that tons of money has been wasted, when really it\u2019s done exactly what it was supposed to.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Want to see how Republicans aren't serious about reducing poverty?
