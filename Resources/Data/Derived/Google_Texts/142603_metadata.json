That infection ended his nine-season career, and on Tuesday he filed a lawsuit alleging his former trainer was responsible for the infection, which he says still ails him to this day.\n\nThe lawsuit filed on Tuesday claims Buccaneers trainer Todd Toriscelli is responsible for the infection, The Tampa Bay Times reported. It also cites the team\u2019s negligence for \u201cunsanitary conditions\u201d at the team\u2019s facility and says the Buccaneers \u201cfailed to disclose and actively concealed ongoing incidents of infection\u201d among other people there. The suit is also seeking $20 million in lost earnings.\n\nTynes says his infection began soon after undergoing a routine off-season procedure that involved trimming his right foot\u2019s big toenail. He developed an ingrown toenail and underwent a procedure to fix it; a few days later, it became red and swollen, and pus began to ooze out.\n\n\u201cThe second or third day and I usually can kick in practice,\u201d Tynes told The Times. \u201cFinally, like the third day, I said, \u2018Something is not right.\u2019 I was feverish, sick, so that\u2019s when I said I\u2019m not healing like I had the previous 10 or 12 times I\u2019ve done it and obviously that\u2019s when I sought out the trainers and said, \u2018What do you guys think here?\u2019\u201d\n\nTynes said he was undergoing antibiotic treatment at the same time, but because they kept switching the drugs, he sought a second opinion. That\u2019s when he found out he had an MRSA infection. Because these infections can quickly become life-threatening, spreading to the blood, bones, and organs, Tynes underwent three procedures and had a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) placed near his heart to deliver antibiotics.\n\nAround this time, Tynes was placed \u2014 wrongfully, he says \u2014 on the non-football injury list, which exempted him from certain monetary benefits players on injured reserve get, such as another season toward his pension. He was only paid his salary for the remainder of his season (about $905,000). He also learned during this time Toriscelli had suffered knee injuries, and that he also had a PICC line delivering antibiotics to fight MRSA. The suit claims he \u201cadmitted to close friends\u201d that his own infection was the source of Tynes\u2019 MRSA, since they had used the same equipment and therapy devices, as well as hot and cold tubs.\n\n\u201cIt is sad,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cListen, it\u2019s frustrating as hell. You miss football every day. I\u2019m not going to sit here and say I don\u2019t. You still think you can do it, but there\u2019s an issue with your foot that makes it impossible for you to play. It\u2019s hard when something is taken away from you through no fault of your own.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "former, tampa, bay, buccaneers, kicker, lawrence, tynes, sues, team, says, trainer, source", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Former kicker for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Lawrence Tynes is suing the team for lost wages and claims its trainer is the source of an MRSA infection that ended his career.", "title": "Former NFL Kicker Sues Team Over MRSA Infection", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/former-tampa-bay-buccaneers-kicker-lawrence-tynes-sues-team-says-trainer-source-328572", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/lawrence-tynes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former kicker for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Lawrence Tynes is suing the team for lost wages and claims its trainer is the source of an MRSA infection that ended his career.", "title": "Former NFL Kicker Sues Team Over MRSA Infection", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/former-tampa-bay-buccaneers-kicker-lawrence-tynes-sues-team-says-trainer-source-328572", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/lawrence-tynes.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/lawrence-tynes.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-08T17:01:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-08T17:01:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Former kicker for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Lawrence Tynes is suing the team for lost wages and claims its trainer is the source of an MRSA infection that ended his career."}, "article_summary": "The lawsuit filed on Tuesday claims Buccaneers trainer Todd Toriscelli is responsible for the infection, The Tampa Bay Times reported.\nTynes says his infection began soon after undergoing a routine off-season procedure that involved trimming his right foot\u2019s big toenail.\nThat\u2019s when he found out he had an MRSA infection.\nThe suit claims he \u201cadmitted to close friends\u201d that his own infection was the source of Tynes\u2019 MRSA, since they had used the same equipment and therapy devices, as well as hot and cold tubs.\nBecause these infections can quickly become life-threatening, spreading to the blood, bones, and organs, Tynes underwent three procedures and had a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) placed near his heart to deliver antibiotics."}
