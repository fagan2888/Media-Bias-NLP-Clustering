YouthBuild Charter School, which gives dropouts an opportunity to earn high school diplomas while learning job skills, is one of two local programs awarded $1.1 million grants from the U.S. Department of Labor.

Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez announced grants totaling nearly $76 million to 72 YouthBuild programs in 31 states Wednesday.

"YouthBuild equips young people with the tools they need to realize their potential and the job skills they need to climb career ladders and punch their tickets to the middle class," Perez said in a media teleconference. "Closing opportunity gaps for America's young people is a matter of basic fairness and critical to our ability to compete in the global economy."
