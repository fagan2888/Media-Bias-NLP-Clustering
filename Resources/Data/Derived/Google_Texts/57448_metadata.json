District of Columbia case filed a motion Thursday asking U.S. District Court Judge Frederick J. Scullin Jr. to block the legislation \u201cunless and until such time as the District of Columbia adopts a licensing mechanism consistent with constitutional standards enabling people to exercise their Second Amendment right to bear arms.\u201d\n\nThe D.C. Council adopted emergency legislation last month that establishes for the first time in decades a process by which gun owners can apply to carry a concealed weapon on city streets. The approved legislation, valid for 90 days, would grant the city\u2019s police chief the authority to issue concealed carry permits and would require gun owners to demonstrate \u201cgood reason\u201d to carry a gun.\n\nSEE ALSO: Lawmakers grudgingly draft bill to authorize concealed carry of guns in D.C.\n\n\u201cThey have merely dusted off their earlier statute restricting handgun carry licenses at the police chief\u2019s pleasure, a licensing regime which explicitly rejects the notion that people have a right to carry handguns for self-defense,\u201d wrote attorney Alan Gura in his request for an injunction.\n\nJudge Scullin struck down the city\u2019s ban on carrying guns in public in July, writing in his opinion that \u201cthere is no longer any basis on which this Court can conclude that the District of Columbia\u2019s total ban on the public carrying of ready-to-use handguns outside the home is constitutional under any level of scrutiny.\u201d His ruling is on hold until Oct. 22, giving the city time to implement the new law.\n\nCity attorneys are still considering whether to appeal the case, but Attorney General Irvin B. Nathan has previously said the city modeled its \u201cmay issue\u201d approach to permits on states such as New York and Maryland, where such statutes have withstood challenges in federal courts.\n\nThe law also defined training requirements for those seeking to carry a concealed handgun and outlined prohibitions on firearms in certain sensitive locations \u2014 such as in schools and government buildings, or within 1,000 feet of demonstrations or public dignitaries.\n\n\u201cAt the minimum the city needs to allow responsible, law abiding people to carry handguns for self-defense. That\u2019s the absolute minimum,\u201d Mr. Gura said in an interview Thursday. \u201cRegulation about training and sensitive places, that\u2019s for another day. But at the heart of it we have a dispute about the right to carry handguns for self-defense.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gun owners who successfully sued the D.C. government to overturn the city's ban on carrying firearms in public are asking a judge to block implementation of new laws regulating concealed carry, saying the measure is unconstitutionally restrictive.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Gun owners who successfully sued the D.C. government to overturn the city\u2019s ban on carrying firearms in public are asking a judge to block implementation of new laws regulating concealed carry, saying the measure is unconstitutionally restrictive.", "title": "Gun owners ask judge to block new D.C. concealed carry law", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/2/gun-owners-ask-judge-block-new-dc-concealed-carry-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/21/guns_20140820_001.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/21/guns_20140820_001.jpg", "description": "Gun owners who successfully sued the D.C. government to overturn the city's ban on carrying firearms in public are asking a judge to block implementation of new laws regulating concealed carry, saying", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Gun owners ask judge to block new D.C. concealed carry law"}, "Author": "Andrea Noble", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Frederick J Scullin Jr"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0e9\"", "article_summary": "Gun owners who successfully sued the D.C. government to overturn the city\u2019s ban on carrying firearms in public are asking a judge to block implementation of a new law regulating concealed carry, saying the measure is unconstitutionally restrictive.\nThe approved legislation, valid for 90 days, would grant the city\u2019s police chief the authority to issue concealed carry permits and would require gun owners to demonstrate \u201cgood reason\u201d to carry a gun.\nBut at the heart of it we have a dispute about the right to carry handguns for self-defense.\u201d\n\u201cAt the minimum the city needs to allow responsible, law abiding people to carry handguns for self-defense.\nThe law also defined training requirements for those seeking to carry a concealed handgun and outlined prohibitions on firearms in certain sensitive locations \u2014 such as in schools and government buildings, or within 1,000 feet of demonstrations or public dignitaries."}
