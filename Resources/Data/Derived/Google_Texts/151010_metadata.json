That would mean religious nonprofits in seven states would not have to comply with the law, while in the remaining few dozens states covered in rulings would. That's problematic.\n\nThat\u2019s not ideal, says David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University\u2019s law school. \u201cThe Supreme Court normally tries to resolve circuit splits because they don\u2019t want federal laws interpreted differently in different parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe other possibility in the case of a deadlock is that the Supreme Court will hold over a decision until a justice with the deciding vote is finally confirmed. Which potentially could mean another year or more of limbo. Despite Sen. Orrin Hatch's assurances that that would be Antonin Scalia's wishes, a year of chaos in the federal judiciary on issues this important is not a good thing.\n\nBut that's not going to stop Republicans from making it happen. They want to maximize disfunction in every branch of government, and have pretty well succeeded at that so far. Only in their wildest dreams could they extend breaking government to the Supreme Court, and now that's in their grasp.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "A three-judge panel on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has upheld the birth control mandate in Obamacare, becoming the eighth circuit court to rule for the government.
