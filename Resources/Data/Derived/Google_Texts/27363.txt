Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey's head is spliced into an anti-drug message featuring the cast of 'Saved By The Bell.' [YouTube]

Impatience was apparently the driving force behind a strange public service announcement featuring Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey — or at least, his head, The New York Daily News reported.

“I just got tired of waiting and crudely pasted the commissioner’s face over the original video,” said the department’s social media manager, Sgt. Eric Gripp.

The 39-second clip is taken directly from a similar video released in 1991 by NBC featuring the stars of Saved By The Bell and Brandon Tartikoff, who was the network’s head at the time. Ramsey’s face is superimposed over Tartikoff’s.

Ramsey can be heard stating his name, before the audio switches to Tartikoff saying, “– and I’ve got a hit idea for the new fall season: don’t do drugs.”

Gripp said he originally wanted to superimpose other officers’ faces over the rest of the cast, but nixed that plan after it became “overly difficult with everyone’s schedules.”

While viewers reportedly wondered if the video was real, Gripp said Ramsey took it in good stride.

“Fortunately for me the boss is very down-to-earth and has a great sense of humor,” he said.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the department did something similar this past April, posting a Sizzler infomercial for potential franchise owners with voice-overs recruiting viewers.

Watch the video, as posted on the department’s YouTube channel, below.
