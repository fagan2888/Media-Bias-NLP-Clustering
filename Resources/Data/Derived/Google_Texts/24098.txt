Marlon Brando starred in a lot of roles that are justifiably considered iconic, but it was arguably his portrayal of outlaw biker Johnny Strabler in the 1953 film “The Wild One” that helped set him on the path to enduring celebrity.

And now, you can bid on one of Brando’s personal motorcycles. No, it’s not the bike from “The Wild One” — that was a Triumph Thunderbird. Rather, this is a 1969 Harley-Davidson HOG, +0.42% FLH Electra-Glide purchased by Brando in 1970, well after “The Wild One” was filmed (but just before “The Godfather”). A transfer notice from Harley-Davidson in Los Angeles to Brando proves it was once his, and based on the 13,859-mile odometer reading, he spent a fair amount of time in the saddle.

Steve McQueen-owned bikes usually dominate the “motorcycle with celebrity provenance” headlines, and for good reason: McQueen, a well-known lover of all things gasoline-powered, owned a lot of them. Brando, by contrast, isn’t really recognized as a gear head, despite his defining role in “The Wild One.” So that makes this Harley somewhat special.

Julian It’s no Triumph, but Brando’s 1969 Harley is still a smooth ride.

To be the only guy on a Brando bike in a sea of ex-McQueen Husqvarnas, however, you’ll have to pay handsomely: Starting bid for this online auction, which ends June 26, is a cool $100,000, and the expected hammer price is between $200,000 and $400,000.

That seems a tad optimistic to us, but that’s a far cry for the most ever paid for a motorcycle at auction — $852,000 for a 1915 Cyclone. Yes, it was once owned by Steve McQueen. On the plus side, you can use that extra cash to bid on a Brando-owned leather jacket. There’s a whole bunch of them on the block courtesy of the same auction house selling the bike.

Head to Julien’s Auctions to check out the Harley or to cast a bid.
