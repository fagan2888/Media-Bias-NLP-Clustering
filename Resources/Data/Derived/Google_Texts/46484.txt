Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded Wednesday to a series of threatening tweets from Iran’s supreme religious leader Ayatollah Khamenei warning that the Jewish state would disappear in 25 years.

“This will not happen,” Mr. Netanyahusaid while on a visit to London, according to the transcript posted by his office in Jerusalem. “Israel is a strong country and it will become even stronger.”

He added that Mr. Khamenei’s remarks send a clear message to the U.S. and supporters of the new nuclear deal between Tehran and other world powers should be under no illusions of Iran’s intentions.

“Khamenei is not giving supporters of the agreement any room for illusion,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “He has made it clear that the U.S. is the Great Satan and that Iran intends to destroy the State of Israel.”

Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Khameneipublished several threatening tweets vowing Israel would be hounded until it is destroyed and that Iran would not negotiate with the U.S. on any matters outside the nuclear deal.

“The conclusion that arises from the remarks of the tyrant in Tehran is that all responsible countries must cooperate in order to stop Iran’s terrorism and aggression which, to my regret, will only increase as a result of the agreement,” Mr. Netanyahu said.
