ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, has railed against money in politics, going so far as trying to amend the Constitution to stop it. But he’s being really quiet now that one of his environmentalist buddies is on top of the spending charts.

Billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer, a former hedge-fund manager and speaker at Mr. Reid’s 2013 clean energy summit, is now the biggest individual donor to super PACs in history, donating $55 million to groups in hopes of making climate change an issue in the midterms, The New York Times reports.

He beats out casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who dropped $49.8 million in 2012 to super PACs backing Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney.

Mr. Reid defended Mr. Adelson, a powerful figure in Nevada, and his spending, saying “he’s not in it for the money,” but he’s been vocal in attacking billionaire conservatives Charles and David Koch for their “attempt to buy our democracy.”

Mr. Reid has yet to decry Mr. Steyer’s attempt to buy our democracy, but that’s probably because he’s given $5 million to the Senate Majority PAC that’s fighting to keep Democrats in power.
