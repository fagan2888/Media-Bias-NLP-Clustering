In January 2014 the Colorado Division of Insurance cancelled 249,000 plans because these plans didn\u2019t meet the requirements of Obamacare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain in 2015, 190,000 plans on the individual and small-group market were cancelled. In total, according to the Congressional Research Service, over 750,000 health insurance plans in Colorado were cancelled between 2013-2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that still wasn\u2019t the end of it and Coloradans are still receiving cancellation notices.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the last months, two of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, UnitedHealthCare and Humana, announced their intent to exit the individual market place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UnitedHealth Group CEO cited that the marketplaces were a risky investment, and that UnitedHealth could not serve these exchanges on an \u201ceffective and sustained basis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis decision will impact roughly 20,000 Coloradans and beneficiaries of these plans can expect cancellation notices in July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disappointment and frustration over a cancelled plan that your family once enjoyed is made worse by the rising costs of the remaining plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericans were told Obamacare would reduce costs for families, businesses and our government.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Colorado Division of Insurance found that individual insurance premiums for 2016 on the Western Slope rose by an average of 25.8 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne woman, interviewed by the Denver Post, living on the Western Slope saw her premium cost alone rise from $300 per month to $1,828 per month, or nearly $22,000 a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says, \u201cIt\u2019s actually like another mortgage payment. I have friends who are uninsured right now because they can\u2019t afford it. Insurance is hard up here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAn increase of nearly 26 percent is incredible, but in 2014, one study found that nearly 150,000 Coloradans saw their health insurance become 77 percent more expensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n26 percent increases, 77 percent increases, as we approach new rates for 2017, it appears there may be no limit to the additional costs that Coloradans will have to bear as the result of this poorly conceived law.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarilyn Tavenner, president and CEO of America\u2019s health Insurance Plans who served as a key\n\n\n\n\n\nContinued on next page ... 1 2 3 >>\n\n\n\n<< Previous Story Next Story >>\n\n\n\nReceive a free weekly news summary by email!\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect keywords to find additional stories on this topic:\n\n\n\nOBAMACARE DAMAGING COUNTRY COSTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend This Story To a Friend Your Name: Friends Email Address: Your Email Address: Custom Message: Captcha: Please enter the string shown in the image\n\n\n\nPublisher information protected by image generation.", "article_metadata": {"Publisher": "politicalnews.me", "Designer": "politicalnews.me - Free Press Release Distribution Center", "Description": "Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) spoke on the Senate floor about the impact of the President\u2019s healthcare law on Colorado.", "Copyright": "\u00a9 politicalnews.me - Free Press Release Distribution Center", "Author": "politicalnews.me - Free Press Release Distribution Center", "Abstract": "politicalnews.me - Free Press Release Distribution Center", "Title": "New Gardner: Obamacare Continues to Hurt Colorado", "verify-v1": "VbJHgvZTqGyvhpISULnotbAsrxCAFid5rj7Z/gjgiSA=", "Robots": "Index,Follow", "Revisit-After": "1 Days", "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "True", "GOOGLEBOT-NEWS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "Keywords": "OBAMACARE,DAMAGING,COUNTRY,COSTS, news,press", "Distribution": "Global", "Rating": "General", "Subject": "Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) spoke on the Senate floor about the impact of the President\u2019s healthcare law on Colorado."}, "article_summary": "Click here to view related Website : US SENATOR CORY GARDNER Publish Date: 2016-05-21 << Previous Story Next Story >>Reading: Gardner: Obamacare Continues to Hurt Colorado1 2 3 >> PoliticalNews.me - May 21,2016 - Gardner: Obamacare Continues to Hurt ColoradoWashington, DC \u2013 Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) spoke on the Senate floor about the impact of the President\u2019s healthcare law on Colorado.\nGardner: Obamacare Continues to Hurt ColoradoSenator Cory Gardner (R-CO) spoke on the Senate floor about the impact of the President\u2019s healthcare law on Colorado.\nAs Obamacare continues on a downward trajectory, Americans are the ones bearing the brunt of its failures.\nIn January 2014 the Colorado Division of Insurance cancelled 249,000 plans because these plans didn\u2019t meet the requirements of Obamacare.\nIn total, according to the Congressional Research Service, over 750,000 health insurance plans in Colorado were cancelled between 2013-2015."}
