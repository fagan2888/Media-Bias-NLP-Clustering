Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) has questioned whether expanding the benefits is legal, saying in a recent letter to OPM Director Katherine Archuleta that the rule change would violate a statute pertaining to temporary and seasonal federal workers.\n\n\n\n(HECU Health)\n\nCurrent law states that non-permanent federal employees become eligible for the health plan after \u201c1 year of current continuous employment, excluding any break in service of 5 days or less,\u201d Coburn noted.\n\nThe senator also pointed out that OPM official Angela Bailey testified before Congress in 2010 that the law is \u201cwritten in such a way that it excludes temporary employees from receiving health benefits.\u201d\n\nCoburn\u2019s letter asked OPM to explain the agency\u2019s recent change in position and provide legal justification for how the proposed rule could possibly comply with the law.\n\nOPM did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter Friday afternoon.\n\nFederal-worker unions support the extension benefits to temporary and seasonal workers. The National Treasury Employees Union released a statement last month applauding the proposed OPM rule, calling it a \u201cwelcome step for important groups of federal employees that have been excluded from the [federal-employee health plan].\u201d\n\nThe federal government employed about 120,000 temporary, seasonal and intermittent workers. OPM has estimated that the expansion of benefits to those personnel will cost between $21 million and $42 million annually.\n\nCoburn is focusing on the legality of the OPM rule, which is a reasonable concern. But this issue could ultimately boil down to how much the government wants to pay.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the government has to fork over extra cash, either in the form of penalties or expanded coverage for the workers who are not permanent federal employees. It is unclear at this point which would cost more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
