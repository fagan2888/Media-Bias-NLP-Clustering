Only one in 10,000 horse pregnancies results in twins. And once they're born, doctors say only 20-percent of twin horses survive.

A Harrah couple is coming to grips with being the new owners of twins, twin Horses that is.

Terry and Jerry Leach have owned barrel racing horses for years. One of their prize mares "Dolly" gave birth to twin girls last Friday.

Only one in 10,000 horse pregnancies results in twins. And once they're born, doctors say only 20-percent of twin horses survive. However, so far so good for mom and both girls, named "Honor This," and "Honor That."

"As soon as we know they're going to be OK and strong, they will get out in the pasture," Terry Leach said Thursday from the family farm in Harrah. "We did not know she was having twins at all."
