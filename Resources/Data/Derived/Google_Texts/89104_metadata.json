He expects the process to be complete by late February, The Des Moines Register reported.\n\nGerhart said he chose liquidation after determining the cooperative\u2019s medical claims would exceed its cash on hand. He said special insurance-guarantee funds will pay outstanding claims, but he recommended people find other health insurance coverage by March 1 or earlier. The deadline for open enrollment for 2015 coverage in Feb. 15.\n\n\u201cOur No. 1 priority is to the Iowans and Nebraskans impacted by this event,\u201d Gerhart said in a statement. \u201cWe want to ensure a seamless transition as possible to other coverage and avoid any gaps in coverage.\u201d\n\nWest Des Moines-based CoOportunity was a federally funded nonprofit created under the Affordable Care Act that was aimed at providing more health care options in Iowa and Nebraska. State regulators took over CoOportunity late last year after the organization\u2019s available funds depleted.\n\nMartin Hickey, chairman of the National Alliance of State Health Co-Ops, said the carrier lost money by participating in a plan that used federal Medicaid money to buy private policies for moderate-income Iowa residents who were relatively unhealthy.\n\n\u201cI think they were exposed to an inordinate amount of risk in that population,\u201d said Hickey, who also leads New Mexico\u2019s health insurance cooperative.\n\nGerhart said CoOportunity hit a cash flow crunch after a provision adopted by Congress reduced its assets.\n\nCoOportunity insures about 120,000 people in Iowa and Nebraska.\n\nCopyright 2016 Associated Press.
