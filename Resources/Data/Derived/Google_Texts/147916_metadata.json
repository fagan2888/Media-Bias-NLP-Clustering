That\u2019s almost half of the 26 minute national average.\n\nLonger wait times can mean extra stress for patient and for hospitals, which are under pressure to keep times low while prioritizing care for those who need it first.\n\nSandra Puente, 37, of McAllen, said she\u2019s had good and bad experiences at hospital emergency wait rooms in the past. Most recently, she said it was a breeze.\n\n\u201cIt was really fast, I was surprised,\u201d Puente said of a recent trip with her 5-year-old son at the Rio Grande Valley Regional Hospital emergency room about three weeks ago. \u201cHe had some chest pains, so we wanted to make sure it wasn\u2019t something to do with his heart.\u201d\n\nPuente said that within 20 minutes she was seen by a doctor and out the door within an hour.\n\nBut Puente said it hasn\u2019t always been so rosy. One time her daughter had accidentally poked herself in the mouth with a pen and they waited for hours.\n\n\u201cMy daughter was bleeding and they told us after she could have hit an artery,\u201d she said of her experience at the McAllen Medical Center, where she said they waited four hours to be seen by a doctor.\n\nHOSPITAL RESPONSE\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services data show that in 2013, most Valley hospitals\u2019 ER wait times ran beyond state and national averages.\n\nRio Grande Valley Regional was the quickest ER across the region, with wait times averaging 13 minutes before a patient can see a doctor.\n\n\u201cBoth Rio Grande Regional Hospital and Valley Regional Medical Center are very pleased that their (emergency department) wait times are below both the Texas and national average,\u201d hospital spokeswoman Mariana Tumlinson said.\n\nSouth Texas Health System declined an interview for this story, but announced it plans to open two new stand-alone emergency rooms \u2014 one this winter in Weslaco and another in Mission in the spring.\n\nSouth Texas Health System, which operates McAllen Medical Center, Edinburg Regional Hospital and several other local hospitals, recorded a 32-minute ER wait time. Officials disputed that figure, saying their average wait time is below the national average at 25 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe always look to improve wait times to enhance our patient\u2019s experience.\u201d South Texas Health System spokeswoman Cari Lambrecht said in a statement of the six-hospital network.\n\nMcAllen Medical Center offers an \u201cER Reserve\u201d website that allows patients to schedule a time for \u201cless serious\u201d emergency care and allows patients to wait at home and can make an appointment up to 12 hours in advance. Posted on the company\u2019s website is an ER wait time of two minutes before a registered nurse follows up with a patient.\n\nKnapp Medical Center in Weslaco recorded the longest ER wait time among hospitals in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\n\u201cFor the past year, Knapp Medical Center has seen an increase of Emergency Department patients, which has contributed to longer wait times,\u201d Knapp spokeswoman Dinah Gonzalez said in a statement. \u201cTo aid us in our commitment to serving our patients, Knapp has recently implemented a number of process improvement initiatives in our Emergency Room that will reduce wait times from their currently historic levels.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of the pack fell Mission Regional Medical Center, Starr County Memorial Hospital and Doctor\u2019s Hospital at Renaissance in Edinburg.\n\nDHR chief executive Israel Rocha Jr. said it expects to fall in line with the national average this year and have been looking into \u201cfast track\u201d centers to expedite care. Nurse practitioners currently meet patients first and assess the severity of their symptoms.\n\n\u201cThe triage process helps us get to patients who need to care the fastest,\u201d he said and attributed the longer than average wait times to an influx of patients who need care. \u201cI think we have a growing population and we have more patients in the Rio Grande Valley, however we saw the numbers and it\u2019s something that we are working to improve.\u201d\n\nHEALTHCARE LAW\n\nIndustry advocates said that long wait times in places with large indigent populations like Hidalgo and Starr counties are caused by bottlenecks of patients without insurance.\n\n\u201cThose wait times are the result of people not having a private health insurance option so they go to the ER to get the care they need,\u201d said Lance Lunsford, spokesperson at the Texas Hospital Association. He added that hospital emergency rooms are mandated by federal law to provide some care to all individuals.\n\n\u201cThe higher the rate of uninsured, the higher the demand in an ER versus where it should be: a primary care setting,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvocates for state expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 and largely ignored by Republican-controlled legislatures, say the crowds are likely to grow.\n\n\u201cThe fact is until we have expanded Medicaid, working poor people are going to be using the emergency room like a night clinic,\u201d said Ann Williams Cass, executive director of Proyecto Azteca and chair of the RGV equal voice health working group.\n\nCass said that about 300,000 residents in Hidalgo County who are at or below 100 percent of the poverty rate are in a \u201cdark hole,\u201d working minimum wage jobs but can\u2019t afford $400 a month for health insurance.\n\nBut she said the future of any Medicaid expansion in Texas is dim; the proposal didn\u2019t make it out of legislative committees at the state level since Gov. Rick Perry announced he would veto the bill.\n\nAnd all federal healthcare clinics will face 70 percent cuts in funding if no resolution is reached by federal lawmakers, who have until October to avoid another fiscal cliff.\n\n\u201cThey will be waiting until they are so sick they need to use the hospitals,\u201d she added.\n\nkmosbrucker@themonitor.com\n\nFor the most complete version of this story, log in or subscribe to MyMonitorNews.com.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Monitor", "description": "As students across the Rio Grande Valley flood back to schools and the summer heat notches down during the fall and winter months, the cold and flu season approaches.", "title": "ER wait times lag behind in the RGV", "url": "http://www.themonitor.com/news/local/er-wait-times-lag-behind-in-the-rgv/article_047ea76e-2fe3-11e4-8505-0017a43b2370.html", "image": {"width": 768, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/themonitor.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/4e/34e53d60-2fe2-11e4-83f0-0017a43b2370/54012425421fb.preview-768.jpg?resize=768%2C543", "height": 543}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@monitornews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 108049775881002}, "keywords": "local,top_story", "google-site-verification": "V8P2NNokGINCTv-r9xQHek8dzZWwYYMCQbh2f7o4PGQ", "news_keywords": "local,top_story", "description": "As students across the Rio Grande Valley flood back to schools and the summer heat notches down during the fall and winter months, the cold and flu season approaches."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde453\"", "article_summary": "Sandra Puente, 37, of McAllen, said she\u2019s had good and bad experiences at hospital emergency wait rooms in the past.\nHOSPITAL RESPONSECenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services data show that in 2013, most Valley hospitals\u2019 ER wait times ran beyond state and national averages.\nPosted on the company\u2019s website is an ER wait time of two minutes before a registered nurse follows up with a patient.\nLonger wait times can mean extra stress for patient and for hospitals, which are under pressure to keep times low while prioritizing care for those who need it first.\nRio Grande Valley Regional was the quickest ER across the region, with wait times averaging 13 minutes before a patient can see a doctor."}
