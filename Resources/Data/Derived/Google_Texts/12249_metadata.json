Veteran\u2019s groups and many lawmakers have united in calling for a fix, with many members of Congress introducing plans to pay for a $6 billion repeal.\n\n\u201cThe American Legion is disappointed that President Obama did not show more leadership in dealing with the COLA issue,\u201d Daniel M. Dellinger, the American Legion\u2019s national commander, said Wednesday in a statement.\n\n\u201cHe promised us, back in August 2011 at our national convention, that he would not balance the federal budget on the backs of America\u2019s veterans. But that is exactly what he is allowing Congress to do,\u201d he said.\n\nThe omnibus appropriations bill completed earlier this month repealed the cuts for disabled veterans and surviving families of deceased veterans, but the cuts are still scheduled to take effect for other retirees in December 2015.\n\nPaul Rieckhoff, founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans for America, also said he was frustrated that the president was silent on the issue of military retirement cuts.\n\n\u201cVeterans across the country are reeling from the surprise attack to their earned benefits. We need immediate action from the president and Congress to restore the promises our country made to them and their families,\u201d Mr. Rieckhoff said in a statement.\n\n\u201cVeterans don\u2019t want any more excuses and won\u2019t take no for an answer. It\u2019s time to restore the retirement cuts,\u201d he concluded.\n\nMr. Rieckhoff was on Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning urging lawmakers to undo the cuts as soon as possible, before attending Tuesday night\u2019s speech as the guest of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, New York Democrat.\n\nDespite being critical of the president for omitting the COLA cuts from his speech, both veterans\u2019 group leaders commended the president on his promises to reduce the disability claims backlog, improve access to healthcare and mental health services for vets, and work to decrease unemployment among veterans.\n\n\u201cWe know he wants to do right by our men and women who have worn the uniform and defended America,\u201d Mr. Dellinger said. \u201cThe Legion will do everything it can to support his efforts to reduce the claims backlog, strengthen medical services at VA and DoD, and get more of our veterans back into the civilian workforce.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While President Obama talked about many initiatives to help veterans during his State of the Union address Tuesday night, veterans' groups criticized him Wednesday for not demanding a full repeal of cuts to military retirement benefits.", "Author": "Jacqueline Klimas", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "While President Obama talked about many initiatives to help veterans during his State of the Union address Tuesday night, veterans\u2019 groups criticized him Wednesday for not demanding a full repeal of cuts to military retirement benefits.", "title": "Veterans\u2019 groups disappointed in Obama on veteran benefits", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/29/american-legion-disappointed-obama-veteran-benefit/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/08/30/obama_lea.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/08/30/obama_lea.jpg", "title": "Veterans\u2019 groups disappointed in Obama on veteran benefits", "description": "While President Obama talked about many initiatives to help veterans during his State of the Union address Tuesday night, veterans' groups criticized him Wednesday for not demanding a full repeal of c", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Politics, Social Issues, Daniel M Dellinger, Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9dde\"", "article_summary": "While President Obama talked about many initiatives to help veterans during his State of the Union address Tuesday night, veterans\u2019 groups criticized him Wednesday for not demanding a full repeal of cuts to military retirement benefits.\nIt\u2019s time to restore the retirement cuts,\u201d he concluded.\nPaul Rieckhoff, founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans for America, also said he was frustrated that the president was silent on the issue of military retirement cuts.\nVeteran\u2019s groups and many lawmakers have united in calling for a fix, with many members of Congress introducing plans to pay for a $6 billion repeal.\n\u201cVeterans across the country are reeling from the surprise attack to their earned benefits."}
