A 2012 study from the Center for Strategic Economic Research showed that the health system generated more than $3.4 billion in annual economic output. Of the four largest private employers in the region, three of them are health systems \u2014 Kaiser (10,000 employees), Sutter (9,000) and Dignity Health (7,000). This is more than Intel, Hewlett-Packard or Wells Fargo. Kaiser alone uses more than 1 million square feet to provide care. The industry is stable. Hospitals are less impacted by the jerky ups and downs of the economy, as there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cbull market\u201d or \u201cbear market\u201d for diabetes and liver transplants.\n\nAnd whether it\u2019s a new trend, a bit of gender-equity karma or just a wonderful coincidence, in this critical sector of the economy, all four of the region\u2019s health centers are led by female executives. At Dignity Health, Laurie Harting is the senior vice president of operations for the Sacramento region. At UC Davis, Ann Madden Rice is the CEO of the medical center. The Kaiser Permanente Sacramento Medical Center is helmed by Sandy Sharon, and its South Sacramento Medical Center is led by Patricia Rodriguez. In January 2016, Sara Krevans was tapped as Sutter Health\u2019s first female CEO, while Theresa Frei serves as CEO of Sutter Medical Foundation.\n\nThe significance is not lost on these women. We reached out to the industry\u2019s senior leadership to get their thoughts on where the hospitals are headed, what they\u2019re focused on, how gender opportunity is changing and what Sacramento can expect with the future of health care.\n\nBucking the Trend\n\nHospitals have never been a paragon of gender diversity. A 2012 study from Rock Health (a health startup incubator) showed that women made up 73 percent of all managers in health care, but only 4 percent of CEOs. Other studies have pegged it at 24 percent of CEOs; either way, the numbers are low. Why the gap?\n\n\u201cI definitely see that in the past four or five years, there\u2019s a trend in people being more open to women succeeding in CEO positions.\u201d Laurie Harting, senior vice president of operations, Dignity Health Sacramento\n\nOne reason is that the career path of a CEO is not, typically, the career path that most women in health care tend to choose. To oversimplify, CEOs often come from spreadsheets, not stethoscopes. \u201cIn acute-care settings, RNs [resident nurses] are a large part of the workforce, which historically have been perceived as roles for women,\u201d explains Frei of Sutter. \u201cHistorically, succession planning for the CEOs has come from strategy, finance and operations, where a typical RN career path has been to obtain a clinical master\u2019s degree and achieve a CNO [chief nursing officer], quality or safety role.\u201d\n\nSo how do hospitals boost more gender balance at the highest levels of leadership? More spreadsheets. More MBAs. \u201cRNs will close the gap by choosing to advance their careers into the business world through an MBA and seeking opportunities outside the clinical arena,\u201d says Frei, who did exactly that in her career. Dignity\u2019s Harting did the same thing. \u201cI went back and got my MBA for more of a grounding on the financials; you have to be able to sit across the table from a CFO and speak the lingo,\u201d she says.\n\nSacramento is bucking the trend. \u201cWhen you look at Sacramento today, all four health systems are led by women. How exciting is that?\u201d Harting says, laughing. \u201cI definitely see that in the past four or five years, there\u2019s a trend in people being more open to women succeeding in CEO positions.\u201d\n\nThis newfound diversity is driven, in part, by a citywide focus on mentorship. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to find someone that supports you, that mentors you, that provides you with that backup,\u201d Harting says. \u201cI\u2019ve been part of a mentoring program for many years, working with women within our own organization who have goals of becoming CEO. It\u2019s very rewarding on both sides. We owe it to the young women coming up.\u201d All the hospitals are involved in some way or another. Rodriguez, of Kaiser, participates in Mentoring Mondays with the Sacramento Business Journal. At UC Davis, more formal mentorship occurs through a national fellowship program for hospital leadership training. \u201cI\u2019m seeing more and more young, energetic and highly intelligent women seeking executive-track careers in health care administration,\u201d Rice, of UC Davis, says. \u201cSo the future does look bright.\u201d\n\nAs an academic institution, UC Davis has another tool to boost gender opportunity: the curriculum itself. In 2000, the school launched a program for faculty called Women in Medicine and Health Sciences, which Rice says was \u201cspecifically created to help ensure full participation and success for women in all roles within academic medicine.\u201d The program can help pivot more women toward an executive track.\n\n\u201cDiversity is such an important part of our mission,\u201d Rodriquez says. \u201cAs an organization that appreciates and respects diversity, we should be role models. We represent the community we take care of. This is who we are.\u201d\n\nNew Changes, New Focus\n\nWhen it comes to overall changes in the hospitals, the elephant in the room, of course, is the Affordable Care Act. Its impact is hard to overstate; the very nature of how hospitals are compensated is changing. \u201cThe ACA has really forced health care systems to stop doing things the way we\u2019ve always done them,\u201d Harting says. \u201cWe know the future world is going to be very different with respect to revenue.\u201d The ACA nudges hospitals away from a fee for service and toward a value-based service, which, as Harting says, brings extra incentive to \u201ckeep people healthy and keep people out of the hospital. It makes us pause to think about how we deliver care.\u201d Methods include rewarding doctors who work together and recommend preventative health services, as well as lower hospital reimbursement for preventable readmissions.\n\nTranslation: Hospitals will soon be paid based not on how many hours you\u2019re in their bed, but on your overall health. This (in theory) is a win for consumers, and it\u2019s forcing hospitals to adapt. \u201cWe focus on prevention. With our model of an integrated health system, I would say that we\u2019re very well-positioned for the ACA,\u201d Rodriguez says. She then gives me a more concrete example. \u201cIf I say to you, \u2018Jeff, you\u2019ve got to focus on your weight to make sure you don\u2019t get high blood-pressure and diabetes,\u2019 that, in the long run, is going to create affordability. That\u2019s what the ACA is all about: prevention. Having discussions about health, as opposed to just the disease.\u201d\n\nWith the ACA, health insurance is accessible for more people. The share of uninsured Americans has plunged from 17.4 percent in 2011 to 11.4 percent in 2015, according to Gallup. More people are going to the hospital, and that increase in patients can mean hospitals have new headaches. \u201cWith the expansion of health care coverage \u2014 as well as with an increasing population \u2014 capacity constraint is now one of our biggest challenges,\u201d Rice says. \u201cWe have 619 patient beds in our hospital, and we only have so many outpatient clinics in the community.\u201d So they\u2019re building. UC Davis is constructing a new 144-acre Sacramento campus, a $1.4 billion investment in the next decade. According to Rice, the medical center has $200 million in construction and demolition plans earmarked for razing old buildings, upgrading current facilities and building new ones over the next few years.\n\nBut what the ACA giveth, the ACA taketh away. Much of the gains in enrollment come from an expansion in Medicaid, which presents a challenge for providers as the number of patients is soaring, but revenue isn\u2019t keeping pace. This demands a tighter focus on costs. \u201cWe need to be more streamlined. If a patient comes into the hospital, maybe instead of staying for three to five days, now many of these procedures are going to be done in an outpatient center,\u201d Harting says. This means more digitization of patient records, more sharing across networks, more cross-training of employees.\n\nThis same dynamic is seen at Sutter. \u201cMore services will continue to shift from hospital-based to home-based,\u201d Frei says of Sutter\u2019s evolving policies. \u201cPatients and caregivers will need tools they can access at home to ensure that they stay on track. The term \u2018health care\u2019 may eventually be replaced with just \u2018health,\u2019 as we support communities in reducing the burden of illness.\u201d\n\nThis has a domino effect across the entire industry. As Rodriguez says, it forces the hospitals to be \u201cvery consumer-centric, very focused on meeting the needs of our patients where they want to be met.\u201d What does that mean, exactly? We all know where millennials want to be met: their smartphones. If you can video-conference someone in Beijing on your iPhone, why not get lab results from across town? Your doctor has a phone. Why can\u2019t you just text her with questions? The hospitals know patients want these features, and they\u2019re working to provide them. \u201cOur focus is aimed around technology,\u201d Harting says. \u201cThe younger consumers are on their smartphones, and they expect to get their health care just as they get their banking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018health care\u2019 may eventually be replaced with just \u2018health,\u2019 as we support communities in reducing the burden of illness.\u201d Theresa Frei, CEO, Sutter Medical Foundation.\n\nSutter has the same mindset. And UC Davis is now testing wearable and implantable devices that Rice says \u201ccan help us address the needs of patients more readily and effectively.\u201d A bluetooth-enabled glucometer for diabetic patients, for example, can automatically zap the readings into the patient\u2019s electronic medical record, providing easier access to data. They\u2019re beta-testing these gizmos \u2014 along with sleep and fitness trackers \u2014 in partnership with their Center for Health and Technology.\n\nAnother job that suddenly becomes more necessary: marketing. The business of health care is, after all, still a business. \u201cSince we\u2019re accepting less revenue per patient, in order to continue to expand our services, we have to grow,\u201d Harting says. \u201cThat\u2019s why Dignity has done a lot more marketing and branding.\u201d Its Hello Humankindness campaign emphasizes warm, feel-good imagery (think parents hugging children, lots of smiling faces) and stories like \u201c7 Profound Ways Love Can Make You Happier.\u201d \u201cWe did a survey finding that the average consumer really didn\u2019t know a lot about Dignity,\u201d she says. \u201cNow people recognize the brand and the commercials.\u201d\n\nOn top of the challenges that all hospitals now face, UC Davis has yet one more ball to juggle: the academic component. \u201cThere\u2019s a declining reimbursement for teaching hospitals,\u201d Rice says, referring to potential cuts in state and federal funding, \u201cwhich directly impacts the ability to sustain an academic health system mission of delivering great patient care, conducting high level research, educating the next generation of clinicians and engaging with the community.\u201d\n\nRodriguez has a very simple habit that keeps her grounded. \u201cI just walk up to units in the hospitals and talk to people. I go to patients\u2019 rooms and ask them, \u2018Tell me about your care? How are we doing?\u2019 Or I\u2019ll walk up to staff members and say, \u2018How are you doing today? Are we giving everything you need to do your job?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the basics still matter. \u201cWe have to continue to be focused on the high quality care,\u201d Rodriguez says. Harting agrees that when all the dust settles, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the patients. When I go to sleep at night, I think about all my priorities, and I think about what\u2019s going to help the patients.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Comstock's magazine", "description": "What the leaders of Sacramento\u2019s health care system have to say about care quality and gender equality", "title": "In Safe Hands - Comstock's magazine", "url": "http://www.comstocksmag.com/article/safe-hands", "image": "http://www.comstocksmag.com/sites/main/files/imagecache/medium/main-images/0416_feat_healthcare_dr_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "umVpM1cBr-I5rMMhPezFzbIn0D4VT8Q78uD5_x_ctvQ", "msvalidate.01": "62E808F8EECF5694F9DD5332F07E0E03", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe ACA has really forced health care systems to stop doing things the way we\u2019ve always done them,\u201d Harting says.\nHealth care is the backbone of Sacramento\u2019s economy.\nThe business of health care is, after all, still a business.\nA 2012 study from Rock Health (a health startup incubator) showed that women made up 73 percent of all managers in health care, but only 4 percent of CEOs.\nThe term \u2018health care\u2019 may eventually be replaced with just \u2018health,\u2019 as we support communities in reducing the burden of illness.\u201dThis has a domino effect across the entire industry."}
