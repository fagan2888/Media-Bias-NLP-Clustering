Randy Weber (R-TX) criticized President Obama for not being enough like Hitler.\n\nA Texas congressman was pilloried on Tuesday for posting a tweet that used the terror attack in Paris as an excuse to compare President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler. Republican Randy Weber's official account, @TXRandy14, tweeted on Monday night: \"Even Adolph Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris. (For all the wrong reasons.) Obama couldn't do it for right reasons\" [...] Weber has a history of inflammatory remarks, and misspellings, on Twitter.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nBen Carson argued that ISIS is just like the Founding Fathers. (For all the wrong reasons.)\n\n\"A bunch of rag tag militiamen defeated the most powerful and professional military force on the planet. Why? Because they believed in what they were doing. They were willing to die for what they believed in,\" Carson said during a speech at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting. \"Fast forward to today. What do we have? You've got ISIS. They've got the wrong philosophy, but they're willing to die for it while we are busily giving away every belief and every value for the sake of political correctness. We have to change that.\" Carson preemptively criticized journalists for twisting those words to make him sound nutty. \"Now I recognize that there's press here and some of the press will say, 'Carson said that ISIS is the same as the United States,'\" he said. \"They are just so ridiculous, so ridiculous.\"\n\nAnd then...\n\nHe tried to convince the audience that he isn't crazy.\n\nSpeaking to the Republican National Committee's winter meeting, Carson tried to challenge the caricature of him as a right-wing zealot by addressing\u2014one by one\u2014many of the individual controversies that have surrounded him, and dismissing them as lies from \"the liberal media.\" Carson defended, among other things, his statements about Obamacare being the worst thing since slavery; comparing present-day America to Nazi Germany; and calling last year's Veterans Affairs scandal \"a gift from God\" because it revealed holes in the system. \"I stand by those\" remarks, Carson told the crowd. \"I don't think there's anything crazy at all.\"\n\nEPIC FAIL.\n\n- Trix\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "It's been said that the definition ...", "title": "Sunday Talk: Please proceed, Governor", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/1/17/1358253/-Sunday-Talk-Please-proceed-Governor", "image": "http://assets.dailykos.com/assets/fb_default-83551080ce5aec223661e373eaf232ea.png", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "It's been said that the definition of insanity is \"doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results\"\u2014and if that's the case, then Mitt Romney probably belongs in&nbsp;the n...", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary", "title": "Sunday Talk: Please proceed, Governor"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6a1\"", "article_summary": "Mike Huckabee (R); Roundtable : Republican Strategist Matthew Dowd, Alicia Menendez (Fusion), Former Michigan Gov.\nThey were willing to die for what they believed in,\" Carson said during a speech at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting.\nRepublican Randy Weber's official account, @TXRandy14, tweeted on Monday night: \"Even Adolph Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris.\nObama couldn't do it for right reasons\" [...] Weber has a history of inflammatory remarks, and misspellings, on Twitter.\nMike Huckabee (R); Tuesday : Actress/Singer Jennifer Lopez; Wednesday : Actress Anne Hathaway; Thursday : Actress Jennifer AnistonElsewhere...Rep.
