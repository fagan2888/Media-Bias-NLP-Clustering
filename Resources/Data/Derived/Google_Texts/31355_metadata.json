Some are good, some are just OK, and some are truly outstanding. The best of the best belong to the National Association of Independent Schools and include some of the country\u2019s most storied prep schools. Costs vary by State and quality of school. Tuition alone can cost as little as $2,500 in North Dakota, or as much as $45,000 in New York City. The cost of non-religious private school now tops $13,000 per year, and it has more than doubled in the past 20 years\n\nThe average cost of daycare is even higher, and the price for college can be twice that. A mid-range option for child-care, private school, and public college could easily run a family more than $230,000 in 23 years. That\u2019s the price of a second home you weren\u2019t able to buy; the cost of family vacations you didn\u2019t take; the amount you didn\u2019t contribute to retirement. The families for whom $230,000 for education is manageable are increasingly rare.\n\nStill, people choose private school for a variety of reasons, especially if their local public school is subpar. If your children demonstrate a need for private education\u2013 perhaps because of a learning delay or behavior issue or because they are gifted, you may opt to pay up now and change your expectations about college, she said.\n\nRelated: 6 Ways to Boost Financial Aid for College\n\nCheaper higher-Ed options include some of the smaller public schools and lesser-known private colleges. Non-name-brand schools may offer more scholarship money and financial aid than higher profile schools that don't need to compete for students.\n\nIn addition to recalibrating college expectations, selecting private school may mean a shift in a family\u2019s lifestyle. \u201cFor people who would like to send their children to private school but are on the borderline \u2013 maybe one parent works part-time, maybe they don\u2019t have the highest earning jobs \u2013 it becomes a question of thinking about all the things you\u2019d like to do, then prioritizing,\u201d says. Thomas Fisher, a financial planner and investment advisor at Fisher Financial Strategies in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nFisher recommends that families who want private school visit a financial planner soon after their birth of their child to make a plan. We can say this is what your spending looks like for the first eight years of the child\u2019s life and then have a better idea what is possible at future stages,\u201d he said.\n\nIn some areas, like Cambridge, parents could be looking at $30,000 a year in child-care. When the child is school age the cash flow might open up if the family opts for public school, Fisher said. Then they can get down to the business of saving for college. \u201cBut if you are going to put what you were paying for child care toward private school, you need a lot of capacity to do that and save for college at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\nParents need to protect themselves, too. \u201cI warn people against neglecting saving for their own retirement because they want to do all these things for their kids,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cYou have to remind people how all the pieces fit together.\u201d\n\nRelated: Average Family Has Saved Enough to Send One Kid to College for Half a Year\n\nHere are five ways to cover the cost of private school:\n\n1. Relocate\n\nFamilies might consider moving to an area with a strong public school so that they do not have to pay for a K-12 education and can instead save for college. Alternatively, families that are committed to a private education may move to a less expensive home (or an area with lower property taxes) to free up more money for the education.\n\n2. Shop Around\n\nThere are more than 30,000 private schools in America (comprising 24 percent of all U.S. schools), according to the Council for American Private Education, and their costs varies widely. Religious schools tend to cost less than secular private schools.\n\n3. Earn More\n\nThose who find that the end goal is so valuable that they would change their work situation to better afford it might consider ways to increase the family\u2019s earnings. For example, a spouse who isn\u2019t working or is working part-time could shift to full-time employment.\n\n4. Get Help from Family\n\nOccasionally a student\u2019s grandparents are willing to help in some way. Even if they don\u2019t pay for private school, the grandparents might agree to help with college, alleviating that stress for the parents. Sometimes grandparents who want to reduce the size of their estate will opt to give specific gifts devoted to the cost of education.\n\n5. Apply for Financial Aid\n\nMany private K-12 schools offer financial aid. If you are in a financial category that makes sending your child to private school a stretch, Fisher recommends applying for aid. If aid is offered but is not enough, he suggest with administrators to see if there is a way to bridge the gap between the cost, the aid offered and your ability to pay. Nearly a quarter of private school students get some form of financial aid, according to the National Association of Independent Schools.\n\n\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A private education can make saving for college problematic.
