The good news, study co-author Frances Griffiths said, is researchers have found that a healthy mood shared among friends can significantly improve depression. Encouraging these friendships could possibly be a method of treatment.\n\nGriffiths, who is the head of social science and systems in health at Warwick\u2019s Medical School, used data from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health to look at more than 2,000 adolescents going to various high schools in the United States. He and a team of researchers looked to see how certain moods spread among students using a model that\u2019s used to track infectious diseases. Interestingly, this model can also be used to track patterns of gang violence.\n\nWhat the team saw was depression is not contagious, but happiness for sure is. Having enough happy friends cut the probability of developing depression in half among teens who had five \u201cmentally healthy\u201d friends or more. More impressive than that was the fact that a happy social network doubled the probability of recovering from depression over a six- to 12-month period among teens with 10 or more healthy friends. These probabilities were compared to having less than three healthy friends.\n\n\"In the context of depression, this is a very large effect size,\u201d lead author Edward Hill said. \u201cOur results suggest that promotion of any friendship between adolescents can reduce depression since having depressed friends does not put them at risk, but having healthy friends is both protective and curative.\u201d Essentially, this study further fuels the idea that strong social support is vital to wellbeing.\n\nIn a separate study from the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, researchers found that the stronger patients' social relationships were \u2014 which meant frequently keeping in contact with social ties and participating in social groups \u2014 the less likely they were to commit suicide. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide.\n\n\"As a society,\u201d researchers concluded, \u201cif we enable friendships to develop among adolescents (for example, providing youth clubs) each adolescent is more likely to have enough friends with healthy mood to have a protective effect. This would reduce the prevalence of depression.\"\n\nSource: Hill EM, Griffiths FE, House T. Spreading of healthy mood in adolescent social networks.
