It was completely paid for by the federal government. However, lawmakers put a 2017 sunset clause on it \u2013 because the state would then be required to start picking up some of the tab. The state has contracted with Sanford Health Insurance to run that program. More than 20,000 North Dakotans are covered under this program.\n\n\"The state becomes 10 percent responsible in 2017,\" said Rep. George Keiser (R-Bismarck), chairman of the Interim Health Care Reform Review Committee. \"That will be a significant amount of money.\"\n\nKeiser chairs the interim Health Care Reform Review Committee. He says with the state\u2019s budget constraints, everything is on the table.\n\n\"I clearly recognize it's unlikely we will continue the current contractual arrangement,\" Keiser said. \"There will either be modifications, or a change in direction.\"\n\nKeiser says the options would include making changes to that contract \u2013 and that means changes to the reimbursement hospitals and doctors receive \u2013 or having the state Human Services Department take it over.\n\n\"Some states, Tennessee, Arkansas, have looked at innovative approaches,\" Keiser said. \"They're going out with such things as voucher programs to the (insurance) exchanges.\"\n\nState Human Services director Mggie Anderson says as her department is working on its budget proposal, she plans to continue the Medicaid expansion program as is.\n\n\"It's the 20,000 people covered under the program,\" Anderson said. \"They currently wouldn't have access to the advanced premium tax credits through the marketplace, if we would end Medicaid expansion.\"", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Government", "description": "The chairman of an interim Legislative committee studying health care says he\u2019s not sure the state will continue Medicaid expansion \u2013 at least in its", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.prairiepublic.org/post/nd-lawmakers-re-open-debate-medicaid-expansion", "type": "article", "description": "The chairman of an interim Legislative committee studying health care says he\u2019s not sure the state will continue Medicaid expansion \u2013 at least in its", "title": "ND Lawmakers to re-open debate on Medicaid expansion"}, "story_id": 479147137, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "author": "Dave Thompson", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "ND Lawmakers to re-open debate on Medicaid expansion"}, "nid": 68208, "datePublished": "2016-05-23", "keywords": "Medicaid", "wordCount": 309, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\"They currently wouldn't have access to the advanced premium tax credits through the marketplace, if we would end Medicaid expansion.\"\nIn 2013, the state Legislature passed Medicaid expansion \u2013 to help lower income North Dakotans receive health care through the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\nThe chairman of an interim Legislative committee studying health care says he\u2019s not sure the state will continue Medicaid expansion \u2013 at least in its current form.\nState Human Services director Mggie Anderson says as her department is working on its budget proposal, she plans to continue the Medicaid expansion program as is.\n\"The state becomes 10 percent responsible in 2017,\" said Rep.
