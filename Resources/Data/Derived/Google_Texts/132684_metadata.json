This can be particularly helpful if the small business is relatively new or doesn\u2019t have an HR department.\n\nIt isn\u2019t as if health reimbursement accounts are new. These have traditionally been a valuable tool used by business owners to provide health insurance to their staff without taking on the administrative cost and burden of establishing their own policy.\n\nAccording to research, 14 percent of small business owners use this technique to provide coverage to their employees without having a company insurance offering.\n\nMany, however, are unaware of this new penalty that directly targets that behavior.\n\nEmployers who are found to be assisting employees with the cost of health care through supplemental income can be fined $100 a day per employee, up to $500,000 per year. The implementation on July 1 only occurred after the Treasury Dept. delayed enforcement of penalties of this new rule.\n\nThat delay expired on Wednesday, however, and businesses can now be charged for failure to comply.\n\nNew Penalty Higher than Other Fines\n\nThis number is actually quite shocking, considering the difference between this fine and the one imposed on employers who fail to offer group insurance altogether.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, employers are required to offer coverage, but if they fail to comply with the employer mandate they can only be fined up to $2,000 per year.\n\nThe stark difference between these penalties and the widespread use of HRAs has caused many to push for new legislation to overrule the new IRS policy.\n\nIf Congress repeals the IRS ruling, this problem could be solved. But in the meantime, small business owners offering to offset the cost of health insurance for their employees may face high fines.\n\nWhile this rule may not be long in effect, small business owners would be wise to keep their eye on this under-reported IRS rule, or consult with a trusted tax professional.\n\nIf the policy isn\u2019t repealed, these business owners could face staggering fines with the very real potential to cripple their company.\n\nExpand your knowledge with these five things you may not know about small business taxes, and payroll filings that will keep you compliant.\n\nHealth Insurance Form Photo via Shutterstock\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new IRS rule aims to fine a business that provides staff with more pay to cover insurance and that is reimbursing employees for health insurance.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Small Business Trends", "description": "A new IRS rule aims to fine a business that provides staff with more pay to cover insurance and that is reimbursing employees for health insurance.", "title": "New Tax Penalty Targets Health Reimbursement Accounts", "url": "http://smallbiztrends.com/2015/07/tax-penalty-reimbursing-employees-for-health-insurance.html", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/health-insurance-form.jpg", "height": 560}, "updated_time": "2015-07-13T09:30:58-04:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Recently, a new IRS rule was rolled out that could have staggering effects for many small business owners.
