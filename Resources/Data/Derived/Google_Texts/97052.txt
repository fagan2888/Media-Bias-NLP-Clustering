Saturday morning, hundreds of community members came out to support the "March Of Dimes" Foundation.

The walk began at the Bay County Court House, and continued around surrounding neighborhoods.

Sponsor signs were placed throughout the area, as well as posters in memory of those families who lost a child due to premature complications.

Donations from the event will go to local mothers, to help them with safe and a healthly pregnancy.

The March Of Dimes walk began in 1970, and has raised $2.3 billion to benefit all babies.

"Its something I do every year," said volunteer, James Bailey. "I've been doing this for 26 years now and I'm one of the fortunate ones, my child was born healthy but she's my inspiration to ensure all babies are born healthy."

Saturday was also a reunion for children who were born premature or sick at the Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center, to meet one another and walk for a cause they overcame.
