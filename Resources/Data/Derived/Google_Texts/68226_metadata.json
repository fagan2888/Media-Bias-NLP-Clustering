And even if asked, he would absolutely, 100 percent refuse. I know, I know, the chances of any of that actually happening are zilch to zip, but Carson just wanted to make it clear on Hugh Hewitt\u2018s show today that even if Obama asked him to step in to deal with this current Ebola crisis, he would refuse.\n\nHewitt asked Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, if he would serve in that position under Obama. Carson said, \u201cNo, because I would, if I were going to serve in that position, I would have to serve under someone that I trusted.\u201d\n\nAnd even with Hewitt saying Obama would hypothetically be telling him he wouldn\u2019t interfere in any way, and he just needs someone to make sure the country is \u201ccalm and appropriately prepared,\u201d Carson insisted he would still refuse. He suspected that there are plenty of government officials who are speaking on behalf of the White House and can\u2019t exactly speak their minds right now, because if they did, the country might hear something altogether different.\n\nListen to the audio below, via The Hugh Hewitt Show:\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "In case you were wondering, Dr. Ben Carson won't be President Obama's Surgeon General.
