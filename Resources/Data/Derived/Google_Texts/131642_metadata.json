Before switching to UltiPro in 2013, Mid-Atlantic was using multiple payroll providers that lacked integrated HR capabilities. As the company expanded by adding new facilities, the HR and payroll teams found that importing new employees was challenging, and managing numerous systems was becoming more cumbersome. Company executives selected UltiPro to make growth more manageable and improve its people-centric operations with a single solution.\n\n\u201cAs we grew, we needed a solution to evolve with us, and that choice was clear with UltiPro,\u201d said Traci Alley, corporate human resources director at Mid-Atlantic Health Care. \u201cWe now have more than 3,700 employees, and UltiPro\u2019s business intelligence has given us access to info-rich data we previously tried to compile manually or may not have been able to gather at all. With real-time reports, we are able to better manage turnover and retention throughout our growing workforce, gaining a clear view as to which positions experience steady turnover and what factors contribute to those trends. Our HR team has been empowered with actionable information, enabling us to rethink and change our orientation process and create ongoing preceptorships with experienced medical practitioners for those positions. UltiPro has helped us have a more stable and engaged workforce.\u201d\n\nAs UltiPro\u2019s robust reporting has given Mid-Atlantic Health Care greater visibility into employee turnover and increased workforce retention, the solution\u2019s real-time analytics has given the company needed reporting capabilities to help it better manage changing healthcare requirements.\n\n\u201cIn terms of compliance with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), UltiPro has given us the ability to track and automatically analyze employee hours of service in order to determine eligibility status,\u201d said Alley. \u201cThis is especially important in the healthcare industry, where we have a large number of per diem employees working long hours. UltiPro helps us to proactively monitor eligibility and compliance in one central dashboard. As a result, UltiPro has provided our managers, HR teams, and executives with peace of mind that we can be fully compliant with the new healthcare legislation.\u201d\n\nEqually important to the healthcare industry is the tracking and monitoring of employee certifications to ensure that all licenses remain current. With UltiPro as its comprehensive HCM solution that houses all employee-centric information, Mid-Atlantic Health Care is able to generate timely reports and instantly notify managers if employees need to update or renew any licenses before they expire.\n\n\u201cWith a large workforce spanning 18 locations, we previously spent a great deal of time manually inputting, updating, and tracking employee certification for nursing, CPR, and CNA licenses,\u201d said Alley. \u201cThis placed a huge strain on our administrative resources. With UltiPro, we have automated our process for medical certification monitoring, resulting in tremendous time savings and ensuring greater visibility and accountability. As our company continues to expand, having these kinds of business benefits will only become more important to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltiPro\u2019s HCM technology is designed to simplify and enhance people\u2019s work lives, and, as a result, our customers achieve higher levels of productivity, effectiveness, and engagement among their workforce,\u201d said Greg Swick, chief sales officer at Ultimate Software. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased that UltiPro is delivering relevant, real-time reporting to Mid-Atlantic Health Care and advancing its overall business.\u201d\n\nAbout Ultimate Software\n\nUltimate is a leading provider of cloud-based human capital management (HCM) solutions, with more than 20 million people records in the cloud.
