UnitedHealthcare will not offer insurance plans in Tennessee on the federally run exchange in 2017.

The company notified the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance of its plans in a letter dated April 15. The insurer announced today on an earnings call that it will only offer plans on a handful of exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act.

UnitedHealthcare, which debuted on the exchange in Tennessee in 2016, enrolled 40,879 people, or about 15.5 percent of all the lives covered under plans on the exchange, according to the TDCI.

Commissioner Julie Mix McPeak said the agency is "disappointed" about how the decision will impact insurance shoppers -- but understands why the company is making the decision.

“However, we understand that the company’s decision to withdraw is a business decision. The decision seems more national in scope than Tennessee-specific as the company has less than four months’ experience with Tennessee’s exchange marketplace," said McPeak in a statement. "Thankfully, we have companies with strong ties to Tennessee still offering products across the state, both on the marketplace and off.”

The decision to leave the exchange does not impact existing coverage or employer-sponsored plans or Medicaid and Medicare products.

People with insurance bought on the exchange will be covered through Dec. 31.
