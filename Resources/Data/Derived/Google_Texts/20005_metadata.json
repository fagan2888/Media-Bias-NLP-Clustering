Hourly pay will eventually rise to $14.75 inside Portland\u2019s urban growth boundary, $13.50 in midsize counties and $12.50 in rural areas by 2022.\n\nThe Oregonian says student work hours are also likely to be cut, much as colleges did following the implementation of Obamacare to avoid having to cover student workers\u2019 insurance:\n\nOfficials will likely turn to another frequent source of revenue to make up the difference: tuition dollars. At the University of Oregon, where the Board of Trustees just voted to raise tuition by 4.8 percent for in-state students in the fall, the new wage will cost an extra $432,779 to implement during the 2017 fiscal year alone [and $6.1 million by the 2021-23 biennium].\n\nOther schools aren\u2019t sure how many jobs they\u2019ll need to shed but they already have estimates of the extra costs: $2.5 million more in the next biennium for Portland State University, $450,000 for Western Oregon, $299,272 for Southern Oregon and $162,907 for Eastern Oregon.\n\nRead the story.\n\nh/t George Leef\n\nRELATED: More than 200 colleges slash work hours to avoid Obamacare employer mandate\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\nIMAGE: Shutterstock", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "Want to know why your tuition is spiking, young Oregonians?", "title": "Oregon's hiked minimum wage will lead to massive job losses for student workers - The College Fix", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 580, "identifier": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/flushingmoney.Shutterstock.jpg", "height": 380}, "updated_time": "2016-04-21T02:34:07-04:00", "url": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/26598/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/flushingmoney.Shutterstock.jpg", "description": "Want to know why your tuition is spiking, young Oregonians?", "card": "summary", "title": "Oregon's hiked minimum wage will lead to massive job losses for student workers - The College Fix"}, "fb": {"admins": "672627547,1540010264,100009162449428", "app_id": 1559699120988871}, "article": {"section": "Buzz", "tag": "University of Oregon", "published_time": "2016-03-11T17:44:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T02:34:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Here\u2019s the new wage structure:The first step of Oregon\u2019s new wage law goes into effect in July, when the minimum wage will increase 50 cents, to $9.75 an hour.\n\u2026 OSU has more than 7,800 student positions, and more than half of them pay less than what will become the new minimum in July.\nOregon lawmakers evaded economic reality when they passed a minimum-wage hike that the state\u2019s public universities can\u2019t afford to pay.\nAssuming \u201cmore than half\u201d is 4,000, OSU would cut about 1 in every 6 minimum-wage jobs.\nh/t George LeefRELATED: More than 200 colleges slash work hours to avoid Obamacare employer mandateLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on TwitterIMAGE: Shutterstock"}
