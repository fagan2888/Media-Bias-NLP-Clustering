Overall, a total of 44 states still have the option to sentence people to life in prison for crimes they committed as children.\n\nThese excessively heavy prison terms are also a complicated factor in a racially disparate judicial system; according to the Burns Institute for Juvenile Justice Fairness and Equity, a disproportionate amount of black, Native American, and Hispanic youth face higher chances of incarceration as white youth.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nJosh Rovner, who authored the SP report, notes national data showing that black minors are five times more likely than white minors to be arrested for curfew violations \u2014 a statistic that does not accurately reflect rates of crimes being committed across those same racial lines.\n\n\u201cThe data we have and our own experience shows that teenagers are not behaving any differently,\u201d Rovner said. \u201cIt\u2019s arrest rates that are different.\u201d\n\nThe precedent set by the Supreme Court in 2012 was meant to enact sweeping changes in sentencing processes. Citing the \u201cprinciple of proportionality,\u201d the decision stated that mandatory life sentences without parole for defendants under the age of 18 violate the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. It built on a previous ruling that struck down life sentences for non-homicide offenses and required juries to give consideration to mitigating factors such as mental development and potential for rehabilitation.\n\nYet more than half of the states that allow mandatory life sentences for minors have made no effort to repeal their laws, while several of those that complied with the ruling simply reduced the required minimums to several decades. Still others technically abide by the ruling by allowing life without parole as an option rather than as a mandate.\n\n\u201cTo sentence young people into their elderly years amounts to a determination that some offenders lack the capacity to change, which violates the spirit, if not the letter, of both Supreme Court rulings,\u201d the SP report says.\n\nA University of Texas study found that juveniles waiting to be tried as adults are often held in county jails, where they are denied access to services and programming that they may be legally required to receive.\n\nHow did this happen? In the last 20 years, the rates of trying juveniles in adult court have increased significantly. According to Dr. Ashley Nellis, senior research analyst at the Sentencing Project, this was caused in part by the upswing in crime during the late 1980s and early 1990s and compounded by media and policy-makers\u2019 claims that future generations would breed \u201cseverely morally impoverished juvenile superpredators.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t. Homicide arrest rates declined 74 percent by 2008. But by then, tough-on-crime policies had grown in popularity, with lawmakers creating legislation that stopped analyzing developmental differences between children and adults and instead focused exclusively on the nature of a crime.\n\nThese kinds of tough-on-crime policies \u201cignore the possibility that there are juveniles who can be rehabilitated,\u201d Rovner told Common Dreams.\n\nMitigating factors that can contribute significantly to rates of juveniles committing \u201cadult\u201d crimes can include exposure to community violence and having family members in prison.\n\nWhile it\u2019s certain that the punishment does not fit the crime, the trend also shows a connection between arrest rates and racial discrimination in the justice system. Nationwide, the estimated rate at which black youth receive life without parole sentences (6.6 per 10,000) is ten times greater than the rate for white youth (0.6 per 10,000).\n\nDiscrepancies in the juvenile justice system \u201c[do] not stop with arrests,\u201d Rovner said. Black youths are \u201cmuch more likely to be detained, and much more likely to be sent to adult facilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe disparities continue to grow with each step of the process,\u201d Rovner said.\n\nThere has been some improvement along the way, Rovner said. A few states have proactively sought to end life without parole sentences for juvenile offenders; California and West Virginia now allow parole reviews after 15 years, while Utah allows it after 25.\n\nThe United States is the only country in the world that sentences children to life without parole.\n\n_____________________\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.\n\nThis article was published by Common Dreams.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Black youth most often receive longer terms.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Nadia Prupis | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Black youth most often receive longer terms.", "title": "Many Juveniles Still Illegally Sentenced to Life Without Parole", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/many-juveniles-still-illegally-sentenced-life-without-parole/193186/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AP100520046317.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-27T15:19:56-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Black youth most often receive longer terms.", "title": "Many Juveniles Still Illegally Sentenced to Life Without Parole", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AP100520046317.jpg", "creator": "@nadiaprupis", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Prison", "published_time": "2014-06-28T05:00:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-27T15:19:56-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd250d\"", "article_summary": "Many Juveniles Still Illegally Sentenced to Life Without ParoleBlack youth most often receive longer terms.\nStill others technically abide by the ruling by allowing life without parole as an option rather than as a mandate.\nThe United States is the only country in the world that sentences children to life without parole.\nA few states have proactively sought to end life without parole sentences for juvenile offenders; California and West Virginia now allow parole reviews after 15 years, while Utah allows it after 25.\nCiting the \u201cprinciple of proportionality,\u201d the decision stated that mandatory life sentences without parole for defendants under the age of 18 violate the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment."}
