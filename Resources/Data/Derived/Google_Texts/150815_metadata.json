Getty Images\n\nOakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane is like the electric car: undoubtedly innovative, and unlikely to ever dominate thanks to the system that\u2019s already in place. When Beane was coming up with clever, sabermetric-guided ways to shape his roster, teams with more money simply replicated what he was doing on a bigger scale, and reaped the rewards.\n\nWell, those times are over, and Beane is no longer some guy you associate with Brad Pitt in \u201cMoneyball\u201d but a risk taker going all in on his hopes of a World Series. Before the trade deadline passed on Thursday, Beane made what\u2019s being considered a true blockbuster deal by acquiring Boston Red Sox pitcher Jon Lester in exchange for strong-armed outfielder Yoenis Cespedes, who made the All-Star team and has won the Home Run Derby two years running. Lester is only under contract until the end of the season, and could absolutely leave once it turns out that small market Oakland isn\u2019t ready to pay for his services; meanwhile, Cespedes is young, on a reasonable contract, and is a Sportscenter highlight machine. But it was pointedly assertive, bolstering what now clearly seems like the best pitching staff in the league. \u201cThis was a gutsy and creative move by A\u2019s general manager Billy Beane,\u201d writes Sports on Earth\u2019s Wendy Thurm. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that a first-place team trades a middle-of-the-order power threat to strengthen a rotation.\u201d\n\nIf it were that simple, we\u2019d be penciling in the A\u2019s World Series champs. They\u2019ve won just one series under Beane, however, and have yet to prove that his longform approach to the season can be effective over seven games. (As Beane once famously said, \u201cMy s\u2014 doesn\u2019t work in the playoffs.\u201d) But Beane was immediately challenged by the Detroit Tigers, who completed their own blockbuster trace for Tampa Bay Rays ace David Price, and even found the time to wag their tail about it. Now, the Tigers have the last three Cy Young winners\u2014a fact despite Justin Verlander\u2019s struggles this season\u2014and could look to once again outduel the A\u2019s in the fall. (It was Detroit that swept Oakland out of the playoffs in the 2006 American League Championship Series, after that sole series win.)\n\nIt was a challenging move for the Rays, who adhered to their organizational strategy of carefully grooming a player over the years only to rip him up by his roots. \u201cI\u2019m not a touchy-feely mind reader, but dealing Price certainly seems like the kind of move that will not only hurt the Rays\u2019 roster and playoff chances in the short term, but also risk damaging the psyches of Rays fans and Price\u2019s former teammates,\u201d Jonah Keri writes for Grantland. \u201cThis is the razor\u2019s edge on which the tiny-revenue Rays must continually operate, trading away star player after star player while assembling younger and younger talent in the hopes of finding the right window for a playoff run.\u201d\n\nBut it also gave us a better rivalry between two elite teams, and a chance for one of baseball\u2019s long celebrated savants to finally win it all. \u201cWant to second guess him? Hey, have at it. He simply does not care what you or I think,\u201d writes Richard Justice for MLB.com. \u201cBeane has been doing this long enough that he trusts his instincts. He\u2019s fearless in that way.\u201d People started driving hybrids, didn\u2019t they?\n\n* * *\n\nBless the athlete who insists he can still play, because even if it wasn\u2019t his ego talking it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019d ever get a chance to prove himself right. There\u2019s no country for old players, ones who demanded too much money to stick around on teams with no responsibility to keep them employed\u2014which Johnny Damon, he of the long hair and ramshod playing style, is finding after two years out of Major League Baseball. Damon is most likely retired, but for a perennial man-child who reveled in the thrill of the show, accepting that is not so easy. At Sports on Earth, Pat Jordan catches up with Damon and shows how a man once celebrated as an idiot is, unsurprisingly, having a hard time figuring out the rest of his life.\n\n\u201cThe game has always been an escape from real life for ballplayers, which is why so many dread leaving the game. The game offers a kind of constant certitude; wins and losses are fathomable in a way that real life\u2019s problems aren\u2019t,\u201d he writes. \u201cReal life\u2019s problems aren\u2019t clearly defined and don\u2019t ever seem to get resolved. They linger, frustratingly. After baseball, nothing in real life will ever be as completely, simply and viscerally gratifying.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever met someone from New York City, you know that they love to talk about New York City, regardless of whether or not there\u2019s something worth talking about. That\u2019s why the city is celebrated as the Mecca of basketball, despite the fact that a truly great player hasn\u2019t come from the city in\u2026 decades, maybe. At Grantland, Jordan Ritter Conn explores the decline, delving into issues of geography and pride to figure out why some New York City residents would rather move to another state than rep their city, and why the myth endures.\n\n\u201cNew York is no longer the greatest basketball city on earth. Right now, it\u2019s not even close,\u201d he writes. \u201cWhen we talk about the decline of New York City basketball, we\u2019re not talking about the Knicks\u2019 interminable incompetence or the Nets\u2019 lavish and misguided efforts to build a contender. We\u2019re talking about the city\u2019s footprint in the NBA: Years ago, New York\u2019s playgrounds and high schools served as the most fertile breeding ground for the game\u2019s elite. Today, you\u2019re just as likely to become a star if you\u2019re born in Los Angeles, Toronto, or Raleigh.\u201d\n\nFound a good column from the world of sports?
