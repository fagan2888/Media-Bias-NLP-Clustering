(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nWith their candidate for governor down in the polls and their nominee for lieutenant governor widely considered a long shot, Virginia Republicans see Mark D. Obenshain as their best hope for blocking a Democratic sweep of statewide offices.\n\nObenshain, a state senator from Harrisonburg, is in a tight race for attorney general against state Sen. Mark R. Herring (D-Loudoun). And while his victory is by no means ensured, his chances look better than those of his ticketmates: Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II, who is running for governor; and E.W. Jackson, a Chesapeake minister running for lieutenant governor.\n\nThat view has solidified in recent days, so much so that a national Republican group pumped an astonishing $660,000 into his campaign, according to records released Friday by the nonprofit Virginia Public Access Project.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s clearly running ahead\u201d of other Republicans, said former congressman Thomas M. Davis, who is hosting a fundraiser for Obenshain at his Vienna home Wednesday. \u201cHe plays well with others. He\u2019s certainly conservative, but he\u2019s been a unifying force in the party. He\u2019s not been a polarizing figure.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have been cheered to see Obenshain attract support from some of the moderate members of the GOP who crossed party lines to endorse Democrat Terry McAuliffe over Cuccinelli. Dwight Schar, part-owner of the Washington Redskins and former national finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, wrote a big check to McAuliffe this year \u2014 and another to Obenshain.\n\nSchar serves on the host committee for the fundraiser at Davis\u2019s home. Former Republican senator John W. Warner, who, like Davis, hails from the party\u2019s moderate wing, is scheduled to attend.\n\nRepublicans have not given up hope on the rest of their ticket, particularly when it comes to Cuccinelli. All three Republicans can win, some say \u2014 particularly if turnout overall is low but Jackson\u2019s tea party fans turn out in droves.\n\n\u201cIf the base turns out, and it\u2019s only 30 or 35 percent [overall] turnout, maybe we\u2019re in a squeaker and Ken pulls it off,\u201d one Richmond Republican said on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nAnother noted that with polls showing Libertarian Robert Sarvis in the low double digits, the numbers could swing big on Election Day if those voters ultimately opt against the third-party candidate.\n\nBut everyone seems to feel better about the prospects for Obenshain, who has a family legacy, plenty of campaign cash and a positive message on his side.\n\nObenshain\u2019s campaign signs bear a slanty, stylized \u2018O,\u2019 the same one his father used in the U.S. Senate bid that ended with a plane crash in 1978 (and launched Warner\u2019s Senate career).\n\nIn gatherings with Republicans, Obenshain has joked that the \u201cO\u201d reminds some of the Democrat who took Virginia's presidential contest last year. No fan of President Obama or his health-care law, Obenshain tells Republican audiences that it\u2019s time to take back not only our country but our alphabet.\n\n(Obenshain also has a renowned sister, Kate Obenshain, a former chairwoman of the state GOP and occasional contributor on Fox News.)\n\n\u201cAre you ready to stop \u00adObamacare in its tracks?\u201d the candidate asked the convention crowd that endorsed him in May. He promises to protect gun rights and to stand up to federal \u201coverreach\u201d \u2014 stances with big appeal to the tea party but less to suburban swing voters.\n\nBut he has mostly pushed noncontroversial issues: promoting ethics reform and cracking down on sex offenders, human traffickers and abusers of the elderly. His broader message \u2014 conveyed in TV ads with his daughter behind the wheel as campaign driver \u2014 is upbeat and middle-of-the-road, said Virginia Tech political scientist Craig Leonard Brians.\n\n\u201cThat is an incredible ad,\u201d said Brians, referring to a spot with Tucker Obenshain saying her dad encouraged her independence. \u201cThis is an empowered girl. She might be 24 or something, but she can speak for the whole family. She doesn\u2019t need a guy to speak for her. And she\u2019s defending her dad.\u201d\n\nHerring\u2019s campaign would agree that the ad is incredible \u2014 in the sense that viewers should not believe what they see. They say Obenshain has soft-pedaled his record on abortion and other issues. Herring has tried to highlight Obenshain\u2019s support for \u00adanti-abortion measures, including sponsorship of a bill, which Obenshain later withdrew, that would have required women to report a miscarriage to police.\n\nHerring is fond of saying that Obenshain votes \u201clike E.W. Jackson talks.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy opponent, Sen. Mark Obenshain, would be a continuation of Cuccinelli\u2019s approach,\u201d Herring said in a Richmond Times-Dispatch guest column last week. \u201cHe himself has stated that he and Ken Cuccinelli are like \u2018two peas in a pod, philosophically\u2019 and that he would \u2018take the baton from Ken, build on his work, without missing a step.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBen Pershing contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans look to attorney general candidate to prevent Democratic sweep in Virginia statewide races.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Republicans look to attorney general candidate to prevent Democratic sweep in Virginia statewide races.", "title": "In Virginia, Mark Obenshain represents GOP\u2019s best shot at preventing a Democratic sweep in statewide races", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/attorney-general-candidate-mark-obenshain-carries-bulk-of-gops-hopes-in-virginia-races/2013/10/26/f653cb3c-3d1d-11e3-b7ba-503fb5822c3e_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/10/02/Others/Images/2013-10-02/021AGdebateA1380728410.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, obenshain, jackson, herring, attorney general's race virginia, va ag race, cuccinelli", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "f653cb3c-3d1d-11e3-b7ba-503fb5822c3e", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, obenshain, jackson, herring, attorney general's race virginia, va ag race, cuccinelli"}, "article_summary": "In gatherings with Republicans, Obenshain has joked that the \u201cO\u201d reminds some of the Democrat who took Virginia's presidential contest last year.\nObenshain, a state senator from Harrisonburg, is in a tight race for attorney general against state Sen.
