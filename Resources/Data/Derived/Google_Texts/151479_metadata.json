We don't see the gloom and doom and apocalyptic horror that Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI and their followers have foretold due to the advent of same-gender marriages.\n\nThe only truly sour note in this document was the suggestion that international bodies should not \u201cpressure\u201d pastors to accept \u201cgender ideology.\u201d\n\nThe influence that many international bodies are trying to exert is that of protecting the civil and human rights of LGBT people, so that their identities are not criminalized, and so that they don't suffer penalties and violence.\n\nIt's very disappointing that the synod authors did not make this distinction, and that the human rights of LGBT are not explicitly mentioned as worthy of defending. Defending LGBT human rights is a pro-family measure, very much in keeping with the synod\u2019s topic.\n\nAlthough this document does not go as far as I and many others would like, I think it is important to remember that doctrinal change in the church starts with a change in language and tone, which leads to a change in pastoral attitudes and practices, which eventually leads to doctrine.\n\nWhat is significant is that the terms of the discussion have now been changed, and that opens new possibilities for how Catholics, both those who are leaders and those in the pew, will think about lesbian and gay people and respond to their lives and concerns.\n\nPerhaps the most welcome statement, in terms of general approaches to marriage, family, and sexuality, is the admonition: \u201cThe indispensable biblical-theological study is to be accompanied by dialogue, at all levels.\u201d\n\nThis call to dialogue has been absent in church discussions of sexuality for way too long. It presents the hope that future changes that are even more welcoming and accepting of lesbian and gay people and their families can develop down the road.\n\nOnce church leaders engage in dialogue with lesbian and gay Catholics, I am confident that these leaders will see the deep faith, love, and witness to the gospel that is active in their lives and loves.\n\nOverall, this document presents a new and very hopeful direction for church leaders to approach lesbian and gay people and their families.\n\nI hope that local bishops and pastors will respond to these challenges with new ways of welcome and acceptance.\n\nFrancis DeBernardo is executive director of New Ways Ministry, a group that ministers to gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual Catholics.
