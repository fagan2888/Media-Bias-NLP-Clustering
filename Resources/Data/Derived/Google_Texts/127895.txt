RENO, NV - If you thought medical professionals did not make house calls anymore, think again. Larry Thompson just received a visit by a team of paramedics from REMSA’s community health program.

“I have had four heart attacks and two strokes and the ambulance has been here at least 10 times,” Thompson said.

The Community Health Program is designed to help patients like Thompson live a healthier life with weekly checkups from paramedics for 30 days after a major surgery. A month ago Thompson had open heart surgery and was recommended to the program by his doctor.

“I was on some diuretic pills that really drained me but it also hurt my kidneys so they complemented that by doing the kidney checks.”

The program was started 18 months ago with nearly a $10 million grant from the federal government due to the Affordable Care Act.

Ryan Ramsdell was a 911 paramedic for 10 years before helping start the Community Health Program and he has noticed a change in the way he looks at patients now.

“I think I look now at ways to better increase people's health knowledge so they can better treat themselves so they are not turning to the emergency room.”

Treating patients at home instead of the emergency room is key to the program.

“So the people that do actually need to be there, the ones that are having an acute emergency, can be seen sooner,” said Dominic Polimeni, REMSA Community Health Paramedic.

Ramsdell got to know Thompson, a retired Marine, over the past 30 days but he is not sad to see him complete the program.

“It is rewarding knowing that he now fully understands what he needs to do to keep himself healthy and that is more of a reward,” Ramsdell said. “There is no sadness. “

The same grant also funds the REMSA Nurse Health Line. The grant money will run out in June 2015. REMSA is hoping doctors' offices and local hospitals will subsidize the program to keep it afloat.
