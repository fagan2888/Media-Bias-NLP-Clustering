We have people who are working in the service industries, at WalMart, and they\u2019re working when they don\u2019t have insurance\u2014and that\u2019s who we\u2019re here to serve.\u201d\n\nChrist Clinic\u2019s humble beginnings came in 2000 as part of the Memorial Lutheran Church in Katy, operating out of the church gymnasium every Thursday night for six years.\n\nIn 2007, the clinic moved to its current location at 5504 First Street and expanded its services to open three days a week, operating as a ministry of the church until 2010 before becoming its own non-profit organization in 2011.\n\nThey employ 18 full-time staff members as well as 40-50 volunteers who come through our doors every month. Volunteers include five doctors, a volunteer podiatrist, volunteer dieticians and nutritionists, nurses and physical therapists.\n\n\u201cThe value of our volunteer hours exceeds $200,000 every year, so because of those volunteers we don\u2019t have to raise that money and it supplements and enhances what we do in the clinic,\u201d Hill said.\n\nCurrently nestled in a 3,200 square-foot space with four exam rooms, a pharmacy and an education room, the clinic is looking at a 6,800 square-foot facility. The new center will contain 10 exam rooms, a larger education center to develop those classes more and a larger pharmacy. Hill says they are hopeful for an early 2016 move in date.\n\nNelson says that Christ Clinic serves those who might not come up in the average census data--those who may be forgotten in this world obsessed with dollar signs.\n\n\u201cWhen you do the census surveys, that population wasn\u2019t always picked up--there are always huge pockets in the Katy area that are underserved or have no insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nThe infrastructure of Katy has ballooned in recent years to rival that of the city of Pittsburgh, bringing with it the increased need for organizations such as the clinic.\n\nIn 2014 the clinic served 2,400 patients totaling 5,600 visits according to Hill. Fast forward to present day, and they are projected to provide 9,200 visits all within the same confined space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the point where we\u2019re busting at the seams. We\u2019re just way too big for our current facility. we need more space to be able to keep up with the need,\u201d Hill said.\n\n\u201cWe use every nook and cranny to be efficient and moving to a new space will just allow us to serve more people,\u201d added Nelson.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourkatynews.com", "description": "A Katy-based clinic providing healthcare for low income and uninsured individuals who do not have options to get on Medicaid or cannot purchase insurance is set to expand its services once again.", "title": "Christ Clinic set to expand healthcare services", "url": "http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/ranch/news/christ-clinic-set-to-expand-healthcare-services/article_13cb30cb-ee0c-57fb-88c9-b5c6d76f2960.html", "image": {"width": 621, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/yourhoustonnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/41/6415cbe8-e07a-532a-b3b1-a395ea43f994/563a3d5ae1aae.image.jpg?resize=621%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ScoopHouston", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A Katy-based clinic providing healthcare for low income and uninsured individuals who do not have options to get on Medicaid or cannot purchase insurance is set to expand its services once again.", "msvalidate.01": "29516177700BA7C06DA5A4D58A12C04C", "fb": {"app_id": 191454774240451}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "lqzy3EyAvgVvWDlrVhCm69f7Q1GER22OmU5rYfmsBh8", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "Christ Clinic board President Sherry Nelson says the clinic provides service for a need many may not realize even exists.\nA Katy-based clinic providing healthcare for low income and uninsured individuals who do not have options to get on Medicaid or cannot purchase insurance is set to expand its services once again.\nwe need more space to be able to keep up with the need,\u201d Hill said.\nVolunteers include five doctors, a volunteer podiatrist, volunteer dieticians and nutritionists, nurses and physical therapists.\nNelson says that Christ Clinic serves those who might not come up in the average census data--those who may be forgotten in this world obsessed with dollar signs."}
