LCOR\n\nThe artist known as Mr. Brainwash, best known from the 2010 Banksy documentary \u201cExit Through the Gift Shop,\u201d has designed an outdoor mural that is being installed in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg.\n\nIn the latest example of corporate real estate owners upping their buildings cool factor by hiring graffiti artists, LCOR has enlisted Mr. Brainwash to design a piece for 250N10, a new rental building in Williamsburg.\n\nThe mural faces Roebling Street and features a tribute to John Augustus Roebling, an architectural pioneer and the designer of the Brooklyn Bridge, and his son Charles Roebling.\n\nMr. Brainwash will also add his signature motto \u201cLife is Beautiful.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Brainwash has designed the piece, others are installing the work, which is expected to take two weeks to be completed.\n\nMr. Brainwash is a French-born but Los Angeles-based street artist whose first show in New York was held in the Meatpacking district in 2010.\n\nA street art installation at 250N10 in Williamsburg. LCOR\n\nIn 2009, he was commissioned by Madonna to design the cover of her 2009 greatest hits album \u201cCelebration.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Brainwash\u2019s work tends to be a more about celebrities, but we wanted to make a bit of a local statement,\u201d said David Sigman, Executive Vice President of LCOR.\n\nMr. Sigman said LCOR purchased the site from a private owner and developer for $21 million in 2011. Company officials are paying for the installation, including the cost of labor, stencils, materials and paint. LCOR chose to incorporate the art in an attempt to add to the eclectic landscape of the neighborhood, which is already home to street art by notable artists including Icy + Sot and Blanca\\Valbuena.\n\nMr. Sigman said the 250N10 building, which will include 234 rental apartments, contains a lot of glass and is colorful, but there was a very large blank stucco wall on Roebling St. that building officials thought would lend itself to art.\n\nWhen commissioning Mr. Brainwash for this art installation, LCOR worked directly with Chris Seriale of New World Group. Mr. Seriale is a collector of street art and has pieces from Shepard Fairey, Kaws and Mr. Brainwash.\n\nMr. Sigman said he had not met Mr. Brainwash. \u201cI think he\u2019s in the Hamptons right now,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The artist known as Mr. Brainwash has designed an outdoor mural that is being installed in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg.", "title": "Mural by Mr. Brainwash Will Adorn Williamsburg Rental Building", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/07/16/mural-by-mr-brainwash-will-adorn-williamsburg-rental-building/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DR530_NYMURA_P_20140714154511.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Mural by Mr. Brainwash Will Adorn Williamsburg Rental Building", "description": "The artist known as Mr. Brainwash has designed an outdoor mural that is being installed in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Carmel Melouney", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "The artist known as Mr. Brainwash has designed an outdoor mural that is being installed in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-16T17:02:12-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/07/16/mural-by-mr-brainwash-will-adorn-williamsburg-rental-building/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-21113", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The artist known as Mr. Brainwash has designed an outdoor mural that is being installed in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg.", "title": "Mural by Mr. Brainwash Will Adorn Williamsburg Rental Building", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/07/16/mural-by-mr-brainwash-will-adorn-williamsburg-rental-building/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DR530_NYMURA_P_20140714154511.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-21113", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-16T19:46:20-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a4b\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Brainwash will also add his signature motto \u201cLife is Beautiful.\u201dWhile Mr. Brainwash has designed the piece, others are installing the work, which is expected to take two weeks to be completed.\nMr. Sigman said he had not met Mr. Brainwash.\nMr. Seriale is a collector of street art and has pieces from Shepard Fairey, Kaws and Mr. Brainwash.\nWhen commissioning Mr. Brainwash for this art installation, LCOR worked directly with Chris Seriale of New World Group.\nA street art installation in progress at 250N10, a rental building in Williamsburg."}
