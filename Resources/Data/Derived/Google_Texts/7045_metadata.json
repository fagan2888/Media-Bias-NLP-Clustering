The project has spurs in Connecticut.\n\nThe project also includes a separate Connecticut expansion to upgrade the existing pipeline.\n\nThe expansion consists of about 13 miles of two- to three-foot-diameter pipeline looping in Albany County, New York; Berkshire and Hampden Counties, Massachusetts, and Hartford County, Connecticut. \u201cThis expansion project is developed to meet increased demand in the U.S. Northeast for transportation capacity for natural gas,\u201d Kinder Morgan's website says.\n\nNew England Public Radio\u2019s Henry Epp takes you along the proposed route in a two-part series, talking to people along the way.\n\nWhen asked if he would let Kinder Morgan onto his Stephentown, New York property to survey his land, Albert Gordon said: \u201cAbsolutely not. As a matter of fact, I\u2019ll put every obstruction in their path.\u201d\n\nMichelle Koelle wondered how the compressor station in Windsor, Massachusetts would affect the reproductive habits of her turkeys, as the station would release some emissions to regulate pressure. Listen to the first story in the series below:\n\nIn the second report, Epp hears from someone who thinks people who are more open-minded about the project have been scared into silence.\n\nMartin Piekos of Londonderry, New Hampshire, said he\u2019s undecided about the line, but doesn\u2019t mind it being less than a quarter mile away.\n\n\u201cBut I would like to benefit from it being in my own backyard. I would like to see my gas rates stay low and my energy costs stay low,\u201d Piekos said.\n\nListen to the second story in the series below:\n\nAfter receiving feedback on his series, Epp sat down with a Kinder Morgan representative, Allen Fore, to discuss the pipeline\u2019s possible effects on the environment, property values, and safety. Listen to the interview below:\n\nClick here for an overview fact sheet of the Northeast Energy Direct Project with a breakout of where the pipeline will go, a map, and a proposed timeline on the project. Kinder Morgan says on its website that construction on the Connecticut expansion project is likely to begin late this year and continue through 2016.\n\nCorrection: an earlier version of this report inaccurately described the number of miles of the proposed gas pipeline project. The NED project totals 400 miles, not 60.
