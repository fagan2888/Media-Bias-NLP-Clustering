Two years later, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld most of the law.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t sit in my office every day figuring out what\u2019s my next lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act. I gave it the best shot I had,\u201d said Olens.\n\nHe urged political leaders, many of whom are still advocating for full repeal, to focus on revising individual elements of the law.\n\n\u201cThe number of businesses that are seeking to hire folks at 29 hours a week will kill our economy, which is the hours upon which you don\u2019t have to do the Affordable Care Act. What a screw-up,\u201d said Olens.\n\nHe also said he was deeply concerned about the employer mandate\u2019s potential criminal penalties and the prospect of more companies dropping spousal coverage in the event the spouse has an insurance option elsewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, Olens did say a lawsuit out of Oklahoma has his attention. It challenges wording in the law that Olens says could jeopardize the federal subsidies promised to those in Georgia and other states that didn't create their own insurance exchanges.\n\nHe said the case could fundamentally threaten the law\u2019s funding.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t provide the premium subsidies, you can\u2019t provide the dollars to provide the coverage,\u201d said Olens.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local", "description": "Echoing recent comments of Georgia U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson and Georgia Chamber of Commerce CEO Chris Clark, state Attorney General Sam Olens criticized", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.wabe.org/post/ga-attorney-general-says-obamacare-critics-should-stop-pouting-and-whining", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wabe/files/styles/medium/public/201310/Olens.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Echoing recent comments of Georgia U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson and Georgia Chamber of Commerce CEO Chris Clark, state Attorney General Sam Olens criticized", "title": "Ga.
