That means that at least for some of you, you\u2019ll be dealing with the Obamacare mandate penalties if you didn\u2019t have health insurance. (Or a government accepted form of it anyway.) If you paid the penalty last year it wasn\u2019t much of a bite, but next April the fine is going to be a bit stiffer.\n\nPeople who weren\u2019t covered under a compliant health plan in 2015 or didn\u2019t meet some specific exemptions will have to pay what amounts to a fine when they file their 2015 tax return. The government has two ways of calculating what you\u2019ll owe in 2015. That\u2019s the greater of $325 for each adult and $162.50 for each child, not to exceed $975, or 2 percent of your family\u2019s adjusted gross income. The most you can be fined is capped at the national average cost of a bronze-level health plan available on the exchanges. For 2015, that\u2019s $2,570 for singles and $5,140 for families.\n\nThat\u2019s basically double what it was last year. The example they provide in the article shows that a young married couple with no children (the most likely to not want to bother paying for insurance) will be paying $1,588 for this year as compared to $797 last year. Depending on your income and how you set up your deductions, if you normally expect a refund every year that could pretty much wipe it out for some people. But maybe you won\u2019t have to pay it after all.\n\nWhen people filed their taxes for 2014, the Wall Street Journal reported that a vast majority of those without insurance were not motivated to buy a plan off the exchanges by the threat. (Of course, the penalty was lower last year.) And not all of those who should have paid the penalty ponied up the cash anyway. There are actually a couple of ways to avoid paying it even if you didn\u2019t purchase a health insurance plan.\n\nThe Motley Fool ran through some of them earlier this year and you might be able to manage one of them if you plan ahead. First of all, if the cost of the bronze level plan on Obamacare represents more than 8.05% of your income, you don\u2019t have to pay the penalty. And if your income is at least relatively close to that level, last year\u2019s forms allowed you to state that you thought it would be that much of your income and you could waive it off. But one far less well known aspect of the law gives you another option even if you\u2019re supposed to get hit with it. You can just not pay it. But there\u2019s a catch\u2026\n\nThe best way to avoid paying the Obamacare tax penalty for not carrying qualifying healthcare coverage is arguably what Dan suggested \u2014 simply getting coverage. If that\u2019s not for you, though, here\u2019s an approach you might want to try: Don\u2019t get a tax refund. That\u2019s right. It seems that, according to the way the rules are set up, unlike with some other tax penalties or consequences, there are no levies, liens, or criminal penalties imposed if you don\u2019t pay. And because the penalty is subtracted from your tax refund, if you have no refund, you won\u2019t lose that money. It\u2019s a simple solution, but not quite as simple as it sounds. That\u2019s because you don\u2019t just check a box to not get a refund. Instead, you must make some calculations, and be sure that you\u2019re underpaying your tax obligations throughout the year, either via your withheld taxes or your self-employment estimated tax payments, or both.\n\nYep\u2026 you read that correctly. It looks like there are no legal penalties built into the law for not paying the penalty so they can\u2019t come drag you into court. But you need to set up your deductions so that you don\u2019t overpay your taxes for the year. If you do, they will take the penalty out of your refund. And in order for this to work you\u2019ll need to do this year after year. If you overpay in later years and are owed a refund, they IRS will just take it back then.\n\nIf you have insurance and had it during the first two months of the year there\u2019s really not much to worry about. If not\u2026 good luck.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Pay up, sucker.
