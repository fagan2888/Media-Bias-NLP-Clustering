Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are net sellers of African bonds this month through August 13, on pace for the first monthly outflows since March, according to data provider EPFR Global. Bond prices in countries ranging from Gabon to Kenya to Ivory Coast have dipped after hitting near-record highs at the start of the month.\n\nThe pullback comes as money managers reassess their riskiest bets on the view that central-bank policy will draw cash back to the developed world. Stronger U.S. economic data this month reinforced expectations for an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve that could hit bond prices across the board next year. Similar fears sparked an exodus from U.S. corporate junk bonds and other risky holdings earlier in August.\n\nInvestors worry that a retreat from higher-yielding bond markets would hit African borrowers particularly hard. It would put pressure on countries struggling to plug budget and trade deficits, potentially slamming currencies and reducing economic growth. Small, illiquid debt markets also could seize up if investors try to cash out at once, essentially trapping money managers in losing trades. Analysts see a key test of investor comfort with African bonds coming up later this year in a planned sale by Ghana.\n\n\u201cIf you look across some of these African countries, I don\u2019t see a lot of value out there anymore,\u201d said Jack Deino, head of emerging-markets debt with Invesco. \u201cThe problem is when things do get a little bit rocky. I don\u2019t think a lot of people who are [buying] these deals are doing their homework.\u201d\n\nWSJ Frontiers Newsletter Enter your email to be notified when we launch the new WSJ Frontiers weekly email newsletter\n\nMr. Deino said the firm, which oversees $799 billion, had cut back on its holdings of some African sovereign bonds.\n\nAfrican governments are on pace to sell a record $12.2 billion in bonds to international investors this year, according to data provider Dealogic, topping last year\u2019s record of $10.9 billion. The countries, many with long wish lists of infrastructure projects to serve their growing economies, have been eager to join in the tide of cheap global borrowing as major central banks hold interest rates at near-record lows.\n\nLast month Senegal sold $500 million worth of 10-year bonds to investors at a yield of 6.25%. The country\u2019s previous effort to tap international debt markets, in May 2011, came with a 9.125% yield. Yields fall when prices rise.\n\nSenegal\u2019s experience was typical of African countries that tapped international markets this year. Most sold 10-year bonds, but there were exceptions such as Kenya\u2019s $2 billion split between five- and 10-year debt and Tunisia\u2019s seven-year bond backed by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The bonds sold by Kenya, Ivory Coast and Senegal in the past two months\u2014valued at a combined $3.25 billion in face value\u2014collectively attracted about $17 billion in bids, according to bankers who worked on the deals.\n\nHowever, investors may be getting more selective about the bonds they will buy. Investors during the two weeks ended August 13 pulled $29 million from bond funds that buy African bonds, according to EPFR Global. During the previous four months, investors had poured $351 million into such funds. The data doesn\u2019t include South Africa, a longtime participant in global bond markets, since many investors view it as a different class of investment.\n\nAnd in a move that gave investors pause, Ghana this month asked the International Monetary Fund for a bailout at the same time as it planned an international bond sale. Countries at the doorstep of the IMF, in Ghana\u2019s case because of a ballooning budget deficit and plunging currency, typically aren\u2019t able to tap international debt markets cheaply.\n\nKieran Curtis, a portfolio manager with Standard Life Investments, said his firm trimmed its holdings of Kenyan debt in recent weeks, fearing the selloff in U.S. junk bonds would spill over into other risky debt markets.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get caught unawares\u201d Mr. Curtis said.\n\nRead the full story at wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "African governments are on pace to issue a record amount of bonds in 2014, but global investors' appetite for African bonds may be testing its limit.", "title": "Investors\u2019 Appetite for African Bonds Appears to Diminish", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/08/21/investors-appetite-for-african-bonds-appears-to-diminish/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Investors\u2019 Appetite for African Bonds Appears to Diminish", "description": "African governments are on pace to issue a record amount of bonds in 2014, but global investors' appetite for African bonds may be testing its limit.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Matt Day", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "African governments are on pace to issue a record amount of bonds in 2014, but global investors' appetite for African bonds may be testing its limit.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-08-21T14:14:14-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/08/21/investors-appetite-for-african-bonds-appears-to-diminish/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-1105", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "African governments are on pace to issue a record amount of bonds in 2014, but global investors' appetite for African bonds may be testing its limit.", "title": "Investors\u2019 Appetite for African Bonds Appears to Diminish", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/08/21/investors-appetite-for-african-bonds-appears-to-diminish/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-1105", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-21T14:16:18-04:00"}, "article_summary": "But global investors\u2019 appetite for African bonds may be testing its limit.\nAnalysts see a key test of investor comfort with African bonds coming up later this year in a planned sale by Ghana.\nInvestors during the two weeks ended August 13 pulled $29 million from bond funds that buy African bonds, according to EPFR Global.\nThe country\u2019s previous effort to tap international debt markets, in May 2011, came with a 9.125% yield.\nInvestors worry that a retreat from higher-yielding bond markets would hit African borrowers particularly hard."}
