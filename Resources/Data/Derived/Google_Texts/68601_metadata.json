That\u2019s one of the findings from a new study from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation on coverage after Obamacare\u2019s implementation.\n\nTheir key findings:\n\nIn states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, 68 percent of the uninsured became eligible for assistance, compared with only 44 percent in states that have not expanded Medicaid.\n\nIf nonexpansion states were to expand Medicaid eligibility, 71 percent of their uninsured would be eligible for assistance.\n\nAmong states expanding Medicaid, the ACA is projected to reduce the number of uninsured people by 56 percent, compared with a 34 percent reduction in the uninsured among states not expanding Medicaid.\n\nIf the states that have not expanded eligibility were to do so, the number of uninsured in those states would decrease by 59 percent.\n\nA decrease of nearly 60 percent in the number of uninsured people would mean 60 percent fewer people getting emergency room treatment that hospitals and states have to eat because there isn\u2019t another payer. It means 60 percent more people getting preventive care that could mean lower health care costs for them in the future. It means that many more people getting things like flu shots, helping to keep everyone in their communities healthier. It means making life that much better and easier for 60 percent of the states\u2019 uninsured people.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing about Medicaid expansion that doesn\u2019t make sense morally or economically. The whole problem is political, and the destructive point Republicans insist on making is killing people.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://sandiegofreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/children-health1-e1401806217721.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcedfa\"", "article_summary": "Their key findings:In states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, 68 percent of the uninsured became eligible for assistance, compared with only 44 percent in states that have not expanded Medicaid.\nIf nonexpansion states were to expand Medicaid eligibility, 71 percent of their uninsured would be eligible for assistance.\nAmong states expanding Medicaid, the ACA is projected to reduce the number of uninsured people by 56 percent, compared with a 34 percent reduction in the uninsured among states not expanding Medicaid.\nIt means making life that much better and easier for 60 percent of the states\u2019 uninsured people.\nIf the states that have not expanded eligibility were to do so, the number of uninsured in those states would decrease by 59 percent."}
