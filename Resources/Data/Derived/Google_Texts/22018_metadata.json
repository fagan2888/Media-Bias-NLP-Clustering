The calculations were for an adult who smoked a pack a day beginning at 18 until age 69, the average age at which a smoker dies. The study looked at costs in each of the 50 states, and the results varied from a loss of $1.1 million in South Carolina to about $2 million in Alaska.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, health insurers are allowed to charge smokers 50 percent more for premiums than nonsmokers. Smokers also on average make 8 percent less than nonsmokers and pay 11 percent more for homeowner's insurance, according to WalletHub.\n\nSmoking-related issues directly contribute $116.4 billion to health care costs each year in the United States, the group said.\n\nehirst@tribpub.com\n\nTwitter @ellenjeanhirst", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Lifetime smokers lose out on $1.5 million, study finds", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "The lifetime cost of smoking in Illinois has surpassed $1.5 million per person, according to a new WalletHub study .", "title": "Lifetime smokers lose out on $1.5 million, study finds", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-cost-of-smoking-illinois-0127-biz-20150126-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54c680d0/turbine/ct-cost-of-smoking-illinois-0127-biz-20150126", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp02.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Cost of smoking, cost of smoking Illinois, Illinois smoking costs, WalletHub", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/82633854", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-01-26", "Description": "If smokers kicked the habit and instead invested in the S&P 500 for about five decades, they would have about $1.5 million in their pockets.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Cost of smoking, cost of smoking Illinois, Illinois smoking costs, WalletHub"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabaa\"", "article_summary": "The lifetime cost of smoking in Illinois has surpassed $1.5 million per person, according to a new WalletHub study.\nSmoking-related issues directly contribute $116.4 billion to health care costs each year in the United States, the group said.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, health insurers are allowed to charge smokers 50 percent more for premiums than nonsmokers.\nWalletHub considered the cost of a cigarette pack every day, elevated health care costs, loss of income and other costs such as increased premiums on homeowner's insurance over a 51-year period.\nThe study looked at costs in each of the 50 states, and the results varied from a loss of $1.1 million in South Carolina to about $2 million in Alaska."}
