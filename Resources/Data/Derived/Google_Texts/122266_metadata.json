Nine of the 11 commissioners, appointed by the president and Congress, agreed on the final report; two issued dissenting reports.\n\nThe panel said the federal Children\u2019s Bureau should report directly to the secretary of Health and Human Services, and Congress should hold hearings and boost funding for family services. Some commissioners urged $1 billion in new funding, although others balked at naming a figure.\n\n\u201cWe can't sit here and think we're going to make a difference and put zero dollars toward it,\" Theresa Covington, a presidential appointee and director of the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths, said in an interview.\n\nThe commission\u2019s recommendations follow other steps this week to protect drug-affected newborns amid a national epidemic of opioid addiction. On Tuesday, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell told a House committee that the agency was improving oversight and investigating some states in response to the Reuters findings. A U.S. Senate committee approved legislation Wednesday to expand safety plans for drug-affected newborns.\n\nThe Reuters investigation, \u201cHelpless & Hooked,\u201d can be found at http://reut.rs/1NSc7uC\n\n(Reporting by Duff Wilson in New York and John Shiffman in Washington.
