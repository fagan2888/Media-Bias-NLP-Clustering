The holiday shopping period this year was shorter than usual, more buying was done online and Americans\u2019 tendency to wait until the last possible second to shop probably didn\u2019t help either.\n\nNeither company said how many packages were delayed but noted it was a small share of overall holiday shipments. While the bulk of consumers\u2019 holiday spending remains at physical stores, shopping online is increasingly popular and outstripping spending growth in stores at the mall.\n\nResidents in the Tampa Bay area took to social media Wednesday to express anger about the late delivery of packages from UPS and FedEx.\n\nThe problems appear to have affected many parts of the country including Alabama, California, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.\n\nUPS officials acknowledge their shipping network along the East Coast suffered a breakdown, meaning many packages promised by Christmas did not make it in time.\n\n\u201cUPS understands the importance of your holiday shipments,\u201d the company said in a statement on its website. \u201cThe volume of air packages in our system exceeded the capacity of our network as demand was much greater than the forecast, resulting in some shipments being delayed. We expect a vast majority of these packages will be delivered the day after Christmas. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.\u201d\n\nUPS did not share the number of packages shipped or what the company\u2019s maximum capacity is.\n\nSnow and ice in the Midwest last week and an ice storm that hit Dallas two-and-a-half weeks ago also were partially to blame, said UPS spokeswoman Natalie Godwin.\n\nUPS did not make pickups or deliveries Wednesday. Extra workers were being brought in Wednesday night to the company\u2019s hub in Louisville, Ky., to sort packages for Thursday and Friday delivery, Godwin said.\n\n\u201cWe apologize that our customers did not receive their packages on Christmas,\u201d Godwin said.\n\nGodwin said \u201cUPS will honor its peak shipments commitments\u201d to customers who used its air delivery service. Those shipping by ground have no guarantee past Dec. 11. Godwin said she didn\u2019t know if customers would receive refunds.\n\nSome FedEx customers were able to pick up packages Christmas Day at their local FedEx Express centers.\n\nThe FedEx World Service Center on Water Avenue in Tampa was open until 1 p.m.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry that there could be delays and we\u2019re contacting affected customers who have shipments available for pickup,\u201d said Scott Fiedler, a spokesman for FedEx Corp.\n\nBetween Thanksgiving and Christmas, FedEx handled 275 million shipments, according to Fiedler. Those that were not delivered in time, he said, \u201cwould be very few.\u201d\n\nThree people told The Associated Press that when they tracked their packages online, FedEx said deliveries to their homes were attempted but failed because \u201cthe business was closed.\u201d During follow-up calls with customer service, they said they learned that the local depot was overwhelmed and didn\u2019t attempt delivery.\n\nOn Sunday, Eric Swanson ordered a doll for his daughter and a sweater for his wife through Amazon.com and one of its affiliated sites. As an Amazon Prime customer, there was a promise of two-day delivery, getting the gifts to his Carmichael, Calif. home just in time for Christmas. One was shipped via UPS, the other FedEx.\n\n\u201cI thought it would happen,\u201d Swanson said. Online tracking tools said the packages would arrive by 8 p.m. Tuesday. Neither did.\n\nLate on Christmas Eve, Amazon sent out an apology letter to its customers affected by the breakdown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very sorry for the delay and inconvenience,\u201d the Amazon e-mail read. \u201cWe understand this is a disappointment. We wanted to let you know about this as soon as possible in case you need to make other plans.\u201d\n\nAmazon gave an automatic credit of $20 to the account of those customers involved \u201cto compensate for this inconvenience, good for any item sold on Amazon.com\n\nAmazon spokeswoman Mary Osako said the company processed orders and got them to its shippers \u201con time for holiday delivery\u201d and is now \u201creviewing the performance of the delivery carriers.\u201d\n\nWhile some customers may get money back, they might think twice about ordering online next year.\n\n\u201cMy wife understands but my 5-year-old daughter ... I think we\u2019re going to let it be a surprise when it comes,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cNext time, if I need to get a gift and cut it that close, I will just have to enter the fray and go to the mall.\u201d\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.\n\nrmullins@Tampatrib.com\n\n813-259-7919\n\nTwitter: DailyDeadline", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Wed, 25 Dec 2013 12:05:29 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Some presents weren\u2019t under the tree this Christmas, but not because of any Grinch.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Some presents weren\u2019t under the tree this Christmas, but not because of any Grinch.", "title": "UPS, FedEx breakdown causes delays in Christmas deliveries", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/business/ups-breakdown-causes-delays-in-christmas-deliveries-20131225/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131225/ARTICLE/131229638/AR/0/AR-131229638.jpg", "height": 340}, "updated_time": "2013-12-25T19:43:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Some presents weren\u2019t under the tree this Christmas, but not because of any Grinch.", "title": "UPS, FedEx breakdown causes delays in Christmas deliveries", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131225/ARTICLE/131229638/AR/0/AR-131229638.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-12-25T12:05:29Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-12-25T19:43:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbce9\"", "article_summary": "Some FedEx customers were able to pick up packages Christmas Day at their local FedEx Express centers.\nDelays at UPS and FedEx were blamed on poor weather earlier this week in parts of the country as well as overloaded systems.\n\u201cUPS understands the importance of your holiday shipments,\u201d the company said in a statement on its website.\nBetween Thanksgiving and Christmas, FedEx handled 275 million shipments, according to Fiedler.\nNeither company said how many packages were delayed but noted it was a small share of overall holiday shipments."}
