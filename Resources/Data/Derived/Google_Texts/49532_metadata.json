Nevermind that Ynoa was playing third base only because Nolan Arenado caught pneumonia.\n\nThe Rockies, a team far less star-studded now than when they started in March, capped a four-game sweep of the Arizona Diamondbacks at Coors Field, winning 8-3 behind a pair of two-run doubles from Ynoa and Brandon Barnes.\n\nColorado (65-91) won a sixth consecutive game. The Rockies have won 17 of 22 at Coors Field since Aug. 14. The Diamondbacks lost a 10th straight on the road, their worst stretch outside Arizona since 2010.\n\nEverything is clicking for the Rockies at the wrong time. Now 24 1/2 games out of first place in the National League West \u2014 although now not in last place, after leap-frogging Arizona (62-94) \u2014 the Rockies rolled through their final homestand.\n\nIn seven games at Coors Field against the Dodgers and Diamondbacks, the Rockies averaged 10.2 runs per game. The Rockies looked like, well, the Rockies.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take them long to jump on Arizona. DJ LeMahieu\u2019s single to center in the second inning scored Drew Stubbs. Barnes\u2019 double to right in the third with the bases load scored Josh Rutledge and Wilin Rosario. And Ynoa\u2019s double to center in the fifth brought home Rosario and Stubbs. Michael Cuddyer added a lead-off homer in the seventh.\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 late rise has run parallel to a surge by Rosario.\n\nColorado\u2019s beleaguered catcher \u2014 he very well may have played his final game at Coors Field \u2014 is on a September tear. He\u2019s hitting .514 this month with 10 RBIs and 10 runs in 35 at-bats. He went 2-for-3 with three runs on Sunday.\n\nAll these wins lately had Coors Field feeling generous. After Rockies starter Christian Bergman gave up a two-run homer to Mark Trumbo in the sixth \u2014 the first of two HRs for Trumbo \u2014 the rookie righty got the axe and a standing ovation.\n\nBergman finished after 67 pitches over 5 2/3 innings, with two earned runs and six hits. It was more than good enough for his third career victory.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies cap four-game sweep of Diamondbacks at Coors Field", "title": "Rockies cap four-game sweep of Diamondbacks at Coors Field", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/21/rockies-cap-four-game-sweep-of-diamondbacks-at-coors-field/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140921__rosariop1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140921__rosariop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-21T17:10:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:36:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4d9\"", "article_summary": "Colorado\u2019s beleaguered catcher \u2014 he very well may have played his final game at Coors Field \u2014 is on a September tear.\nIn seven games at Coors Field against the Dodgers and Diamondbacks, the Rockies averaged 10.2 runs per game.\nThe Rockies have won 17 of 22 at Coors Field since Aug. 14.\nThe Rockies, a team far less star-studded now than when they started in March, capped a four-game sweep of the Arizona Diamondbacks at Coors Field, winning 8-3 behind a pair of two-run doubles from Ynoa and Brandon Barnes.\nAll these wins lately had Coors Field feeling generous."}
