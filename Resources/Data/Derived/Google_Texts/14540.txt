Tina Fey and Amy Poehler’s opening monologue at the Golden Globes set a high standard for Ellen DeGeneres’ gig at the Oscars in March. A lot of it hit — and there was at least one moment that fell a bit short. Here are our favorite and least favorite moments from what was a strong set.

The good: The pair found a way to joke about “12 Years a Slave” — possibly the hardest mission for a comic in the current Oscar season. Poehler claimed that the nominated film ensured that “I will never look at slavery the same way again.” Asked Fey: “Wait — how were you looking at it?” The pair nailed the self-satisfied tone of white “12 Years a Slave” viewers, while not diminishing the huge achievement the film represents, a tricky balance.
