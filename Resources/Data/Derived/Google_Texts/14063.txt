Richard Dawkins, a scientist, has come up with `An Appetite for Wonder', the first of a planned two-volume memoir.

The book relates to 1976 and the publication of The Selfish Gene. It is a science-shaking sensation that made his fortune and turned him into what he has become.

He also creates sensation in the Twitterworld. Only few months ago, he tweeted that "all the world's Muslims have fewer Nobel Prizes than Trinity College, Cambridge. They did great things in the Middle Ages, though".

Dawkins book provide an insight account of an Edenic childhood in Africa. He was born in Nairobi and he had to live barefoot and bronzed in Nyasaland with his adored and adoring parents.

Dawkins's schooldays are also been described in the book and you can come across casual cruelties, bullying, pointless regulation, girl-deprived homoeroticism being mitigated by some open-minded, curiosity-inspiring teachers and eccentric headmasters.

Dawkins arrived at Oxford after his school and there his life took a turn and he became entirely about science. He then set up a career of a zoologist. The book describes how he worked with some giants of biology like Niko Tinbergen, W. D. Hamilton, Mike Cullen.

Dawkins also provided a short accounting of his strengths and shortcomings in emulation of his hero, Darwin.
