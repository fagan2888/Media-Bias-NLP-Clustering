Earlier today, we spoke of Trump\u2019s callous statements on women\u2019s health in relation to the hot-button abortion issue. This story also referred to the helicopter rides Trump doled out Sunday at the Iowa State Fair. Trump did so to win votes in a showy manner, although it could be argued that no one would let their kid ride with Trump unless they were planning on voting for the fella already.\n\nAccording to CNN, Trump displayed an unusual amount of interest in something other than himself. After crossing a field and allowing the wind to blow through his magnificent mane, he excitedly asked, \u201cWhere are the children? Get them over here. I love my kids. Come \u2018ere.\u201d All of this happened while \u201cMustang Sally\u201d played in the background, so it was very patriotic.\n\nTrump fielded questions from the children, including one brave soul who asked, \u201cUnder what circumstances would you use a nuclear weapon?\u201d Trump replied, \u201cI don\u2019t even wanna talk about that question. It\u2019s a very serious question. I will bring back jobs, I will strengthen our military, I\u2019ll take care of our vets, I\u2019ll get rid of Obamacare, which is, by the way, a catastrophe.\u201d In the above video, one precocious little boy asked, \u201cMister Trump, are you Batman?\u201d This is when the world ended as Trump answered, \u201cI am Batman.\u201d\n\nClearly, Donald Trump has gone mad with assumed power.\n\n(Via CNN)", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Trump's doled out free helicopter rides at Sunday's Iowa State Fair, he broke all of our hearts.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Donald Trump Committed The Ultimate Sin By Telling A Little Boy, \u2018I\u2019m Batman\u2019\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/uproxx.com\\/tv\\/donald-trump-batman\\/\",\"image_url\":\"https:\\/\\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\\/2015\\/08\\/batman-trump-6.jpg?quality=90&w=650\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"UP-1101176\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-17T03:00:13Z\",\"author\":\"Kimberly Ricci\",\"section\":\"TV\"}", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "site": "@UPROXX", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@UPROXX"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News and Culture for the Digital Generation", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\": \"story\"}", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1109605093", "fb": {"admins": "680207693,2208604", "page_id": 116548701336, "app_id": 117400151618132}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://uproxx.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/bae760df0e3bd64e122a0b36facaee58?s=16", "application-name": "UPROXX", "google-site-verification": "370ZQZwYhpp3OFLpudIZ11ONRN8X1ZhGglPMAFJ6GKw", "keywords": "donald trump, batman, cnn", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UPROXX", "published_time": "2015-08-17T03:00:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-17T14:56:02+00:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "UPROXX", "description": "As Trump\u2019s doled out free helicopter rides at Sunday\u2019s Iowa State Fair, he broke all of our hearts.", "title": "Donald Trump Committed The Ultimate Sin By Telling A Little Boy, \u2018I\u2019m Batman\u2019", "url": "http://uproxx.com/tv/donald-trump-batman/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/batman-trump-6.jpg?quality=90&w=650", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "donald trump, batman, cnn"}, "article_summary": "According to CNN, Trump displayed an unusual amount of interest in something other than himself.\nShare This Video Facebook Twitter EMAILOut of all the outrageous things Donald Trump has said or done during his inexplicable presidential campaign, this statement hits right in the jugular.\nThis story also referred to the helicopter rides Trump doled out Sunday at the Iowa State Fair.\nEarlier today, we spoke of Trump\u2019s callous statements on women\u2019s health in relation to the hot-button abortion issue.\nAfter crossing a field and allowing the wind to blow through his magnificent mane, he excitedly asked, \u201cWhere are the children?"}
