Turning a blind eye to the marchers outside, the White House tried to change the subject from abortion to college sexual assault. Insisting that the country doesn\u2019t pay enough attention to the problem, the President signed a special memorandum today, creating a task force to combat an epidemic that his own views have helped create! In the report from his White House Council on Women and Girls, the administration insists that the incidence of rape \u201cis highest at college, fueled by drinking and drug use that can incapacitate victims.\u201d But instead of putting the blame for this very real crisis where it belongs, the White House points the finger at \u201cpolice bias\u201d and a \u201clack of training to investigate and prosecute sex crimes.\u201d With all due respect, the people who need training are the leaders who head up this council. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to understand what\u2019s really driving the sexual abuse on college campuses. (And it isn\u2019t the failure local law enforcement). Abuse is never okay. But America\u2019s kids are growing up in an oversexualized culture, fed in part by Hollywood \u2014 but also by the radical Left. In the debate over contraception, it wasn\u2019t the police department that embraced the hook-up culture and crusaded for free birth control . It wasn\u2019t the police department that urged more than 50 universities to open their campuses to co-ed dorm rooms. It wasn\u2019t the police who blamed sexual assault on drinking and drug use \u2014 and then proceeded to encourage ObamaCare Happy Hours and even endorse the decriminalization of marijuana. \u201cI smoked pot as a kid,\u201d the President told reporters last weekend, \u201cand I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life. I don\u2019t think it is more dangerous than alcohol.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand what's really driving the sexual abuse on college campuses\"", "title": "Tony Perkins blames President Obama for campus sexual assault crisis in bizarre rant", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand what's really driving the sexual abuse on college campuses\"", "title": "Tony Perkins blames President Obama for campus sexual assault crisis in bizarre rant", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/23/tony_perkins_blames_president_obama_for_campus_sexual_assault_crisis_in_bizarre_rant/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/barack_obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand what's really driving the sexual abuse on college campuses\"", "title": "Tony Perkins blames President Obama for campus sexual assault crisis in bizarre rant", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/barack_obama.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, campus sexual assault, President Obama, Rape, Sexual assault, sexual violence, Tony Perkins, Violence Against Women, Women's Rights, women's safety", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbaec\"", "article_summary": "Later that day, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins blamed the campus sexual assault crisis on \u2026 Obama.\nTurning a blind eye to the marchers outside, the White House tried to change the subject from abortion to college sexual assault.\nAn excerpt of the bizarre rant:While the pro-life movement protested the violence against the unborn and women, President Obama focused on a different kind of assault.\nIt wasn\u2019t the police who blamed sexual assault on drinking and drug use \u2014 and then proceeded to encourage ObamaCare Happy Hours and even endorse the decriminalization of marijuana.\nTopics: campus sexual assault, President Obama, Rape, Sexual assault, sexual violence, Tony Perkins, Violence Against Women, Women's Rights, women's safety, Life News, News, Politics NewsPresident Obama announced Wednesday that his administration has launched a federal task force to combat sexual assault on college campuses, telling the network of student activists who brought this issue to national attention, \u201cI\u2019ve got your back.\u201dIn addition to demanding greater accountability from police and campus administrators, the president called on young men to help end sexual violence against women."}
