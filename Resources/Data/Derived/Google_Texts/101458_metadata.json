Steve Bullock (D) started arranging some \u201c non-publicized \u201d meetings on the issue. The Democratic governor saw a possible opportunity to advance the policy, so he started quiet negotiations with state Republicans and private-sector stakeholders.\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of folks trying to come up with a solution,\u201d state Sen. Ed Buttrey (R) said at the time.\n\nA year later, that solution appears to be within reach. The Missoulian reported yesterday on striking progress among state lawmakers (thanks to my colleague Laura Conaway for the heads-up).\n\nOne day after a lengthy floor battle to free a Medicaid expansion bill from committee, the Montana House on Thursday endorsed the measure, voting 54-46 to accept millions of federal dollars to extend subsidized health coverage to thousands of low-income Montanans. \u201cI think this is the right thing to do, it\u2019s the right time to do it,\u201d said Rep. Rob Cook, R-Conrad, who carried Senate Bill 405 on the floor. \u201cLet\u2019s pass this bill.\u201d\n\nNote, the Montana state House is run by a Republican majority, but on this issue, it was 41 members of the Democratic minority, joined by 13 GOP lawmakers, who prevailed.\n\nThe local report added, \u201cIf the state Senate accepts the one amendment attached Thursday by the House \u2013 a likely prospect \u2013 the bill goes to Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock for his signature.\u201d\n\nAnd there is no real doubt the Montana Democrat would sign the bill into law.\n\nEstimates vary on exactly how many low-income Montanans would receive coverage through the proposal \u2013 I\u2019ve seen estimates ranging from 27,000 to 70,000 \u2013 but the benefit to state finances and state hospitals is undeniable.\n\nAlso note the national context: if Montana policymakers follow through, the state would become the 30th to accept Medicaid expansion and its benefits, coming on the heels of Indiana\u2019s breakthrough earlier this year.\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed before, those who continue to argue that states should reject the policy out of partisan spite \u2013 regardless of the benefits for families, regardless of the needs of state hospitals, regardless of the effects on state finances \u2013 are facing headwinds that are only growing stronger.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "If Montana policymakers follow through, the state would become the 30th to accept Medicaid expansion and its benefits.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/medicaid-expansion-moves-forward-montana", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "If Montana policymakers follow through, the state would become the 30th to accept Medicaid expansion and its benefits.", "title": "Medicaid expansion moves forward in Montana", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/medicaid-expansion-moves-forward-montana", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/2013-09-29t010721z_1832254206_gm1e99t0p9501_rtrmadp_3_usa.jpg?itok=r7ZUIbER", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Medicaid expansion moves forward in Montana", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/medicaid-expansion-moves-forward-montana", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/2013-09-29t010721z_1832254206_gm1e99t0p9501_rtrmadp_3_usa.jpg?itok=VlkmNjZk", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "If Montana policymakers follow through, the state would become the 30th to accept Medicaid expansion and its benefits."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-10T15:46:37-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "If Montana policymakers follow through, the state would become the 30th to accept Medicaid expansion and its benefits.", "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Medicaid expansion moves forward in Montana", "tags": "health,health-care-reform,medicaid,montana,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "04/10/2015 15:46:37 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/medicaid-expansion-moves-forward-montana"}, "news_keywords": "Health Care Reform, Health, Medicaid, Montana"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0473\"", "article_summary": "At this point a year ago, Medicaid expansion in Montana looked like a lost cause, but in early May 2014, Gov.\nAlso note the national context: if Montana policymakers follow through, the state would become the 30th to accept Medicaid expansion and its benefits, coming on the heels of Indiana\u2019s breakthrough earlier this year.\nOne day after a lengthy floor battle to free a Medicaid expansion bill from committee, the Montana House on Thursday endorsed the measure, voting 54-46 to accept millions of federal dollars to extend subsidized health coverage to thousands of low-income Montanans.\n\u201cLet\u2019s pass this bill.\u201dNote, the Montana state House is run by a Republican majority, but on this issue, it was 41 members of the Democratic minority, joined by 13 GOP lawmakers, who prevailed.\nSteve Bullock for his signature.\u201dAnd there is no real doubt the Montana Democrat would sign the bill into law."}
