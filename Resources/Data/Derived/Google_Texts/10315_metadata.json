But an analysis of rates among states found alarming disparities \u2013 from a low of 7.9 deaths per 1,000 people with diagnosed HIV in Vermont to a high of 30.8 in Louisiana. Also, seven of the 10 states that have not met the national 2015 goal were in the Southern region of the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that people with HIV living in many Southern states are more likely to die than those living in other parts of the country,\u201d said Jonathan Mermin, M.D., director of CDC\u2019s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. \u201cSome states are making great strides toward getting people with HIV diagnosed and into care, but every state must do this if we are to reach our national goals for prevention and care.\u201d\n\nThe data show that Southern states also lagged behind in people knowing their HIV status. Nationally, 87 percent of Americans knew their HIV status in 2012, but this percentage varied substantially across states \u2013 from a low of 77 percent in Louisiana to a high of 93 percent in New York and Hawaii.\n\nAcross the nation, only five states reached the National Goal of 90 percent awareness (Hawaii, New York, Colorado, Connecticut, and Delaware); 70 percent of the worst-performing states on this indicator were in the South. Particularly in these states, people who do not know they are infected with HIV are not getting the medical care they need to stay healthy and protect their partners.\n\n\u201cCDC is responding to the challenge of HIV in the South and nationwide by prioritizing the hardest-hit areas and populations and investing in the most effective strategies,\u201d said Eugene McCray, M.D., director of CDC\u2019s Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention. \u201cThese strategies include expanded testing for HIV, helping people living with HIV obtain ongoing care and treatment, and increasing awareness of and access to all effective prevention tools, including condoms, pre-exposure prophylaxis \u2013 or PrEP, and interventions to decrease risky behavior.\u201d\n\nDr. McCray announced the findings in his plenary speech launching the 2015 National HIV Prevention Conference. The conference, convened by the CDC and many public, private, and government agencies, is taking place in Atlanta, Dec. 6-9. This meeting focuses on the full spectrum of HIV prevention, giving community organizations, public health professionals, clinicians, advocates, and other interested individuals the opportunity to exchange information about effective prevention approaches.
