(NASDAQ:AMGN) and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) aren\u2019t exactly friends. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration just approved the use of a biosimilar drug for the first time. (It happens to be a copy of Amgen\u2019s Neupogen.) And although pricing has yet to be determined, you can bet CVS \u2014 which also is one of the country\u2019s largest pharmacy benefits managers \u2014 will work hard to keep it as low as possible.\n\nIt seems like pharmaceuticals companies are always dealing with their blockbuster drugs going off patent to be subsumed by far cheaper generic versions. Now that the FDA has approved biosimilars in the U.S., biotechs could see the same kind of price pressure hitting their top lines \u2014 and maybe their stocks.\n\nCVS is striving mightily to lower costs for its clients. After all, it\u2019s in a tight competition with rival Express Scripts Holding Company (NASDAQ:ESRX) to sign them up \u2014 and keep them happy.\n\nIt\u2019s even worse for a company like Amgen when the two pharmacy benefits managers team up. For instance, ESRX and CVS\u2019 PBM division set up competition between two drugs for hepatitis C, forcing price cuts from the pharma companies that make them.\n\nAs much as Amgen and CVS might find themselves in a price tug-of-war, there are, of course, plenty of other headwinds and tailwinds for both stocks. Let\u2019s see how they stack up going head-to-head.\n\nAmgen (AMGN)\n\nAmgen stock is off to a poor start in 2015, falling nearly 3% for the year-to-date. Finding itself as a market laggard is an unfamiliar position for AMGN. Indeed, over the past 52 weeks, it\u2019s ahead of the broader market by a whopping 30 percentage points.\n\nThe underperformance shouldn\u2019t last long. The company\u2019s acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals for $10.4 billion brought with it a crown jewel of cancer-fighting drugs. Additionally, AMGN has a strong pipeline, with as many as five drugs facing approval (or rejection) this year.\n\nSure, the FDA\u2019s approval of an AMGN copycat drug may be something of a weight on the stock, but it was hardly a surprise. The market has had ample time to price AMGN stock for just such an outcome.\n\nWhat really helps AMGN in the shorter term is that activist investor Daniel Loeb is pushing it to cut costs and perhaps even break up. The market tends to like it when activists like Loeb start rattling a company\u2019s cage.\n\nCVS\n\nFew companies have such strong demographics and other macro factors at their backs. As both a pharmacy and pharmacy benefits manager, CVS is loving health reform and our rapidly aging population.\n\nAfter all, the Affordable Care Act created millions of new customers for the healthcare industry. At the same time, baby boomers \u2014 a cohort of some 80 million people \u2014 are just now entering retirement years.\n\nPerhaps that helps explain why CVS has clobbered the market and beaten AMGN over the last one-, three- and five-year periods. Heck, CVS stock has tripled over the last half-decade alone. AMGN is up less than 80%, while the broader market gained 155%.\n\nOn the downside, the valuation on CVS looks stretched. It trades at a 25% premium to its own five-year average on a forward earnings basis. Valuation, remember, tends to revert to the mean.\n\nOur First-Round Pick: CVS\n\nCVS Health gets the edge here. It may be a bit on the pricey side, but then so is AMGN \u2026 and CVS has a better long-term growth forecast.\n\nFurthermore, you have to like the macro forces behind CVS. There are few sure things in life, and the aging of the baby boomers is one of them. AMGN \u2014 like all biotechs and pharma companies \u2014 will always face regulatory risk. The market hates uncertainty, and the drugs industry has it in spades.\n\nFinally, CVS is certainly pricey by historical measures, but the valuation is defensible. The stock currently trades at 18 times forward earnings. That\u2019s not out of line for a projected compound annual growth rate of nearly 15%. CVS wins.\n\nHead back to the Stock Market Madness bracket to vote for your favorite stocks and check out other previews!\n\nAs of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amgen (AMGN) and CVS Health Corp (CVS) find themselves on opposite sides when it comes to pricing for the latest drugs.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "InvestorPlace", "description": "Amgen (AMGN) and CVS Health Corp (CVS) find themselves on opposite sides when it comes to pricing for the latest drugs.", "title": "MARCH MADNESS: Amgen (AMGN) vs. CVS Health (CVS)", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/march-madness-630-478.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-15T13:10:58-04:00", "url": "http://investorplace.com/2015/03/march-madness-amgen-inc-amgn-vs-cvs-health-corp/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Amgen (AMGN) and CVS Health Corp (CVS) find themselves on opposite sides when it comes to pricing for the latest drugs.", "title": "MARCH MADNESS: Amgen (AMGN) vs. CVS Health (CVS)", "image": "http://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/march-madness-630-478.jpg", "creator": "@danburrows", "site": "@InvestorPlace", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100002035369734}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "5MtKaaO4K0OK-C2y-n9MKUc_WzF9GSkH0fLgruR0TKM", "keywords": "markets, amgn, cvs, amgen, cvs health, march madness", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/investorplace", "section": "Stock Picks", "published_time": "2015-03-15T13:10:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-15T13:10:58-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20150315, "yandex-verification": "7449d54f0a1869d7", "news_keywords": "markets, amgn, cvs, amgen, cvs health, march madness"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf764\"", "article_summary": "Amgen, Inc.
