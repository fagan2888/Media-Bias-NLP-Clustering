She believes the process will not \"result in anything more than an academic exercise.\"\n\nOther advertising groups said they would stay in the group.\n\nThe Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) will remain in the group, though its senior vice president Mike Zaneis said it supported the DDA\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) also plans to stay in the working grou.\n\n\u201cThe absence of a clear process is particularly disturbing given the gravity of issues being debated within the Working Group and the potential impact on the Internet economy,\u201d said the group's leader, Marc Groman.\n\nStill, NAI believes \"that we must remain at the table to ensure that the perspectives of advertising technology companies, small business, and the long tail of the Internet are considered should this process move forward.\u201d\n\nJeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, which supports strong privacy standards, said DAA\u2019s involvement is one of the key reasons the working group has \u201cfloundered.\u201d\n\n\"If the DAA power brokers \u2014 Google, Yahoo, and the ad giants \u2014 had really wanted to deliver new privacy protection clout to consumers, our work would have successfully finished a year ago,\u201d Chester said.\n\nBut even with the DAA gone, he said the group is unlikely to succeed in creating a \"Do Not Tack\" standard.\n\nThis story was posted at 11:30 a.m. and updated at 1:26 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Talks to help users avoid online tracking have \"clearly reached the end of [their] useful life,\" a group said.", "description": "Talks to help users avoid online tracking have \"clearly reached the end of [their] useful life,\" a group said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kate Tummarello", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Talks to help users avoid online tracking have \"clearly reached the end of [their] useful life,\" a group said.", "title": "'Do not track' effort in trouble", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/322701-do-not-track-group-should-give-up-departing-online-ad-reps-say", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T23:41:31-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T23:41-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/322701-do-not-track-group-should-give-up-departing-online-ad-reps-say", "dcterms.date": "2013-09-17T15:30-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Kyle Balluck", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",John Rockefeller,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-17T15:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T23:41:31-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/322701-do-not-track-group-should-give-up-departing-online-ad-reps-say", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Talks to help users avoid online tracking have \"clearly reached the end of [their] useful life,\" a group said.", "card": "summary", "title": "'Do not track' effort in trouble"}, "dcterms.title": "'Do not track' effort in trouble"}, "article_summary": "The working group has divided between online advertising groups and privacy activists that want strict standards on what online companies can track.\n\u201cI no longer see any workable path to a standard that will gain active support from both wings of the Working Group.\"\nIt also lashed out at Peter Swire, the co-chairman of the working group who recently left it to participate in the White House\u2019s review of National Security Agency surveillance programs.\nOther advertising groups said they would stay in the group.\nBut even with the DAA gone, he said the group is unlikely to succeed in creating a \"Do Not Tack\" standard."}
