ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012, rallied support for New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez in Albuquerque today.

Romney drew a crowd of more than 200 outside Martinez’s campaign headquarters in Albuquerque, where Romney praised Martinez’s record of accomplishment as a model for the nation and urged supporters to vote early.

“People look at the president’s policies and recognize they’re not working, and they look here in New Mexico and look at Susana Martinez’s policies, and say they’re working,” Romney told supporters.

“New Mexico is a model. New Mexico is an example,” Romney said. “If you want good leadership and a bright future, you’ve got to vote for Susana Martinez early.”

Romney highlighted the governor’s record on education, noting the state’s improvement in graduation rates.

“What shes done on education has the whole country looking,” Romney said.

Critics have said the improvements are a carry-over of policies crafted by the Legislature under former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson.

The former Massachusetts governor also praised Martinez’s work toward diversifying the state economy and managing the state budget without tax increases.
