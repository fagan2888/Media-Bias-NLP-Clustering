It updates a previous study that looked at payments from 2003 through 2012.\n\nThat study also showed that payments to hospitals in southeastern Wisconsin from private health plans on average had increased at roughly half the national rate.\n\n\"The expense control of the hospitals has been very good,\" said Keith Kieffer, a management consultant with Milliman.\n\nThe hospital market also has become more competitive since 2008 as health systems opened hospitals in different parts of the Milwaukee metropolitan area. Aurora Health Care opened hospitals in Summit and Grafton, for instance, and Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare opened a hospital in Franklin.\n\nAurora also has sharply lowered the operating costs \u2014 the day-to-day expenses \u2014 of its hospitals.\n\nIn 2003, Aurora's hospitals had the highest average operating costs among health systems in southeastern Wisconsin, according to the study released Tuesday. Last year, the operating costs of its hospitals were 12% below the average for health systems in the area.\n\nAurora's operating costs were 4% lower last year than they were in 2003. In contrast, two national measures of hospital operating costs \u2014 both imperfect, Kieffer said \u2014 increased 52% and 39% from 2003 through 2014.\n\nAurora's success in controlling costs enabled it to hold the line on rate increases.\n\nIn 2003, commercial health plans' payments to Aurora hospitals were 23% above the average for southeastern Wisconsin. Last year, payments to Aurora were 3% below the average.\n\nPayments to Wheaton Franciscan for hospital care were the lowest among the six health systems included in the study: 6% below the average for southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nAt the same time, overall hospital costs in southeastern Wisconsin were much higher than similar geographic areas 10 years ago, said Dave Osterndorf, a partner and chief actuary for Health Exchanges Resources in Glendale. Now they are more in line with similar markets.\n\nThe Milliman study did find that payments to hospitals in southeastern Wisconsin from private insurers increased 6.5% last year compared with a national average of 5%. It was the first time that the increase has outpaced the national average since 2005.\n\nThe increase in all likelihood stemmed from hospitals with higher rates providing more medical services than an increase in what hospitals bill health plans, Kieffer said.\n\nHospital care accounts for 30% to 40% of the costs of medical spending for commercial health insurance plans.\n\nThe slower increase in hospital payments has only partly checked the increase in insurance premiums.\n\nThose typically have increased more than 4% a year after changes in plan design, such as higher deductibles, in recent years.\n\nHowever, physician fees account for about 30% of medical spending \u2014 and physician fees for commercial health plans in southeastern Wisconsin were almost 50% higher on average than other Midwest markets, according to a Milliman study released last year.\n\nIn addition, prescription drug costs have increased significantly in recent years.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also placed a tax on health plans. In addition, the aging of the workforce has contributed to the increase in premiums.\n\nThe study released Tuesday found that the total increase in commercial payments to health systems for health systems ranged from 18% to 80% from 2003 through 2014.\n\nIn that time period, payments for hospital care from private health insurers increased:\n\n\u25a0 18% for Aurora Health Care.\n\n\u25a048% for Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare.\n\n\u25a053% for Columbia St. Mary's.\n\n\u25a062% for United Hospital System.\n\n\u25a064% for Froedtert Health.\n\n\u25a080% for ProHealth Care.\n\nIn 2014, payments to ProHealth were 18% above market average for southeastern Wisconsin. In 2003, they were 6% below the average.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Study: Increases in payments to southeastern Wisconsin hospitals were less than national average", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/study-increases-in-payments-to-southeastern-wisconsin-hospitals-were-less-than-national-average-b996-362419041.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Payments to southeastern Wisconsin hospitals from commercial health plans increased on average at a rate that was less than 50% of the national rate from 2003 through 2014, according to a new study released Tuesday.", "title": "Insurers\u2019 payments to area hospitals rise less than U.S. rate"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "Payments to southeastern Wisconsin hospitals from commercial health plans increased on average at a rate that was less than 50% of the national rate from 2003 through 2014, according to a new study released Tuesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Study: Increases in payments to southeastern Wisconsin hospitals were less than national average"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6766\"", "article_summary": "That study also showed that payments to hospitals in southeastern Wisconsin from private health plans on average had increased at roughly half the national rate.\nIn 2003, commercial health plans' payments to Aurora hospitals were 23% above the average for southeastern Wisconsin.\nThe Milliman study did find that payments to hospitals in southeastern Wisconsin from private insurers increased 6.5% last year compared with a national average of 5%.\nIn 2003, Aurora's hospitals had the highest average operating costs among health systems in southeastern Wisconsin, according to the study released Tuesday.\nIn 2014, payments to ProHealth were 18% above market average for southeastern Wisconsin."}
