The ribbon cutting will be held on September 22 at 2 p.m. The museum, located at the Miccosukee Indian Village, in the heart of Florida\u2019s Everglades along Tamiami Trail, near the halfway point between Miami and Naples, east of the Collier County line. The Miccosukee Tribe is the southernmost Tribe in our nation\u2019s lower 48 states.\n\nThe Miccosukee Tribe has been operating this attraction for visitors for more than 50 years. Visitors can watch alligator wrestling, traditional art demonstrations and walk along a boardwalk that takes then out over the River of Grass. At the heart of the village experience is the tribal museum. First built in the 1980\u2019s, the tribe felt that it was time to renovate the museum exhibits to tell the story of their people and the environment they call home.\n\nThe tribe hired Tina Marie Osceola & Associates, a member of the Seminole Tribe and former executive director of the Seminole\u2019s Ah-Tah-Thi-Ki Museum, the nation\u2019s first tribally-governed museum to be accredited by the American Association of Museums. Osceola put a team together in April and has spent the summer researching and designing the new exhibits.\n\nCentral to this renovation project has been a series of films that feature members of the Miccosukee Tribe telling their story. The first film, \u201cSo We May Grow,\u201d was produced by Mehdy Ghannad & Evan Zissimopulos, Free Road Entertainment. The film was a re-shoot of a work produced for the museum in the 80s. The new film tells the story of culture, preservation and growth as told to a young boy, Ezekiel Tiger, by his uncle, Michael Osceola.\n\n\u201cSo We May Grow,\u201d was narrated by Adam Beach, an Anishinaabe member of the Saulteaux tribe of Dog Creek Lake Reserve in Manitoba, Canada and star of films like \u201cSmoke Signals\u201d and \u201cCode Talkers.\u201d Beach also appeared in the television series \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit.\u201d The original score was produced by Grammy Award Winning artists, Micki Free and Jean Beauvoir.\n\nThe second film, \u201cWe Must Not Forget,\u201d is a film inspired by words of tribal elder Virginia Poole. The film features the voice of her daughter, Gina Poole, reinforcing the role and importance of women in determining the tribe\u2019s future and cultural relevance. \u201cWe are the ones who keep our camps and homes as a place for people to come back to. Some say when we have no more Native people, the earth will die.\u201d\n\nExhibits will cover topics such as alligators, camp life, traditional arts, canoes and transportation, as well as adaptability to the environment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida will be embarking on a major renovation to the tribal museum to tell the story of their people.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/18/miccosukee-village-renovation-new-exhibits-will-tell-story-tribe-156450", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/miccosukee-indian-village.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Miccosukee Village Renovation: New Exhibits Will Tell the Story of the Tribe"}, "abstract": "The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida will be embarking on a major renovation to the tribal museum to tell the story of their people.", "dc": {"title": "Miccosukee Village Renovation: New Exhibits Will Tell the Story of the Tribe"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/18/miccosukee-village-renovation-new-exhibits-will-tell-story-tribe-156450", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, Native American History", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-18T13:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Miccosukee Village Renovation: New Exhibits Will Tell the Story of the Tribe"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcbbe\"", "article_summary": "The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida recently announced that they have embarked on a major renovation to their tribal museum.\nThe Miccosukee Tribe is the southernmost Tribe in our nation\u2019s lower 48 states.\nCentral to this renovation project has been a series of films that feature members of the Miccosukee Tribe telling their story.\nThe Miccosukee Tribe has been operating this attraction for visitors for more than 50 years.\nAt the heart of the village experience is the tribal museum."}
