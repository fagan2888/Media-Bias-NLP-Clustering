Reps. Jim Wilson, a Salida Republican who is a former school superintendent, and Lois Court, a Denver Democrat, sponsored the measure.\n\nThey sponsored the original bill, House Bill 1251, which sailed through the House on a 55-9 vote, but died 3-2 on a party-line vote in the Senate committee with little debate or discussion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Court said.\n\nBackers told The Denver Post that Sen. Owen Hill, R-Colorado Springs, told them national Republicans didn\u2019t want to see a bill passed that potentially could help Bennet, a Democrat up for re-election next year. Hill responded his chief concern is the Colorado Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Association\u2019s solvency is a \u201creal ticking time bomb,\u201d but he acknowledged people told him they had concerns about \u201csome bad deals that were cut\u201d when Bennet oversaw Denver schools.\n\nThose deals became an issue in Bennet\u2019s 2010 Senate primary. He maintained then those deals actually benefited DPS, whose retirement obligations now are 86 percent fulfilled, compared to other school districts, which are at 64 percent. DPS is now paying around $23 million extra into the retirement fund; the bills would allow them to pay the same rate as other schools. A 2009 bill allowing DPS to join the state retirement system required the extra payment and an evaluation in five years. That evaluation showed DPS should actually be paying less into PERA than other school districts, but the bills require the same payments.\n\nDuring the House hearing in March, Wilson urged passage of the bill and referenced state Treasurer Walker Stapleton, who has long warned lawmakers about PERA.\n\n\u201cThe state treasurer supports this bill, and everyone knows where he stands on PERA unfunded liability issues,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSo that should clarify this.\u201d\n\nIf the House passes the measure on Monday, it goes to the Senate in a time crunch. The legislature must adjourn by midnight Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado Public Employees Retirement Association,Denver Public Schools,DPS,Jim Wilson,Lois Court,Michael Bennet,Owen Hill,PERA,Walker Stapleton", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "A Denver Public Schools pension bill that was killed amid allegations the GOP was worried Sen.
