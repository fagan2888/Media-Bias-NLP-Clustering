Nothing groundbreaking had hit the shelves yet, but even the biggest, clunkiest tech devices were building a foundation for incredible electronic advancements decades later.\n\nLikewise, district Superintendent Brad Meeks lets out a chuckle thinking about the then-and-now of technology. The boxy Commodore PET \u2014 a relic machine since 1982 \u2014 was the up-and-coming tool in Meeks\u2019 days as a 1978 high school senior, right alongside the newly introduced graphing calculator.\n\nMeeks now oversees a school district with 2,467 students in dozens of classrooms equipped with technological learning tools that didn\u2019t even exist five years ago, let alone in the 1980s and \u201970s.\n\n\n\nMiles, meanwhile, is the captain that steers the district ship as it navigates through currents of the advancing electronic landscape. As the technology director for eight years, Miles has worked with arguably the biggest technological advancements in education, particularly in the past four years.\n\nMore than ever before, Steamboat students in kindergarten through 12th grades are studying with iPads in their hands, Chromebooks on their desks and Smart Boards on their classroom walls. These technological tools are not only changing the way students born into today\u2019s digital age keep up with modern curriculum, but also how their teachers make learning fun, interesting and, most of all, interactive.\n\n\u201cI tell people, you go into the schools today, and they\u2019re not like they were when we were growing up,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cI remember going through my teacher prep stuff, and you\u2019d have to learn how to just run the film through the projector and all that stuff.\u201d\n\nSTARTING SMALL, THEN KEEPING UP\n\nHanding a first-grader an iPad and expecting the student to stay on track with the lesson plan doesn\u2019t spark the chaos you\u2019d imagine.\n\n\n\nWalk into teacher Niki Struble\u2019s first-grade class at Soda Creek Elementary School on a Friday, and there\u2019s a buzz in the air.\n\nThe class looks just like any class from the past decade or so \u2014 well, almost. Books are stacked on shelves, personal belongings are stowed safely away in cubbies and the 20 students sit around six round tables.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch. These students aren\u2019t drawing on construction paper with colored pens or pencils. They each have an assigned iPad in their hands with the \u201cExplain Everything\u201d application open on their screens, steadily working on a science research project.\n\nLooming above the room is a flat-screen television programmed with an Apple TV device that allows the 20 iPads in the room to display the children\u2019s work for everyone to see.\n\nSoda Creek technology director Scott Furgueson leads the youngsters through the very basics of the app, such as saving a photo from the Internet onto the iPad\u2019s hard drive, or how to take that photo and insert it into an interactive slideshow, one they can record their voices onto, and in about three months, sync those voices into a video slideshow.\n\nThe youngsters\u2019 eyes light up when even the simplest tasks are achieved.\n\n\n\nUsing iPads with 6- or 7-year-olds isn\u2019t uncommon at either Soda Creek or Strawberry Park elementary schools, nor is it a way to simply fill the students\u2019 class day with games \u2014 far from it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about using this to enhance what they\u2019re already doing in the classroom,\u201d Furgueson explains. \u201cAs we talk about it with the kids, it\u2019s a tool, not a toy. We battle that all the time, because at home, it\u2019s considered a toy to them.\u201d\n\nThe first-graders start small, Struble says. Soda Creek\u2019s designated iPad cart, which carries 25 devices room to room upon request, makes regular appearances in her room, but not in every room.\n\nFor a year now, teachers district-wide have been required to complete 15 hours of tech training, which often is facilitated by the district\u2019s designated \u201cGoogle, iPad or Smart mentors,\u201d group leaders who themselves have voluntarily embarked on extra training, which qualifies them to train their colleagues.\n\n\u201cWe introduced this last year,\u201d Miles said. \u201cTraining can happen in staff development days or in those committee groups.\u201d\n\nThe teacher resources are there, and more training sessions are being introduced each year. The Northwest Colorado Board of Cooperative Educational Services has offered iPad classes for teachers the past few summers \u2014 classes that teachers like Mrs. Struble frequent.\n\nTeachers throughout the district have chosen to attend tech conferences on a volunteer basis after seeing more devices introduced to their students and realizing they need to be brought up to speed on the latest technology. Miles said he gets a lot of insight from the monthly tech conferences \u2014 the Technology Leadership Forum \u2014 held for school district tech directors from across Colorado.\n\n\u201cI go to those and listen to what other districts are dealing with,\u201d Miles said. \u201cMost of it is, \u2018What are your challenges?\u2019 You gain knowledge from schools who have done different things and carved the trail in some aspects.\u201d\n\nEven with added training for teachers, it\u2019s the students who don\u2019t need to look much farther than their peers next to them for the assistance they may need.\n\n\n\nNot only are iPads and Chromebooks changing the way students learn, they are creating an entirely new dynamic in the teacher-student relationship.\n\n\u201cOnce the teacher adopts (more technology), they\u2019re not the smartest person in the room,\u201d Miles said. \u201cWhat they become is the classroom manager. When there is a tech issue with one of these devices, they have to accept that little Johnny is going to help Sarah because they can figure it out quickly. They\u2019re very adaptive.\u201d\n\nFROM 30 iPADS TO 600\n\nFour years ago, when Apple first released the iPad, the Steamboat Springs School District didn\u2019t join those lining up days in advance, eager to get the devices into their classrooms.\n\n\u201cI hesitate to simply rely on a salesperson,\u201d Curriculum Director Marty Lamansky said. \u201cWe talk to other districts with these things, look at other trends across the country. We don\u2019t want to be the people to line up for a week to get the latest version just because it\u2019s the latest version.\u201d\n\nBut the district doesn\u2019t ignore the latest tech trends, either. When the iPad was introduced in April 2010, Steamboat Springs Middle School teachers got the first trial run as a pilot initiative, Miles said.\n\nFour years ago, the district introduced 30 iPads to the middle school. Today, there are almost 600 of the devices in use, and every district teacher has been given one of their own.\n\nIt was an add-on, Miles said, not a substitute for the desktop models that currently fill district computer labs. The technology director spent the first part of his eight years on the job refurbishing outdated computers and updating software to be more sustainable, so there was no way iPads suddenly were going to replace the desktops.\n\nStruble is an example of how the devices can help teachers enhance student learning.\n\n\u201cI went to a couple of trainings three years ago and had an iPad from the school,\u201d Struble said. \u201cI came back and had to turn it in. I was like, \u2018I really need that back if you want me to try this.\u2019 That\u2019s when I think it became really apparent to people in administration that we needed to have these tools in our hands to use them effectively and efficiently with our children.\u201d\n\nFunding for technology like iPads, Chromebooks and Smart Boards comes almost entirely from the Steamboat Springs Education Fund Board, which receives grant requests each year and ultimately decides how much each of Routt County\u2019s three districts will receive.\n\nWith its grant money, Steamboat always purchases the iPads in packages of 10 and receives a small $20 discount per device, which reduces the cost to about $379 apiece. Nearly every model is an iPad 2, except the most recently purchased tablets, which are iPad 3s because Apple no longer produces the second-generation model. To protect the five-days-per-week constant use from students, Miles said the district invested in $70 robust cases with screen shields for each iPad.\n\nDo they last? Absolutely, he says.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been very reliable,\u201d Miles says. \u201cExtremely reliable. We\u2019ve had a handful of those 600 every year that need to get replaced. We have some local contacts in town that can fix things like screens and stuff, but electronically they have never failed.\u201d\n\nCHROMEBOOKS HERE TO STAY\n\nThis time last year, there wasn\u2019t a single Chromebook in the Steamboat Springs School District.\n\nBut as is the case with a lot of newly introduced devices in the district, an immediate need was there as the Colorado Department of Education began phasing in a digital-only online state testing system.\n\nAt the same time, the district was exploring the Google Apps for Education program, Miles rolled out 100 Chromebooks \u2014 small laptops manufactured by Google \u2014 at the high school.\n\nGoogle Apps for Education is free for school districts and comes with applications such as Google Docs, which act as online Word documents, and Google Calendar, a program that often is used in schools\u2019 checkout systems for teachers renting the iPad and Chromebooks.\n\nWith Google Apps, students can work on group projects purely online with one another from outside locations, where all work is saved to the Cloud. Students also have their own Gmail login, another way for their instructors to communicate instantly with them, whenever from wherever.\n\nOther districts moved to Google Apps a long time ago, Miles said. But until last year, the need simply wasn\u2019t there yet in Steamboat. A complete overhaul wasn\u2019t feasible at the time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s changing education,\u201d Miles says. \u201cWe purposely held off. Other districts had gone to it three or four years ago. It just wasn\u2019t there for our needs. I see this time next year, 100 percent of our students, or close to it, will be into that product.\u201d\n\nThe 100 Chromebooks, originally purchased for state testing use, went to a pilot group of teachers to introduce into their class curriculum.\n\n\u201cThey were ecstatic,\u201d Miles says.\n\nAs a result, Miles bought nearly 300 more of them.\n\nIn Meghan Hanson-Peters\u2019 freshman world geography course at Steamboat Springs High School, Chromebooks are a mainstay.\n\nAfter wrapping up a roundtable discussion regarding China\u2019s one-child policy with the help of an interactive Smart Board, students are instructed to pair up and grab a Chromebook.\n\nWith the small laptop, the freshmen are asked to gather data from the Population Reference Bureau and plot their findings regarding such things as birth rates, infant mortality and life expectancy from various countries. In doing so, they plot the data on a printed-out spreadsheet, joining the new and old styles of classroom learning.\n\nHanson-Peters said she\u2019s careful to know exactly when to hand out things like iPads and Chromebooks to 13- and 14-year-olds and when to get their eyes off a screen and shift the room into a class discussion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned the hard way a few times where I made the mistake of handing students things like iPads as they walk into class,\u201d Hanson-Peters said. \u201cThen I\u2019m screwed because my first 10 minutes they\u2019re multitasking, and I\u2019ve already lost them.\u201d\n\nLike Soda Creek\u2019s Struble, Hanson-Peters has bought into the district\u2019s technology shift. She was one of a small group of teachers who took part in Google training the district held in March. She also has taken part in iPad training before the start of school.\n\nLike so many district teachers, who range in age from their late 20s to well past retirement age, Hanson-Peters recognizes the struggle of constantly evolving technology seeping into prep school curriculum, where the digital age is alive and well.\n\nYou can\u2019t ignore the influx of the tech-heavy classrooms, she says, nor can you replace the old way of doing things.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to use technology as a substitute,\u201d Hanson-Peters says. \u201cI want to use it to extend or enhance. I\u2019m always wrestling with that.\u201d\n\nONE-TO-ONE COULD BE ON THE HORIZON\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint where the district might be in the future as it continues to roll out more devices and explore options that fit well with schools of its size.\n\nAbove all else, district officials say, they\u2019re being meticulous in their decision-making process.\n\nIn April, the Los Angeles Unified School District suspended a proposal for the largest technology rollout of its kind \u2014 a one-to-one iPad ratio for each student in the enormous district.\n\n\n\nAmong other reasons, the Los Angeles rollout, a $1 billion initiative, hit a snag at the beginning of last school year when handfuls of students bypassed security protocols to get into their social networking profiles and other blocked websites, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n\u201cWe try to be a lot more thoughtful and cautious,\u201d district Curriculum Director Marty Lamansky says.\n\nAlthough Steamboat is much smaller than the Los Angeles Unified School District, the local administrators keep a close eye on what other districts are doing nationwide and statewide.\n\nManitou Springs School District near Colorado Springs is one of the first school districts in Colorado to adopt the one-to-one system with iPads, Miles said.\n\n\u201cI went down and visited them and talked to some students,\u201d Miles said. \u201cAt the very beginning they said it was very distractive. They had something they could do school work on and/or screw around on. They had to make a decision.\u201d\n\nStudents fell noticeably behind in their work during the first few weeks of the rollout, Miles said, and as their grades began to slip, an overwhelming conscious decision was made to use their iPads to stay on track rather than cave to the lure of games and the Internet. \u201cThe first few weeks they got really behind in their schoolwork. They then had to make a choice and discipline themselves.\u201d\n\nAnd even though every student in the Manitou Springs School District \u2014 which is slightly smaller than Steamboat \u2014 now has their very own iPad, only about 10 percent were broken or stolen, Miles said.\n\n\u201cIt turned out most of them had the same products of their own at home anyway,\u201d he said.\n\nMiles said the next few months will be telling as to whether or not the Steamboat Springs School District will begin phasing in something similar to what Manitou Springs implemented. There\u2019s also the option of BYOD (bring your own device), which has its own set of benefits and drawbacks.\n\nThough legalities can complicate BYOD \u2014 who is responsible for the device should something happen, the owner or district? \u2014 Miles is confident the one-to-one, BYOD or both could work locally.\n\n\u201cI think a BYOD would work great here because we have an affluent community,\u201d Miles said. \u201cI\u2019ve had calls this year that I\u2019ve never had before. \u2018I\u2019m looking to buy my kid something, what should I buy?\u2019 I\u2019ve never had that call in eight years.\u201d\n\nNo matter the affluence of families in the region, students growing up in today\u2019s digital age are the most comfortable engineers of things like iPads and Chromebooks.\n\nTheir teachers? Well, not as much, but they\u2019re learning. And the more technology the Steamboat Springs School District continues to introduce into its classrooms en route to a possible one-to-one implementation, the more the teachers must adapt.\n\n\u201cIt actually wasn\u2019t mandatory for teachers to adopt\u201d one-to-one, Miles said about districts that implemented it. \u201cEvery student would have a device, so then it was managed more so by the peer pressure. \u2018This teacher over here is doing something and I\u2019m not, so I better catch up or I\u2019m gone.\u2019\u201d \u25cf", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than ever before, Steamboat students in kindergarten through 12th grades are studying with iPads in their hands, Chromebooks on their desks and Smart Boards on their classroom walls.
