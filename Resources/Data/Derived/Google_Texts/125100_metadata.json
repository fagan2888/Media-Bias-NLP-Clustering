Women age 18-44 with income below 214 percent of the federal poverty guidelines who have no private insurance, and no Medicaid insurance, are eligible.\n\nThose who have limited health plans that do not include family planning benefits also may be eligible.\n\nThe website gives no indication the program will be ending at year\u2019s end, but women\u2019s advocates say they have been told to prepare for the program\u2019s termination. On Thursday, the Corbett administration said \u201cno final decisions have been made.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Corbett administration will not let any of these women in Pennsylvania go without access to health-care coverage \u2014 we will ensure that,\u201d said Kait Gillis, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Welfare, in an email. \u201cWe are still in conversations working through some of the issues [and] we are coordinating with the federal government on any outstanding health-care waivers, including SelectPlan.\u201d\n\nSelectPlan is not a full health insurance plan with a comprehensive range of benefits; some of those losing coverage will be eligible to reapply for new, full health-care plans under Gov. Tom Corbett\u2019s \u201cHealthy PA\u201d Medicaid overhaul. Others, who make more than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, will be able to apply for full benefits plans through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online health insurance exchanges.\n\nIn both cases, women will be able to receive tax subsidies toward their monthly premiums, and for women making less than the federal poverty limit, they won\u2019t have to pay any monthly premiums to gain Healthy PA Medicaid-style coverage.\n\nBut they might have to pay copays, and will have limits on their visits and usage. With the SelectPlan, there are no visit limits, no premiums and no co-pays, making it a valuable safety net for women.\n\n\u201cSelectPlan has been very important for low-income women who can\u2019t get family planning care any other way,\u201d said Sue Frietsche, senior staff attorney at the Women\u2019s Law Project in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe federal Medicaid waiver for the plan will expire Dec. 31.\n\nSeveral advocacy groups have said the state\u2019s Department of Public Welfare should continue to offer SelectPlan to women who are not eligible for coverage under the new Healthy PA, and should additionally automatically transition eligible women into Healthy PA, to ensure continued access to care.\n\n\u201cWhy let people\u2019s benefits expire?\u201d Ms. Frietsche said.\n\nMaking women reapply for new coverage means additional administrative costs for the state, and a likely loss of coverage for patients in the meantime, according to a briefing prepared by the left-leaning Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, Community Legal Services of Philadelphia, and the Pennsylvania Health Access Network. The groups also worry that the women will be lost in the shuffle in a time of bureaucratic chaos, as the state is also going to be trying to enroll hundreds of thousands of newly insured people into the Healthy PA program, which takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe state is automatically moving other groups of people from other categories of Medicaid coverage to the new coverage but is not doing the same for SelectPlan women, the groups say.\n\nFurthermore, since many of the women in SelectPlan initially applied for full Medicaid, or may have children in Medicaid or another assistance program, the state probably has the information it needs to transition them.\n\n\u201cDPW has a lot of information from these women,\u201d such as their income and household size, said Laval Miller-Wilson, executive director of the Pennsylvania Health Law Project.\n\nHealthy PA is the governor\u2019s alternative to a straight-up expansion of the Medicaid program; federal regulators have approved portions of the plan that would allow several hundred thousand uninsured Pennsylvanians to purchase private insurance with a federal subsidy.\n\nIt remains to be seen if it will ever become reality, however. The governor's opponent in the Nov. 4 election, Democrat Tom Wolf, who is leading in the polls, has made it clear he favors a traditional Medicaid expansion, as permitted under the federal Affordable Care Act. But if he were to win, by the time he takes office hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians may have already applied for private coverage through the Healthy PA program, making it hard to immediately undo.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some 90,000 women now receive free family planning and women\u2019s health coverage through a special Medicaid program that\u00a0will soon end.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "HARRISBURG \u2014 Some 90,000 Pennsylvania women are at risk of losing access to the free family planning and women\u2019s health-care coverage they now receive through a special Medicaid program.
