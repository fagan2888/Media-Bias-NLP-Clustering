Many best-selling brand-name products doubled in price between 2007 and 2014. And according to a recent U.S. Senate committee report, generic medications have followed suit.\n\nMaine\u2019s first-in-the-nation importation law sailed through the Legislature in 2013. It was challenged later that year, though, when groups like the Maine Pharmacy Association, the Retail Association of Maine and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America filed suit in federal court.\n\nThey claimed that allowing Maine patients to buy medications from outside the country posed a risk to public safety, because international pharmacies aren\u2019t regulated as closely as their U.S. counterparts.\n\nBut Canada, a major source of imported drugs, has its own regulatory system, with procedures found to be just as rigorous as those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. And the Safe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act \u2013 a proposal introduced for the second year in a row by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. \u2013 calls for tight oversight of purchases from Canadian pharmacies.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has also signed on to the measure, which would allow Americans with a valid prescription from a U.S.-licensed physician to order up to a 90-day supply of medicines from a licensed Canadian pharmacy. Prescription drugs would have to have the same active ingredients, dosage form and potency as medicines that are approved by the FDA.\n\nThis measure won\u2019t resolve the bigger issue: that the United States \u2013 unlike other countries \u2013 doesn\u2019t negotiate with drugmakers. So our federal government misses out on an opportunity to reach the best deal for U.S. taxpayers, who fund prescription coverage for people on Medicare. And uninsured consumers wind up paying the full cost for the drugs that they\u2019ve been prescribed, because they don\u2019t have big insurers advocating on their behalf.\n\nBut passage of the Safe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act would be a good first step toward ensuring some relief for some patients, and it deserves to be discussed and debated in Congress.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bill before the Senate addresses some of the issues that derailed Maine's importation law.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "A bill before the Senate addresses some of the issues that derailed Maine's importation law.", "title": "Our View: Congress should help ease high drug costs - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/595762_shutterstock_109343126.jpg", "height": 666}, "updated_time": "2015-02-28T01:06:09-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/02/27/our-view-congress-should-help-ease-high-drug-costs/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A bill before the Senate addresses some of the issues that derailed Maine's importation law.", "title": "Our View: Congress should help ease high drug costs - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/595762_shutterstock_109343126.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Editorials", "published_time": "2015-02-27T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T01:06:09-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Prescription drugs would have to have the same active ingredients, dosage form and potency as medicines that are approved by the FDA.\nBut a bill authorizing prescription drug importation from Canada recently was introduced in the U.S. Senate and should receive serious consideration as a sound \u2013 although temporary \u2013 solution to a longstanding problem.\nAdditional Images Many best-selling brand-name prescription drugs doubled in price between 2007 and 2014, and the cost of generic medications is climbing as well.\nAnd the Safe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act \u2013 a proposal introduced for the second year in a row by Sens.\ntxking/Shutterstock.com Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192The rising expense of medication is driving state and national efforts to allow drug imports."}
