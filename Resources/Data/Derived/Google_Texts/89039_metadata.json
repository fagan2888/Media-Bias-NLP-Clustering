Birx, The United States President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) to commemorate today\u2019s observance of HIV Vaccine Awareness Day.\n\nMay 15, 2015\n\nWith no current cure for HIV/AIDS, an HIV vaccine could be a game changer in our effort to control and end the HIV/AIDS pandemic. HIV Vaccine Awareness Day reminds us that the need for safe, effective, and affordable vaccines that can prevent HIV is urgent. A vaccine could translate into millions of lives saved through averted HIV infections and billions of dollars saved in lower treatment costs. On this HIV Vaccine Awareness Day we thank the advocates, health professionals, and scientists working together with the volunteers around the world who make this research possible and bring us one step closer to truly changing the course of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We also recognize the leadership of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director Anthony Fauci, M.D. for his dedication to HIV research and driving us toward the definitive HIV vaccine clinical trials.\n\nI spent a significant part of my career working on HIV vaccine research and know firsthand that through continued development and testing, a vaccine for HIV can be developed in our lifetime. I had the honor of working on what many consider to be the most influential HIV vaccine trial in history \u2013 \u201cHIV Vaccine Clinical Trial RV 144\u201d or the \u201cThai Trial.\u201d This clinical trial provided the first early supporting evidence of any vaccine\u2019s potential effectiveness in preventing HIV transmission. The success of RV 144 was a testament to the shared commitment by the United States and researchers around the world who worked together to explore the unknown and to answer critical questions about the virus and its transmission.\n\nSince the 2009 announcement of the results from RV 144, there have been a variety of secondary studies, public-private partnerships, and commitments to from high-HIV burden countries to continue supporting HIV vaccine trials. While this important research continues, the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, our implementing agencies, and partners will continue to work with partner countries, civil society, multilateral organizations, and others to focus our resources on the highest HIV burden areas to save lives and achieve epidemic control.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
