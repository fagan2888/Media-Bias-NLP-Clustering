While the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services predicted 80 percent of small-group plans could have been discontinued by the end of 2013, many small employers renewed policies through the end of 2014, according to the Post.\n\nHowever, insurers said they will send the bulk of small-business cancellation notices in October, ahead of the next open-enrollment period. Some small-business cancellations are due to policies that fail to meet Affordable Care Act requirements, others stem from insurers consolidating their plan offerings to maximize profits and streamline operations, the article noted. In Colorado, for example, small-group plans covering a total of 143,000 workers will get discontinued in 2014.\n\nMost small businesses will experience a \"labeling issue.\" That means businesses can shift to similar plans at similar prices with the same insurers but the plans may have different names, Jonathan Gruber, a key architect of the ACA and a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told the Post.\n\nAnd some small businesses can qualify for new tax credits to help cover the cost of health insurance, the Post noted.\n\nCompanies that purchase health insurance on the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) marketplace, which is available to businesses with 50 or fewer employees, can obtain a small business tax credit, according to a new FAQ from Westfair Online. The smaller the employer and the lower the average wage, the greater the tax credit.\n\nThe small-business cancellations come as some small businesses consider shifting their sickest, most expensive-to-insure employees to health insurance exchanges. But that strategy could threaten the viability of the online marketplaces by inflating the amount of sick and costly consumers shopping for health plans, FierceHealthPayer previously reported.\n\nFor more:\n\n- read the Post article\n\n- here's the small employer FAQ\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n2014 begins with slew of reform taxes for insurers\n\nSmall businesses consider shifting sickest workers to exchanges\n\n2014 Preview: What's in store for health insurers\n\nMyth or fact?
