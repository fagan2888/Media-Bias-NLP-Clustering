Committee chair \u2013Republican John Kline of Minnesota says it will give parents more school choice and eliminates unnecessary federal programs.\n\n\u201c[HR 5] empowers parents with more school choice options by continuing support for magnet schools and expanding charter school opportunities, as well as allowing Title I funds to follow low-income children to the traditional public or charter school of the parent\u2019s choice.\u201d\n\nThe one Ohioan on the House Education committee, is ranking Democrat Marcia Fudge who voted against it.\n\n\u201cIt is tragic that students in Cleveland and in poor school districts throughout the nation will suffer as a result of H.R. 5. I believe it is no accident this legislation weakens public education and siphons resources from poor school districts and reallocates them to wealthier school districts. We are failing a generation of young people. Those who voted for it should be ashamed.\u201d\n\nFudge also said the \u201caction will disproportionally harm many disadvantaged low income students.\u201d\n\nThe head of the White House Domestic Policy Council, Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz agrees.\n\n\u201cSame thing is true for Cleveland which would lose 25.8% of its funding compared to a community like Shaker Hts which would see an increase of 21.6% of its funding. This approach is backward and our teachers and kids deserve much much better.\u201d\n\nThat would be a $14.1 million dollar loss for Cleveland. Columbus would lose 25.1% or $11.8 million and Cincinnati would drop $5.1 million. The full House is expected to pass it while the Senate is working on a more bi-partisan version. Munoz would not say whether the President would veto it", "article_metadata": {"description": "The White House warned today (Fri) that some big school districts in Ohio will see a cut-back in federal funding if a new House bill becomes law.
