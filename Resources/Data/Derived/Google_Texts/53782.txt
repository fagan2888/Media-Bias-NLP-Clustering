Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker hit back at President Obama’s suggestion a few months ago that the governor “bone up” on foreign policy in part of a recent back-and-forth between the two leaders.

“I thought it was interesting for the president to say that the guy who called ISIS the JV squad and Yemen a success story somehow suggesting someone else should bone up in foreign policy,” Mr. Walker said on ABC’s “This Week.”

Mr. Walker, a potential 2016 GOP presidential contender, pointed to his recent trip to Israel and that he’s talked to British Prime Minister David Cameron.

“My belief is if I’m going to — if I’m even thinking about running for president of the United States, it’s not about preparing for debates, it’s about being prepared to be the president of the United States,” he said.

Mr. Obama also hit Mr. Walker, though not by name, in March after Wisconsin passed right-to-work legislation.

Mr. Walker, who has not yet officially declared his 2016 candidacy, told Breitbart in March that such singling out “suggests maybe we’re the frontrunner,” but on Sunday, the governor was comfortable ceding that title on the Republican side to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is announcing his 2016 plans next week.
