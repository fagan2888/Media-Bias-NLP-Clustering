(Or \"individual shared responsibility provision,\" as the Affordable Care Act calls it.)\n\nIt's a simple concept, right? Get too much subsidy last year, pay some of it back; get too little, get a bit more to make up for that.\n\nYet calculating which category you're in can plunge low-earning taxpayers - who typically are less likely to itemize deductions - deep into the weeds of bewildering tax forms.\n\nIn this case, it's Form 8962. Roughly 80 percent of the 162,000 New Jerseyans who purchased policies through the the healthcare.gov marketplace will have to fill it out.\n\nThe folks at H&R Block offered the following tips:\n\n\u2014 Take a deep breath and consider filing for an extension. Because the feds messed up and sent erroneous forms to 800,000 taxpayers, they're waiving the usual penalty for late payment of taxes, said Lindsey Buchholz, principal tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block in Kansas City.\n\nYou still have to file an extension by April 15th - that requirement isn't waived - and make a good faith effort to pay what you think you may owe. But if you don't have the right documents or if you think your documents wrong and you want time to correct them, go for the extension.\n\n\u2014 Before you start, make sure you have Form 1095-A, which the government should have sent you earlier in the year. It lists how much you received in subsidies last year, month by month. If you're one of the taxpayers who received an incorrect form, you were most likely notified by telephone call and by mail, and should have received a corrected form by now.\n\n\u2014 Consider using tax prep software or a tax preparer. Yes, that's an indirect plug for outfits like H&R Block, but Buchholz points out software automatically calculates the answer from instructions such as, \"Divide line 3 by line 4. Enter the result rounded to the nearest whole percentage. For example, for 1.542 enter 154.\" It's already bad enough you have to do your taxes; don't turn the experience into the SATs.\n\n\u2014 Come to grips with the notion that your \"tax family\" is not your \"health insurance family.\" Buchholz points out that parents can now provide coverage to their young adult children through the parent's policy. That's not the same as being able to claim them as an overall dependent, though. \"Those two things do not always line up one to one,\" she said. \"A lot of people don't understand that those two things are different.\"\n\n\u2014 If you had a change in family circumstances last year, brace yourself for some rough sledding. Let's say you thought your children would be your dependents, but they ended up living with an ex-spouse. Or let's say your college-age son ended up getting a full-time job with benefits.\n\n\"People in those situations were particularly confused,\" Buchholz said.\n\n\u2014 Finally, don't try to fudge it. When it comes to health insurance subsidies, the IRS has real-time - as in \"right now\" - data on how much you received in subsidies, as well as what you indicated was your family size and likely income. If you submit a tax return that varies substantially from that, an IRS computer somewhere will spit your return into the pile that deserves an extra look, Buchholz said. Even if your return is scrupulously accurate, this will slow down its processing.\n\n\"They can double-check your facts and figures pretty easily on this one,\" she said. \"There's no human interaction. It's just looking to see if things line up. They can pretty quickly determine if your return is not remotely looking like it should.\"\n\nKathleen O'Brien may be reached at kobrien@njadvancemedia.com, or at (732) 902-4557.
