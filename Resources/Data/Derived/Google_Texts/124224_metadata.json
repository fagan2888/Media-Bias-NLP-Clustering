Bobby Jindal, hoping that a push for education reform can set him apart among prospective Republican candidates for president, today begins to tout a national plan he says would create \u201can ecosystem of freedom and choice\u201d for parents, students and teachers.\n\nHis proposals, Jindal says in the plan to be released this morning, would push the public education system out of \u201ca rut\u201d it has been stuck in for 50 years because of Washington\u2019s ever-increasing involvement, which he sees as holding back generations of children.\n\n\u201cReform along the principles outlined in this paper will restore the balance in education toward parents and teachers, and away from the bureaucracies that stand as obstacles to change,\u201d Jindal says in the introduction to the plan, a copy of which was obtained by The Daily Signal. \u201cMost importantly, it will give parents the power to choose from among many quality educational options, instead of taking away their power by keeping children in poor-performing schools.\u201d\n\nThe bulk of the 42-page \u201cK-12 Education Reform: a Roadmap\u201d is divided into three sections devoted to what it calls the principles of parent choice, limited government and educator freedom.\n\nIn his introduction, Jindal emphasizes these guiding approaches:\n\nAllowing education dollars to \u201cfollow the child,\u201d meaning to be used as parents and families deem best inside or outside conventional \u201cgovernment schools\u201d \u2014 and including online learning and homeschooling.\n\nReforming teacher tenure laws: \u201cWe must get out of the mode of paying teachers for how long they have been breathing. \u2026 Good teachers need to be rewarded, and underperforming teachers need to be put on notice, and ultimately dismissed if they do not improve.\u201d\n\nRejecting the \u201cnational curriculum\u201d created by Common Core education standards and returning education decisions to the local level: \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that the federal government has begun tying compliance with Common Core to federal funds, but once you see the methods and the homework that accompanies Common Core, the verdict is in: Common Core must go.\u201d\n\nThe Jindal plan concludes the nation must heed, in addition to pressing economic and fiscal considerations for reform, \u201ca moral imperative to provide a quality education to each child.\u201d\n\nGovernment spending on public education is more than three times what it was in 1970, the Jindal plan notes, yet the \u201csad truth\u201d is that U.S. children continue to emerge as \u201cmediocre at best\u201d compared with other developed nations on the world stage.\n\nEven as Jindal again condemned Common Core standards last week in a speech to the American Principles Project in Washington, D.C., CNN reported that critics note Louisiana\u2019s school system continues to lag behind nearly every other state in K-12 achievement. The state finished 49th in an annual report from Education Week.\n\nJindal\u2019s national education reform plan calls for partnering educators with the private sector to update training and certification, and for \u201cunbundling\u201d a school system\u2019s education dollars to meet children\u2019s individual needs.\n\nCiting evidence of growing school choice in Louisiana, the plan urges states to create and expand scholarship programs, establish education savings accounts, cut regulations on both private and public schools, put parents in charge of special education and do more to encourage charter schools.\n\nThe plan emphatically calls on states to repeal Common Core and \u201crestore\u201d state and local standards, an issue that has put Jindal at odds in court with Louisiana\u2019s school superintendent and school board.\n\n>>> How Bobby Jindal\u2019s 7-Year-Old Son Outsmarted Common Core\n\nThe governor, who switched from supporting Common Core to seeking to pull his state from participating, recently sued the federal government over the issue.\n\nThe Jindal plan argues for reduced federal \u201cmeddling\u201d and promotes control at the local level, as well as eliminating duplicative or coercive federal programs, reducing government data collection and restoring student privacy rights in such data gathering, and improving the flow of information to parents.\n\nIt also calls for higher academic requirements for prospective teachers, evaluating and overhauling teacher preparation by emphasizing subject matter rather than general education, and repealing state and federal mandates for teacher certification.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about providing more opportunities for Americans to maximize their happiness and pursue their dreams.\u201d-@BobbyJindal\n\nThe plan proposes experimenting with more \u201cpractical\u201d teacher evaluations at the local level, doing away with \u201clifetime job guarantees\u201d for teachers, ending forced membership in teacher unions, and restricting collective bargaining to salaries rather than matters such as classroom temperature and the size of bulletin boards.\n\nOther proposals include giving principals control over their own staffs and budgets, cutting laws and rules that restrict innovation, and eliminating most federal curriculum mandates and incentives that aim to bend state programs toward national models.\n\nJindal\u2019s America Next political action committee posted the education paper this morning.\n\nThe Republican governor was set to introduce the details in two meetings today with reporters in Washington, D.C. \u2013 one at the regular newsmakers breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor, the other at a lunch at The Heritage Foundation co-hosted by The Daily Signal, the think tank\u2019s multimedia news organization.\n\nUpdates: Between the two briefings, Jindal stopped by a daylong forum on school choice on Capitol Hill sponsored by Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., where he participated in the initial panel discussion.\n\nOne positive early review of the Jindal plan came from Lindsey M. Burke, Heritage\u2019s Will Skillman fellow in education policy, who found it focused on \u201creturning dollars and decision-making back to states and local leaders.\u201d The plan cites two of Burke\u2019s research papers.\n\n\u201cHis proposal, critically, leads with parental choice,\u201d Burke told The Daily Signal. \u201cIt includes smart policy such as eliminating assignment-by-Zip code policies, having dollars follow students to educational options of choice, and unbundling education financing from the delivery of services. And it supports the most innovative education choice option to date: education savings accounts. ESAs empower parents with the ability to direct every dollar of their child\u2019s state education funding to services and products of choice, and represent the next generation of school choice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Louisiana governor, pondering a White House run, releases a plan to reform K-12 education by giving more freedom to educators and parents.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Louisiana governor, pondering a White House run, releases a plan to reform K-12 education by giving more freedom to educators and parents.", "title": "Jindal Education Plan Stresses Choice", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-02-06-at-5.05.22-PM.png", "updated_time": "2015-02-10T14:03:33+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1vcdxlz"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Louisiana governor, pondering a White House run, releases a plan to reform K-12 education by giving more freedom to educators and parents.", "title": "Jindal Education Plan Stresses Choice", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-02-06-at-5.05.22-PM.png"}, "creator": "@KenMac55", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "2016,common core", "published_time": "2015-02-09T08:30:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-10T14:03:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bobby Jindal president, Bobby Jindal education reform, Bobby Jindal Common Core, Bobby Jindal school choice, Bobby Jindal charter schools"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4092\"", "article_summary": "And it supports the most innovative education choice option to date: education savings accounts.\nESAs empower parents with the ability to direct every dollar of their child\u2019s state education funding to services and products of choice, and represent the next generation of school choice.\u201d\nJindal\u2019s national education reform plan calls for partnering educators with the private sector to update training and certification, and for \u201cunbundling\u201d a school system\u2019s education dollars to meet children\u2019s individual needs.\nUpdates: Between the two briefings, Jindal stopped by a daylong forum on school choice on Capitol Hill sponsored by Sen.
