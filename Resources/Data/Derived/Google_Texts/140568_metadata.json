Bobby Jindal is slamming politicians in Indiana and Arkansas for a \u201cretreat\u201d on so-called religious freedom legislation and says he isn\u2019t going to be pressured by corporate America into backing off of his support for similar legislation in his home state on the issue of marriage.\n\n\u201cIn Indiana and Arkansas, large corporations recently joined left-wing activists to bully elected officials into backing away from strong protections for religious liberty,\u201d Mr. Jindal wrote in an opinion piece published Thursday by The New York Times. \u201cIt was disappointing to see conservative leaders so hastily retreat on legislation that would simply allow for an individual or business to claim a right to free exercise of religion in a court of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat political leaders in both states quickly cowered amid the shrieks of big business and the radical left should alarm us all,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMr. Jindal, who is weighing a 2016 presidential run, said he won\u2019t be bullied and that he plans to fight in the state\u2019s legislative session for the \u201cMarriage and Conscience Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe legislation would prohibit the state from denying a person, company or nonprofit group a license, accreditation, employment or contract \u2014 or taking other \u2018adverse action\u2019 \u2014 based on the person or entity\u2019s religious views on the institution of marriage,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMr. Jindal said he\u2019s already been contacted by corporations who have asked him to oppose the law, but he said he will not be deterred.\n\n\u201cAs a nation we would not compel a priest, minister or rabbi to violate his conscience and perform a same-sex wedding ceremony,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut a great many Americans who are not members of the clergy feel just as called to live their faith through their businesses. That\u2019s why we should ensure that musicians, caterers, photographers and others should be immune from government coercion on deeply held religious convictions.\u201d\n\nThe bill does not provide a \u201cright to discriminate,\u201d as critics of such laws say, but \u201cmerely makes our constitutional freedom so well defined that no judge can miss it,\u201d Mr. Jindal wrote.\n\nHe acknowledged polls that indicate Americans\u2019 views on gay marriage are changing, but said he will not change his \u201cfaith-driven view\u201d that marriage is between one man and one woman, \u201ceven if it becomes a minority opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who believe in freedom must stick together: If it\u2019s not freedom for all, it\u2019s not freedom at all. This strategy requires populist social conservatives to ally with the business community on economic matters and corporate titans to side with social conservatives on cultural matters. This is the grand bargain that makes freedom\u2019s defense possible,\u201d he concluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louisiana Gov.
