Employees\u2019 satisfaction with their agencies fell three points from last year, to 58.8 on a scale of 100.\n\nRelated: Federal Workers Organize to Block Sequester\n\nMax Stier, PPS president and CEO, called the numbers \u201cdistressing\u201d and \u201can unwelcome reminder\u201d of the poor management within the federal government that \u201chas made for a toxic work environment.\u201d\n\nThe 169,000 employees at the Department of Homeland Security were the most dissatisfied with their agency, which consistently ranks near the bottom of the \u201cBest Places to Work\u201d list.\n\nDHS\u2019s poor morale is nothing new and the agency has been the subject of countless congressional hearings. Last week, Rep. Mike McCaul (R-TX), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, blamed DHS\u2019s unhappy employees on leadership vacancies within the agency. Currently about 40 percent of all politically appointed positions are vacant.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, these vacancies have a negative impact on mission effectiveness and employees\u2019 morale,\u201d McCaul said during a committee hearing.\n\nRelated: DHS Winks at Workers Stealing Overtime\n\nMarsha Catron, a DHS spokeswoman, said the agency is focused on improving employee engagement through enhanced communication and training.\n\n\u201cThe department\u2019s employees are our greatest resource and we are committed to providing them with the resources and support they need to carry out our mission to protect the homeland,\u201d Catron said.\n\nBut the results from the employee survey seem to disagree.\n\nStier says management issues are to blame for the agency\u2019s persistently dismal performance. That seems to be true for all agencies, based on the index, which shows that employees value \u201ceffective management\u201d the most over things like pay and work/life balance, among others. Still, it was the lowest-rated category agency wide, with a score of 51.8.\n\nFederal Execs Get Bonuses Despite Worker Furloughs\n\nStier pointed to Obamacare\u2019s rocky rollout, which was plagued by a host of technical problems with the website, as well as management issues with federal contractors. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but look at things like the HealthCare.gov website and wonder if with a better managed workforce that would have happened,\u201d he said.\n\nOther agencies that landed with a thud near the bottom of the rankings were the Agriculture Department, with 56.1, the Army with 55.6, and the Labor Department with 55.6.\n\nFor all of the dismal news in the report, there were several bright spots. Despite suffering from massive cuts to its space program, NASA managed to score the coveted \u201cbest places to work\u201d position for the second year in a row, as well as \u201cmost improved agency.\u201d\n\nStier credited the space agency\u2019s performance to solid management and employee engagement. \u201cNASA is continuously excelling at meeting management expectations and overcoming difficulties brought on by budget cuts,\u201d Stier said.\n\nThe government\u2019s happiest agency paid 20 people $18,000 to lie around for 70 days this year, as part of a bed rest study to simulate the effects of long-duration spaceflight. It also awarded a $200,000 grant to a contractor to create a 3D pizza printer.\n\nHere are some highlights from the report:\n\nWorst Federal Agencies to Work for:\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Labor Department ARMY Agriculture Department Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Defense Agencies, and Department of Defense Field Activities\n\nBest Federal Agencies to Work for:\n\nNASA Commerce Department Intelligence Community State Department Department of Justice\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After this year\u2019s budget cuts, employee furloughs, and a 16-day government shutdown, i", "title": "Homeland Security Has the Worst Worker Morale ...
