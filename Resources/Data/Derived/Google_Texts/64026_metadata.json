My new candy-land colleagues walk about chewing, murmuring, occasionally grimacing. They punch ratings into computer tablets, scoring the marketability, price points and deliciousness of each product.\n\nWe take joy where we find it in life, and I\u2019ve almost always found joy in candy. Unwrapping a frozen Charleston Chew, biting into the sweet-salty perfection of a Reese\u2019s peanut butter cup or daintily consuming a handful of unjustly maligned candy corn reaffirms the world\u2019s wonder for me.\n\nWhen the candymakers tell me their product is about fun and pleasure, I want to be one of them.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nAnd yet America is a nation of scale-busters. Two out of every three of us are overweight. We\u2019re No. 1 with a bullet on the world\u2019s obesity chart, and no one is catching us anytime soon. A sugar-fueled diabetes epidemic looms.\n\nPublic health advocates long ago took notice of this rising fat and sugar tide and have pushed for changes to stem a health disaster. Soda companies have come under siege; trans-fats were punished into near oblivion. The phrase \u201chigh-fructose corn syrup\u201d is now uttered with lip-curling contempt.\n\nANTI-SUGAR LOBBY\n\nAmerica\u2019s candymakers insist that they aren\u2019t the problem. They point out that Americans get only 2 percent of their daily calories from candy. They argue that Americans understand that candy is a treat to be eaten in moderation. They state that candy can be a part of a balanced diet.\n\nAnd that may all be true, but the candymakers also sense that sugar is public health enemy No. 1. The health advocates and regulators who went after soda and trans-fats now have candy in their crosshairs.\n\nFor 15 years, Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, has been pushing hard on the anti-sugar front. She worked with a large coalition to bring about the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010, which brought vast changes to nutrition requirements at all schools that get federal funding.\n\nA portion of the law that went into effect last month required that all candy, sugary drinks and non-nutritional snacks be removed from school cafeterias and vending machines.\n\n\u201cBy taking candy out of schools we\u2019re saying candy is not an everyday food, and it\u2019s something you should be eating a lot less of,\u201d Wootan says.\n\nFor a few advocates, the law didn\u2019t go far enough, but with its passage, the anti-sugar forces had notched their first significant piece of legislation.\n\nTHE CHECKOUT LANE\n\nWootan doesn\u2019t want to see the sugar-removal effort stop at the boundaries of schools and public buildings. She is preparing a campaign to rid candy and unhealthy snacks from all checkout aisles of grocery and convenience stores.\n\nThis strategy is borrowed from Great Britain, where earlier this year Tesco, the United Kingdom\u2019s largest supermarket and convenience store chain, announced it would remove all candy at checkouts. Other U.K. chains are doing the same, says Malcolm Clark, coordinator of the London-based Children\u2019s Food Campaign.\n\nCould candy removal work on this side of the Atlantic? Currently, most supermarkets in the United States have one or two checkout lanes where candy is not sold. Those are mostly intended for parents who have small children and don\u2019t want to endure the ruthless negotiating of 4-yearolds.\n\nBut Wootan isn\u2019t just worried about whiny kids; she\u2019s also thinking about weak-willed grown-ups.\n\n\u201cCompanies know that at the end of a shop, your willpower is at a very low point, and then they assault you with this huge display of candy, knowing that it will induce impulse buying,\u201d she says. \u201cPushing people to buy food that they didn\u2019t want, that is going to harm their health, just doesn\u2019t seem appropriate, given the high rates of obesity.\u201d\n\nOf course, the idea of restricting choice simply because Americans may not want to make a healthy choice is not roundly popular, particularly not with . . . Americans.\n\nTHE CASE FOR SUGAR\n\nJohn Downs took the reins this year as the National Confectioners Association\u2019s new chief executive. Sitting on a couch in his executive suite, the former Coca-Cola executive sips from a Diet Coke and makes candy\u2019s argument against regulation.\n\n\u201cThere is so much negative publicity around sugar,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to do a better job, obviously, in articulating our case in the role that candy plays in a balanced lifestyle. . . . I think our message is clear. It\u2019s about balance and moderation.\u201d\n\nThe health and wellness issue is a sensitive topic, and candymakers have become accustomed to playing defense and occasionally giving ground. When criticized for aiming television advertising at children, most candymakers agreed to pull back. Brands have also created sugar-free offerings and reduced portion sizes.\n\nBut candy can change only so much before it stops being candy. And the NCA is pushing back against demands to further limit its marketing or availability to customers. Removing candy from all checkout aisles would be a blow to the industry.\n\n\u201cThe majority of consumers don\u2019t want government to restrict their access to food; they want education around how to consume indulgent foods,\u201d says Alison Bodor, the NCA\u2019s executive vice president. \u201cEven dietitians will say there\u2019s a role for candy in the diet, albeit a small one. And we\u2019re all fine with that. We agree. But removing access or trying to remove choice is an unfortunate outcome, and I think most consumers reject that policy and feel that they can make that decision themselves.\u201d\n\nA CANDIFIED WORLD\n\nDavid Kessler, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, wrote the 2012 book \u201cYour Food Is Fooling You: How Your Brain Is Hijacked by Sugar, Fat and Salt.\u201d\n\nKessler emphasizes that the issue is not simply candy.\n\n\u201cThe issue is that all of our food has been candified,\u201d he says. The danger occurs \u201cwhen you make everything into candy, and you load and layer fat, sugar and salt into everything, and then you eat that constantly.\u201d\n\nIf that sounds like alarmist hyperbole, consider a 2012 historical study of sugar consumption in America by obesity researchers Stephan Guyenet and Jeremy Landen. They concluded that in 1900 the average American consumed just over 40 pounds of sugar a year. By 2005 that had increased to just under 100 pounds.\n\nDiving deeper, the pair determined that in 1822 Americans ate the amount of added sugar in a 12-ounce soda every five days. In 2012, that same amount was consumed every seven hours.\n\n\u201cWhat changed?\u201d Kessler asks. \u201cWe would occasionally have candy. Now we have the equivalent of candy all the time, and you can\u2019t walk more than 100 feet in any direction from where you are, certainly in any city, and not be affected by some food or food cue.\u201d\n\nGovernment has a role, but what doesn\u2019t work, he insists, is instituting laws to change consumption patterns.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about regulation or litigation or legislation,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is really about changing social norms. But let\u2019s not fool ourselves; government is a helpful tool in changing social norms. . . . What did we really do when it came to smoking? We demonized the product. We changed the social norm.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to make candy seem menacing. Even Wootan, the industry critic, says, \u201cIf anyone tried to ban chocolate, I would be the first one up in arms to oppose it.\u201d\n\nCandy is simply the visible tip of the sugar iceberg and the easiest place to focus concern about the warped presence that sweetness has assumed in America\u2019s diet. Preaching moderation and exercise hasn\u2019t worked, and the pounds keep accumulating.\n\nINSIDE THAT M&M\n\nM&Ms are a marvel of engineering and taste. Like space exploration, Michael Jackson and the cure for polio, the very existence of M&Ms points to America\u2019s greatness and ingenuity. From my dead hands they will pry not a gun, but a bag of unmelted M&Ms.\n\nSo it pains me to use M&Ms as an example, but one ordinary-size packet (1.69 ounces) contains 31 grams of sugar. This year, the World Health Organization recommended that sugar consumption should equal no more than 5 percent of your daily caloric intake. For the average adult, that\u2019s about 25 grams of added sugar per day. The WHO isn\u2019t just worried about the 69 percent of Americans who are overweight or obese. Diabetes and obesity are rapidly becoming a global concern.\n\nMy packet of M& Ms already exceeds 25 grams of sugar. If on a day that I eat the M& Ms I also have a 12-ounce Coke (39 grams of sugar), a one-cup bowl of Raisin Bran Crunch (19 grams), one serving of Campbell\u2019s tomato soup (12 grams) and a 6-inch turkey sub from Subway (7 grams), that puts me at 108 grams of sugar, or over 400 percent of the WHO\u2019s daily recommendation.\n\nAnd that\u2019s in 950 calories.\n\nSo either the WHO\u2019s recommendation is ridiculously low or much of the reason the world is getting so fat \u2014 and not just fat, but sick \u2014 is that we\u2019re swimming in an ocean of sugar and don\u2019t even realize it.\n\n\u2013 Joe Heim, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/11/shutterstock_130144298.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf52a\"", "article_summary": "The health advocates and regulators who went after soda and trans-fats now have candy in their crosshairs.\n\u201cBy taking candy out of schools we\u2019re saying candy is not an everyday food, and it\u2019s something you should be eating a lot less of,\u201d Wootan says.\nBut candy can change only so much before it stops being candy.\nShe is preparing a campaign to rid candy and unhealthy snacks from all checkout aisles of grocery and convenience stores.\nMy reporting would be incomplete if I did not also tell you there is a new candy called Sour Farts."}
