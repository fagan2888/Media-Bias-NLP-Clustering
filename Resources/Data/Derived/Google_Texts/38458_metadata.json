The pair attended a Mariah Carey concert together on the eve of their semifinal.\n\n\u201cIt was the first match I didn\u2019t feel great \u2014 if you take (sister) Venus out of the equation \u2014 where I wasn\u2019t happy after I won,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to cry because Caro is so nice, we get along and we do so much together. She\u2019s like my little baby sister, from a different mother, and father, and different country.\u201d\n\nWozniacki reciprocated the affection, but being on the losing end of a 10-1 career record against the American meant she wanted to see less of the world No. 1.\n\n\u201cI told Serena \u2018Can you just leave me alone? I love you, but stay away from the other side of the court. Quite frankly I\u2019m sick of losing to you,\u201d Wozniacki said.\n\nTwice before this year, Williams had to come back from a set down to beat the Dane and she again made a slow start, taking only three points off Wozniacki\u2019s serve in the opening set and the frustration showed. After the seventh game, she repeatedly smashed her racket into the court, bringing a warning from the chair umpire.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I hit it but, boy, that racket will never do me wrong again I tell you,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt was definitely legendary. I kind of lost my cool a little bit.\u201d\n\nWozniacki, who had a perfect 3-0 record in the group stage, took the opening set in 26 minutes and held serve to open the second.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Serena Williams beats Wozniacki to reach WTA final", "title": "Serena Williams beats Wozniacki to reach WTA final", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Serena Williams beats Wozniacki to reach WTA final", "title": "Serena Williams beats Wozniacki to reach WTA final", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/25/serena_williams_beats_wozniacki_to_reach_wta_final/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/singapore-wta-finals.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Serena Williams beats Wozniacki to reach WTA final", "title": "Serena Williams beats Wozniacki to reach WTA final", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/singapore-wta-finals.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chris Lines", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4841\"", "article_summary": "It was a bittersweet win for Williams, who has developed a close off-court friendship with Wozniacki.\nWozniacki served for the match at 5-4 in the third set, but Williams broke back and prevailed in the tiebreaker on her third match point after trailing 4-1.\nWilliams beat Caroline Wozniacki in a thrilling contest 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (6) to remain on course for a third-straight title, while Halep swept aside Agnieszka Radwanska 6-2, 6-2 to put herself in a position for the biggest title of her career.\nHalep beat Williams 6-0, 6-2 in the group stage, inflicting the American\u2019s heaviest loss in 16 years, and the Romanian has been the form player of the tournament, dropping only 27 games across four matches against top-eight-ranked opponents.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I hit it but, boy, that racket will never do me wrong again I tell you,\u201d Williams said."}
