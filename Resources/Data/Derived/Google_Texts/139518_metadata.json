What we have now because we have real terrible war,\" Mokhnenko said.\n\nThe Pastor from Ukraine searches the streets for homeless children struggling with substance abuse. His church has 30 rehab centers for both kids and adults. Many of the children later become a member of his family.\n\n\"Little bit strange family because I have 3 biological children and 32 adopted children,\" Mokhnenko said.\n\nAs his family continues to grow, so does the danger. Russian troops are on the ground near Mokhnenko's hometown in Mariupol. He recalls a story where a 75-year-old man was visited by his son and his family. The man left the house to close his garage door.\n\n\"It was just two seconds and rockets, Russian rockets came and killed all his family, all his family,\" Mokhnenko said.\n\nIt's violence he wants to see stopped, which is why he's bringing his message across the globe.\n\nThe pastor is in Sioux Falls for two days. He's spreading his message of the violence in Ukraine to youth groups.\n\n\"I want to say special thanks for American people who are thinking about my country who pray about my country,\" Mokhnenko said.\n\nHis voice is about to be heard on a larger scale. A documentary, called Crocodile Gennadiy recently played at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. A film crew followed Mokhnenko for two and half years to illustrate the hardships in Ukraine.\n\n\"It's not a cinema for popcorn and Coca-Cola and to relax. It's a very hard experience,\" Mokhnenko said.\n\nAn experience the pastor wants everyone to see. He will continue to fight to get that message heard, no matter where he is in the country.\n\nMany of the pastor's adopted children call him Pastor Crocodile. It's a name for a Russian Cartoon, where a Crocodile goes around saving children.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
