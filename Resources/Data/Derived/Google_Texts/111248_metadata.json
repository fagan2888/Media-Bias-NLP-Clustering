Should you brush for 30 seconds, or over a minute? How much toothpaste should you use, and should you rinse with water afterwards?\n\nWe brush our teeth daily, but probably rarely think about the \u201ccorrect\u201d way to complete this mundane routine. The fact is, nobody really knows what the best way to brush your teeth is \u2014 not even dental professionals themselves. That\u2019s what the authors of a new study out of the University College London state, at least.\n\nPublished in the British Dental Journal, the study reviewed various dental professionals\u2019 advice on how to brush your teeth \u2014 across ten countries. The researchers reviewed what dental associations and dental textbooks all had to say. The consensus was that there seemed to be a lot of conflicting information about brushing teeth, often leaving consumers and patients confused. \u201cThe public needs to have sound information on the best method to brush their teeth,\u201d Aubrey Sheiham, Emeritus Professor of Dental Public Health at University College London and senior author of the study, said. \u201cIf people hear one thing from a dental association, another from a toothbrush company and something else from their dentist, no wonder they are confused about how to brush. In this study we found an unacceptably inconsistent array of advice from different sources.\u201d Sheiham argues that dental associations need to be more consistent about which method works best.\n\nIn the study, the researchers found a variety of recommendations \u2014 some dentists advised brushing twice a day, while others said it should be three times. Some recommended to brush at a 45 degree angle, while others said that vertical movements rather than horizontal ones were most effective. As for the length of time, some dentists suggested to brush for two minutes; others claimed three minutes was optimal.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that complicated methods work any better than a \u201csimple gentle scrub,\u201d Sheiham says. Overall, research is lacking on which technique is best \u2014 which is most likely why so many people disagree over the topic. Sheiham recommends to \u201cbrush gently with a simple horizontal scrubbing motion, with the brush at a forty-five degree angle to get to the dental plaque. To avoid brushing too hard, hold the brush with a pencil grip rather than a fist. This simple method is perfectly effective at keeping your gums healthy.\u201d\n\nOther dentists, like Dr. John Wainwright, another co-author of the study, suggests \u201cto focus [your] brushing on areas where plaque is most likely to collect \u2014 the biting surfaces and where the teeth and gums meet \u2014 and to use a gentle scrubbing motion.\u201d\n\nUntil a solid study is completed to identify the most effective brushing method, it appears that for the most part it\u2019s a \u201cto each his own\u201d case. Brush for longer than a minute, brush gently and consistently, at least twice a day, and target plaque-y areas \u2014 and you should be good.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "best way to brush teeth, brushing teeth, dentist", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "No one really knows what the most effective way to brush your teeth is, but following this advice could help you keep your smile clean.", "title": "The Best Way To Brush Your Teeth, According to Science", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/most-dentists-cant-choose-best-way-brush-your-teeth-keep-your-smile-white-advice-297238", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/brushing-your-teeth.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No one really knows what the most effective way to brush your teeth is, but following this advice could help you keep your smile clean.", "title": "The Best Way To Brush Your Teeth, According to Science", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/most-dentists-cant-choose-best-way-brush-your-teeth-keep-your-smile-white-advice-297238", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/brushing-your-teeth.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/brushing-your-teeth.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-08T14:50:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-08T14:50:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "No one really knows what the most effective way to brush your teeth is, but following this advice could help you keep your smile clean."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1427\"", "article_summary": "The fact is, nobody really knows what the best way to brush your teeth is \u2014 not even dental professionals themselves.\nDentists can't seem to come to an agreement regarding the best way to brush teeth, but if you stick to a 2-minute brush involving of gentle scrubbing that targets plaque areas, you should be set.\nThe consensus was that there seemed to be a lot of conflicting information about brushing teeth, often leaving consumers and patients confused.\nPublished in the British Dental Journal, the study reviewed various dental professionals\u2019 advice on how to brush your teeth \u2014 across ten countries.\nWe brush our teeth daily, but probably rarely think about the \u201ccorrect\u201d way to complete this mundane routine."}
