President Barack Obama remains extremely unpopular (private polling shows him nearing a 65 percent disapproval rating), and news items ranging from gay marriage to Planned Parenthood are firing up an already conservative Kentucky electorate. Nothing has happened since Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s blowout win last November to improve the atmospherics for Democrats, and a strong argument can be made that they are actually worse. Many Kentuckians look disdainfully at the nation\u2019s leftward cultural tilt and pin the blame squarely on the man in the White House. As one person put it to me: \u201cKentucky voters are dying for another chance to stick it to Obama.\u201d\n\nThe one environmental factor helping Conway comes in the \u201cright track/wrong track\u201d questions that comes standard in political polling. A vast majority of Kentuckians think the nation is on the wrong track, but voters appear split on whether Kentucky is. Democrats are hoping Kentuckians have a healthier view of Frankfort than they do of Washington as they attempt to separate Conway from Obama.\n\nPolling. The last public poll \u2014 Survey USA\u2019s Bluegrass Poll, taken in late July \u2014 showed Conway leading Bevin 45 percent to 42 percent, but it may have been overweighted with self-identified Democrats. Most observers believe the race remains close if not a dead heat. Republicans think they have the advantage among the likeliest voters, and Democrats believe they have severely damaged Bevin\u2019s image with their summer onslaught of negative advertising.\n\nAir War. A review of television ad spending by an industry source shows that Democrats have outspent Republicans since the May primary. The chief GOP advertising vehicle has been the Republican Governors Association (RGA), which has spent $2 million over the last 10 weeks attacking Conway. The RGA showed nimbleness in July, popping its first ad a mere 12 hours after Conway\u2019s campaign had done the same. The RGA ought to be on Bevin\u2019s Christmas card list for the rest of his life, as it saved his campaign from an early demise.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Conway and aligned independent groups have spent about $3 million on television, some positive and some negative. Democrats tout Conway\u2019s use of coal-focused regional ads in Eastern Kentucky as evidence they learned a lesson from McConnell\u2019s shellacking of Alison Grimes in that part of the state.\n\nRepublicans argue that Democrats have had to vastly outspend them just to keep Conway competitive, and that their spending advantage will dissipate when Bevin finally goes on the air to bolster what the RGA is already doing. The RGA on Friday placed another $1 million ad buy and Bevin\u2019s campaign appears to be going up on TV soon, perhaps indicating that Bevin has loaned his campaign more personal money (financial reports from the campaigns won\u2019t come again until early October). Democrats dispute the notion they will be outspent and say if they were having money troubles they wouldn\u2019t be airing 60-second spots, which are more expensive than the traditional 30-second versions.\n\nRepublicans believe the atmospherics and anti-Obama message will drive Bevin up, Conway down, and persuade the national Democratic Party to save its money for next year when they are defending eight governor\u2019s races, several of which may be open seats.\n\nLooking Ahead. Republicans will ask voters to hold Obama against every Democrat running, which worked like a charm in 2014\u2019s U.S. Senate race. GOP leaders believe everything happening in the world has only added to voters\u2019 anger with Obama\u2019s Democratic Party. Bevin will argue that Conway has failed as attorney general and isn\u2019t equipped to solve Kentucky\u2019s deep financial problems, particularly in the area of public pensions (Kentucky\u2019s recent credit downgrade will aide this argument).\n\nThe Democrats will run a two-track campaign: discredit Bevin on trust and character issues, and try to convince voters that Democrats have things under control in Frankfort even if Obama doesn\u2019t in Washington. The trust campaign is already underway, with Conway\u2019s campaign releasing advertising (including a 60-second ad launched last week) using video of Bevin making statements they say are false. Republicans believe Democrats have fired their best shot (the attacks on tax delinquency) and that Bevin has survived it.\n\nThe real question is whether voters actually feel as if Frankfort is under control, considering a vast majority of voters disapprove of Obamacare, the implementation of which is outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear\u2019s legacy. Conway will likely need Beshear, who remains personally popular, to appear in advertising to make a closing argument. It remains to be seen if Beshear\u2019s personal popularity is transferable to other candidates.\n\nScott Jennings is a former adviser to President George W. Bush and U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell.
