But her being at AHIP is also valuable for the administration, because it means that the insurance industry's main lobbying group will now be headed by a cheerleader for Obamacare.\u201d\n\nUnder Obamacare, health insurance is nearly as much a product of government as it is of the private sector\u2014a joint operation conducted in tandem by a revolving cast of public officials and private sector interests.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The move is a reminder that Obamacare is a joint operation between the government and the health insurance industry.", "title": "Senior Obamacare Official Becomes Top Health Insurance Lobbyist", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/07/17/senior-obamacare-official-becomes-top-he", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14371479035162.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The move is a reminder that Obamacare is a joint operation between the government and the health insurance industry.", "title": "Senior Obamacare Official Becomes Top Health Insurance Lobbyist", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14371479035162.jpg", "creator": "@petersuderman", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-07-17T15:48:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/peter-suderman"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Earlier this week, news broke that Tavenner would be joining America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the health insurance lobbying group, as chief executive.\nAt this point, though, \u201cprivate sector\u201d is practically a misnomer.\nTavenner, in other words, will continue to be Obamacare\u2019s caretaker\u2014only now she\u2019ll be operating from the private sector.\nEssentially, Tavenner played the role of Obamacare\u2019s caretaker within the administration, helping to craft its many tedious rules and procedures while serving as a public face when implementation failed.\nAs Philip Klein writes at The Washington Examiner, Tavenner \u201chas a web of connections within the Obama administration and an intimate knowledge of how it works."}
