And Republicans are accused of legislating morality?

In a move that is fundamentally wrong on so many levels, an omnipotent moral busybody Democratic lawmaker in Kentucky has filed a bill that would require men to get a note from their wives before they can purchase Viagra, according to the Courier-Journal.

State Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Louisville, told the newspaper that the legislation “is about family values” and is meant “to protect these men from themselves.”

HB 396 specifies only married men can obtain Viagra and requires “a man to make a sworn statement with his hand on a Bible that he will only use a prescription for a drug for erectile dysfunction when having sexual relations with his current spouse.”

It may be one of the few times in recorded history that a Democrat lawmaker included the Bible in legislation, aside from efforts to ban the Word of God.

Turns out, Marzian filed the bill as a response to several anti-abortion measures in the current legislative session, to include an “informed consent” bill that requires women seeking an abortion to get counseling beforehand, which has already been signed into law by Gov. Matt Bevin after passing last week.

Or, in other words, it’s a frivolous, smart-aleck bill intended to goad her male colleagues — at the expense of taxpayers, who pay her salary.

Marzian, an abortion-rights supporter, admitted to the Courier-Journal that she was protesting the predominantly male General Assembly intervening into women’s health.

“Do we really want a bunch or legislators interfering in private, personal, medical decisions?” she asked.

The lawmaker said she also plans to file an informed consent-type bill for potential gun buyers, requiring them to get counseling from victims of gun violence before purchasing a firearm.
