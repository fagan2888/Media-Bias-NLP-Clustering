Muslims really do take that War on Christmas thing very literally.

Dozens of people were injured tonight when a man ploughed his white van into a Christmas market crowd while screaming ‘Allahu Akbar’, or 'Allah is Greatest’.

Five people were left seriously hurt when the vehicle drove into the pedestrianised Place Royale area of Nantes in France.

Within seconds of running down as many people as he could, the driver stabbed himself nine times.

It follows 13 people being injured after a known psychiatric patient drove into pedestrians shouting 'Allah is greatest' in Arabic in the eastern city of Dijon on Saturday.
