Its purpose is to safeguard the \u201caccuracy, reliability, and timeliness\u201d of patient test results.\n\nToday, the number of labs with direct oversight under CLIA 88\u2019s purview is shrinking due to the rise of so-called \u201cwaived testing\u201d \u2013 point-of-care-performed tests exempted from most federal and state regulations. These tests can be performed by individuals with little or no laboratory background, in a bedside or chair side setting. They are simple to conduct, do not require staff with specialized training, and have a reputation for being relatively error-free.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 1993, only nine waived testing analytes, and 203 waived testing systems, were waived. Today there are now 120 waived analytes, and more than 4,000 waived testing systems are listed on the FDA website. Waived tests now include HIV tests, tests for drugs of abuse, glucose, pregnancy tests, tests for Lyme disease, infectious diseases like influenza A and B, and many others.\n\nFurther, according to CMS, more than 165,000 clinical laboratories in the United States now have certificates of waiver. That means that 70 percent of laboratories performing work that ultimately impacts millions of patients across the United States have little to no federal regulatory oversight.\n\nBut despite their relative simplicity, waived tests are not immune to human errors. When lab personnel fail to follow instructions or basic good lab processes, bad results can occur \u2013 and patient care can be negatively impacted.\n\nUsing CMS data, COLA published a white paper which documented some of the errors detected at waived testing sites in the United States. Among the problems found:\n\nMore than 30 percent do not have or routinely follow manufacturers\u2019 product inserts.\n\nMore than 30 percent do not perform Quality Control testing as specified by manufacturers\u2019 instructions.\n\nMore than 30 percent do not perform confirmatory testing, as required by the manufacturer and approved by the FDA.\n\nMost waived laboratory directors and testing personnel did not have formal laboratory training or testing experience, and there is a high level of turnover of waived testing personnel.\n\nFurther, anecdotal evidence seems to contradict the popular perception that errors in waived testing can cause no harm.\n\nLast May, Alere initiated a product recall for a waived testing product used to measure blood clotting time in patients on warfarin after alleged errors resulted in nine adverse patient outcomes, including three deaths.\n\nAdditionally, the FDA reported 100 deaths associated with potential glucose meter inaccuracies between 1992 and 2009 and 12,672 serious injuries from 2004 to 2008.\n\nThe good news is that problems in waived testing labs seem to have a common cure: Improved education. Teaching directors and testing personnel of Certificate of Waiver sites about good laboratory practices and the importance of following manufacturers' instructions, adhering to expiration dates, performing Quality Control testing, and proper documentation and recordkeeping can produce some quick and dramatic benefits.\n\nFor example, CMS randomly surveys two percent of all Certificate of Waiver sites as part of its ongoing nationwide study of waived testing facilities. Studies show that this surveillance coupled with educational outreach is having an impact on the performance of waived sites. COLA\u2019s own Waived Testing Program includes a comprehensive Waived Testing Manual, online courses and other resources.\n\nDoing the test right is key to ensuring good patient outcomes. Regardless of the complexity of the test being performed, and regardless of the level of training possessed by the person doing the testing, maintaining and following the highest quality standards should be a universal priority.\n\nCOLA has begun building a library of examples of adverse patient outcomes resulting from waived testing errors. We hope our colleagues in government and the healthcare community will also begin exploring the relationship between waived testing and quality in patient care. The more data we can accumulate, the easier it will be to spread the word about the importance of education.\n\nTwenty-six years after CLIA\u2019s enactment, it is time to put waived testing under the microscope.\n\nBeigel is CEO of COLA, Inc., the nation\u2019s largest accreditor of clinical laboratories, as well as an advocate for quality in laboratory medicine.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Despite their relative simplicity, waived tests are not immune to human errors.", "description": "Despite their relative simplicity, waived tests are not immune to human errors.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Despite their relative simplicity, waived tests are not immune to human errors.", "title": "Putting waived testing under the microscope", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/219375-putting-waived-testing-under-the-microscope", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/219375-putting-waived-testing-under-the-microscope", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-02T14:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Douglas Beigel", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-02T14:00:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/219375-putting-waived-testing-under-the-microscope", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Despite their relative simplicity, waived tests are not immune to human errors.", "card": "summary", "title": "Putting waived testing under the microscope"}, "dcterms.title": "Putting waived testing under the microscope"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3b4\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTIn 1993, only nine waived testing analytes, and 203 waived testing systems, were waived.\nCOLA\u2019s own Waived Testing Program includes a comprehensive Waived Testing Manual, online courses and other resources.\nWaived tests now include HIV tests, tests for drugs of abuse, glucose, pregnancy tests, tests for Lyme disease, infectious diseases like influenza A and B, and many others.\nMost waived laboratory directors and testing personnel did not have formal laboratory training or testing experience, and there is a high level of turnover of waived testing personnel.\nToday there are now 120 waived analytes, and more than 4,000 waived testing systems are listed on the FDA website."}
