It features a French senator, Nathalie Goulet; the New York Times\u2019s Paris Bureau chief, Alissa Rubin; lawyer Ardavan Amir Aslani; and Christelle Yalap of the Committee for the Support of Iraqi Christians, a French NGO.\n\nThe panel is worth watching in full, if only to learn about the discussion taking place in another Western country. The panelists disagree about the responsibility America bears for the situation. The invasion of Iraq destabilized the country and exposed Christians and other minorities to grave danger. But Islamism is not simply a response to American actions. It results from factors internal to the Muslim world. America has been only a peripheral actor in the Arab Spring. And yet, as one of the panelists says, the Arab Spring always seems to become an Islamist autumn.\n\nThe ordeal of Mosul\u2019s Christians did not end with expulsion from their homes, a fact Ms. Yalap succinctly describes. Her NGO has been in touch with these Christians, who have taken refuge in Erbil, in Kurdistan. Apparently, ISIS has continued to pursue them there, and has succeeded in cutting off their water and electricity. It\u2019s summer in Erbil, and the temperature is around 113\u00b0. The Christians of Mosul continue to face a humanitarian crisis.\n\nHow can outsiders best help this beleaguered group? Not by granting asylum, Ms. Yalap says. Emigration would mean the end of the Christian presence in Iraq. Although Mosul\u2019s Christians are very grateful to France for offering them a home\u0097an offer the United States has not made, incidentally\u0097they wish to remain in their own country, where their community has lived for thousands of years. Instead, she says, the international community can best help Iraq\u2019s Christians by providing them immediate humanitarian assistance\u0097food, water, shelter, security.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A blog devoted to sharing initial thoughts on topics, and daily ramblings, First Thoughts speaks to the latest topics in religion and today\u2019s society.", "og": {"site_name": "First Things", "description": "For people seeking to understand the crisis facing the Christians of Iraq, there\u2019s an interesting panel discussion on the website of France 24, an English-language news station based in Paris: \u201cIraq\u2019s Christians: Nowhere to Run?\u201d", "title": "Iraq\u2019s Christians Need Our Help | Mark Movsesian", "url": "http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2014/08/iraqs-christians-need-our-help", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/first-things-resources/uploads/article_53dba267a0696.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/first-things-resources/uploads/article_53dba267a0696.jpg", "title": "Iraq\u2019s Christians Need Our Help | Mark Movsesian", "description": "For people seeking to understand the crisis facing the Christians of Iraq, there\u2019s an interesting panel discussion on the website of France 24, an English-language news station based in Paris: \u201cIraq\u2019s Christians: Nowhere to Run?\u201d", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@firstthingsmag"}, "robots": "follow", "msvalidate.01": "649D2BEB6B8F0C1832C0762CD37C2FAE", "fb": {"admins": 1504860014}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "thumbnail": "https://dae6ca3yfi9zj.cloudfront.net/img/favicon-196.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb18\"", "article_summary": "Instead, she says, the international community can best help Iraq\u2019s Christians by providing them immediate humanitarian assistance\u0097food, water, shelter, security.\nFor people seeking to understand the crisis facing the Christians of Iraq, there\u2019s an interesting panel discussion on the website of France 24, an English-language news station based in Paris: \u201cIraq\u2019s Christians: Nowhere to Run?\u201d The discussion is in two segments, here and here.\nThe invasion of Iraq destabilized the country and exposed Christians and other minorities to grave danger.\nThe ordeal of Mosul\u2019s Christians did not end with expulsion from their homes, a fact Ms. Yalap succinctly describes.\nThe panel is worth watching in full, if only to learn about the discussion taking place in another Western country."}
