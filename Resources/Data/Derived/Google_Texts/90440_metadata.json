Jerry Brown\u2019s Republican challenger, and the pressure was on to walk the party line.\n\nOne caller asked if Kashkari had \u201cthe cojones to take on the unions.\u201d Another, Michael in Long Beach, wondered how he\u2019d get Californians to give up food stamps and other \u201cfreebies from the government.\u201d A co-host pressed Kashkari on \u201cillegal alien children\u201d entering the country from Mexico.\n\nFor seven hours this week, Kashkari played up his partisan Republican credentials on Fresno and L.A. radio stations.\n\nYes, he assured listeners of KABC-AM 790 in Los Angeles on Wednesday, he will challenge organized labor, come what may \u2014 an approach that backfired for California\u2019s last Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, as Kashkari acknowledged.\n\n\u201cIf people are going to be mad as heck over it, so be it,\u201d said Kashkari, who described unions as less \u201ceconomically rational\u201d than the mob.\n\nAt the same time, Kashkari was careful not to take his appeals to the party base too far, lest he offend some of the nearly 13 million California voters \u2014 72% \u2014 who are not Republican.\n\nKABC co-host John Phillips reminded Kashkari that one of his top Republican supporters, former Gov. Pete Wilson, had sued the federal government for reimbursement of state spending on public services for immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nKashkari, who is trying to gain support among the many Latinos who were offended by Wilson\u2019s hard line on illegal immigration, was noncommital.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Kashkari said. \u201cWe would have to look at the legal implications of that.\u201d\n\nThe radio appearances were a boon to Kashkari, who is struggling to raise money to advertise and needs all the free media attention he can get. Brown has banked about $21 million for his reelection run, while Kashkari\u2019s campaign was close to broke after the June 3 primary. Since then, Kashkari has reported raising just over $53,000, while Brown has collected $453,000.\n\nHe's trying to show Republicans that he is in fact a Republican, and he's doing it very cheaply. \u2014 Allan Hoffenblum, publisher of the California Target Book, a nonpartisan election guide, on Neel Kashkari's radio appearances.\n\nThe radio shows gave Kashkari a chance to shore up party support after a hard-fought primary against a more conservative rival, Tim Donnelly. The most recent Field Poll found 71% of likely Republican voters backing Kashkari over Brown in November. Overall, Brown was 20 points ahead, so stronger GOP support is essential to Kashkari.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to show Republicans that he is in fact a Republican, and he\u2019s doing it very cheaply,\u201d said Allan Hoffenblum, publisher of the California Target Book, a nonpartisan election guide.\n\nOn KMJ-AM radio in Fresno, Kashkari tried his hand at self-deprecating banter.\n\nThe former assistant U.S. treasury secretary, who lives in Laguna Beach, told listeners that his two big dogs were \u201clike my kids.\u201d He joked that he looked like the bald star of \u201cThe Mummy\u201d or \u201cone of the Afghani guys\u201d in \u201cIron Man.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lead terrorist in 'Iron Man' looks like me too,\u201d Kashkari said.\n\nIn a medium known for hot rhetoric, Kashkari rose to the occasion. He branded Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom as a \u201cpretty-boy candidate\u201d whose ambition for higher office could be thwarted by actor George Clooney.\n\n\u201cHow can you have two playboy candidates for governor in 2018?\u201d Kashkari asked, alluding to unsubstantiated rumors that Clooney aspires to the job.\n\nKashkari was most feisty when he taunted Brown. He mocked the Democratic governor\u2019s taste for the writings of ancient scholars and accused him of ducking debates. \u201cHe can beat me in Latin,\u201d Kashkari said. \u201cHe can quote dead Greek philosophers better than I can.\u201d\n\nKashkari compared his rival unfavorably with his father, Pat Brown. As governor of California from 1959 to 1967, Pat Brown invested wisely in the state\u2019s water supply network, Kashkari said, while his son is squandering money needed for new dams and reservoirs on a \u201cvanity train,\u201d his high-speed rail project.\n\n\u201cHe clearly doesn\u2019t understand water,\u201d Kashkari said.\n\nAs opportunities arose to show party loyalty, Kashkari took them. He criticized efforts to raise the minimum wage. He spoke out against moves to pass new gun control laws in response to mass shootings. And he welcomed House Speaker John A. Boehner\u2019s court action against President Obama for allegedly overstepping his executive authority.\n\n\u201cJohn Boehner is now holding the president accountable,\u201d said Kashkari, who cited Obamacare rules as a presidential abuse of power.\n\nOne of his harshest attacks on Democrats was on education. Kashkari pounded Brown and other Democrats for their silence on the landmark June 10 court ruling that California\u2019s teacher hiring and tenure laws violate the right of poor and minority children to equal education by saddling them with thousands of grossly ineffective teachers.\n\n\u201cThey should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d Kashkari told Fresno listeners on Tuesday.\n\nOn KABC, Kashkari said the idea that Brown and other Democrats were \u201cfighting for the civil rights of poor kids\u201d had been exposed as a lie. \u201cThey\u2019re in bed with the teachers unions,\u201d he said.\n\nTeacher unions have spent $6 million on Brown\u2019s 2010 and 2014 runs for governor and the 2012 campaign that Brown led for Proposition 30, which imposed temporary tax hikes to generate billions of dollars to close budget shortfalls.\n\nThe governor\u2019s press secretary, Evan Westrup, said the campaign money from teacher unions had no influence on Brown\u2019s public silence on the court ruling. \u201cThe decision is a tentative ruling and it\u2019s being reviewed,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Kashkari plays up Republican loyalty on talk radio", "date": "2014-07-03", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "It was Neel Kashkari \u2019s third gig as a talk radio guest host since he emerged from last month\u2019s primary as Gov.
