XI? \u2014 Chinese President Xi Jinping touches down in Seattle today and will give an address this evening at a dinner hosted by the US-China Business Council and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations beginning at 7 p.m. (4 p.m. local time). Check out the livestream here: http://bit.ly/1KvGksG Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker will also be in attendance at the forum this week as President Barack Obama\u2019s representative, the AP reports. http://bit.ly/1OMgzcJ\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile economic hacking promises to be a major topic once Xi reaches Washington, sidebar conversations in Seattle are just as likely to focus on a proposed Chinese banking law. An earlier draft of that law drew widespread condemnation from industry and governments in the U.S., Europe and Japan for demanding companies in the sector turn over source code to Chinese officials. A coalition of industry organizations, including the US-China Business Council, penned a letter earlier this month urging the Chinese government not to demand companies' source code and to adhere to global standards on encryption. Background: http://politico.pro/1FeeFPX\n\nRICE SEEMS TO SOFTEN LANGUAGE ON CHINESE HACKING \u2014 National Security Adviser Susan Rice on Monday threatened less dire consequences if Chinese economic hacking continues than Obama did previously in a speech previewing the Xi visit. Rice noted only that the U.S. will \u201ccontinue to urge China to join us in promoting responsible norms of state behavior in cyberspace,\" and that continued hacking would be \u201ca critical factor in determining the future trajectory of U.S.-China ties.\u201d Obama had previously warned that the U.S. was \u201cprepared to take some countervailing action\u201d on cybertheft, a likely reference to targeted sanctions. http://politico.pro/1MmnZ44\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF TALKING TO CYBER FRENEMIES \u2014 Rice also used her address to respond to critics who said the U.S. should cancel Xi\u2019s visit over the hacks at U.S. companies and the Office of Personnel Management. Engagement with China helped produce deals on trade and climate change, Rice said. She warned that shunning engagement would \u201conly ensure the Chinese are not challenged on issues where we differ and not encouraged to peacefully rise.\u201d Chief among those critics was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination just hours after Rice\u2019s address. http://politico.pro/1OqFF1F\n\nHAPPY TUESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity. Your regular MC concierge has returned from Colorado and his best friend\u2019s wedding (go Jim and Rebecca!). Though I miss the mountains and my old pals already, I\u2019m back and eager to serve. Send your thoughts, feedback and especially your tips to tstarks@politico.com and follow @timstarks, @POLITICOPro and @MorningCybersec. Full team info is below.\n\nFIRST LOOK: FEDS THE SECOND-SAFEST SECTOR ON CYBER? \u2014 The federal government is just behind the finance sector in its cybersecurity performance, according to security ratings firm BitSight Technologies, which is out with its annual industry benchmark report today. Given all the attention over the big breaches at OPM, IRS and Joint Chiefs of Staff this year, that\u2019s a bit of a surprise. But BitSight said it surveyed 119 government agencies and found a slight improvement from last year.\n\nOther takeaways: BitSight ranks the education sector the worst of the six industries it examined by a good margin, with the energy/utility and health care sectors in the back half of the pack. Retail tracks fairly even with the federal government. Finance\u2019s supremacy, and education\u2019s poor performance, are trends that BitSight has observed in the past. And every industry has major SSL vulnerabilities, according to BitSight.

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration holds on Sept. 29 the first in a series of public meetings dedicated to the issue in Berkeley, Calif. \u2013 where Moussouris says the maturity model will be discussed. The model rates companies according to five capabilities: Organizational, Incentives, Analytics, Communications and Engineering. It then rates them across three levels of ability: Basic, Advanced and Expert.

On Sedgewick\u2019s list: updated cybersecurity controls referenced in the framework, and how to use risk management frameworks together with the guidance. For Pros: http://politico.pro/1Krl4q1\n\n** A message from Northrop Grumman: Today\u2019s enemy threats have taken on forms like never before.

Zerodium, founded by notorious zero day supplier Chaouki Bekrar, says it\u2019ll pay out if a hacker shows how to permanently jailbreak the latest Apple mobile operating system via code embedded into a website. The dollar amount and the publicity surrounding the offer are unusual \u2013 the zero-day market is dominated by stealth and secrecy, especially given heavy participation of intelligence agencies. Governments usually shell out $300,000 to $400,000 per zero day, said Robert Graham, who heads up Errata Security. (Graham doesn\u2019t discuss whether he sells zero days.)\n\nThe $1 million price looks high, but it involves levels of technical sophistication that could be sold individually for about $300,000 each, he said. Graham predicted a government would be the party most interested in buying the jailbreak zero days, since that would give it the ability to remotely take over a target\u2019s cellphone.\n\nIt\u2019s also another illustration of the obstacles cyber defenders face when trying to patch zero days before the offensive side (as Zerodium likely sells to) of cybersecurity can make use of them, said Moussouris of HackerOne. \u201cMore defense-oriented incentives are needed, though they will never be able to compete with these prices, so using other levers besides price will have to be part of any defender's strategy,\u201d she said.

State Department Cyber Coordinator Chris Painter\u2019s office has held at least one cyber conference in Africa each year since the office was created in 2011, part of an effort to build cybersecurity along with cyber capacity in the developing world. \u201cThis workshop will address broad issues of cybercrime and cybersecurity while focusing on issues of specific interest to the Lusophone Africa region such as combating cybercrime; mobile phone security; Internet freedom, access, and affordability; and the development of national computer emergency readiness teams,\u201d according to the notice. More from State: http://1.usa.gov/1QUOgbg\n\nCDM ORDERS AWARDED \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security announced Monday that after three more task orders, 97 percent of federal government agencies now have access to DHS\u2019s Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program tools and services. The remaining 3 percent is due to be covered by the end of the year. Booz Allen Hamilton, Northrop Grumman and HP Enterprise Services won the orders. More for Pros: http://politico.pro/1OqC43A\n\nAfter we published, we got the names of the 17 agencies covered under the new batch of orders. Those are: Commerce; Education; Environmental Protection Agency; General Services Administration; Health and Human Services; Housing and Urban Development; Justice; Labor; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; National Science Foundation; Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Social Security Administration; Small Business Administration; State; Treasury; U.S. Agency for International Development; and U.S. Postal Service.

Senate leaders abandoned that requirement on Monday, causing Sen. Ron Wyden to lift his hold on the bill. Internet Association spokesman Noah Theran called it an encouraging development. \u201cRequiring Internet companies to provide law enforcement enormous quantities of data does not make us safer, and stands in stark conflict with long-standing federal policy governing platform liability and free speech online,\" he said in a statement.\n\nQUICK BYTES\n\n\u2014 A confidential Verizon report on the 2013 Target hack determined that Verizon\u2019s consultants could even hack into deli meat scales, but that Target had improved by early 2014.

Motherboard: http://bit.ly/1MFwtGe\n\n\u2014 The malware-infected apps from Apple\u2019s App Store were the result of developers in China being \u201ctricked into using software tools that added malicious code,\u201d according to the AP. http://cbsn.ws/1NH9V6B\n\n\u2014 The IRS has stepped up its efforts to block fraudulent tax refunds earlier in the process.
