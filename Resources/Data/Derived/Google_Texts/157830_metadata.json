His attorney, Klaus-Peter Kniffka, said after the 35-minute opening session that it was unlikely his client would ever address the court personally.\n\n\u201cI will probably deliver a defense declaration, but it depends upon the course of the trial,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe trial comes amid a new phase of German Nazi-era investigations, with federal prosecutors this week expected to announce they are recommending the pursuit of possible charges against about 40 former Auschwitz guards.\n\nThe renewed probes of death camp guards come after the case of former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk, who died last year while appealing his 2011 conviction for accessory to murder after allegations he served in Sobibor.\n\nHis case established that death camp guards could be convicted as accessories to murder, even if there was no specific evidence of atrocities against them.\n\nMr. Bruins, however, long has been on the radar of German legal authorities and already served time in the 1980s for his role in the wartime slaying of two Dutch Jews.\n\nMr. Bruins also was convicted and sentenced to death in absentia in the Netherlands in 1949 in a case that involved the killing of the resistance fighter. The sentence later was commuted to life in prison, but attempts to extradite him were unsuccessful because he had obtained German citizenship through a policy instituted by Adolf Hitler to confer citizenship on foreigners who served the Nazi military.\n\nUlrich Sander, spokesman for an organization representing the victims of Nazi crimes, told the dpa news agency that the decision to bring Mr. Bruins to trial again, even at his advanced age, was a good one.\n\n\u201cWe must make it clear for the future that such crimes are always prosecuted, that murderers never get away,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite his age, Mr. Bruins was found medically fit to stand trial, though Mr. Kniffka said the stress of the proceedings against him has weakened him.\n\nTrial sessions are being limited to a maximum of three hours in deference to his age and health.\n\nMr. Bruins volunteered for the Waffen SS, the combat arm of the Nazis\u2019 fanatical paramilitary organization, in 1941 after the Nazis conquered and occupied his homeland. He eventually rose to the rank of Unterscharfuehrer \u2014 roughly equivalent to sergeant.\n\nHe fought on the eastern front in Russia until 1943, when he became ill and no longer fit for combat duty.\n\nTransferred back to the Netherlands, he served first in the Sicherheitsdienst \u2014 the Nazi internal intelligence agency \u2014 and then the Sicherheitspolizei, or Security Police, in a unit tasked to find resistance fighters and Jews.\n\nAs part of that unit, he is accused of killing resistance fighter Aldert Klaas Dijkema in September 1944 in the town of Appingedam, near the German border in the northern Netherlands.\n\nIf convicted, he faces a possible life sentence.\n\nDijkema was apprehended by the Nazis on Sept. 9, 1944, on suspicion he was involved in the Dutch resistance.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Mr. Bruins and alleged accomplice August Neuhaeuser, who has since died, drove Dijkema to an isolated industrial area where they stopped and told him to \u201cgo take a leak.\u201d\n\nAs he walked away from the car, they fired at least four shots into him, including into the back of his head, killing him instantly, according to the indictment.\n\nMr. Bruins and Neuhaeuser reported that Dijkema was shot while trying to escape.\n\nThough it is not clear who fired the fatal shots, under German law if both suspects were there with the intent to kill, it does not matter who pulled the trigger, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe trial is scheduled through the end of September but it could be extended.\n\n\u2022 David Rising reported from Berlin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Germany on Monday put a 92-year-old former member of the Nazi Waffen SS on trial on charges that he murdered a Dutch resistance fighter in 1944.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Germany on Monday put a 92-year-old former member of the Nazi Waffen SS on trial on charges that he murdered a Dutch resistance fighter in 1944.", "title": "Germany tries 92-year-old man for Nazi war crime", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/2/germany-tries-92-year-old-man-nazi-war-crime/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/02/germany-nazi-trial_lea.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/02/germany-nazi-trial_lea.jpg", "description": "Germany on Monday put a 92-year-old former member of the Nazi Waffen SS on trial on charges that he murdered a Dutch resistance fighter in 1944.", "card": "summary", "title": "Germany tries 92-year-old man for Nazi war crime"}, "Author": "Daniel Niemann and David Rising", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Siert Bruins, Netherlands, Klaus Peter Kniffka"}, "article_summary": "HAGEN, Germany (AP) \u2014 Germany on Monday put a 92-year-old former member of the Nazi Waffen SS on trial on charges that he murdered a Dutch resistance fighter in 1944.\nNo pleas are made in the German system, and Mr. Bruins offered no statement.\nMr. Bruins and Neuhaeuser reported that Dijkema was shot while trying to escape.\nDespite his age, Mr. Bruins was found medically fit to stand trial, though Mr. Kniffka said the stress of the proceedings against him has weakened him.\n\u201cI will probably deliver a defense declaration, but it depends upon the course of the trial,\u201d he told reporters."}
