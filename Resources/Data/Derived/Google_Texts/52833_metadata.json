And at 6 years old, Christina is low enough to the ground that a shot from below probably won\u2019t find her.\n\nThe girl is usually asleep at night when gunfire erupts, but if she does hear a shot, \u201cshe will tell me guns are bad,\u201d Young said.\n\nYoung protects her daughter the best she can and tries not to worry about things she can\u2019t change.\n\nInstead, the 35-year-old, who dropped out of high school at 16, has been working to change her life and that of her daughter.\n\nWith the help of Colorado\u2019s temporary assistance for needy families program, Young studied for and received her general equivalency diploma. She went on to study culinary arts at the Emily Griffith Technical College.\n\nIn late April, she started a job as a cook at a nearby Family Crisis Center that provides temporary shelter for children awaiting a more permanent placement from Denver Human Services.\n\nThe job, which can provide anywhere from zero to 40 hours of work a week, pays $13 an hour. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is on call, but at least I have my foot in the door.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Poverty in Colorado rural and urban families\n\nAs poor as Sun Valley is, the neighborhood on Denver\u2019s west side is in a metro area where a number of social service providers are easily accessible. \u201cIt took me a long time to apply for help, but there really is a lot of help out there if you are willing to go in there and stand up and ask,\u201d she said.\n\nYoung and Christina, a blond bundle of energy, live in a two-bedroom unit at the Decatur Place apartment building, which is owned by nonprofit Mercy Housing.\n\nDecatur offers subsidized, two-year transitional housing to single parents and their children.\n\nYoung receives $364 a month in financial assistance from TANF, $300 a month in food stamps, and pays $80 a month in rent. \u201cI do manage to pay all the bills and assure there is always food in the house,\u201d she said.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sun Valley: Single mother and high school dropout works to change her life", "title": "Sun Valley: Single mother and high school dropout works to change her life", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/23/sun-valley-single-mother-and-high-school-dropout-works-to-change-her-life/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523__FelishaYoungp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523__FelishaYoungp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T16:48:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T05:04:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc315\"", "article_summary": "Instead, the 35-year-old, who dropped out of high school at 16, has been working to change her life and that of her daughter.\nWith the help of Colorado\u2019s temporary assistance for needy families program, Young studied for and received her general equivalency diploma.\nAt home in their fourth-floor apartment, Felisha Young and her daughter sometimes hear gunshots in the surrounding Sun Valley neighborhood.\nFour floors from the street, she thinks her windows are high enough that a stray bullet is unlikely to find its way in.\nYoung protects her daughter the best she can and tries not to worry about things she can\u2019t change."}
