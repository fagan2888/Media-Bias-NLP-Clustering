As the government shutdown hogs the spotlight Tuesday, the White House is trying to celebrate the first day of Obamacare open enrollment. But the administration was forced to come clean and admit that signing up for service isn't as seamless as it should be.

Among the estimated 48.6 million uninsured Americans, many flocked to HealthCare.gov to enroll, but some say the rollout was fraught with technical difficulties.

Many complained that they received error messages when they tried to fill out forms online and weren't able to sign up for the service, prompting the White House to blame Congress for cutting funding for necessary Web resources.

"Some submissions may not be processed and we may not be able to respond to your inquiries," a posting on the White House blog said.

In just 140 characters, the White House Twitter account was poignant in their attack of Republicans.

"Thanks to the House GOP, the government is shutting down. Thanks to #Obamacare, uninsured Americans can #GetCovered," the message read.

More than 2 million visitors tried to access the New York Department of Health website in the first 2 hours that the site launched Tuesday.

A message on the site alerted visitors to the overwhelming response and urged them to return to the website later, when the IT issues could be resolved.
