Circuit. Patricia Millett is another radical activist masquerading as judge.\n\nAs chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1990, now-Vice President Joseph Biden threw a fit after it was clear David Souter was going to be confirmed to the Supreme Court, warning the first Bush administration that no more \u201cstealth\u201d nominees would be getting through.\n\nLiberals threw an even bigger fit the next year when Clarence Thomas told Biden\u2019s committee he had no \u201cpersonal opinion on the outcome in Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nBut Souter and Thomas\u2019 non-candor before the committee pales in comparison to the balderdash peddled by Patricia Millett.\n\nAs Carrie Severino noted in National Review earlier this year, when Sen. Ted Cruz, R.-Texas, asked Millett under oath to \u201cdescribe how you would characterize your judicial philosophy, and identify which U.S. Supreme Court justice\u2019s judicial philosophy from the Warren, Burger, or Rehnquist Courts is most analogous with yours,\u201d Millett handed the U.S. Senate pure falsity.\n\n\u201cI cannot claim familiarity with any particular judicial philosophies the justices might possess,\u201d the Clinton Justice Department veteran who has argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court, contended. \u201cNor do I have a judicial philosophy myself.\u201d\n\nAs Severino noted, even second-year law students applying for clerkships get asked in interviews \u201cto name the judge whose approach to the law they most admire\u201d or \u201cthe judicial philosophy they most identify with.\u201d An interviewee who stammered to a judge that he or she had no philosophical outlook or wasn\u2019t familiar with any judges would be considered intellectually unfit.\n\nOf course, Millett, who will now be sworn in, on to arguably the second most powerful court in the country, has plenty of interest in law, as her damning record proves.\n\nOn same-sex marriage, for instance, an MSNBC interview a year ago reveals Millett has found a clever way to make liberalism actually sound conservative. Fighting against the radical re-definition of marriage at the federal level \u2014 supported by none other than Millett\u2019s former boss, that great defender of traditional marriage, President Bill Clinton \u2014 violates states rights, Millett argues.\n\n\u201cHistorically that\u2019s always been the job of the states to decide what marriage is \u2014 to define it \u2014 and so,\u201d Millett argued, \u201cthat really is the federal government stepping somewhere where it hasn\u2019t before.\u201d\n\nSound like someone with no judicial philosophy?\n\nBut Millett not only has a radical legal ideology; she\u2019s a through-and-through political operator.\n\nShe provided written endorsements for Obama\u2019s radical Supreme Court nominations of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, three other Obama judicial nominations, and Donald Verrilli, the solicitor general who argued ObamaCare before the high court.\n\nAnd Millett\u2019s regard for the Constitution\u2019s freedoms do not extend to law school Christian societies being allowed to restrict their membership solely to Christians, because doing so wouldn\u2019t \u201cfoster community involvement,\u201d Millett wrote in a law review article.\n\nKeeping a political operative like Patricia Millett off the D.C. Circuit is exactly what the Senate filibuster is for. Thanks to Harry Reid, it is now just as dead as this newest judge\u2019s respect for the Constitution.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nuclear Option: The first spoil of Harry Reid's shredding of the Senate's historic filibuster rules has been confirmed to the D.C.
