Typically, these worlds are environmentally degraded or governed by totalitarian regimes.\n\nMy favorite example is George Orwell\u2019s 1984, a hugely ambitious novel that deals with themes of both personal threat and universal oppression. Orwell\u2019s vision is expressed in phrases like Big Brother, doublethink and Thought Police that are now part of everyday speech.\n\nEven though they may have read 1984 as kids, some of today\u2019s parents worry their teens\u2019 obsession with dark fiction means they\u2019ll grow up and overthrow the government \u2013 like Katniss Everdeen in Hunger Games or Tris Prior in Divergent.\n\nHow real is this concern?\n\nWhy is dystopian fiction popular?\n\nI am a narratologist, meaning I study the causes and effects of exposure to stories.\n\nMy colleagues and I have found that the extent to which a reader loses herself in a story is a major cause of the extent to which her attitudes change.\n\nLosing oneself in a story is also known as narrative transportation.\n\nNarratologists have uncovered three consequences of narrative transportation that explain the current popularity of young adult dystopian fiction.\n\nNarrative transportation feels good. People like to empathize with story characters and to suspend reality.\n\nNarrative transportation teaches people about story themes, such as poverty. In turn, this knowledge intensifies the narrative transportation experience and makes people care about these themes.\n\nNarrative transportation teaches people about story symbols. For instance, the fictional mockingjay bird represents defiance in the Hunger Games. In turn, this knowledge makes it easier to follow the story, allows people to brag about being in the know, and strengthens in-group identity.\n\nAll three consequences make people want to repeat narrative transportation, which is most easily done with sequels \u2013 like the four movies based on the three Hunger Game books, or stories in the same genre.\n\nDystopian themes are egalitarian.\n\nThere is no doubt that storytelling is powerful, and can have an effect on readers.\n\nYoung adult dystopian fiction tends to include at least one key learning point or moral. When teens absorb the moral, it can change their attitudes and durably weave the story into teens\u2019 life choices. Narratologists call this the cultivation effect.\n\nThe cultivation effect of Harry Potter is reported to have played an important role in galvanizing Millennials\u2019 political opinions. As Anthony Gierzynski and Kathryn Eddy note:\n\nHarry Potter fans are more open to diversity and are more politically tolerant than nonfans; fans are also less authoritarian, less likely to support the use of deadly force or torture, more politically active, and more likely to have had a negative view of the Bush administration.\n\nA similar effect could occur with teens and dystopian fiction. Many young adult dystopian stories tackle themes such as oppression, poverty, starvation, and war, among others. Relating to the story characters allows teens to explore and learn to care about these issues. Attitudes towards justice and responsibility can be changed when teens empathize with Tris or Katniss.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean dystopian-loving teens will act out the story plots when they grow up \u2013 say, by starting a revolution.\n\nRather, the cultivation effect predicts that today\u2019s teens will grow up with less acceptance of oppression, poverty, starvation, and war. If government officials do not take these concerns seriously though, who knows what might happen?\n\nNothing is less innocent than a story \u2013 except maybe a teen who has taken its message to heart.\n\nTom van Laer, Senior Lecturer in Marketing, City University London Disclosure statement Tom van Laer does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/11/23/could-the-hunger-games-turn-your-teen-into-a-revolutionary/", "article_author_name": "Tom van Laer", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image-20151107-16249-1yw5r0m.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "children, counterculture, dystopian, Hunger games, kids, teaches"}, "description": "The popular books by Suzanne Collins are the most visible example of a genre of stories today\u2019s teens are reading voraciously: young adult dystopian fiction.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image-20151107-16249-1yw5r0m.jpg"}, "keywords": "children,counterculture,dystopian,hunger games,kids,teaches", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Printed from: http://newbostonpost.com/2015/11/23/could-the-hunger-games-turn-your-teen-into-a-revolutionary/FILM TITLE: The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 2015 SS_D82-26107.dngAs a fan of The Hunger Games trilogy, I cannot wait to see the final part of the film series.\nCould the Hunger Games turn your teen into a revolutionary?\nThe Hunger Games novels and films have fascinated me for more than seven years.\nFor instance, the fictional mockingjay bird represents defiance in the Hunger Games.\nYoung adult dystopian fiction tends to include at least one key learning point or moral."}
