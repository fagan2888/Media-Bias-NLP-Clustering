The embryo is then thawed (or the egg is inseminated) and transferred into the uterus. Success rates specifically for cancer patients have not yet been studied. But in vitro fertilization (IVF) rates are around 50 percent for women younger than 35.\n\nFor men with cancer, freezing sperm before treatment is far less invasive and less expensive.\n\nThere are also experimental options such as ovarian tissue freezing, in which all or part of an ovary is removed and the outer area, which contains the eggs, is frozen in strips for later use. The ovary can be reimplanted when the patient is well.\n\nThe procedure typically costs around $12,000; because it is experimental, research centers often provide funding, according to Teresa Woodruff, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University.\n\nWoodruff refers to such procedures as part of oncofertility, a new discipline that bridges oncology and reproductive medicine.\n\n\"I really appreciated there were so many advances in cancer therapy, yet so many young survivors were ending up sterilized,\" Woodruff said. \"There was a real need for a focus specifically in this field.\"\n\nAbout 140,230 Americans younger than 45 will receive a cancer diagnosis this year, the American Cancer Society projects. The large majority of them are likely to survive for five years or more.\n\nBut only recently has fertility been factored into a patient's treatment plan, according to Mark Payson, a reproductive endocrinologist at Dominion Fertility, a practice based in Arlington, Va. When he speaks to breast cancer support groups, patients say that \"only half of their oncologists talk to them about fertility options.\"\n\nLast month, a study by researchers at the University of Sheffield in England found that only 40 percent of young female cancer patients were happy with the way their doctors discussed the options they had to preserve fertility.\n\nMost doctors are typically more concerned with saving the patient's life than with fertility options, Payson said.\n\nWhen Ilana Brunner's breast cancer was discovered in 2009, she quickly embarked on fertility treatments in order to freeze embryos before chemo began.\n\n\"When I started chemo, they hooked me up to the machine and made me watch a video about cancer and chemo. But the video never mentioned fertility for women,\" though it mentioned it for men, said Brunner, a 40-year-old lawyer who lives in Silver Spring, Md. \"I actually complained. To me, it was a travesty.\"\n\nFoust's fate was different. A few days after her initial conversation, she and her husband got an urgent phone call with a new plan for her treatment.\n\nHer breast surgeon at Virginia Hospital Center had set up a conference call with Stephen Lincoln, a reproductive endrocrinologist with the Genetics & IVF Institute's fertility preservation center for cancer patients: She would be able to try to freeze her eggs or embryos before her treatment.\n\n\"Everyone is recognizing now that talking about fertility is a part of dealing with cancer,\" Lincoln said. \"People aren't just being rushed right into treatment anymore.\"\n\nDenduluri concurs. \"The awareness is just much higher now, whereas before many were concerned with finding the so-called cure and saving the patient's life,\" she said. \"It's more a balancing act now, and there are more strident feelings about the importance of bringing up fertility issues at the beginning of treatment.\"\n\nIn late May, Foust went to the Genetics & IVF pharmacy near her home in Annandale, Va., and went home with a supply of vials of gonadotropins, hormones that stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs for retrieval.\n\nShe would have to give herself injections every day for the next two weeks. Then Lincoln and his team would extract her eggs, a procedure done with light sedation. In breast cancer cases, doctors want to keep estrogen levels low because of concern that raising them might accelerate the growth of a tumor.\n\nFoust's doctors combined a low dose of gonadotropin and a medication that promotes ovarian stimulation while keeping estrogen levels low.\n\n\"It was amazing that they could actually do this, safely. At the same time, you never think as a 26-year-old that the ability to bear children \u2014 something I was looking forward to \u2014 will be taken away from you,\" said Foust, an emergency room nurse.\n\nShe decided to freeze eggs instead of embryos because she was concerned about having embryos she might not use. There was also a chance that she could have children naturally, depending on how much harm chemotherapy caused to her fertility.\n\nA growing number of oncologists reject the traditional view that the hormones used to stimulate eggs for retrieval \u2014 as well as pregnancy itself \u2014 might increase the risk of developing certain cancers. Today many doctors see both the freezing process and pregnancy as safe after three to five years of tamoxifen, a hormone drug used with breast cancer patients, according to Denduluri.\n\nAnd although large-scale data are still being collected about recurrence rates after pregnancy, tumor histories are also looked at on a case-by-case basis to see if carrying a baby is safe, according to Denduluri.\n\nBrunner froze her eggs twice \u2014 once before her double mastectomy and another time before chemotherapy. \"Someone said, 'Are you sure you want to do this and start poking yourself with needles?' And I said, 'This is nothing compared to what I have to do with cancer.'\"\n\nAfter two unsuccessful embryo transfers, she tried again, post chemo. She was able to get one viable egg the first round and one more the second. Both were fertilized with her husband's sperm using IVF and were implanted in a new gestational carrier. Her positive outcome in retrieving viable eggs after chemo is uncommon, doctors said. Today, she has twins who are 9 months old.\n\nMeanwhile, Foust was able to freeze 15 eggs. She is currently going through eight rounds of chemotherapy. Knowing that her eggs are frozen brings her comfort.\n\n\"I remember seeing a picture in my breast surgeon's office that has a list of things that cancer cannot do,\" she said. \"And I wanted that to include that it couldn't take a pregnancy away from us. Even if we never use the eggs or get pregnant on our own, it would be a blessing. I refer to my frozen eggs as my pocketful of sunshine.\"", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1c8\"", "article_summary": "Despite this, medicine has come a long way recently toward helping cancer patients \u2014 women especially \u2014 preserve fertility prior to treatment.\nWhen he speaks to breast cancer support groups, patients say that \"only half of their oncologists talk to them about fertility options.\"\nBut only recently has fertility been factored into a patient's treatment plan, according to Mark Payson, a reproductive endocrinologist at Dominion Fertility, a practice based in Arlington, Va.\nAt the top of the 26-year-old's concerns was an unknown that haunts many young cancer patients: \"If I survive, will I be able to have children?\"\nWhen Ilana Brunner's breast cancer was discovered in 2009, she quickly embarked on fertility treatments in order to freeze embryos before chemo began."}
