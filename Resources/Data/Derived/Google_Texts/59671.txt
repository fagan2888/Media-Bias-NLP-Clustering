â€” Cumberland County deputies and U.S. marshals on Wednesday arrested a Fayetteville man in a shooting last month that seriously wounded a 20-year-old man.

Miguel Demetrius Melvin, 24, of Dudley Road, was charged with attempted first-degree murder, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury and discharging a weapon into occupied property. He was being held in the Cumberland County jail under a $250,000 bond.

Investigators said Justin Phillip Cockrell was driving in Stedman at about 11 p.m. on March 17 when Melvin flagged him down at the intersection of Azelia Drive and Dogwood Court. The two men know each other, authorities said, and Melvin, angry over an incident that had occurred earlier that day, shot Cockrell multiple times and drove off.

Cockrell remains hospitalized, authorities said.
