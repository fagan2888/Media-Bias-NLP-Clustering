Falling gas prices have been a key component of recent economic growth and Obama did everything in his power to raise gas prices, not lower them. Obama's bailout of Wall Street banks came at the expense of millions of homeowners who found it harder to get out of debt and a recent study found that Obama's unemployment insurance extension cost the economy 1.8 million jobs.\n\nLooking ahead, voters in all three states are also highly skeptical of Obama's free community college plan as well. Colorado voters oppose the plan 49 - 46 percent, Iowa voters oppose the plan 55 - 40 percent, and in Virginia voters oppose the plan 51 - 45 percent.\n\nOther results from the poll include:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Voters in Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia want change..05/26/2016 19:40:42PM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Voters in Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia want change.", "title": "- Poll: Swing State Voters Not Giving Obama Credit For Economic Recovery", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2015/02/19/poll-voters-not-giving-obama-credit-for-economic-recovery-n1959437", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/40/0a726e4c-5bc5-4250-a14a-5b545cad2302.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Voters in Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia want change.", "title": "- Poll: Swing State Voters Not Giving Obama Credit For Economic Recovery", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2015/02/19/poll-voters-not-giving-obama-credit-for-economic-recovery-n1959437", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/40/0a726e4c-5bc5-4250-a14a-5b545cad2302.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Poll: Swing State Voters Not Giving Obama Credit For Economic Recovery, Conn Carroll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Colorado voters oppose the plan 49 - 46 percent, Iowa voters oppose the plan 55 - 40 percent, and in Virginia voters oppose the plan 51 - 45 percent.\nVoters in all three states have every reason to believe Obama's policies have hindered, not helped, the recovery.\n\"By margins of 24 points or higher, voters say they want the next president to change direction and not follow President Obama's policies,\" Quinnipiac Poll assistant director Peter Brown said in a release.\nThe Quinnipiac University poll of registered voters in Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia was conducted from February 5th through the 15th and was released Thursday.\nLooking ahead, voters in all three states are also highly skeptical of Obama's free community college plan as well."}
