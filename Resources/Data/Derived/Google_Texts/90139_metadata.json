But the weeks passing since the massacre in Paris of the highly talented Charlie Hebdo cartoonists for their depictions of the Prophet Muhammad have only granted a good number of commentators the opportunity to bedork themselves time and again, as they pen columns and make on-air statements that both spread confusion and betray commitments to untenable, morally reprehensible extenuative positions concerning Islam. This is tragic, for, if anything, the slaughter of European artists exercising their lawful right to self-expression in the capital of their own country offered us all a \u201cteachable moment\u201d sans pareil about the nature of the threat lurking within \u2013 in fact, innate to \u2014 the \u201creligion of peace.\u201d\n\nRarely have murderers so clearly manifested their motive. With the exclamations they made as they carried out their atrocity \u2014 \u201cAllahu Akbar!\u201d and \u201cOn a veng\u00e9 le proph\u00e8te Mohamed, on a tu\u00e9 Charlie Hebdo!\u201d (The prophet Muhammad has been avenged, we have killed Charlie Hebdo!) \u2014 the attackers explicitly told us they were killing for Islam, and imparted precisely the lesson they intended: Do not insult or ridicule our faith or you will pay the supreme price. They wrought violence against innocents who dared transgress the commandments of a religion they did not profess. What\u2019s more, they de facto succeeded in imposing sharia tenets well beyond the confines of the Islamic world. How many major publications or networks dared even publish the anodyne drawing of a teary-eyed, forgiving Muhammad that graced the cover of the post-massacre issue of Charlie Hebdo, to say nothing of the other images satirizing the Prophet that presumably led to the fire-bombing of the magazine\u2019s office in 2011? That so many Western media outlets shied away from doing so is more than scandalous. It unambiguously signals one thing: terrorism works. More lives are likely to be lost as a result.\n\nThose whose profession it ostensibly is to enlighten found ample grounds on which to rebut reality and muddy the waters around the matter at hand: the faith-motivated murder of cartoonists for doing nothing more than drawing cartoons. Serial Islam-apologist Reza Aslan appeared on Charlie Rose\u2018s show and admitted that the Quran has \u201cof course\u201d served as a \u201csource of violence\u201d for terrorists, but then resorted to his usual tiresome Derrida-esque double-talk when it came to discussing his religion\u2019s material role in the killings. \u201cWe bring our own values and norms to our scriptures; we don\u2019t extract them from our scriptures.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 Nicholas Kristof, an unwitting recidivist \u201cuseful idiot\u201d for Islamism, cautioned us to avoid \u201creligious profiling\u201d and contended that \u201cThe great divide is not between faiths. Rather it is between terrorists and moderates, between those who are tolerant and those who \u2018otherize.\u2019\u201d He is apparently unaware of Islamic traditions dividing the world into Dar al-Islam (the Abode of Islam, or Muslim regions) and Dar al-Harb (the Abode of War, where Muslims must strive against, and even do battle with, infidels, in order to convert them. For Kristof, a \u201cstrain of Islamic intolerance and extremism\u201d is the (mere) \u201cbackdrop to the attack on Charlie Hebdo.\u201d\n\nSusan Milligan, writing in U.S. News and World Report, opined that news outlets should feel no pressure to publish the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, since \u201cThis isn\u2019t about religion or respect, and it insults every peace-loving practicing Muslim to suggest otherwise.\u201d Wow. Has she converted to Islam? What gives her the right to speak for \u201cevery peace-loving practicing Muslim?\u201d\n\nThere are other examples, but foulest of all were the excretions emanating from James Zogby, president and founder of the Arab American Institute. I\u2019ll cite in full the opening paragraph of his Huffington Post op-ed:\n\n\u201cThe perpetrators of the horror at Charlie Hebdo were not devout Muslims outraged by insults directed at their faith. They were not motivated by religious piety, nor did they seek to strike a blow at \u2018freedom of expression.\u2019 Rather they were crude political actors who planned an act of terror \u2014 seeking to create the greatest possible impact. They were murderers, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nEvery sentence here, with the partial exception of the last, is so transparently counterfactual that no refutation is warranted. But it gets worse. Zogby goes on to spew toxic drivel he will never live down, informing readers that he believes in \u201cfreedom of expression, but\u201d \u2014 the \u201cbut\u201d here portends the most insidious kind of \u201cblame the victims\u201d slander \u2014 \u201cwith freedom also comes responsibility. Pope Francis got it right when he noted \u2018You cannot provoke. You cannot insult the faith of others. You cannot make fun of the faith of others\u2019. . . . As Francis added \u2018one cannot offend, make war, kill in the name of one\u2019s religion \u2014 that is in the name of God. To kill in the name of God is an aberration.\u2019\u201d\n\n(Except that in Islam, a faith long spread by the sword, it isn\u2019t. Dozens of Quranic suras and texts from the Hadith call upon Muslims to commit violence against unbelievers in the cause of jihad, including, of course, those who insult the Prophet Muhammad.)\n\nZogby continued, complaining of the \u201cprejudice against the religion of Islam\u201d evinced by some commentators, and bemoaning the \u201churt . . . Muslims have felt at the insults directed at the faith by the dominant secular French culture.\u201d He concluded with boilerplate gibberish, declaring that those who kill for religion \u201care not Muslim or Christian or Jewish or Hindu or Buddhist murderers or terrorists. Rather they are murderers or terrorists who defile the language of religion in a vain effort to justify their violence.\u201d\n\nZogby\u2019s is by far the most disgraceful, twisted, retrograde commentary on the Charlie Hebdo tragedy I have come across. Yet in adducing Pope Francis\u2019 admonition to those who would insult faith, he unintentionally makes a point: Representatives of the world\u2019s major religions usually stand together in calling for respect for their institutionalized fables, and they still, even now, usually get it. After all, respect, at least of a sort, is just what theocrats of old exacted, on pain of torture and death, when they ruled during the brutal millennium before the Renaissance that was once (and justly) known as the Dark Ages.\n\nWe are accustomed to reflexively deferring to \u201cmen of the cloth,\u201d be they rabbis and priests or pastors and imams. In this we err, and err gravely. Those whose profession it is to spread misogynistic morals, debilitating sexual guilt, a hocus-pocus cosmogony, and tales of an enticing afterlife for which far too many are willing to die or kill, deserve the exact same \u201crespect\u201d we accord to shamans and sorcerers, alchemists and quacksalvers. Out of misguided notions of \u201ctolerance,\u201d we avert our critical gaze from the blatant absurdities \u2014 parting seas, spontaneously igniting shrubbery, foodstuffs raining from the sky, virgin parturitions, garrulous slithering reptiles, airborne ungulates \u2014 proliferating throughout their \u201choly books.\u201d We suffer, in the age of space travel, quantum theory and DNA decoding, the ridiculous superstitious notion of \u201choly books.\u201d And we countenance the nonsense term \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d banishing those who forthrightly voice their disagreements with the seventh-century faith to the land of bigots and racists; indeed, the portmanteau vogue word\u2019s second component connotes something just short of mental illness.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Out of misguided notions of \u201ctolerance,\u201d we avert our critical gaze from blatant absurdities.
