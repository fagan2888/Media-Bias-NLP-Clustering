Social Security Q&A Reporting Social Security on Income Tax Return, Benefits as Military Retiree in SSA Q&A SSA-1099 forms reporting benefit payments for 2013 will be mailed by January 31 Jan. 9, 2014 \u2013 Many are surprised they have to report their Social Security benefit on their income tax form, but it is explained by Oscar Garcia, Public Affairs Specialist, with the Social Security Administration in this week\u2019s Social Security Q&A. He also has an answer for a military retiree who wonders if he can also get a Social Security benefit. Question: My parents are still able to manage their own finances, including Social Security. However, I am helping them with their income tax return, and I just found out they need to report their Social Security benefits. I do not have their SSA-1099 forms as of yet. How can I request a copy of these forms? Answer: More than likely all you have to do is wait for the forms to arrive by mail later this month. Each January we mail a Social Security Benefit Statement (Form SSA-1099) showing the amount of benefits received in the previous year. The SSA-1099/1042S for Tax Year 2013 will be mailed by January 31, 2014. You can request a replacement SSA-1099/1042S for Tax Year 2013 on or after February 1, 2014. You can use this Benefit Statement when you complete their federal income tax return to find out if their benefits are subject to tax.
