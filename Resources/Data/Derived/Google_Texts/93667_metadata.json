The brief is basically just another explanation of why the law is built the way it is, the same one we\u2019ve been having for six or seven years now, to which Republicans\u2019 only response is \u201cyeah, but FREEDOM!\u201d If you\u2019re familiar with the basic workings of the law, as anyone who reports on it should be, then you do not need the American Academy of Actuaries to tell you that Republican plans to \u201cfix\u201d the ACA will really just screw it up, which is the point.\n\nBut anyway. What happens if the Court strikes down premium subsidies for the approximately three dozen states that use federally facilitated exchanges? \u201cAn immediate or near-term elimination of federal premium subsidies would cause massive disruption in the individual market,\u201d the Academy writes. \u201cPotentially millions of people would drop coverage, and the average costs of those remaining insured would soar. Insurers could face solvency concerns, especially those for whom exchange business is a relatively large share of their book of business.\u201d People would drop their coverage, the individual mandate would be weakened as more could qualify for hardship exemptions, risk pools would be disrupted, those who need insurance would pay higher costs. Bad.\n\nSo then what about the alleged \u201csolutions\u201d that Republicans are throwing around, like those in the Ron Johnson bill?\n\nFirst there\u2019s the item that Johnson is so generously willing to offer Democrats/millions of people with subsidized plans: a temporary extension of subsidies into 2017. \u201cEven if a temporary extension of premium subsidies would help avoid disruption in the short term, it is likely that the disruption would be only delayed, not avoided,\u201d the Academy writes. Since the Republican plan is to temporarily extend the subsidies with the explicit purpose of \u201creplacing\u201d Obamacare with ??? in two years, it\u2019s just delaying the disaster.\n\nIn exchange for a temporary extension of subsidy availability, Johnson\u2019s bill would eliminate the individual mandate. Just asking for a \u201clittle bit of freedom,\u201d is he how puts it. Eliminating the individual mandate could \u201ccould threaten the viability of the health insurance market,\u201d the Academy warns. \u201cWhen health insurance markets include guaranteed issue and modified community rating requirements to ensure that coverage is available to people with pre-existing conditions, market viability depends on attracting a broad cross section of risks.\u201d That\u2019s what the individual mandate is in there for \u2014 to ensure that younger and healthier people purchase health insurance. It\u2019s not in there because Democratic lawmakers thought people would hold parades in the streets celebrating it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new paper explains why the Senate GOP's Obamacare \"fix\" wouldn't fix anything.
