In general, the main impetus to hire a contract cleaner is to save money and time. Increases in construction spending, disposable personal income, and business establishments are expected to support advances in cleaning service revenue. However, the outsourcing trend has been maturing in some markets, and while the high level of price competition helps make these services affordable to more potential users, it also will restrain further gains in market value.\n\n\n\nNonresidential market trends to favor outsourced cleaning services\n\n\n\nNonresidential markets account for the vast majority of cleaning service revenues, making up almost 80 percent of the total in 2014. In general, demand for cleaning services in the nonresidential market is more inelastic than in the residential market because cleaning functions are often essential to presenting a safe and clean facility for customers and employees. However, in many cases these operations are outside the core capabilities of the business and so are contracted out. In addition, the 2010 Affordable Care Act's insurance mandate has raised the cost of maintaining an inhouse staff, prompting some companies to outsource services. Companies continue outsourcing cleaning activities rather than spend their resources hiring, training, and maintaining an in-house cleaning staff. In addition, ongoing expansion in both the amount of nonresidential floor space and the number of businesses will spur demand for contract cleaning services.\n\n\n\nGrowth in residential market demand to accelerate\n\n\n\nDemand for contract cleaning services in the residential market will accelerate through 2019 due to an increased number of households, an aging population, and the growing number of dual-income households. Members of dual-income households often do not have the time or the inclination to perform cleaning tasks. Additionally, older citizens are sometimes less able to perform cleaning tasks than they once were, particularly as a growing share choose to stay in their homes and age in place. Accelerating growth in disposable personal income levels will also benefit residential cleaning services.\n\n\n\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p0883967-summary/view-report.html\n\n\n\nAbout Reportlinker\n\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
