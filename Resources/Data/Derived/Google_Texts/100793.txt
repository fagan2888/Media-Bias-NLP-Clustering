It was a quiet day at Avalanche practice, which was probably a good thing. There were no injuries, for instance.

In fact, the Avs got some good news regarding one player’s health. Tomas Vincour, who played his first game of the season for the Avs Saturday, spent his time after the contest getting X-rays on his left foot. He took a shot off the foot in the third period against Carolina and didn’t return, but the film showed that things were fine, other than a bruise, and he practiced Sunday.

Otherwise, it was an optional practice, and several players exercised their choice to sit it out.

Coach Patrick Roy even took the practice off, and also the day from reporters. That left the question unanswered as to whom will start in goal for the Avs’ next game, Tuesday in Arizona.

Will it be rookie Calvin Pickard, who earned his first career victory in relief of Reto Berra against Carolina, or will Roy give Berra another chance despite allowing six goals on the last 36 shots faced?

We’ll know definitively the answer to that question after practice Monday.
