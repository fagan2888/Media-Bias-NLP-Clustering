New branding took place Monday for a metro hospital system. Nebraska Medical Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center Physicians and Bellevue Medical Center will now be known as “Nebraska Medicine.”

The logos were changed Monday morning and the advisory board said the transition will not only make the organization stronger, but also improve the patient experience through better coordination of care, including your hospital bills coming from just one source: Nebraska Medicine.
