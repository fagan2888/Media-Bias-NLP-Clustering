"Why We Identify with Mutants: X-Men Screenwriter Simon Kinberg," Produced by Tracy Oppenheimer

Original release date was September 5, 2014 and the original writeup is below.

"There's always suspicion of large organizations in immense amounts of power," says X-Men screenwriterSimon Kinberg. "Whether it's a corporation or a government, or an evil society of mutants. Especially when they are all working together."

In addition to a slew of Hollywood blockbusters, Kinberg has written and produced the latest X-Men: Days of Future Past, as well as the upcoming X-Men: Apocolypse, The Fantastic Four, and Star Wars Rebels. Reason TV's Tracy Oppenheimer caught up with Kinberg at San Diego Comic-Con to discuss the mass appeal of the X-Men films and why they are so relatable to a mainstream audience.

Kinberg explains how the character and plot developments in the X-Men series parallel some real-world themes like xenophobia, individuality, and government programs gone awry. "You have sort of the whole pantheon of human experience," says Kinberg.

About 5 minutes.
