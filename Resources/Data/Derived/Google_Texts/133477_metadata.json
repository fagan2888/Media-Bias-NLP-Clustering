These air bags can explode on impact and release shrapnel that cause further death and injury to drivers involved in a crash; in the past six years at least five deaths have been attributed to the faulty air bags.\n\nRelated: 7 Carmakers Recall Vehicles at Risk for Exploding Air Bags\n\nThe recall involves more than four million cars throughout the southwest, made mostly by Honda Motor. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said this week that Takata must expand the recall beyond its current scope.\n\nOn Friday morning Toyota announced a recall of some 423,000 of its luxury Lexus brand cars because of a possible fuel leak that could increase fire risks. And General Motors, of course, grabbed headlines earlier this year when it recalled 2.6 million vehicles with a faulty ignition switch that has been linked to more than 20 deaths. In the first action by a state against GM, Arizona filed a lawsuit against the company, seeking billions in damages from the alleged car defects.\n\nThere have also been dozens of other recalls this year involving millions of cars for everything from defective headlights to loose floor mats. In most cases, the recalls involve minor issues that don\u2019t pose a huge safety threat. As of last month, automakers had recalled more than 56 million vehicles this year, more than three times the number of new cars and trucks Americans will buy in 2015.\n\nRelated: 10 Hottest New Cars for 2015\n\n\u201cA big part of this is really manufacturers erring on the side of caution more than ever before,\u201d said Dave Sargent, vice president of global automotive at J.D. Power. \u201cNo manufacturer wants to be labeled as hiding information, so they\u2019re more willing to pull the trigger on a recall.\u201d\n\nThe glut of recent recalls, however, has become so commonplace that many consumers have simply begun tuning them out. That\u2019s a dangerous practice, say consumer advocates \u2013 especially without doing any research into the scope of the recall or the issue it\u2019s aimed at fixing.\n\nHere\u2019s how to find out whether your car is subject to a recall, and what to do about it:\n\nONE: Find out if your car has been recalled.\n\nMost manufacturers publish a list of all cars that are potentially subject to recall based on the year, make, and model of the vehicle. However, since autos produced in different plants may use parts from different suppliers, you\u2019ll need to run the VIN number on your car to be certain whether it\u2019s affected. The easiest way to check is to enter that number at SaferCar.gov, for a recall report specific to your vehicle. While you\u2019re there, sign up for email alerts for any future recalls that might affect your vehicle.\n\nRelated: The 10 Safest Small Cars and SUVs in America\n\nYou can skip this step if you regularly take your car into the dealership for an inspection. Dealers will check to see if there are any outstanding recalls during that inspection and usually will repair any issues for you during that visit. One note: Unaffiliated mechanics won\u2019t run this check during an inspection.\n\nTWO: Contact your manufacturer.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve learned of a potential defect, call your manufacturer\u2019s customer service department to find out what issue the recall focuses on and whether there truly is any danger. \u201cThey should be able to tell you if it\u2019s something that needs to be addressed immediately,\u201d said Phil Reed, consumer advice editor at Edmunds.com. \u201cFor the most extreme cases, the manufacturer may set up a separate phone line for inquiries and information.\u201d\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten all the facts, you can decide how quickly you need to move to get the repairs made\n\nTHREE: Make an appointment with your dealer.\n\nDealers must fix any recall-related issues for free. If they don\u2019t have the parts to make a repair right away, and it\u2019s an immediate safety issue, ask for a loaner car to drive for the time-being.\n\nRelated: Why Younger Americans Are Ditching Cars\n\nAll of these recalls, by the way, have been a boon for auto dealers, who are getting paid (by the manufacturer) to do the repairs \u2013 as well as getting face time with lots of potential customers who may not otherwise have come onto the lot. So be careful not to get upsold on repairs, or to make an auto purchase you weren\u2019t previously planning on.\n\nFOUR: Check for recalls before buying a new car.\n\nIf you are in the market for a used car, be sure to run that vehicle\u2019s VIN to be sure it isn\u2019t subject to a recall. Last year, more than 3.5 million cars for sale online had an open safety recall, according to Carfax.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s not your imagination: There really have been more auto recalls this year than eve", "title": "Air Bag or Other Car Part Recalled?
