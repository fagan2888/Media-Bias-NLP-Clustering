He also stressed patient education, which he said has been effective in battling the overprescribing of antibioitic medications.\n\nEarlier in the panel, the White House drug czar Michael Botticelli also warned that overprescribing was \"one of the top issues\" for the federal goverment.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think in the middle of an epidemic, it's too much to ask prescribers to take a minimum amount of education,\" said Botticelli, who has struggled himself with addiction.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"If we change prescribing practices, we can change the face of the epidemic.\"", "description": "\"If we change prescribing practices, we can change the face of the epidemic.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\"If we change prescribing practices, we can change the face of the epidemic.\"", "title": "Surgeon general doubles down on doctor training for opioids", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/278673-surgeon-general-doubles-down-on-doctor-training-to-contain-opioids", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/murthyvivek02042015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-04T11:52:04-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-05-04T11:52-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/278673-surgeon-general-doubles-down-on-doctor-training-to-contain-opioids", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-05-04T11:31-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-04T11:31:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-04T11:52:04-04:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/278673-surgeon-general-doubles-down-on-doctor-training-to-contain-opioids", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\"If we change prescribing practices, we can change the face of the epidemic.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Surgeon general doubles down on doctor training for opioids"}, "dcterms.title": "Surgeon general doubles down on doctor training for opioids"}, "article_summary": "Surgeon General Vivek Murthy on Wednesday called for more robust training for doctors who prescribe opioids, highlighting the medical community's role in combatting addiction.\nThe issue of prescriber training has long pitted groups like the American Medical Association against health officials like those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nMurthy, the nation\u2019s top doctor, called prescribing practices \u201ca key part\u201d of stemming the flow of painkillers, which have led to alarmingly high numbers of overdose deaths across the country.\nWhile he was careful not to blame doctors, Murthy specifically pointed to overprescribing in the 1990s as a force behind the epidemic.\nMurthy called on the federal government to make sure doctors \u201chave more tools\u201d to prevent the abuse of powerful painkillers like OxyContin."}
