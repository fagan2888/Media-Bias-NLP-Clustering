After Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina’s SuperPAC released an ad responding to Donald Trump criticizing her looks, View co-host Joy Behar attacked Fiorina for daring to invoke “women’s suffrage” given that she is pro-life and opposes ObamaCare.

The liberal ABC host lectured Fiorina on women’s issues and proclaimed she should “be ashamed of herself.” It’s not your face honey, it’s your policy.”

Behar’s anti-Fiorina rant included a laundry list of liberal issues that Fiorina does not support, and the View host asserted that the GOPer had the “nerve” to say she was pro-women’s rights simply for being conservative:

She has the nerve to use the term women’s suffrage when she’s against Planned Parenthood and women’s maternity leave. She’s against ObamaCare. She’s anti-choice. She uses the term women’s suffrage. She should be ashamed of herself. It’s not your face honey, it’s your policy.
