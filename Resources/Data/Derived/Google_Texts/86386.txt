During the Super Bowl victory parade in downtown Seattle yesterday, running back Marshawn Lynch got the crowd’s attention.

As he rode in the WWII-era Duck vehicle, Seattle Seahawks' running back Marshawn Lynch heard a fan beating on a drum. So, of course, he did what any normal football player would do, he asked if he could borrow it.

"As soon as he heard me beating the drum and he saw me, he turned around and looked right at me," John Scott, 41, told The Bellingham Herald. "Our eye contact was immediate. He kept waving his hands and asking for (the drum).”

And, like any fan in the crowd would do, Scott handed it over.
