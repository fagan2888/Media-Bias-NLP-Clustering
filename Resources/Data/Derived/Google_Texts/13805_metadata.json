Over 12 million people have enrolled in Medicaid under the ACA, with enrollment \u201chundreds of thousands beyond initial projections,\u201d wrote Politico, adding that the overruns in seven states with \u201cparticularly big surges\u201d come to \u201cnearly 1.4 million\u201d people in toto.\n\nPolitico cited several examples:\n\nIn Illinois, nearly 541,000 people had signed up as of December, far beyond the 199,000 adults the state had estimated would enroll in 2014. The numbers increased to nearly 634,000 as of April.\n\nIn Washington, 535,000 people had signed up as of March \u2014 already beating the state\u2019s January 2018 goal. Officials\u2019 projection for March had been just 190,365 newly eligible enrollees.\n\nIn Michigan, where the first-year enrollment projection was 323,000 people, sign-ups hit 605,000 before falling back to 582,000 earlier this month. Kentucky signed up nearly 311,000 new adults by the end of its 2014 fiscal year, more than double its initial projection of 148,000. And in February 2014, Minnesota forecast that 147,000 newly eligible adults would enroll by December, but actual enrollment that month was at nearly 194,000.\n\nThe situation would be even bleaker had the Supreme Court not declared the expansion optional for states in 2012, leading 21 states to pass on it. The Obama administration, bound and determined to get its way, is now trying to \u201cblackmail\u201d states into signing onto the expansion by threatening to withhold other Medicaid funding from states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, according to Jonathan Ingram and Josh Archambault of the Foundation for Government Accountability.\n\nAlthough some state opposition can be chalked up to partisanship \u2014 most of the recalcitrant states have Republican governors \u2014 there are also sound fiscal reasons for states to opt out of the expansion. The federal government is paying 100 percent of the cost of the expansion through next year; after that, it will gradually reduce its share to 90 percent, leaving states stuck with the rest of the tab. The more Medicaid enrollees there are, the more revenue states will have to come up with.\n\n\u201cThe expansion of Obamacare will cost our state taxpayers $5 billion [over 10 years],\u201d Florida Governor Rick Scott, a Republican who at one point supported Medicaid expansion, told Politico. \u201cName the health care program \u2014 I think the only one is Medicare Part D \u2014 that cost less than what they initially anticipated\u2026. Historically, if you look at the numbers, with the growth in Medicare costs, Medicaid costs, it\u2019s always multiples.\u201d\n\nAs Republican George LeMieux, a former U.S. senator from Florida, put it in a recent Tampa Bay Times op-ed, \u201cThe offer of free money for the first few years is \u2018poison candy\u2019 \u2014 alluring at first, but detrimental in the end.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, many people who were already eligible for Medicaid but had not enrolled have now done so because of the increased push for enrollment under ObamaCare \u2014 a problem even for those states that have balked at expanding the program, especially since the federal government covers only about half the cost for these beneficiaries. In California, 200,000 more previously eligible individuals signed up for Medicaid than were expected. Kentucky saw nearly 37,000 previously eligible enrollees, or 218 percent of forecast.\n\nOf course, even if Uncle Sam were footing the entire bill for all Medicaid enrollees, that would merely shift the problem from state capitals to Washington.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re spending twice as much on this program than expected, that\u2019s twice as much money that\u2019s being added to the national debt,\u201d the Foundation for Government Accountability\u2019s Nicholas Horton told Politico. Regardless of which level of government is paying for it, he remarked, \u201cYou\u2019re still going to spend more money overall. That\u2019s still taxpayer money.\u201d\n\nThere are, however, those who dismiss such concerns. \u201cSupporters of Obamacare say the enrollment surge might lead to some budget bumps down the road, but that the historic decline in the uninsured is a major achievement,\u201d penned Politico. \u201cIn addition, they say the expansion is providing significant health and economic benefits to states that more than offset costs.\u201d\n\nThe millions of new Medicaid enrollees who can\u2019t find doctors willing to see them \u2014 only half of family doctors accepted Medicaid patients in 2013, according to a survey by healthcare-staffing firm Merritt Hawkins \u2014 might beg to differ.\n\n\u201cIt goes to the false promise of the ACA,\u201d the Manhattan Institute\u2019s Avik Roy told USA Today, that Medicaid recipients are \u201cgiven a card that says they have health insurance, but they can\u2019t have access to physicians.\u201d\n\nAs a result, many of these new Medicaid beneficiaries are turning to emergency rooms for treatment of non-emergency conditions, the paper noted, citing a poll released earlier this month by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) finding that three-quarters of emergency physicians have seen increases in patient volume since the ACA took effect. Fifty-six percent of those polled said their Medicaid patient volume had grown.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have anywhere to go but the emergency room,\u201d ACEP president Mike Gerardi told USA Today. \u201cThis is what we predicted. We know people come because they have to.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it was perfectly predictable. A study published in the journal Science in January 2014 revealed that an expansion of Medicaid coverage in Oregon in 2009 led to significantly increased ER use by the newly covered individuals, mostly for less-than-urgent ailments.\n\nAll those extra ER visits come at a price. \u201cA 2013 report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation says going to an ER when a primary care visit would suffice costs $580 more for each visit,\u201d wrote USA Today. The alleged savings from expanding Medicaid \u2014 and then some \u2014 will quickly be eaten up by such excessive outlays. And there are other costs: longer ER wait times and more hurried, lower-quality treatment, even for those with genuine emergencies and private insurance.\n\nThe states that chose to expand Medicaid are, therefore, looking at major spending hikes in the not-too-distant future, in terms of both sheer numbers of Medicaid beneficiaries and their likely overuse of ERs. In fact, Katherine Baicker, an economist at the Harvard School of Public Health and one of the principal authors of the Science study, told the Wall Street Journal that her research suggests that widening Medicaid coverage hikes healthcare costs 25 percent to 35 percent per covered person. Those costs, of course, come right out of taxpayers\u2019 pockets.\n\nWhatever their reasons for not expanding Medicaid, the states that took that route can pat themselves on the back, and taxpayers \u2014 even those in other states \u2014 can thank them for their prudent decision.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Medicaid, enrollment, expanding, costs, ObamaCare, state budgets, emergency rooms, Illinois, Washington, Michigan", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/20913-obamacare-s-medicaid-enrollment-vastly-exceeding-expectations", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/a2354521db3e03dcdf202b5f82c7cf68_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cMedicaid enrollment under Obamacare is skyrocketing past expectations,\u201d reported Politico, and that means big trouble for federal and state budgets and hospital emergency rooms. by Mchael Tennant", "title": "ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid Enrollment Vastly Exceeding Expectations"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/a2354521db3e03dcdf202b5f82c7cf68_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f98\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMedicaid enrollment under Obamacare is skyrocketing past expectations,\u201d reported Politico, and that means big trouble for federal and state budgets and hospital emergency rooms.\n\u201cThe expansion of Obamacare will cost our state taxpayers $5 billion [over 10 years],\u201d Florida Governor Rick Scott, a Republican who at one point supported Medicaid expansion, told Politico.\nIn Michigan, where the first-year enrollment projection was 323,000 people, sign-ups hit 605,000 before falling back to 582,000 earlier this month.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re spending twice as much on this program than expected, that\u2019s twice as much money that\u2019s being added to the national debt,\u201d the Foundation for Government Accountability\u2019s Nicholas Horton told Politico.\nAnd in February 2014, Minnesota forecast that 147,000 newly eligible adults would enroll by December, but actual enrollment that month was at nearly 194,000."}
