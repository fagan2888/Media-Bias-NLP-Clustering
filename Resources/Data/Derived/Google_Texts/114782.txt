Sioux Falls, SD

While the rain stayed light in Sioux Falls with amounts of a quarter to a third of an inch, parts of KELOLAND had a good soaking of rain on Wednesday. Amounts totaled over an inch in Aberdeen, Chamberlain, and Rapid City.

If you missed the rain, there's more on the way, especially for the second half of the weekend.

The raw model data for that day suggests high ranging from the 20s in Custer to 80 degrees in Spencer, Iowa. In fact there's a 30 degree difference from Spencer to Marshall.



With a temperature difference like that, it's easy to see a chance for severe weather in eastern and southeast KELOLAND. So, it could end up being one of those days when we have severe weather in southeast KELOLAND and snow in western South Dakota.

We seem to get this type of contrast in the weather at least once or twice a year. The timing is right as we should expect in once in the spring and once in the fall.
