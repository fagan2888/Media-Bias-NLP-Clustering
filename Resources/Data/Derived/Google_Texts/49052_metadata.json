(AP) - Hundreds of thousands of books are published every year in the United States.\n\nMost get overlooked, remaindered, pulped, or consigned to the farthest outer reaches of Amazon.com, never to be read again.\n\nA former Indiana University Northwest English professor overcame the odds faced by most authors, especially those of academic titles. Miller Beach resident Anne Balay wrote a pioneering book about gay steelworkers that has opened eyes and inspired international workplace protections for gay and transgender steelworkers.\n\nBalay\u2019s \u201cSteel Closets: Voices of Gay, Lesbian and Transgender Steelworkers\u201d won the National Women\u2019s Studies Association\u2019s prestigious Sara A. Whaley Prize this year.\n\nThe book also helped prompt the United Steelworkers union to approve a civil rights resolution that includes a constitutional change protecting transgender workers as well as a requirement that local chapters discuss how they will protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender steelworkers before negotiating new contracts, such as by securing them equal health care benefits for their partners.\n\nThe union is studying whether every chapter could have a civil rights representative specially trained to work with GLBT workers so they feel comfortable coming forward with any complaints of harassment, and won\u2019t fear retaliation for doing so.\n\nThe resolution was first approved by Local 6787, which represents workers at ArcelorMittal Burns Harbor, and then when more than 2,500 elected union leaders from across North America gathered at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas in August for the USW\u2019s annual International Convention, Local 1010 President Tom Hargrove told The Times (http://bit.ly/W3plL4 ).\n\n\u201cWe will actively discourage members from engaging in discrimination and harassment of equality-seeking individuals or groups in the workplace and in union activities, and will not use disciplinary procedures to shield illegal discriminatory conduct,\u201d the resolution says in part.\n\nBalay pursued the changes, which will affect 1.2 million workers and retirees in the steel industry and a range of other sectors, including education, energy, health care, manufacturing, mining, oil, forestry, pharmaceuticals and rubber. She saw the need after interviewing 40 gay, lesbian and transgender steelworkers from Northwest Indiana for her book, which documents the abuse, fear, discrimination and physical attacks they have suffered at the mills.\n\nAs part of her extensive research, she met with the USW\u2019s civil rights coordinator in Pittsburgh and found GLBT steelworkers had not filed a single complaint about discrimination - ever.\n\n\u201cThey were too scared to come forward,\u201d she said. \u201cThey definitely had a sense this was a problem, but no one stood up to say it was a problem. Once the book came out though, even though the 40 steelworkers were anonymous, it was still out there that they were having these experiences. There was documentation this was happening.\u201d\n\nBalay discussed possible legal protections with the steelworkers she interviewed and it came up that the USW would have a constitution convention in August. She wanted to bring forward a resolution just to get union leaders talking and thinking about the issue, so she worked with the civil rights arm of the AFL-CIO union to write a draft.\n\nUSW local chapters approved a modified version in Porter County, and then New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California and Massachusetts. The resolution met with some resistance from southern delegates in Las Vegas, but president Leo Gerard shouted them down, saying there would be no discrimination in the union.\n\nFor the first time, the union\u2019s constitution adds gender identity to the list of protected classes. Gay and lesbian steelworkers can shield their identities, but transgender workers can\u2019t, so they face a disproportionate amount of harassment at the mills, Balay said.\n\nOne transgender steelworker she interviewed was recently beaten by colleagues outside a bar so badly the vertebrae in her neck were damaged as though she had suffered whiplash in a car wreck, Balay said.\n\n\u201cWorking in the factories is dangerous,\u201d Balay said. \u201cYou take your life in your hands every time you go to work. There\u2019s an added layer of danger for gay, lesbian and transgender steelworkers. But every single union member should have a safe workplace.\u201d\n\nThe USW resolution provided an immediate psychological boost for GLBT steelworkers who had long felt invisible and finally got recognition, Balay said. But the true test will be what changes in the mills take place over the next 10 years, and whether protections are written into contracts and harassment is discouraged.\n\n\u201cHopefully, future generations in the mills will have an easier life and more acceptance,\u201d she said.\n\nThe book\u2019s impact partly prompted Balay to drop a discrimination complaint she filed against IUN with the U.S. Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Council last year, after she was denied tenure.\n\n\u201cYou would expect universities to be more receptive to this issue than steel mills,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the USW listened, and the university made it clear they didn\u2019t care. So I\u2019m just going to move on. I\u2019ve got so many cool things to move on to.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times, http://www.thetimesonline.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hundreds of thousands of books are published every year in the United States.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/1/book-on-gay-steelworkers-prompts-union-changes/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of books are published every year in the United States.", "title": "Book on gay steelworkers prompts union changes"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of books are published every year in the United States.", "card": "summary", "title": "Book on gay steelworkers prompts union changes"}, "Author": "JOSEPH S.
