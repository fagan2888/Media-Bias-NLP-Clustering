Kim Brooks, the writer and mother who wrote on Salon about how an innocuous split-second decision changed her life forever, on Friday took her gripping story to “Good Morning America,” continuing the conversation she started about good parenting, technology and child welfare laws.

As she recalls in her essay, it was a cool day, and Brooks, in a rush, left her 4-year-old son strapped in the backseat of her car during a five-minute stop — something many good parents have done without incident. But someone noticed that her son was alone, videotaped him, and turned the evidence over to the police. Brooks, slapped with a misdemeanor charge for contributing to delinquency of a minor, struggled to understand how quickly her life unraveled and why, as her son became terrified that Mommy would one day be taken by the police. Stuck in a murky area between the letter of the law and the intent of the law, Brooks turned to support from her peers but found mixed responses.
