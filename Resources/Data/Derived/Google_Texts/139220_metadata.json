Airlines are still subject to FAA oversight and audits. He said SMS will help the Department of Transportation reach its goal of reducing U.S. commercial flying fatality rates by 50 percent by 2050.\n\n\u201cOur top priority is ensuring the safety of the traveling public,\" he said, adding \u201cthere\u2019s never been a safer time to fly in American than right now.\u201d\n\nFAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the administration is receiving data from 96 percent of airlines now.\n\nThe rule is estimated to cost the airlines $224.3 million in compliance over the next decade, but DOT estimates the benefits could save $205 million to $472.3 million over 10 years.\n\nThe FAA is offering a federally developed and funded software system to help airlines implement SMS. The system is expected to cost the FAA $2.6 million per year to maintain.\n\nThe rule will take effect in 60 days.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The SMS is designed to identify precursors to accidents.", "description": "The SMS is designed to identify precursors to accidents.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The SMS is designed to identify precursors to accidents.", "title": "FAA rule requires airlines to adopt safety management systems", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/228786-faa-rule-requires-airlines-to-adopt-a-safety-management-system", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/228786-faa-rule-requires-airlines-to-adopt-a-safety-management-system", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-07T13:36-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Air safety, Aviation, Federal Aviation Administration, Safety Management Systems, Airline,Anthony Foxx,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-07T13:36:10-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/228786-faa-rule-requires-airlines-to-adopt-a-safety-management-system", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The SMS is designed to identify precursors to accidents.", "card": "summary", "title": "FAA rule requires airlines to adopt safety management systems"}, "dcterms.title": "FAA rule requires airlines to adopt safety management systems"}, "article_summary": "The Federal Aviation Administration released a final rule Wednesday that will require most commercial airlines to have a Safety Management System (SMS) in place by 2018.\nThe administration is referring to SMS as a top-down, organizationwide approach to managing safety risk and measuring the effectiveness of safety controls.\nThe FAA is offering a federally developed and funded software system to help airlines implement SMS.\nThe system is expected to cost the FAA $2.6 million per year to maintain.\nThe rule requires all Part 121 operations, meaning scheduled airlines, to submit a specific plan to the FAA within six months and then put said plan in place within the next three years."}
