The more than 60 newly trained clinical care coordinators, from case management and nursing leadership roles, will oversee schedules from admission to discharge, Stack writes.\n\nThe program trumps patient-centeredness and performance focus by implementing leadership rounding, according to the article, and unit leaders work with senior leaders during the biweekly sessions. Though early in the process, the move has already increased visibility and engagement of leaders in solving patient-flow challenges, Stack says.\n\nNorthwest Community identified eight aspects to improve overall length of stay, including time from:\n\nBed request to bed assigned Bed assigned to patient in bed Test ordered to test completed Test completed to results available Transport request to transport completed Room cleaning request to room available Pending transfer order to transfer completed Discharge order to room available\n\nThe hospital has already seen cycle-time improvements in four of the eight milestones, and expects to see improvements in the remaining four as the program grows and improves. Length of stay dropped from 4.2 days to 3.93 days immediately post-implementation, but has since returned to previous levels, Stack writes. However, hospital officials expect the number to continue to decrease over the next six to 12 months.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMichigan hospitals' quality initiatives save $116 million in costs, improve care\n\nUse analytics to unkink patient flow\n\nER best practice improve flow\n\nHow to conduct hospital CEO rounding", "article_metadata": {"description": "One independent community hospital in Illinois adopted a new\u00a0patient-flow\u00a0model that reduced length of stay, bolstered\u00a0hospital culture\u00a0and improved patient flow, according to an\u00a0article\u00a0in\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "One independent community hospital in Illinois adopted a new\u00a0patient-flow\u00a0model that reduced length of stay, bolstered\u00a0hospital culture\u00a0and improved patient flow, according to an\u00a0article\u00a0in\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks.", "title": "Patient flow model helps independent community hospital improve length of stay, culture", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/patient-flow-model-helps-independent-community-hospital-improve-length-stay/2014-08-15", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "care coordinators,Care Delivery,hospital culture,length of stay,Northwest Community Healthcare,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient flow", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee24\"", "article_summary": "One independent community hospital in Illinois adopted a new patient-flow model that reduced length of stay, bolstered hospital culture and improved patient flow, according to an article in Hospitals & Health Networks.\nLength of stay dropped from 4.2 days to 3.93 days immediately post-implementation, but has since returned to previous levels, Stack writes.\nTo learn more:- here's the articleRelated Articles:Michigan hospitals' quality initiatives save $116 million in costs, improve careUse analytics to unkink patient flowER best practice improve flowHow to conduct hospital CEO rounding\nHowever, hospital officials expect the number to continue to decrease over the next six to 12 months.\nThough early in the process, the move has already increased visibility and engagement of leaders in solving patient-flow challenges, Stack says."}
