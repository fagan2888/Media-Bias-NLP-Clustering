He finished third in a straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference this year, ahead of Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.\n\nLast week, he had breakfast with Washington journalists, mainly conservatives, and spoke at the National Press Club.\n\nHe is dazzling conservative audiences across the country. They love his story \u2014 a poor black kid from Detroit\u2019s inner city who rose to be a pre-eminent pediatric neurosurgeon \u2014 and his strongly held traditional conservative values.\n\nThe 62-year-old, who has written best-selling books about his story, medical career and, most recently, his vision for America, says his candidacy depends on what he hears from the public and God.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike the boomlets for Mr. Cronkite, the celebrated television anchorman, and Mr. Iacocca, the high-powered automobile executive, neither of whom ran \u2014 or for nonpoliticians who did run, such as the publisher Steve Forbes, the pizza executive Herman Cain or Gen. Wesley Clark \u2014 the Carson candidacy likely will falter. The reason: Running for president isn\u2019t for political novices.\n\n(A personal aside: Dr. Carson is a hero in our home. Sixteen years ago, he operated on our critically injured son and gave him a new lease on life. His extraordinary talents were matched by his kindness.)\n\nHe\u2019s already discovering that, even without a spotlight, politics isn\u2019t brain surgery, and that you can get in trouble with careless comments. For example, he linked same-sex marriage to bestiality and then apologized.\n\nIn his calm, appealing manner, he unleashed a harsh critique of the Affordable Care Act at the National Prayer Breakfast last year, in front of President Obama. He has gone on to call Obamacare \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d which, he said, it resembles. He later explained he was talking about any attempt to take away an individual\u2019s control of his or her life. He hasn\u2019t included Medicare in that critique yet.\n\nWith no experience in the grass-roots vineyards, he will unwittingly rattle, or alienate, some on the right with assertions that don\u2019t hew to conservative orthodoxy. Some examples: the 2008 financial crash was caused by the financial deregulation of the 1990s; health insurance companies should be regulated like utilities; and all federal spending, including defense (and medical research), should be cut by 10 percent, no exceptions.\n\nHis foreign policy views, a work in progress, sometimes seem closer to those of Sen. Rand Paul than former Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s. Dr. Carson thinks both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were a mistake; economic pressure and a crash energy independence project would have worked better. On Syria, he sounds like Mr. Obama.\n\nDr. Carson calls for straight talk and an end to all political correctness.\n\nThat sounds appealing, but it doesn\u2019t work in the real world of presidential politics.\n\nWith a huge, diverse electorate, there\u2019s a premium on stitching together coalitions and finding common ground to get more than 50 percent of the vote. That is why, over the past century, the United States only once elected someone with no electoral experience: Dwight D. Eisenhower, who as the supreme allied commander in World War II demonstrated exceptional political skills.\n\nCorporations don\u2019t seek out nonbusiness types to be chief executives, football teams don\u2019t pick coaches who haven\u2019t been associated with the sport and symphonies don\u2019t select the tone deaf as conductors. Whatever the superficial appeal of the nonpolitician mantra, presidential politics is for politicians.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140601125012, "twitter": {"description": "Benjamin Carson, a retired physician at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, has become a favorite of the political right as he weighs a run for the Republican presidential nomination.", "title": "The Lasting Appeal of the Nonpolitician Politician", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/politics/the-lasting-appeal-of-benjamin-carson-the-nonpolitician-politician.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002913575"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/politics/the-lasting-appeal-of-benjamin-carson-the-nonpolitician-politician.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002913575", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/politics/the-lasting-appeal-of-benjamin-carson-the-nonpolitician-politician.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "The Lasting Appeal of the Nonpolitician Politician", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 1, 2014", "edt": "Global", "org": "Johns Hopkins University", "keywords": "Carson  Benjamin S,Doctors,United States Politics and Government,Obama  Barack,Conservative Political Action Conference,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Same-Sex Marriage  Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships,Johns Hopkins University,Presidential Election of 2016", "news_keywords": "Doctor", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Albert R.
