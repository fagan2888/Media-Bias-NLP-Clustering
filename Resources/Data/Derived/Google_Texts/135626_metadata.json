According to Democracy Alliance documents obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, OFA\u2019s board of directors includes four Democracy Alliance \u201cpartners,\u201d individuals who pay $30,000 in annual dues and contribute at least $200,000 to the left-wing groups that Democracy Alliance supports.\n\nAn additional five Democracy Alliance members sit on OFA\u2019s \u201cadvisory board.\u201d According to the Democracy Alliance documents, that advisory board is expected to grow from 65 to 75 members this year, and to collectively provide \u201cat least $3.5 million\u201d in OFA financing.\n\nThe Democracy Alliance began fundraising for OFA in 2013, the same year that it launched as a 501(c)(4) advocacy group to push liberal policy priorities such as carbon emission restrictions, immigration reform, and gun control.\n\nMany of OFA\u2019s top issues are low on Americans\u2019 list of political priorities, polls show, but Democracy Alliance has been an enthusiastic supporter.\n\n\u201cOFA is a strong partner to many organizations in the progressive movement and has established a strong track record on a host of issues,\u201d state promotional materials said, detailing up to $40 million in Democracy Alliance support for 20 groups this year, including OFA.\n\nAccording to those materials, Democracy Alliance is hoping to steer between $600,000 and $1 million to OFA this year. Data compiled by the Sunlight Foundation shows that Democracy Alliance donors have already given $500,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nThe bulk of Democracy Alliance\u2019s support for OFA has come from Amy Goldman Fowler, who was listed on documents obtained by the Free Beacon as one of the Alliance\u2019s newest partners, having signed on in 2013.\n\nGoldman gave OFA $500,000 that year and another $250,000 from January to April of 2014.\n\nOther Democracy Alliance partners who donated this year include Ryan Smith, who chipped in $50,000 on top of $300,000 in 2013 contributions; Jon Stryker, brother of founding Democracy Alliance member Pat Stryker, who gave $100,000 in the first quarter, matching his 2013 donations; and Wayne Jordan and his wife Quinn Delaney, who gave a combined $100,000 to OFA in the first quarter on top of the $50,000 Jordan donated last year.\n\nAccording to Democracy Alliance documents, those are only half of the Alliance partners supporting OFA. \u201cInvestment portfolio\u201d brochures for both Fall 2013 and Spring 2014 say that 10 Democracy Alliance partners are supporting the group.\n\nUnlike many political groups, the Democracy Alliance does not actually solicit donations or spend money. Instead, it connects major left-wing donors to groups that Democracy Alliance has strategically vetted and recommended for support.\n\nThe arrangement means that there is little public documentation about how many partners Democracy Alliance has, how much money they donate, and which groups that money supports. So while Sunlight noted the overlap between Democracy Alliance members and OFA donors, others on its list of top financiers may also be connected with the Alliance.\n\nThose ambiguities complicate OFA\u2019s frequent refrain that it greatly exceeds its legal requirements for the disclosure of donor information.\n\nWhile it does disclose more than the law requires, large amounts of information about its donor base, especially with respect to that base\u2019s overlap with Democracy Alliance members, remain shrouded from public scrutiny.\n\nWhile Sunlight lauded OFA for disclosing some donor information, it criticized the group for making its list of donors difficult to search and sort, and for declining to disclose the professional affiliations of those donors.\n\nProblems with the disclosures, Sunlight wrote, \u201cillustrate the capriciousness of \u2018voluntary\u2019 disclosure. What is given can easily be taken away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Internal documents reveal 10 DA members support OFA, nine sit on its corporate boards", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Members of a major left-wing dark money outfit are providing large chunks of cash for, and serving as top advisers and officers of, President Barack Obama\u2019s personal advocacy group.
