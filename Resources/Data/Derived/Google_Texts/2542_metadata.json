(Photo: Monica Land for The Clarion-Ledger)\n\nFor the past 18 years, Barney Shepherd, an 87-year-old World War II veteran from Philadelphia, has purchased a box of 22 glucose test strips to check his Type 2 diabetes for $25.\n\nWhen he wanted to increase the count to 50, the cost was $90.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s too high. And I don\u2019t understand how they can do that,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cA box of 50 should have been less than $50. I\u2019m disabled. I can\u2019t go to Meridian. I can\u2019t go to Carthage. I can\u2019t go nowhere else.\u201d\n\nBut where in Mississippi he buys those strips doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nIn the state with the second-highest incidence of diabetes in the country, the cost of diabetes-related medication is the same from the Tennessee line to the Gulf Coast. And it\u2019s true across the country.\n\nMany individuals on a fixed income, like Shepherd, have no choice but to pay what the retailer wants.\n\n\u201cWe have people that make too much for Medicaid and others who can\u2019t afford the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Irena McClain, associate director of the Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi. \u201cBetween the rapid increase in some of the insulin analogs \u2026 and some of the newer oral medicines \u2026 people are really struggling to make ends meet and take good care of themselves.\u201d\n\nHigh incidence rate\n\nIn its 2012 statistics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Mississippi had the second-highest rate of diabetes in the nation with 11.7 percent. The Diabetes Foundation said that\u2019s about 280,000 people who know they have the disease and 93,000 others who don\u2019t.\n\nAnd yet, with a staggering number of residents on meds for some form of diabetic or renal disorder, the costs of diabetic supplies seems higher in Mississippi than in many other states.\n\nMcClain said in the last 30 years, genetic engineering has taken over and insulin is no longer taken from cows and pigs but is genetically engineered \u201chuman\u201d insulin.\n\n\u201cThese engineered insulins are the ones that we\u2019ve seen a dramatic increase in the cost,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t figure that out. They work really well. And we\u2019re creating these in yeast and bacteria. So it\u2019s not like it takes some special animal to create these insulin analogs.\u201d\n\nWhen these rapid-acting insulin analogs were first introduced in the late 1990s, the cost was $45 a vial, McClain said, and that was considered extreme. Today, those same analogs are nearly $300 a vial.\n\n\u201cMedicaid will cover those analogs,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so will Medicare, provided you\u2019re not already in the \u2018donut hole,\u2019 or beyond your coverage limit.\u201d\n\nIndividual pharmaceutical companies set the cost of prescription meds. The Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission regulate those costs.\n\nWhile the pharmaceutical companies argue their prices help fund research and product development, naysayers insist the majority of their capital is being spent on marketing and administrative costs, according to the Professional Staff Congress, the union that represents more than 25,000 faculty and staff at the City University of New York.\n\nHowever, the Bureau of Competition, a division of the FTC that protects consumer interests, said it has examined the issue several times and found the reason for the increase or decrease of a drug is often the result of \u201cnormal market forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne common cause of a sudden spike in the price of a drug is the development of a supply problem, such as an ingredient shortage,\u201d Alan Friedman of the FTC said in a blog.\n\nAffordability factor\n\nAs medical technology continues to produce even better medications to treat Types 1 and 2 diabetes, the affordability factor remains a constant barrier for many.\n\nThe Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi, which for 50 years has worked to help individuals and families throughout the state to cope with, adjust to and manage diabetes, in a large percentage of cases, donates and pays for diabetic supplies for those unable to do so themselves.\n\nLauren and Wayne Shinault of Batesville were baffled by their then 2-year-old daughter\u2019s lethargy. Kristen was thirsty all time, urinating throughout the day and night, and, at 24 pounds, was losing weight. Kristen was on the verge of diabetic coma when she was finally diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Insulin injections brought back their playful child.\n\nBut keeping her blood sugar regulated was another story. While Shepherd, who has Type 2 diabetes, checks his blood sugar once a day, Kristen Shinault\u2019s needs to be checked several times a day.\n\n\u201cThe doctor wrote her prescription for 300 test strips a month, and Medicaid would only give her 200 and she would always run out,\u201d Lauren Shinault said. \u201cSo, we had to do fundraisers to pay for her medical expenses because we didn\u2019t have the money. I\u2019m a stay-at-home mom. I homeschool my kids, and my husband works. He has a full-time job and he works really hard, but we didn\u2019t have the extra money to pay for all of the medical supplies.\u201d\n\nMcClain said people with diabetes need the ability to check their blood sugar as often as they want.\n\n\u201cThe gold standard used to be four times a day,\u201d she said. \u2018But I\u2019d be happy if people had access to their test strips to check it twice a day. And people with Type 1 diabetes often check their sugar six, eight or more times a day to keep it tightly controlled.\u201d\n\nThe problem with programs like Medicare and Medicaid can be whether they cover a particular product, and when Medicaid stops covering the person.\n\n\u201cKids will be on Medicaid until they turn 19, and Medicaid will cover the pumps, the insulin and the strips for those with Type 1 diabetes,\u201d McClain said. \u201cBut when the child turns 19, they\u2019re off Medicaid.\u201d\n\nMcClain said not only is blood sugar better managed with an insulin pump \u2014 which costs about $6,000 plus $300 a month for supplies \u2014 but a patient can use it in smaller increments.\n\nMedicaid can change its drug policies and has a committee of 12 physicians, nurse practitioners and practicing pharmacists who conduct clinical evaluations and recommend appropriate drugs for preferred status on the Division of Medicaid\u2019s preferred drug list and/or drugs for prior authorization.\n\nAnother option to help defray high drug costs is generics.\n\n\u201cWe understand that drug prices have a direct impact on the ability of people to cope with their illnesses as well as meet other expenses,\u201d said Eric Pahon, a press officer with the FDA in Washington, D.C. \u201cAnd while FDA does not regulate the price of drugs, we will continue to make safe and effective generic drugs available to the public as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Wayne Woo, the sole practitioner at the Diabetes and Endocrinology Institute in Flowood, said in some cases, generics are not always better when it comes to diabetes management.\n\n\u201cMedicare prefers we do generics,\u201d Woo said. \u201cBut some of these generics are very old and are not safe, especially in the elderly. If patients understood how these new medications work, they would understand why we should use the newer meds.\u201d\n\nSome pharmaceutical companies have patient assistant programs that offer prescription drugs for free or for a fraction of the cost. But in the end, organizations like the Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi, continue to reach out to as many as they can.\n\n\u201cIt really does scare me to think about some of the people we help,\u201d McClain said. \u201cWe\u2019re actively telling doctor\u2019s offices to go to the insulin assistance pages online so they can get samples for the patients because the need is huge. There are free clinics around the state where people can go and get assistance. But we\u2019re the only diabetes group, that I know of, that buys the supplies for people.\u201d\n\nWhat is Diabetes?\n\nDiabetes results from an inability to use and/or produce insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas. Insulin helps get glucose \u2014 a form of sugar from the foods we eat \u2014 into our body cells to burn for energy. After eating, blood glucose levels rise, and insulin is produced to help get glucose into cells. If the body cannot produce insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or cannot use it properly (Type 2 diabetes), blood glucose levels build up in the blood. Diabetes is diagnosed based on elevated blood glucose levels.\n\nType 1\n\nType 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults and was previously known as \u201cjuvenile diabetes.\u201c Only 5 percent of people with diabetes have this form of the disease.\n\nWhy it occurs\n\nThe body\u2019s immune system attacks part of its own pancreas. Scientists are not sure why. But the immune system mistakenly sees the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas as foreign and destroys them. This attack is known as \u201cautoimmune\u201d disease. A person with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily.\n\nThese cells are the ones that sense glucose in the blood and, in response, produce the necessary amount of insulin to normalize blood sugars. Insulin serves as a \u201ckey\u201d to open the cells, to allow the glucose to enter \u2014 and allows for the glucose to be used for energy.\n\nWithout insulin, there is no key. So, the sugar stays \u2014 and builds up \u2014 in the blood. The result: The body\u2019s cells starve from lack of glucose. And, if left untreated, the high level of blood sugar can damage eyes, kidneys, nerves and the heart and can lead to coma and death.\n\nType 2\n\nThe most common form of diabetes is Type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin-dependent diabetes. This is also called \u201cadult onset\u201d diabetes, since it typically develops after age 35. However, a growing number of younger people are now developing Type 2 diabetes. Ninety to 95 percent of people diagnosed with diabetes have Type 2.\n\nWhy it occurs\n\nType 2 diabetes is most often associated with genetics and lifestyle and has even been nicknamed a \u201cdisease of lifestyles.\u201d The body does not use insulin properly. At first, the pancreas makes extra insulin to make up for it. But over time, it isn\u2019t able to keep up and can\u2019t make enough insulin to keep your blood glucose at normal levels. This is called insulin resistance. This usually occurs with excess weight and physical inactivity.\n\nType 2 diabetes has a higher inheritance risk Than type 1. Common factors associated with Type 2 diabetes include obesity, family history of diabetes, prior diagnosis of gestational diabetes, physical inactivity and race/ethnicity.\n\nType 2 diabetes is serious, controllable and preventable. Moderate diet and exercise that results in a 5 percent to 7 percent weight loss can delay and possibly prevent Type 2 diabetes.\n\nSources: Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi, Mississippi Department of Health, American Diabetes Association, Diabetes Research Institute.\n\nType 2\n\nThe most common form of diabetes is Type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin-dependent diabetes.
