Operation Backpack was created to give the children living in NYC's shelters new school supplies.

When you're a kid, showing up to the first day of school with a new backpack full of cool school supplies is a big part of the excitement. Most kids look forward to that annual trip to Staples, but there are many parents who can't afford a place to live, let alone new school supplies for their kids. Volunteers of America is giving people a way to help homeless children through its Operation Backpack campaign.

VOA is urging those who are able to fill a backpack with school supplies, which will be given to a homeless child before school starts in August. The backpack and school supply drive runs from July 14 through August 8 with drop-off centers at every Duane Reade across all five boroughs. You can even buy the school supplies at Duane Reade and drop it off in the donation box while you're there.

The VOA's goal is to give out 16,500 new backpacks with school supplies and distribute them to every child in the New York City shelter system in mid-August. For more information about Operation Backpack, head to www.OperationBackpackNYC.org.
