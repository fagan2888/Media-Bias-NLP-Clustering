She kept count. This is her story.\n\nBoat owners who think they can dump a boat in the California Delta had better not leave it in the Clarksburg area. There is a tenacious woman there, Anna Swenson, who will call every government agency in the state, if necessary, to get rid of the boat and hopefully have them penalize the boat owner for leaving it there.\n\nMrs. Swenson pointed out the problem to members of North Delta Community Area Residents for Environmental Stability of Clarksburg, better known by its acronym, North Delta CARES, at their weekly Thursday night meeting, which usually takes on bigger issues like the governor\u0092s twin tunnels that have threatened the quaint, charming river town on the Sacramento River.\n\nBut recently she wanted to vent her spleen about having to call 25 government agencies about one houseboat that its owner had dumped on the Sacramento River in the Clarksburg area.\n\nShe said the houseboat used to park along the levees. \u0093One day it was just kind of brought up on the levee and it sat there for months and months,\u0094 she began telling the audience. \u0093I have called every agency that has anything to do with the Delta. The only person who ever responded was Raymond Costantino from the Delta Protection Commission. He said if there is an abandoned vessel in the Delta, whatever county is responsible has to publish a notice to the owner, unless the owner is standing there. Then they can seize the boat and take it away. And the counties do not want to publish an advertisement for just one boat owner. They want an accumulation of boats before they can publish a $15 advertisement in the local newspaper.\u0094\n\nThe frustrated Mrs. Swenson warned that if there is a high-water event in the Delta or if the boat just breaks up, \u0093that ship will become dislodged and will hit something on our Delta \u0097 someone\u0092s property, dock, or bridge. All things in the Delta float south.\u0094\n\nIf California\u0092s counties cannot afford a newspaper legal ad, then area residents might want to pry the pennies out of their piggy banks.\n\n\u0093We could pass the hat and raise $15,\u0094 said a smiling Barbara Daly, a Clarksburg resident and librarian.\n\n\u0093The powers that be are not taking the safety of our property and the Delta seriously,\u0094 continued Mrs. Swenson. Bob Kirtlan, a Clarksburg property owner, said the houseboat owner had already had three run-ins with Sacramento County and \u0093then made a mistake of parking on my property. I told him he had two days to remove it. Then he went across the river and now it\u0092s Mark Scribner\u0092s problem.\u0094\n\nMark Pruner, an attorney and founder of North Delta CARES, said he has learned through Erik Vink at the Delta Protection Commission that they can get help through the state Department of Parks and Recreation, since the Recreational Boaters of California are now rolled into that department. \u0093They have some say about abandoned vessels and removing them.\u0094\n\nMr. Kirtlan warned that there are marine laws to follow. \u0093If the vessel is in distress, he\u0092s allowed to stay there,\u0094 said Mr. Kirtlan.\n\n\u0093But it shouldn\u0092t take 25 calls, which is what I did, ranging from the Coast Guard to counties to county supervisors. We shouldn\u0092t have to do that. These agencies should be able to say, \u0093Oh, for an abandoned vessel, call this person, instead of \u0091Let me get back to you.\u0092\u0094\n\nShe said the Coast Guard only empties any fuel out of the vessel, or toxic substances, which they did, she reported.\n\n\u0093It is a very mysterious, non-transparent process in this Delta,\u0094 Mrs. Swenson concluded. My belief is there are too many cooks in the kitchen.\u0094\n\n\u0093Who\u0092s got a match?\u0094 yelled 92 year-old Pete Hunn, a Clarksburg farmer.\n\n\u0093We\u0092ll figure it out,\u0094 Mrs. Swenson told Mr. Hunn. \u0093We want to go through the bureaucratic process.
