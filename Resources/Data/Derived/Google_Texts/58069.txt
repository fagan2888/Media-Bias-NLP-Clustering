Rev. Franklin Graham said bluntly in an interview on “Washington Watch with Tony Perkins” that an “anti-Christian bias” has permeated all levels of U.S. government, beginning at the top – with President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder.

Graham, the head of Samaritan’s Purse, an international aid organization, said both Obama and Holder are to blame for much of the anti-Christian rhetoric that’s been coursing through the nation in recent years because they’re the leaders, and they set the tone for the country. And it’s that tone that’s trickled from the federal level into state and local levels of government, he said, the Christian Post reported.

“There is an anti-Christian bias that is now in our government, has permeated our government, that’s also permeated Washington but [also] at the state and local level. It’s the progressives, whatever you want to call them, that are trying – and the president is into this and the attorney general is into this 100 percent – and that is forcing on the American people a new morality.”

Graham also repeated concerns he expressed in previous interviews about the president’s Muslim connections.

“One of the problems we have, the president, his father was a Muslim and his stepfather was a Muslim – [he] lived in Indonesia and went to Muslim schools. His mother must have been a Muslim,” Graham said, the Christian Post reported. “We don’t know that, but she married two Muslim men, so there must have been something there. The framework that our president has [had] growing up, his influences on his life were that of Islam.”

Conversely, Graham said his influences during his growing and developing years were all Christian and biblical.

“But our president did not have that,” he said. “It was Islam. Many feel that he’s protecting Islam. I don’t know that, but it certainly seems that way.”
