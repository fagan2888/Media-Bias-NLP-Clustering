Oklahoma City police arrested an 18-year-old who is accused of having a sexual relationship with a 12-year-old girl for almost three years.

According to police, last Friday, the victim's mother told officers that she walked in on the suspect, Zachary Buchanan, performing a lewd act with her daughter in her room. That's when the mother punched Buchanan in the face.

Officers found Buchanan at a home in the same neighborhood, and took him into custody. Police say Buchanan carried out a sexual relationship with the young girl for almost three years.

Buchanan is facing several charges, including rape, lewd/indecent acts with child, and forced oral sodomy.
