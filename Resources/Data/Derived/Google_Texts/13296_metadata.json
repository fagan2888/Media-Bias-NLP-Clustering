They may not have expected that the Iranian government\u2019s response would be the strongest of all.\n\nThe letter, authored by freshman Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and signed by the entire Republican leadership, was structured as a miniature lesson in U.S. civics for the government in Tehran. It reminded them that, while President Obama will have to leave office in 2017, many senate Republicans will likely be in office for many years. \u201cPerhaps decades,\u201d the letter notes.\n\nRelated: GOP Senators Send Their Own Warning to Iran on Nukes\n\nIt said that unless a deal being negotiated by the U.S., United Kingdom, China, Russia, France and Germany is also approved by Congress, it remains a \u201cmere executive agreement\u201d and is not binding on future administrations or on the Congress.\n\n\u201cWe hope this letter enriches your knowledge of our constitutional system and promotes mutual understanding and clarity as nuclear negotiations progress,\u201d the letter concludes.\n\nCotton even went so far as to post a Farsi version of the letter, tweeting it directly to Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif \u201cin case you need a translation.\u201d Zarif, as it happens, moved to the U.S. at age 17 and earned a Masters degree at San Francisco State University as well as a second Masters and a Ph.D. at the University of Denver.\n\n.@JZarif also, in case you need a translation... http://t.co/NVWL4PSFi1 pic.twitter.com/LfOl16gWiu \u2014 Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) March 9, 2015\n\nIn a statement released through the Iranian government-owned Tasnim News Agency, Zarif did not spare the sarcasm.\n\nRelated: A Nuclear Deal with Iran Starts to Look Likely\n\nIn the view of the Iranian government, he said, \u201cthis letter has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy.\u201d The statement said, \u201cI wish to enlighten the authors that if the next administration revokes any agreement with \u2018the stroke of a pen,\u2019 as they boast, it will have simply committed a blatant violation of international law.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201c[T]heir letter in fact undermines the credibility of thousands of such \u2018mere executive agreements\u2019 that have been or will be entered into by the US with various other governments.\u201d\n\nThe statement, which remarked on the unusual decision by U.S. lawmakers to become directly involved in a negotiation being conducted by the U.S. president, included language closely mirroring the Cotton letter:\n\n\u201cZarif expressed the hope that his comments \u2018may enrich the knowledge of the authors to recognize that according to international law, Congress may not \u2018modify the terms of the agreement at any time\u2019 as they claim, and if Congress adopts any measure to impede its implementation, it will have committed a material breach of US obligations.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: As Iran Talks Reach Key Phase, Obama Would Walk Away\n\nDemocrats also reacted with anger to the letter. On Monday in the Senate, Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) said, \"This is not a time to undermine our commander in chief purely out of spite. We should always have robust debate about foreign policy but it's unprecedented for one political party to directly intervene in an international negotiation with the sole goal of embarrassing the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nIn comments to reporters, President Obama pointed out that the Iranians most receptive to the message contained in the letter are likely the regime\u2019s most adamantly anti-American elements.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s somewhat ironic to see some members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hardliners in Iran -- it\u2019s an unusual coalition,\u201d he said. \u201cI think right now what we\u2019re going to focus on is seeing whether we can get a deal or not.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Senate Republicans knew that inserting themselves into negotiations between the Obama administration and Iran would provoke a reaction.
