Every Monday, we ask a question via Facebook and Twitter and then post the responses from our Facebook \"likers\" and Twitter followers in this column. Well-known Milwaukee movers and shakers will contribute, too.\n\nThis week, OnMilwaukee.com asked the Social Circle where's the best spot in town to get married. The response was incredible. You can read the entire thread here.\n\nAlso, share where your Brew City marriage took place via the Talkback feature. Here's to getting hitched, Milwaukee!\n\nMike Barr: \"How about a church? Anyone consider that anymore?\"\n\nAdrein Clapp: \"The Marcus Center for the Performing Arts. The venue has beautiful floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Downtown, as well as some outdoor spaces. Sazama's Fine Catering does the catering there, and the food is wonderful. They are great to work with, too!\"\n\nPat Buechs: \"Ours was at Century Hall the night it burned to the ground.\"\n\nCeleste Contreras: \"Alice's Garden. The land has historical Underground Railroad roots and Native American roots. It's a two-acre urban farm. Need I say more?\"\n\nTom Held: \"South Shore Pavilion, with a full moon coming up over the lake. Beautiful room, great sound and affordable.\"\n\nAnthony Garrison: \"Italian Community Center, if you have a large wedding reception.\"\n\nRhonda Greenhaw: \"Lincoln Park. Gorgeous riverside setting, CCC-built stone building with lovely balcony for reception dinner and very inexpensive. My husband and I were married there.\"\n\nBrian Hillers: \"I got married at Paddy's Pub. The owners did all the flower decorations and made the place look even more amazing than it normally does. Highly recommended!\"\n\nLindsay Hurwitz: \"I arrived at the Milwaukee Yacht Club via Captain Robert De Vorse on his sailboat where I met my parents and walked down the aisle to meet my husband. We had an outdoor wedding. Would highly recommend this idea for anyone who wants something the guests will remember.\"\n\nElizabeth Janners: \"Bacchus \u2013 in their conservatory room. It's cheaper than most places and the food is fantastic! It was the perfect place for a small and intimate wedding!\"\n\nAndrea Judson: \"South Shore Pavilion was beautiful except for trying to clean up by midnight. If I did it again I would have paid for two days. Black Tie Catering did the food and it was unforgettable. Yum. Fall would have been better for outdoor pics than December though! Brrr.\"\n\nJuli Kaufmann: \"Hooligan's.\"\n\nMike Kendall: \"South Shore Park Pavilion. Beautiful location, inexpensive and not locked into bar / catering packages.\"\n\nRichard Kerhin: \"We wed at picnic area 7A at Grant Park, built by workers during the depression near 7 Bridges. Beautiful lake view, close to the beach, you can make plenty of noise, alcohol allowed, room for 100 or more.\"\n\nErin Shea Linnane: \"It really depends on the style of wedding. If I were planning my wedding right now, it would be Best Place. When I got married it was at the Bavarian Inn. I like my Germans and my beer!\"\n\nJason Maline: \"Little known gem called The Brumder Mansion on 30th and Wisconsin. I'm getting married there at the end of May. Old world charm at its best.\"\n\nLisa Malmarowski: \"Seattle. Because it's not legal here. Although our 'reenactment' at Best Place rocked!\"\n\nMaria Meyers: \"Brown Deer Park. Outside ceremony, dinner and live polka duo in the pavilion. Our county parks are beautiful, inexpensive, flexible. We know of two couples that modeled their weddings after ours.\"\n\nDerek Mosely: \"Wisconsin Women's Center, Northpoint Lighthouse, Hubbard Park, Turner Hall, War Memorial, Villa Terrace.\"\n\nRyan Pringle: \"The cemetery. Because they never last.\"\n\nElisabeth Reichman: \"I didn't get married here but I have been to awesome weddings in Milwaukee. I especially loved the Polish Center and Lakefront Brewery.\"\n\nChristian Ricco: \"The Court House. I went to prom in high school. Streamlining seemed more realistic.\"\n\nStephanie Sherman: \"St. Hedwig. Why: Father Tim (Kitzke) and God.\"\n\nAnna Spankowski: \"Outside! Milwaukee is so beautiful!\"\n\nLiz Steiner: \"The Wisconsin Club was great. Beautiful, good price, and most things were included in the cost. We didn't have stupid fees like a chair fee or a napkin fee. We loved it.\"\n\nKenya Stevens: \"Boerner Botanical Gardens or The Domes.\"\n\nEileen Harnett Teska: \"If cost is no object, the Milwaukee Art Museum. Gorgeous light, acoustics for music, backdrop for photos.\"\n\nWendy Womack: \"Under the whale, dinner in front of the butterfly garden. That's where I got married.\"\n\nMaggie Zaborek: \"I was married at The Basilica of St. Josaphat and reception at The Hilton's crystal ballroom. Gorgeous and very elegant.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "This week, OnMilwaukee.com asked the Social Circle where's the best spot in town to get married.
