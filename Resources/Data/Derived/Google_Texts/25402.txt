Ted Cruz-signed 'Green Eggs and Ham' goes for $1,000 in San Antonio

SAN ANTONIO — An 8-year-old San Antonio girl is the proud new owner of a $1,000 Ted Cruz-signed copy of “Green Eggs and Ham.”

The Bexar County Republican Party auctioned three copies of the Dr. Seuss classic signed by the Texas senator on Tuesday at their annual Lincoln Day Dinner. The first went for $1,000 and the other two raked in a combined $1,800, said Chairman Robert Stovall.

“I was astounded,” Stovall said, adding that it drew more than 600 people to Vistas at Valero. “It was a tremendous event, (Cruz) brought so much energy.”

The San Antonio couple that bought the $1,000 copy said they bought it for their 8-year-old daughter.

Cruz, a tea party firebrand, read from “Green Eggs and Ham” in September while on the U.S. Senate floor during a 21-hour speech.

Stovall said Cruz signed the three books free of charge to raise money for the county party.
