WASHINGTON â€” U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), sworn into a full six-year term today, says he will spend the new session of Congress trying to find common ground with Republicans who now hold the majority.

"I don't want it to descend into partisan gridlock," Booker told reporters before the formal swearing-in led by Vice President Joe Biden, the president of the Senate. "My focus is finding persons on the other side of the aisle."

Booker, re-elected in November, said reducing the corporate tax rate, developing alternatives to prison for certain non-violent offenders and repealing the Affordable Care Act's tax on medical devices are all issues where he hoped to work with Republicans on.

"There are a lot of things that both sides admit is a growing problem," Booker said.

Booker said the most important goal is to find ways to grow the economy and help lower- and middle-class Americans. Lowering the corporate tax rate from its current 35 percent by eliminating deductions targeted to specific industries would help spur investment, he said. So would a lower tax rate to encourage companies to bring back earnings from overseas.

"For me, it's about jobs and expanding economic opportunities here at home," Booker said. "We can't be a place that disincentivizes people from investing here and creating jobs here."
