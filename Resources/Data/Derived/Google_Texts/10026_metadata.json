But Newsom builds songs like cathedrals of sound, layers of voices, instruments and words reaching you from every direction. Take the express tour or settle in the nave and stay for hours.\n\nThe record never loses its sonic clarity \u2014 Steve Albini and Noah Georgeson take a bow\u2014 even as Newsom's crisp harp, regal piano and often multi-tracked voice is enveloped by a well-cast collection of bouzoukis, English horns, too many keyboards to name, the City of Prague Symphonic Orchestra and even a Hohner Guitaret, a kalimba in a box.\n\nNewsom's voice is a kaleidoscope, every slight turn coloring the songs in varied explosions of emotion.
