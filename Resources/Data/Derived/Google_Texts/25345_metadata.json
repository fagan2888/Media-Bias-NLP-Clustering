It is caused when abnormal protein particles called Lewy bodies (named after Frederic H. Lewy, who discovered them in 1912) accumulate in the brain.\n\nLewy body protein deposits disrupt the brain\u2019s normal functioning.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Lewy body dementia has three distinguishing features that eventually become apparent:\n\n\u25a0 Fluctuating alertness and attention that can resemble delirium.\n\n\u25a0 Visual hallucinations.\n\n\u25a0 Parkinson\u2019s-like symptoms, such as balance problems, rigidity and tremors and a flat affect. (Lewy bodies also show up in people with Parkinson\u2019s, though they affect a different area of the brain.) There are no known therapies to stop or slow the progression of Lewy Body dementia, according to the institute.\n\nAverage survival after the time of diagnosis is similar to that in Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 about eight years \u2014 with progressively increasing disability.\n\n\u201cLewy body dementia is characterized by a mixture of symptoms\u201d that can make diagnosis difficult, says Sonja W. Scholz, a at Johns Hopkins Hospital neurologist and researcher who specializes in the illness.\n\nLewy body dementia patients can typically \u201chave a bad day when they are poorly responsive and confused about time and place,\u201d Scholz says, \u201cand the next day they are their normal self again, able to discuss the plot of their favorite TV show and childhood memories.\u201d\n\nAs a result of its fluctuating symptoms, Lewy body dementia is often mistaken for Pick\u2019s disease \u2014 a rarer form of dementia \u2014 or Parkinson\u2019s.\n\n\u201cMost patients develop signs that look like Parkinson\u2019s disease: balance problems, flat affect, rigid muscles, tremor or falls,\u201d Scholz says.\n\nAlthough hallucinations can occur in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, they are more common in Lewy body dementia, she says, and \u201ccan be quite disabling for the patients and upsetting for family members and caregivers.\u201d\n\nMisdiagnosis of this disorder is not only frustrating; it can even be a fatal mistake. People with Lewy body dementia are much more sensitive to many of the medications prescribed for Alzheimer\u2019s patients, like antidepressants and antipsychotics.\n\nOccasionally, those meds \u201ccan be life-threatening,\u201d Scholz said.\n\n\u2013 Candy Schulman, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/12/hfqa23.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb10c\"", "article_summary": "Average survival after the time of diagnosis is similar to that in Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 about eight years \u2014 with progressively increasing disability.\nThere are no known therapies to stop or slow the progression of Lewy Body dementia, according to the institute.\nAlthough Lewy body dementia is the second-most-common type of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s, it is often misidentified.\nQ: What is Lewy body dementia?\nPeople with Lewy body dementia are much more sensitive to many of the medications prescribed for Alzheimer\u2019s patients, like antidepressants and antipsychotics."}
