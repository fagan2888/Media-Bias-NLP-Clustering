Is it true that a woman who tries to combine a high-powered career with a family is going to be frazzled and sleep deprived? A study of more than 100 mothers who earned at least six figures shows the answer isn’t necessarily yes. First, many have a healthy dose of autonomy and flexibility in their jobs and work split shifts–leaving at a reasonable hour, having family time and then working after kids’ bedtime. Women in this category also earn enough to “buy balance” in doing online shopping, hiring cleaning services or household help. They also had the economic power within relationships to demand their partners’ help.
