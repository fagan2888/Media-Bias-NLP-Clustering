The Prebys Cardiovascular Institute on the campus of Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla.

Scripps Health this week opened its brand-new Prebys Cardiovascular Institute, a $456 million heart center on the campus of California' Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla.

The 383,000-square-foot tower was named in honor of real estate developer Conrad Prebys, who donated $45 million to help fund the project.

According to Scripps, the design took into account best practices for cardiac patients based on input from a pool of 200 doctors, nurses, executives, architects and support staff.

Features include floating nurses stations spread throughout the facility, advanced wireless networking and four new operating rooms, two which can be used for either catheterization or surgeries. The tower also include 17 negative pressure isolation rooms and private room that each feature LCD screens that can display medical images such as CT scans.

Scripps treats more than 76,000 patients with cardiac issues a year, the healthcare provider said, which is why the system staffs 166 cardiovascular specialists.
