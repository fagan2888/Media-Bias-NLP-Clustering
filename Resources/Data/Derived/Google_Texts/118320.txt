PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - It’s graduation day for movie star Emma Watson.

The British actress best known as Hermione Granger in the “Harry Potter” movies was among 2,000 graduates receiving degrees Sunday from Brown University. She tweeted a photo of herself in cap and gown.

Watson graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English literature from the Ivy League university in Rhode Island.

The 24-year-old started at Brown in 2009, the same year she was named the highest-grossing actress of the decade by the Guinness Book of World Records.

Watson had a busy film career during her time as a student, releasing both parts of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” ”The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” ”This is the End,” and the recent Biblical epic “Noah.”
