Last year, consumers who tried to use the website were met with errors and delays that prevented millions from signing up for several months.\n\nChallenges are mounting for the second year of enrollment in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as Republicans gained control of Congress last week and the Supreme Court announced it will consider whether a key feature, subsidies to reduce the cost of insurance, should be available to all Americans. The Obama administration, meanwhile, must simultaneously persuade more than 7 million existing customers to renew and sign up millions more uninsured people.\n\n\u201cWe have been working in a number of areas to raise the bar,\u201d Andy Slavitt, the deputy director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs healthcare.gov, told reporters yesterday on a conference call to preview the feature. \u201cOur principal focus is to bring people back to the website so they can update their information and shop for the best values. That\u2019s our principal focus, is to get people to come back.\u201d\n\nConfused Americans\n\nConsumer confusion is high about this year\u2019s enrollment period, which begins Nov. 15. About 90 percent of uninsured people surveyed in October by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they didn\u2019t know when they could sign up for coverage. And about 51 percent of people who tried out federal and state enrollment systems last year said they wouldn\u2019t return, according to a Nov. 3 Bankrate.com survey.\n\nMore than 13.5 million people registered to use the enrollment systems in 2014, and about 8 million finished the process and selected a health plan. Enrollment as of Aug. 15 was 7.3 million people, the government has said.\n\nObama administration officials are optimistic that a rebuilt federal enrollment system will hold up when it opens in a week, avoiding a repeat of last fall. The site has been much more extensively tested this year, Slavitt said.\n\nTesting Deadlines\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hit all of the critical deadlines we set over the summer for testing,\u201d Slavitt said. A former executive at UnitedHealth Group Inc., he was appointed to supervise Affordable Care Act programs for the government after his company helped salvage the healthcare.gov website last year.\n\nThe administration also hired Kevin Counihan, the former chief executive officer of Connecticut\u2019s health insurance market, as the CEO of healthcare.gov. Connecticut\u2019s enrollment system was one of the best-working in the nation in 2014.\n\nThe window-shopping feature went live at about 9:30 p.m. New York time yesterday, said Lori Lodes, a CMS spokeswoman. The feature allows people to enter a small amount of information -- where they live and their family size and income, if they wish - - and view premiums and benefits for health plans available in their area.\n\n\u201cEverything looks great,\u201d Lodes said in an e-mail. She declined to say how many people had used the feature so far.\n\nMost people already enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans can save money if they shop for a new plan in 2015 instead of automatically renewing this year\u2019s coverage, Slavitt said. He and Counihan declined to be more specific about premiums for next year, saying comprehensive data would be released later in the week. Prices are about 6 percent higher nationwide on average, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers analysis of mostly preliminary data released by 41 states.\n\nPayment Varies\n\nThe amount consumers will pay for insurance varies based on their age, family size, eligibility for subsidies and other factors.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most important for us, because the answer is different for every consumer, is this window-shopping tool,\u201d Counihan said on the call. \u201cEvery individual can answer the question in the way best for them.\u201d\n\nIn Dallas, this year a single 27-year-old nonsmoker might have paid as little as $217 a month for a \u201csilver\u201d-level plan, which offers the second-least generous benefits, according to the website ValuePenguin.com. Silver plans have been the most popular with consumers.\n\nNext year, the cheapest silver plan in Dallas will cost the same person $229, a 5.5 percent increase, according to healthcare.gov. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas sells the cheapest silver plan in Dallas this year and in 2015.\n\nSwitching Plans\n\nA 27-year-old living in Gainesville, Florida, paid as little as $214 for a silver plan this year, according to ValuePenguin. The cheapest silver premium will be at least $250 next year, a 17 percent increase, according to healthcare.gov, and the person would have to change insurers to get it -- from Florida Blue to UnitedHealth Group Inc.\n\nTo stay with Florida Blue, the person would have to pay $261 a month, a 22 percent increase.\n\nThe new shopping features available this year will bring the experience closer to that of a commercial website such as Amazon.com. For example, consumers will be able to narrow the selection of plans by the monthly premium they want to pay, the company offering the plan, or even specific medical benefits they need, such as management of diabetes or heart disease.\n\n\u201cWindow shopping is both simpler and faster, and more intuitive,\u201d Counihan said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne", "twitter": {"description": "Potential Obamacare customers can peek at 2015 prices for the program\u2019s health plans today after the government released a \u201cwindow-shopping\u201d feature overnight.", "title": "Obamacare Customers Get Sneak Peek at 2015 Plans", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-09/obama-administration-offers-preview-for-health-plans", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7sdjog7ch44/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Shopping,Health", "news_keywords": "Shopping,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-09/obama-administration-offers-preview-for-health-plans", "parsely-title": "Obamacare Customers Get Sneak Peek at 2015 Plans", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-11-09T19:00:00.000Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Potential Obamacare customers can peek at 2015 prices for the program\u2019s health plans today after the government released a \u201cwindow-shopping\u201d feature overnight.", "parsely-tags": "Shopping,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-11-09T19:00:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Potential Obamacare customers can peek at 2015 prices for the program\u2019s health plans today after the government released a \u201cwindow-shopping\u201d feature overnight.", "title": "Obamacare Customers Get Sneak Peek at 2015 Plans", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-09/obama-administration-offers-preview-for-health-plans", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7sdjog7ch44/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Potential Obamacare customers can peek at 2015 prices for the program\u2019s health plans today after the government released a \u201cwindow-shopping\u201d feature overnight."}, "parsely-post-id": "NESAZ16JIKLU01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7sdjog7ch44/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9826\"", "article_summary": "Potential Obamacare customers can peek at 2015 prices for the program\u2019s health plans today after the government released a \u201cwindow-shopping\u201d feature overnight.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Texas sells the cheapest silver plan in Dallas this year and in 2015.\nSilver plans have been the most popular with consumers.\nSwitching PlansA 27-year-old living in Gainesville, Florida, paid as little as $214 for a silver plan this year, according to ValuePenguin.\nNext year, the cheapest silver plan in Dallas will cost the same person $229, a 5.5 percent increase, according to healthcare.gov."}
