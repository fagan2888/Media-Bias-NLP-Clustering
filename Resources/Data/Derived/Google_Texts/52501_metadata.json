Since 1979, when the country adopted a one child per family policy, China\u2019s partiality toward males has kept millions of women lining up for abortions, whether forced or voluntary.\n\nDue to Chinese gendercide, by the year 2020, there are expected to be 30 million more men than women of marriageable age in the country.\n\nSpeaking of paid leave to ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos Sunday, Sen. Sanders said the United States is the \u201conly major country on earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee paid family and medical leave.\u201d\n\nSanders supports Sen Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s FAMILY Act, a bill that would require taxing all American citizens to fund 12 weeks of paid maternity leave, not just the 1 percent.\n\n[The payroll tax] would hit everyone \u2013- yeah, it would,\u201d Sanders admitted ABC.\n\nHe added: \u201cBut it would mean we would join the rest of the industrialized world and make sure that when a mom has a baby she can in fact stay home with that baby for three months, rather than going back to work at the end of one week.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative bulldog and Hollywood actor James Woods called out Sen.
