LITTLE EGG HARBOR â€“ A Sunday night fire that caused severe damage to a golf course clubhouse has been extinguished, according to police.

Flames engulfed the clubhouse of the Atlantis Golf Course at Country Club Boulevard about 8:45 p.m., Little Egg Harbor Police Cpl. Christopher Arciniegas said in an email.

"When officers arrived on scene they observed heavy smoke and flames and heard multiple explosions from inside the clubhouse," Arciniegas said.

Firefighters from surrounding communities assisted at the scene. No one was injured. A few firefighters were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation, Arciniegas said.

Though the clubhouse was heavily damaged by the fire, the nearby restaurant was spared, he said.

The Ocean County Fire Marshal is investigating.

Atlantis Golf Course is a par-72 course operated by the Ocean County Department of Parks and Recreation.
