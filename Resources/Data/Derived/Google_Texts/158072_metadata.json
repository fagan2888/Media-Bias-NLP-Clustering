Customers purchasing or needing services for the CPAP equipment often asked for help dealing with insurance companies, medical facilities and other matters. She realized there was a need for a consulting firm to help seniors get the answers, advice and services they need.\n\n\"It was a business opportunity,\" Robinson said. \"We present personal support services to help you manage your health care.\"\n\nAging in Place can be a resource for folks who would prefer to stay at home rather than move into a nursing home.\n\n\"We base it on a clientele of people who have worked their whole life and want to live in their own home rather than go into a facility,\" Robinson said. \"There are 10,000 people who turn 65 every single day. We are seeing a lot of people who are 65, and their parents are still alive because of advancements in health care and technology. People who want to enjoy their retirement after raising their family now have to take care of their mom and dad.\"\n\nAging and Place staff will go into a client's home, spread out all the documents for long-term care and determine the pros and cons of going to a facility vs. staying at home.\n\n\"We call it health care navigation,\" she said.\n\nAging in Place can also help people following hospital stays.\n\n\"You've just been in the hospital, had all this rehab and are faced with a stack of papers you don't understand,\" she said. \"You have this big bill and so much of your claims were denied. We sit down with you and look through it. Sometimes a person will face a $7,000 bill because they didn't list their secondary insurance while the primary insurance doesn't pay for any of that. The person smiles and realized we just saved them $7,000.\"\n\nRobinson said that health care has changed so much following the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"We have a highly educated population here in Champaign County with the university people and research people,\" she said. \"But you would seriously have to go back to school for two years to be able to read insurance benefit and denial statements. Some of them are 50 pages long.\"\n\nAging in Place also provides recommendations to make staying at home safer and more livable for seniors.\n\n\"We can look at your home and say, 'Let's get rid of the carpet and put in some hardwood so your walkers or wheelchairs are safe. Let's work on getting these cords out of the middle of the floor. Let's get this clutter taken out so you are safe in your own home.'\"\n\nTo reach Aging in Place, call 531-HOME.\n\nGallagher acquires agency\n\nAn insurance agency that has operated in the area since before the Civil War has a new owner.\n\nBrown, Hobbs & McMurray Insurance at 118 S.
