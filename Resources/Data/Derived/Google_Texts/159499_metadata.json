While some say that bringing up a child in a non-traditional setting such as this could have consequences, others have upheld the idea that these virgin mothers are actually more emotionally stable than mothers who have been left to bring up a child alone due to a failed relationship.\n\nFour major British IVF firms claim that within the las five years, they've assisted in the pregnancies of at least 25 heterosexual single women who claim to have never had sexual intercourse, The Telegraph reported. Although the identity of these women has not been released, Maha Ragunath, director of the Care Fertility clinic in Nottingham, which treated three of these virgin pregnancies, said women who choose to undergo the treatment are from diverse backgrounds \u2014 some still live with their parents while others have full-time careers. However, they all have one thing in common: a strong desire to start a family, with or without a man.\n\n\u201cThey are extremely happy to go ahead on their own and don\u2019t care about the implications that might bring for the child or how they would go into a new relationship,\u201d Ragunath told the Daily Mail.\n\nThere are many different reasons why these mothers have chosen to abstain from sexual intercourse. For example, Tracey Sainsbury, a senior fertility counselor and research officer at the London Women\u2019s Clinic, said some women may have psychological or medical reasons for never having sex.\n\n\u201cSome wish to save sexual intercourse for a special relationship. They feel they have not found the right partner to share sex with, but they know they want a baby now,\u201d Sainsbury told the Daily Mail. For many, the choice to refrain from sexual activity is often spurred by religious and cultural pressures or past traumatic experiences.\n\nSome criticize these virgin births, claiming that women who are not emotionally ready to have sex aren't ready to have a baby, either. Others question the reasoning behind these women\u2019s motivation to have virgin births.\n\n\u201cWhat is the child for these women? A teddy bear that they pick off the shelf?\u201dJosephine Quintavalle, of the group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, told the Daily Mail .\n\nDespite this criticism, Laura Witjens, chief executive of the National Gamete Donation Trust, said the children of these rare virgin mothers come out just fine. In fact, she said they end up better than children from single mothers who had split from the fathers.\n\nMumsnet CEO Justine Roberts agreed with Witjens, telling the Huffington Post, \u201cActive parenting isn't always the result of sex \u2014 adoptive parents and same-sex parents are obvious examples \u2014 and love and stability seem to be what really counts in the end.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "virgin pregnancy, jane the virgin, ivf, fertility, in-vitro fertilization", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "IVF treatments are helping more women skip the sex to have a \"virgin birth.\"", "title": "Move Over, Mary: Virgin Births Are On The Rise", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jane-virgin-real-life-women-getting-pregnant-using-ivf-despite-never-having-sex-rise-354946", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/29/pregnant.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "IVF treatments are helping more women skip the sex to have a \"virgin birth.\"", "title": "Move Over, Mary: Virgin Births Are On The Rise", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jane-virgin-real-life-women-getting-pregnant-using-ivf-despite-never-having-sex-rise-354946", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/29/pregnant.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/29/pregnant.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-09-29T17:47:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-30T12:04:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "IVF treatments are helping more women skip the sex to have a \"virgin birth.\""}, "article_summary": "Despite this criticism, Laura Witjens, chief executive of the National Gamete Donation Trust, said the children of these rare virgin mothers come out just fine.\nThe number of virgin births, or pregnancies among heterosexual women who've never had sex, is on the rise.\n\u201cSome wish to save sexual intercourse for a special relationship.\nThere are many different reasons why these mothers have chosen to abstain from sexual intercourse.\nSome criticize these virgin births, claiming that women who are not emotionally ready to have sex aren't ready to have a baby, either."}
