REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\n4705154\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system is a mess. Premiums and deductibles are soaring. Consumers have fewer choices when it comes to doctors and hospitals. And the United States could be short 90,000 physicians within a decade.\n\nVoters want to know how the next president will reverse these trends. Yet the 24 million Americans who tuned into August\u2019s Republican presidential debate heard \u201chealth care\u201d mentioned just twice. By comparison, the word \u201cTrump\u201d was uttered 28 times.\n\nRepublican candidates hoping to win the presidency would be wise to have answers to the following four questions ready at the next debate on September 16 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious: \u201cHow will you combat rising premiums?\u201d\n\nNext year, patients across the country will face stiff rate hikes. Oregon\u2019s Moda Health Plan recently confirmed a 25 percent premium increase. Blue Cross Blue Shield affiliates are requesting increases ranging from 23 percent in Illinois to 54 percent in Minnesota.\n\nNationwide, premiums will increase an average of 12 percent next year, according to the online health insurance research tool HealthPocket. That\u2019s a far cry from President Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign promise to cut premiums by $2,500 for the average family.\n\nThe next president must find ways to make insurance more affordable.\n\nA good place to start is by repealing Obamacare in its entirety. That would eliminate Obamacare\u2019s onerous regulations on insurers, including \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d and \u201ccommunity rating.\u201d These rules, which force insurers to sell policies to all comers regardless of health history or status and then control the prices they\u2019re allowed to charge, have resulted in lower rates for the sick \u2014 and astronomical increases for the young and healthy.\n\nA better way to provide affordable coverage to the sick is through state-based high-risk pools, which separate high-cost patients from the majority of reasonably healthy folks. That will create a functional, competitive insurance market for the latter group \u2014 and allow state officials to deploy targeted aid to the former group.\n\nSecond question: \u201cHow will you fix Medicare and Medicaid?\u201d\n\nThe two entitlement programs are fiscal disasters. In 2013 alone, Medicare and Medicaid cost over $1 trillion \u2014 nearly 40 percent of what the United States spent on health care. By 2020, they\u2019re on track to cost a whopping $688 billion and $466 billion, respectively.\n\nDespite such spending, most enrollees can\u2019t get past the waiting room. Only half of doctors are scheduling appointments with new Medicaid patients. According to a 2013 report by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, three in ten beneficiaries struggle to find a primary care doctor who accepts Medicare.\n\nTo reform these programs, the GOP presidential candidates should give states block grants to administer their Medicaid programs as they see fit. For Medicare, the presidential hopefuls should raise the program\u2019s eligibility age and give seniors means-tested vouchers so they can take direct control of their care. Medicare beneficiaries should also be allowed to contribute to tax-advantaged Health Savings Accounts, which the IRS currently prohibits.\n\nThat leads to the third question: \u201cHow will you promote healthy competition among insurers?\u201d\n\nInsurers are merging rapidly. This summer, Aetna purchased Humana, and Anthem acquired Cigna. The Big Five national insurance companies could soon be just three. That will mean less competition and higher prices for patients.\n\nTo counterbalance these effects, patients should be allowed to purchase insurance across state lines. They could then shop around for the best deal and provide insurers with an incentive to scale back prices.\n\nAnd question four: \u201cHow will you give individual Americans more control over their health care?\u201d\n\nObamacare has squashed consumers\u2019 healthcare choices. The average exchange enrollee has access to 32 percent fewer primary care doctors and 24 percent fewer hospitals than the average person covered by conventional private insurance.\n\nThat needs to change.\n\nFortunately, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has started the conversation by introducing the first detailed replacement plan for Obamacare among the GOP candidates. The rest of the field should let voters know whether they agree with Gov. Walker \u2014 or articulate their own visions for health reform.\n\nAmerican voters want to know how presidential hopefuls will fix our nation\u2019s broken healthcare system. The winner of the next GOP debate will be the one with an answer.\n\nSally C. Pipes is president, CEO, and Thomas W. Smith Fellow in Health Care Policy at the Pacific Research Institute.
