BEIJING (AP) â€” Prominent Chinese human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang (POO JER'-chiang) has been disbarred following his sentencing on what supporters say are drummed-up charges to curtail his activism.

Pu posted a photo of a letter from the Beijing City Legal Affairs Department to his micro-blog Thursday that says his law license was pulled in accordance with regulations. It cites his conviction in December for disturbing public order and inciting ethnic hatred.

Pu was detained shortly after attending a May 2014 meeting to discuss the bloody military crackdown on the 1989 pro-democracy movement. He was given a three-year sentence suspended for three years.

Pu tells The Associated Press by phone that he has no comment other than that he is no longer a lawyer and hasn't decided whether to appeal.
