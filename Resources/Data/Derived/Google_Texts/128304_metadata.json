(AP) - Two high school students in western South Dakota are hatching Chinook salmon eggs at home in an experiment that could lead to an increase in survival rates of salmon eggs at fish hatcheries.\n\nGretchen Blain and Hannah Neumiller, both juniors at Spearfish High School, began their experiment in late October and are receiving guidance from the manager of a state fish hatchery, the Black Hills Pioneer (http://bit.ly/1NQwXVU ) reported. The students are incubating the eggs in a cooler and a petri dish and then testing water change intervals.\n\n\u201cIn the end we\u2019re doing a mortality comparison,\u201d Blain said.\n\nIn some dishes, the students changed the water every day, in others every three days and in some others once a week. Once the eggs reached their eyed-up stage, the students abandoned the once-a-week change and changed them once every three days.\n\nNeumiller\u2019s eggs were kept in a cooler around 54 degrees and Blain\u2019s were maintained around 48.\n\n\u201cMy survival rate was around 50 percent and Gretchen\u2019s around 70 percent survival,\u201d Neumiller said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was my warmer temperature or if it was that there were 15 eggs in a dish. But none of my dishes still have 15 eggs left. A lot are lower than 10.\u201d\n\nBlain\u2019s petri dishes contained 10 eggs each, while Neumiller\u2019s had 15.\n\nMike Barnes, who manages the McNenny State Fish Hatchery in Spearfish, is guiding the students. He said the hatchery recognized the need to improve the survivability of Chinook salmon eggs about a decade ago. He said the hatchery thought about incubating a small number of eggs in a refrigerator, but the experiment would have required more attention than what could be provided with a small staff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed with the initial data,\u201d Barnes said of the students\u2019 experiment. \u201cSubsequent experiments we can manipulate the variables to try and prove survivability.\u201d\n\nBlain and Neumiller aren\u2019t the first students who have worked with the hatchery to run an experiment, but Barnes said, \u201cit is rare for high schoolers to conduct an experiment with results of scientific quality.\u201d\n\nBarnes plans on helping the students get their paper regarding the experiment published in a peer-reviewed science journal.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Black Hills Pioneer, http://www.bhpioneer.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two high school students in western South Dakota are hatching Chinook salmon eggs at home in an experiment that could lead to an increase in survival rates of salmon eggs at fish hatcheries.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/26/2-high-school-students-hatching-salmon-eggs-at-hom/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Two high school students in western South Dakota are hatching Chinook salmon eggs at home in an experiment that could lead to an increase in survival rates of salmon eggs at fish hatcheries.", "title": "2 high school students hatching salmon eggs at home"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Two high school students in western South Dakota are hatching Chinook salmon eggs at home in an experiment that could lead to an increase in survival rates of salmon eggs at fish hatcheries.", "card": "summary", "title": "2 high school students hatching salmon eggs at home"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "(AP) - Two high school students in western South Dakota are hatching Chinook salmon eggs at home in an experiment that could lead to an increase in survival rates of salmon eggs at fish hatcheries.\nHe said the hatchery recognized the need to improve the survivability of Chinook salmon eggs about a decade ago.\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed with the initial data,\u201d Barnes said of the students\u2019 experiment.\n\u201cMy survival rate was around 50 percent and Gretchen\u2019s around 70 percent survival,\u201d Neumiller said.\nMike Barnes, who manages the McNenny State Fish Hatchery in Spearfish, is guiding the students."}
