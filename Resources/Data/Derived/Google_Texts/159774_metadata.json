At the weekend, he was in Brisbane for a G-20 meeting where he piled very effectively into Vladimir Putin, according to reports.\n\nWhen we take a closer look at Obama\u2019s Asian journey, we find Americans in deep trouble across the Pacific, and the guy who gets tough with the Russian leader elicits mostly shrugs. No amount of happy talk can change these realties.\n\nRelated: GOP Leaders Fume Over Obama\u2019s Climate Deal with China\n\nIn truth, Obama\u2019s days in Beijing, including a summit with President Xi Jinping, had more defeat than victory in them. Bring the cameras in close: We watch as the U.S. reaches its limits with the Chinese, even as China\u2019s ties to other nations, notably Russia, power on with extraordinary momentum.\n\nThere is a simple way to put this: When Washington speaks to Asians now it is the past talking plaintively to the future. With the rest of the region abuzz about all that it\u2019s getting done for itself, nagging China and other Asia nations about America\u2019s once-unchallenged primacy in the Pacific is a certain loser.\n\nThe press pictures coming out of this trip, which included a gathering of leaders under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation banner told a truer story. Obama was at a complete loss in the presence of the Russian president. Plenty of time with Xi, but both of them avoided eye contact every time a shutter snapped.\n\nBad atmospherics, then. While Xi and Putin put in strong performances, according to my sources in attendance, the American president was caught up in a mission abroad so carefully stage-managed you could all but read the choreography marks on the floor. It\u2019s hardly a surprise that nothing significant was done.\n\nRelated: China Seeks Greater Role in Afghanistan with Peace Talks\n\nWhat about that climate pact Xi and Obama signed? The American leader committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by roughly a quarter by 2025, while Xi agreed to stop the growth of China\u2019s emissions by 2030. \u201cLandmark agreement,\u201d The New York Times reported, a \u201csignature achievement.\u201d\n\nWait a minute. One, while Obama agreed to quicken the pace of U.S. reductions, we\u2019ll have to see how this plays on Capitol Hill. And China\u2019s target is woefully short of anything remotely effective, climate scientists were quick to say. It\u2019s increasingly clear we don\u2019t have enough time for this sort of incremental, off-in-the-distance non-reduction target.\n\nTwo, the Chinese leadership and the CEOs at American power companies are going to wake up in, say, 2019 and fret that they aren\u2019t pacing a bilateral pact signed five years earlier\u2014as in, \u201cWe better not annoy those Americans,\u201d or, \u201cWhat will Beijing say if we don\u2019t move faster?\u201d\n\nRisible. In my read, this agreement was an act of charity on Xi\u2019s part, the American sherpas having said, \u201cOur leader has to go home with something, please.\u201d\n\nRelated: China\u2019s Xi, Japan\u2019s Abe Hold Landmark Meeting\n\nObama cut a deal whereby Chinese and American planes and naval vessels can better avoid confrontations off the mainland\u2019s coast. A few market-opening measures of interest to high-tech manufacturers were signed. All good.\n\nBut bits and pieces\u2014salad croutons served as the main course. A uniformed officer at the Pentagon could\u2019ve managed the first agreement and an assistant secretary at Commerce the second.\n\nAs advanced before Air Force One took off, Obama was to push forward the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the administration\u2019s (overly) ambitious trade agreement, which pointedly excludes China. Now we hear not a peep, and no surprise: The TPP\u2014as easily predictable\u2014is no further today than it was before this presidential journey.\n\nThis may come over as a harsh assessment. It is more an expression of alarm on the way to fear as the 21st century arrives in the western Pacific. Put Obama\u2019s take- home next to China\u2019s and Russia\u2019s and it starts to look as if our leadership is well on the way to Nowheresville (a little-known atoll off the coast of Saipan).\n\nRelated: Landmark China/Hong-Kong Stock Trading Scheme Starts Nov. 17\n\nFor months before Obama traveled, Washington fought Beijing\u2019s idea of an Asian-managed lending institution intended to rival the Asian Development Bank. This mistake\u2014and it was one\u2014was all too obvious in Beijing, where the Chinese boasted of the up-and-running Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, its $50 billion capitalization, and its 20 (and counting) members.\n\nJust to make things perfectly clear, Xi announced during Obama\u2019s visit that China was putting $40 billion into a new Silk Road Fund to finance development projects in the seven Central Asian republics.\n\nStay with me. We\u2019re only part way through the list.\n\nIn Brisbane, Obama sat and listened as China pressed its fellow BRICS\u2014the middle-income group comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa\u2014to move swiftly to establish the New Development Bank, which will finance infrastructure and make available an emergency reserve fund.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear yet whether western nations will be welcome in either the BRICS bank or the AIIB; in the latter case, Washington had to lobby Canberra very hard to keep Australia from joining. Like the AIIB, the BRICS bank is also intended to preclude western leadership and control.\n\nRelated: Obama and Putin Are Odd Couple at Beijing Summit\n\nNow we come to the Russian deals. Xi and Putin announced a second natural gas agreement, this one worth $325 billion, following the unprecedented $400 billion deal struck in March. By 2020, Russia will sell China more gas than it now sells Europe, and the supply is big enough and priced such that it could threaten U.S. sales in South Korea, Japan, and elsewhere in the region.\n\nNumerous other agreements came atop this. Most important among them, Russian petroleum sales to China will now double.\n\nThis is where sanctions against Russia and a refusal to consider Xi\u2019s persistent, always courteous requests for \u201ca new great power relationship\u201d are getting Washington. The rise of the non-West was destined to be a prominent feature of our century, but the U.S. could not have done more to propel it if it tried.\n\nRelated: Drop in Gas Prices Should Continue to Show Up in Economy\n\n\u201cThe use the U.S. makes of the privileges she enjoys for providing the world's reserve currency are being increasingly contested,\u201d Ken Courtis, a former Goldman Sachs man and a longtime observer of Asian affairs, said in a long interview carried on Australian Broadcasting over the weekend. \u201cTheir misuse has, among other things, pushed China and Russia into a tight strategic partnership.\u201d\n\nOne can lay this at Obama\u2019s feet because he has little experience managing foreign policy and no gravitas when he is in the room with leaders such as Xi and Putin. At home and abroad, he\u2019s simply out of his depth.\n\nMore fundamentally, however, the policy-setting apparatus in Washington, from State, Defense, and intelligence to Commerce and the trade side simply cannot accept that America has to play a new kind of baseball if it is to keep pace with a world voracious to advance beyond old structures, institutions, and relationships.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama brought a climate agreement back from", "title": "How China and Russia Out-Maneuvered Obama in Asia", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/11/17/How-China-and-Russia-Out-Maneuvered-Obama-Asia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05202014_China_Russia.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/11/17/How-China-and-Russia-Out-Maneuvered-Obama-Asia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05202014_China_Russia.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama brought a climate agreement back from", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: China Seeks Greater Role in Afghanistan with Peace TalksWhat about that climate pact Xi and Obama signed?\nAs advanced before Air Force One took off, Obama was to push forward the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the administration\u2019s (overly) ambitious trade agreement, which pointedly excludes China.\nRelated: Obama and Putin Are Odd Couple at Beijing SummitNow we come to the Russian deals.\nIn Brisbane, Obama sat and listened as China pressed its fellow BRICS\u2014the middle-income group comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa\u2014to move swiftly to establish the New Development Bank, which will finance infrastructure and make available an emergency reserve fund.\nOne, while Obama agreed to quicken the pace of U.S. reductions, we\u2019ll have to see how this plays on Capitol Hill."}
