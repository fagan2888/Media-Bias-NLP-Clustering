The free membership packages will not be available to existing members of a participating institution, or to those people whose membership lapsed since January 2012.\n\n\u201cThe municipal ID is a powerful tool to bring more New Yorkers out of the shadows and into the mainstream,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cIt is now also a key that opens the door for hundreds of thousands of more New Yorkers to our city\u2019s premiere assets in culture, science and entertainment.\u201d\n\nBy connecting perks to the ID card, officials hope to counteract any potential stigma that might come with it.\n\nParticipating institutions include the New York Botanical Garden, Staten Island Zoo, New York City Ballet and the Brooklyn Museum.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New Yorkers who sign up for the city\u2019s new municipal identification card will get access to one-year free membership packages at 33 of New York City\u2019s most prominent cultural institutions, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday.", "title": "Municipal ID Cardholders to Receive Free Admission to Some Museums, Zoos", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/09/18/municipal-id-cardholders-to-receive-free-admission-to-some-museums-zoos/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EP560_nyzoo_P_20140918181154.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Municipal ID Cardholders to Receive Free Admission to Some Museums, Zoos", "description": "New Yorkers who sign up for the city\u2019s new municipal identification card will get access to one-year free membership packages at 33 of New York City\u2019s most prominent cultural institutions, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Michael Howard Saul", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "New Yorkers who sign up for the city\u2019s new municipal identification card will get access to one-year free membership packages at 33 of New York City\u2019s most prominent cultural institutions, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-09-18T22:36:56-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/09/18/municipal-id-cardholders-to-receive-free-admission-to-some-museums-zoos/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-21659", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "New Yorkers who sign up for the city\u2019s new municipal identification card will get access to one-year free membership packages at 33 of New York City\u2019s most prominent cultural institutions, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday.", "title": "Municipal ID Cardholders to Receive Free Admission to Some Museums, Zoos", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/09/18/municipal-id-cardholders-to-receive-free-admission-to-some-museums-zoos/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EP560_nyzoo_P_20140918181154.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-21659", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-09-18T22:37:14-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba83\"", "article_summary": "Peacocks are seen in 2013 at the Staten Island Zoo, one of the institutions that will offer free admission to municipal ID card holders.\nThe free membership packages will not be available to existing members of a participating institution, or to those people whose membership lapsed since January 2012.\n\u201cThe municipal ID is a powerful tool to bring more New Yorkers out of the shadows and into the mainstream,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.\nParticipating institutions include the New York Botanical Garden, Staten Island Zoo, New York City Ballet and the Brooklyn Museum.\nThe mayor and other officials said they hope the wide range of benefits \u2013 including free admission to major museums, complimentary rehearsal passes at performance halls, discounted theater tickets \u2013 will draw more people to sign up for the ID card, which is scheduled to launch in January."}
