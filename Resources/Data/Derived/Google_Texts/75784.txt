As deadline to sign up for health insurance in the federal marketplace approaches, local navigators are ramping up their efforts to enroll uninsured individuals.

The deadline to sign up for health insurance is Feb. 15, and those who qualify for health insurance but don't sign up, will face a penalty.

You can meet with a health insurance navigator at one of the following events:

Friday, Feb. 6, 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. at H.O.L.A., 595 N. Primrose Drive, Orlando

Saturday, Feb. 7, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at BVL Library, 405 Buenaventura Blvd., Kissimmee

Friday, Feb. 13, Hope Community Center, 1016 N. Park Ave., Apopka

Saturday, Feb. 14, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Barry University, 6441 E. Colonial Drive, Orlando

You can also dial 2-1-1 or 877-564-5031 to set up an appointment with a navigator, or visit healthcare.gov to sign up for a plan.

So far, more than 1.3 million Floridians have signed up for health insurance, including 160,000 people in Orlando, Kissimmee and Sanford.
