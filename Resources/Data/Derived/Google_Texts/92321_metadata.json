Photo courtesy of the Drinking Jacket\n\nAmericans consume more alcohol during the colder months than any other time during the year \u2014 so it should come as no surprise the \"Drinking Jacket\" is now a thing. The coat looks like an ordinary jacket designed to keep you warm and insulated, but with the pull of a zipper, shoppers quickly see the \"mobile bar\" built within.\n\nThe alcohol-friendly jacket started off as a kickstarter, reflecting the public demand for such a coat when it quickly exceeded its pledge of $50,000 to more than $500,000. Inside is a bottle-opener zipper pull, a neoprene-lined koozie breast pocket, a hidden flask pocket, and slip-resistant drinking mitts that help drinkers grip beer bottles without freezing their hands. The jacket even has an ID tag sewn into it, just in case your drinking escapades take an unexpected turn.\n\nIn 2014, a study conducted by the BACtrack breathalyzer app revealed Americans tend to drink more in the winter. From December to March, the average drink has a 0.06 percent higher blood alcohol content level compared to the rest of the year. They drink about five days a week during the coldest months, while only drinking three days a week in the spring, summer, and fall. For only $95, the Drinking Jacket helps keeps you warm and buzzed all winter long, and no one is the wiser.\n\nWe can't say for sure if that's a good thing or not, but in any case, it exists.
