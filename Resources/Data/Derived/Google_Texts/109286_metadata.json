According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, many of them haven\u2019t signed up because they don\u2019t know they could get tax credits for monthly premiums or additional financial help through cost-sharing.\n\nAs part of the Affordable Care Act, all insurance companies are required to offer silver plans that incorporate cost-sharing dollars from the federal government. Customers who qualify for cost-sharing plans have incomes between 100 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $24,000 to $60,000 a year for a family of four. Under these plans, the actuarial value of the plan is increased for the consumer.\n\n\u201cTo put it in the most common language, it's how much they're going to have to spend themselves,\u201d Skube said.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates it will cost about $147 billion over the next decade to fund cost-sharing under the Affordable Care Act. Different companies use the cost sharing dollars in different ways, to reduce what customers spend on co-pays, deductibles and co-insurance.\n\nThe new product from Florida Blue, called MyBlue, features a $0 deductible and low co-pays. It\u2019s available only in Duval, Osceola, Orange, Seminole, Pinellas, Pasco, Hillsborough, Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties.\n\n\"It's pretty exciting that somebody could have the potential of paying $1 to go see a specialist,\u201d Skube said. \u201cThat can be something that's very interesting to a person who says, I don't have a lot of disposable income that I can spend for this.\"\n\nBut there's a tradeoff. They're in a Health Maintenance Organization, or HMO, meaning they have a very specific list of providers they can see. Sometimes, it's a short list.\n\nThe issue of provider networks came up recently in Tampa, when HealthCare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan met with some of Florida's Affordable Care Act navigators, or in-person assisters. He said consumers should call the doctor's office to confirm they accept a certain plan.\n\n\u201cNot just the company, like, do you take Florida Blue? Because you guys know, it's not that simple,\u201d Counihan said. \u201cThe doctor's office will say sure, right? But is it Florida Blue HMO X Y Z? That's what the question has to be.\"\n\nHumana is among the health insurance companies in Florida selling a variety of plans on HealthCare.gov, including a cost-sharing plan.\n\n\"This year, we did lower the prescription co-pays, the doctor co-pays, and the overall maximum out-of-pocket,\u201d said Abbie Hundt, who oversees sales representatives who sell Humana plans in Tampa Bay, Central Florida and South Florida. \u201cFor those people that fall in the lower levels of the federal poverty level, we really want to help those consumers out so they do have access to care. We want them to be able to go a primary care physician.\u201d\n\nShe said part of Humana\u2019s marketing strategy includes setting up kiosks in malls this weekend around Tampa Bay, Central Florida and South Florida. She said when they set up shop last year during open enrollment, they were met by lines of people waiting.\n\n\u201cWe were thrilled, obviously, because we do want to help everyone purchase health insurance,\u201d Hundt said.\n\nAmid the crowds of people doing holiday gift buying this year, Humana -- and other insurance companies -- are hoping for long lines of people who are shopping for health insurance.\n\nDec. 15 is the deadline to enroll for coverage that kicks in by Jan. 1. Under the federal health law, the penalty for going without insurance in 2016 is increasing to $695, or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater.\n\nLottie Watts is a reporter and producer with WUSF in Tampa.
