But just the opposite happened for teens with parents who had only a high school diploma\u2014obesity continued to climb.\n\nOverall, obesity rates for adolescents 12 to 19 did not rise between 2003 and 2010. But Robert Putnam and his colleagues at the Harvard Kennedy School dug down through the statistics and found during that period, obesity rates among teens whose parents have no more than a high-school education rose from about 20% to 25%.\n\nMeanwhile, teenage children of parents with a four-year college degree or more saw their obesity rates fall from 14% to about 7%.\n\n\u201cThe overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds,\u201d the authors of the study wrote.\n\nPhysical activity, and the lack of it, may help explain the differences between these two groups.\n\nUsing data from two national health surveys (the 1988\u20132010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and the 2003\u20132011 National Survey of Children\u2019s Health), the researchers found:\n\n\u00b7 87% of adolescents in 2003 living with parents who had college degrees told survey-takers that they had exercised or played a sport for at least 20 minutes continuously sometime in the last seven days. The rate went up to 90.1% by 2011.\n\n\u00b7 But 79.8% of adolescent children in 2003 with parents who did not go beyond high school said they had exercised or played a sport for at least 20 minutes in the last week. The rate went up only slightly by 2011, to 80.4%.\n\n-Noel Brinkerhoff\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nUncovering the Real Drivers of Obesity in Young People (by Joe Rojas-Burke, Association of Health Care Journalists)\n\nAmong Kids in U.S., the Rich Get Thinner and the Poor Get Fatter (by Melissa Healy, Los Angeles Times)\n\nIncreasing Socioeconomic Disparities In Adolescent Obesity (by Carl B.
