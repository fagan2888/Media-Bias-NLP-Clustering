Rienzi, a lawyer for the Little Sisters, says the government is 'simply blind to the religious exercise at issue: the Little Sisters and other applicants cannot execute the form because they cannot deputize a third party to sin on their behalf.'\n\nIn court papers, he says the government\u2019s 'causal dismissal' of that 'religiously forbidden act as a mere \"stroke of their own pen\" perpetuates their claim below that the Little Sisters are fighting an \u2018invisible dragon.'\n\nAnother lawyer for the nuns, Kevin C. Walsh of the School of Law University of Richmond writes, 'The government\u2019s incomplete characterization of the form is that it is a simple opt-out form that does nothing but signal that the organization is claiming an exemption.'\n\nRefute: The government say Catholic groups are already exempt from administering - and paying for - contraception (library image)\n\nHowever, Professor Michael C. Dorf of Cornell Law School says groups are wrong.\n\nSpeaking with ABC news, he claims the Little Sisters' emphasis on the form is misguided.\n\n\n\n'I would say that even if the consequence of signing the paper were that the employees get contraceptive coverage, that still would not count as a substantial burden under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\n'Suppose that a Quaker who is categorically opposed to war gets a draft notice. If the Little Sisters plaintiffs are right, then he is not only entitled to his exemption from the draft; he\u2019s entitled to get his exemption without even signing the piece of paper saying he is entitled to his exemption. Why?\n\n\n\nBecause if he signs that piece of paper, then the government will draft the next person on the list and so he will be 'participating' in the war effort to which he is religiously opposed.'", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Nuns,loggerheads,ObamaCare,claim,U,S,blind,contraceptive,implications", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2535067/Nuns-loggerheads-ObamaCare-claim-U-S-blind-contraceptive-implications.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Catholic non-profit groups, led by the Little Sisters of the Poor, are challenging the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court.", "title": "Nuns at loggerheads with ObamaCare as they claim U.S. is blind to contraceptive implications", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2535067/Nuns-loggerheads-ObamaCare-claim-U-S-blind-contraceptive-implications.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/07/article-2535067-1A778EF300000578-173_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2535067, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Nuns,loggerheads,ObamaCare,claim,U,S,blind,contraceptive,implications", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-01-07T09:29:34.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Lizzie+Edmonds", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-01-07T10:42:18.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Nuns loggerheads ObamaCare claim U S blind contraceptive implications"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Catholic non-profit groups, led by the Little Sisters of the Poor, are challenging the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court.", "title": "Nuns at loggerheads with ObamaCare as they claim U.S. is blind to contraceptive implications", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2535067/Nuns-loggerheads-ObamaCare-claim-U-S-blind-contraceptive-implications.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/07/article-2535067-1A778EF300000578-173_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Catholic non-profit groups, led by the Little Sisters of the Poor, are challenging the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded46\"", "article_summary": "The administration adds the Little Sisters are also part of the Christian Brothers Services - which also exempts them.\nThe groups say the ObamaCare requirement for group health plans to provide contraception violates their religious beliefs.\nCatholic groups - led by the Little Sisters of the Poor - are currently challenging the contraceptive mandat e of the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court.\nSpeaking with ABC news, he claims the Little Sisters' emphasis on the form is misguided.\nNuns at loggerheads with ObamaCare as they claim U.S. is blind to contraceptive implicationsCatholics challenging contraceptive mandate of Affordable Care ActSay need for group health plans to provide contraception 'violates beliefs'Government 'blind' to the full implications of the law, they argueAdministration rebut claims - and says groups are already excemptCatholic groups are up in arms with ObamaCare, President Barack Obama's flagship healthcare program, claiming that the government is 'blind' to the full implications of the contraceptive mandate."}
