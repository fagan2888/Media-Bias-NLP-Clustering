Pennsylvania Sen. Lloyd Smucker is one step closer to making the jump to the U.S. House of Representatives as he advances to the general election with a win in Tuesday’s primary election.

Smucker, of West Lampeter Township, Lancaster County, spent two and a half decades as president of the Smucker Company, a construction firm.

The conservative Smucker said he supports a declaration of war against ISIS. He supports a repeal of Obamacare, but would still want to require insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. His voting record is strongly pro-life and pro-Second Amendment.

His primary opponent, Chet Beiler, is originally from Gap. After graduating from Pepperdine University, he returned to Pennsylvania and started a business – Amish Country Gazebos. He currently lives in Manheim.

The 16th Congressional district covers a portion of southeastern Pennsylvania, including areas of Chester, Lancaster and Berks counties, including Reading.

Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Pitts has held the seat since 1997. Pitts announced in November he would not seek re-election and plans to retire when his current term is ended.

Smucker will face Democrat Christina Hartman in the general election this November.
