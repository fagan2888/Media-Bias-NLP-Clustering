Every year on December 1st, we commemorate World AIDS Day and re-commit to addressing HIV/AIDS, a disease that affects approximately 35 million people worldwide.

The White House will honor this worldwide observance on Monday, December 1, with an important World AIDS Day event focusing on this year’s Federal theme, “Focus, Partner, Achieve: An AIDS-Free Generation.”
