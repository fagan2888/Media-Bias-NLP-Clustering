(Photo: Estatley image)\n\nPantaloons?\n\nConfess: You\u2019ve Googled it, haven\u2019t you?\n\nA recent Estately blog study of Google Trends from the 50 states has revealed some disturbing facts about New Jersey\u2019s Internet search habits. We\u2019re tops in the nation for such search terms as: Bon Jovi; Britney Spears; cure for baldness; girdles; New Jersey jokes; pantaloons; six-pack abs; Teletubbies; and thumb wrestling.\n\nYou can\u2019t question Sayreville native rocker Jon Bon Jovi\u2019s appearance on the list. Platinum record seller, rich guy, great hair.\n\nBut what\u2019s the deal with thumb wrestling?\n\nSeriously, you have to Google that? OK, there is a Thumb Wrestling Federation website where you can buy merchandise such as T-shirts and hats but the site carries a warning: \u201cRemember, you need your parent\u2019s permission to buy things online.\u201d (That warning disappears in five seconds, by the way). This tells us \u201cwho\u201d in New Jersey might be searching for thumb wrestling, but the \u201cwhy\u201d remains a mystery.\n\nNor can we figure out our search obsession with Britney Spears or \u201ccure for baldness.\u201d Well, if you\u2019ve been to the mall at 11 a.m. on a Tuesday, perhaps you can get a clue. New Jerseyans, according to the research, seem to be inordinately concerned with our appearance. We also like to Google \u201cgirdles\u201d and \u201csix-pack abs.\u201d\n\nWhere do \u201cTeletubbies\u201d fit in? Those little creatures that infants watch when they\u2019re drooling into their dry Cheerios are just plain weird. Here\u2019s what\u2019s even weirder: Those infants can\u2019t type yet, so it\u2019s folks too old for Teletubbies who are Googling them.\n\nThen there\u2019s that pantaloons thing. It makes sense. Really. Pantaloons isn\u2019t just an obscure term for vintage ladies undergarments. It\u2019s also an Indian fashion retailer, and Asian Indians are the largest group of Asians in New Jersey, according to the U.S. Census.\n\n\u201cWhile weaving its magic across lifestyle segments, Pantaloons caters to the discerning and trendy Indian consumer,\u201d the company\u2019s website says.\n\nThe Estately list is manipulated a bit. The bloggers entered hundreds of oddball topics in the Google search engine and then tallied the totals for each state. So while Kentuckians may be the most prone to searching \u201cdemonic possession,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean that tons of folks there are worried about Old Scratch tapping into their cerebral cortexes.\n\nNonetheless, it is interesting that Maine folks are partial to \u201ccat pics\u201d and \u201chow to roll a joint\u201d and some people in Maryland have a thing for David Hasselhoff.\n\nAmong all the Garden State search results, however, there is one that is confusing: \u201cNew Jersey jokes.\u201d\n\nWe live here. Shame on you if you don\u2019t already know the jokes. Go back to searching for girdles. Or just suck it in\u2026\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/middlesex-county/2014/05/22/nj-search-web/9452097/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "From Teletubbies to thumb wrestling, we\u2019re tops in the nation for odd search terms", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "From Teletubbies to thumb wrestling, we\u2019re tops in the nation for odd search terms", "title": "What does NJ search for on the Web?", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/middlesex-county/2014/05/22/nj-search-web/9452097/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From Teletubbies to thumb wrestling, we\u2019re tops in the nation for odd search terms", "title": "What does NJ search for on the Web?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e0ef80b8d672a6e1a205c72cbd89e66303669a31/c=91-0-309-218&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2014/05/22/google-search-map22.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "The bloggers entered hundreds of oddball topics in the Google search engine and then tallied the totals for each state.\nAmong all the Garden State search results, however, there is one that is confusing: \u201cNew Jersey jokes.\u201dWe live here.\nWe\u2019re tops in the nation for such search terms as: Bon Jovi; Britney Spears; cure for baldness; girdles; New Jersey jokes; pantaloons; six-pack abs; Teletubbies; and thumb wrestling.\nA recent Estately blog study of Google Trends from the 50 states has revealed some disturbing facts about New Jersey\u2019s Internet search habits.\nEstatley, a website, shows what search words are most popular by state."}
