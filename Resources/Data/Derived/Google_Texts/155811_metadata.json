Critics see it as \"back-door\" surveillance on Americans without a warrant.\n\nA recently declassified November opinion from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secretive body that oversees the legality of U.S. spy programs, rejected a constitutional challenge to rules permitting the FBI to access foreign intelligence data for use in domestic criminal investigations.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House has voted overwhelmingly since the Snowden leaks to require U.S. agencies obtain a warrant before searching collected foreign intelligence for data belonging to Americans, but those proposals have gained minimal traction in the Senate.\n\nCivil liberties groups and Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, have previously requested information on the extent of U.S. data caught up in the foreign surveillance program.\n\nThe Obama administration, however, has said it cannot provide a precise answer and that any estimate would require reviewing communications in a manner that would raise privacy concerns.\n\nIn their letter to Clapper, the lawmakers said officials have demonstrated the feasibility of providing an estimate and that any one-time privacy concerns were acceptable in light of the importance of the information.\n\nJames Sensenbrenner, Darrell Issa, Jim Jordan, Ted Poe, Jason Chaffetz, and Blake Farenthold were the Republicans to sign the letter. Jerrold Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, Hank Johnson, Ted Deutch, Cedric Richmond, Suzan DelBene, David Cicilline and John Conyers signed for the Democrats. Conyers is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.\n\n(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Paul Simao)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.", "title": "Spy chief pressed for number of Americans ensnared in data espionage", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/22/Spy-chief-pressed-number-Americans-ensnared-data-espionage", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-security-intelligence_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/22/Spy-chief-pressed-number-Americans-ensnared-data-espionage", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-security-intelligence_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A recently declassified November opinion from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secretive body that oversees the legality of U.S. spy programs, rejected a constitutional challenge to rules permitting the FBI to access foreign intelligence data for use in domestic criminal investigations.\nIntelligence officials say data about Americans are \"incidentally\" collected during communication with a target reasonably believed to be living overseas.\nThey requested that Clapper provide the information about data collected under a statute, known as Section 702, by May 6.\nCivil liberties groups and Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, have previously requested information on the extent of U.S. data caught up in the foreign surveillance program.\n\"Now we require your assistance in making a determination that the privacy protections in place are functioning as designed.\""}
