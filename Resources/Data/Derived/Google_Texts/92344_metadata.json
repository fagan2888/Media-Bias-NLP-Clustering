(AP) \u2014 When Maggie McNally-Bradshaw and husband Curt hop on their electric motorcycles and twist the throttles, they get a rush like no other.\n\nOr maybe a WHOOSH!\n\n\u201cThere is that sense of being at the beginning of something new, and part of our future as far as ecology,\u201d said McNally-Bradshaw, chairwoman of the American Motorcyclist Association. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s novel. Then they realize it\u2019s powerful stuff. The technology is improving by leaps and bounds. It\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nWhile startups like Zero, Brammo and Mission are producing state-of-the-art electric motorcycles on the West Coast, Harley-Davidson has decided to jump into the fray. The Milwaukee-based manufacturer announced its LiveWire this month and plans to offer demo rides to gauge interest nationwide before going into production.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see it at all replacing internal combustion,\u201d Harley President Matt Levatich said. \u201cI mean, maybe in 100 or 50 years, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll be open to what people want.\u201d\n\nStill, while Harley\u2019s announcement may not sit well with its core riders, who relish the distinctive rumble of the V-twin engine\u2019s exhaust, it might provide the impetus needed for the electric market to take off.\n\n\u201cWe had our biggest single day of Internet traffic in the history of the company the day Harley made its announcement,\u201d said Scot Harden, vice president of global marketing for Zero Motorcycles, which began in a Santa Cruz, California, garage in 2006 and now is the top seller of full-size, high-powered electric bikes. \u201cIt just validates what we\u2019ve been saying and how it\u2019s going to play out in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nA recent study by Navigant Research suggests the industry is at the start of a trend. The research company anticipates sales of electric motorcycles worldwide will grow to 1.2 million this year.\n\nNo surprise that Yamaha, Honda and KTM also have electric bikes in the pipeline.\n\n\u201cIt seems that electric motorcycles are going to be a pretty important mainstay,\u201d said Jerry Phibbs Jr., a longtime motorcycle dealer in Albany who sold all four of the Zero bikes on the showroom floor this year. \u201cAll of the industry standards say by 2018 it will consist of more than 50 percent of the market. I don\u2019t know if I believe that, but it\u2019s certainly going to be a major part of it.\u201d\n\nZero expects to sell 2,400 electric motorcycles this year, a fraction of the more than 260,000 conventional motorcycles sold last year alone by Harley. But what has happened to the technology since former NASA engineer Neal Saiki began tinkering in that Santa Cruz garage is impressive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Harley helps put electric motorcycles in spotlight", "title": "Harley helps put electric motorcycles in spotlight", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Harley helps put electric motorcycles in spotlight", "title": "Harley helps put electric motorcycles in spotlight", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/29/harley_helps_put_electric_motorcycles_in_spotlight/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/electric-motorcycles.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Harley helps put electric motorcycles in spotlight", "title": "Harley helps put electric motorcycles in spotlight", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/electric-motorcycles.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Kekis", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The research company anticipates sales of electric motorcycles worldwide will grow to 1.2 million this year.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsPRINCETOWN, N.Y.
