The head of the Louisiana Democratic Party, state Sen. Karen Carter Peterson, walked out during Gov. Bobby Jindal’s legislative-session opening speech Monday.

“She walked out because we’ve heard that speech from him before,” Louisiana Democrats spokesman Beau Tidwell said in a statement to The Advocate. “No ideas for Louisiana and no clue. Between his Iowa campaign and his budget nightmare, he walked out on the state and on the families of Louisiana a long time ago.”

Jindal, who has frequently traveled out of state in recent weeks as he weighs a run for the GOP’s 2016 nomination for president, gave a speech that focused on three points: The state budget, his opposition to the Common Core education standards and support of a proposed “religious freedom” bill this session.
