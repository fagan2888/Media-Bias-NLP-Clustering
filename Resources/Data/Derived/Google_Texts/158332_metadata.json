JOHN\u2019S WOOD TOWNHOUSE\n\n$2.3 MILLION (\u00a31.395 MILLION)\n\nThis duplex occupies the third and fourth floors of a Victorian townhouse on Alma Square, a quiet area near the High Street in St. John\u2019s Wood. The house was built around 1850 and converted into apartments in 1985. This one was updated last year; its lower floor includes a living room with a wood-burning stove, and a dining room with a gas fireplace. Both rooms have accent walls with ornate gold-and-cream wallpaper by Zoffany. Next to the dining room, the kitchen has a recycled-glass backsplash made by Fired Earth in dark reds and rust browns. A bathroom with a shower stall is next to the kitchen.\n\nUpstairs, all three bedrooms are tucked under the low, sloping ceilings at the top of the house. Working fireplaces and built-in wardrobes evoke the Victorian period. The rooms share a hall bath, which has a corner bathtub. Although the apartment doesn\u2019t face Alma Square directly, the owners of this apartment have a key to its communal garden. Abbey Road, made famous by the Beatles, is a block away, and Regent\u2019s Park is a 15-minute walk. The High Street has many independent shops and restaurants, and the St. John\u2019s Wood Underground station on the Jubilee line gives easy access to Bond Street, the City of London and Canary Wharf. Heathrow Airport is about a half an hour away via public transit.\n\nMARKET OVERVIEW\n\nThe British property market has become very lively over the last year, said Joseph Selby, a director with CBRE Residential in Canary Wharf, explaining that government subsidies had acted as a stimulus, \u201cadding to the whole feel-good factor that is very evident at the moment.\u201d The market in St. John\u2019s Wood has seen robust price gains in recent years, according to Giles Elliott, an agent for Savills St. John\u2019s Wood. \u201cPrices for prime property have risen by about 45 percent since 2008,\u201d he said, adding that his company was anticipating price increases of 6 percent this year. The housing stock in St. John\u2019s Wood varies quite a bit, with Regency-era townhouses, Italianate villas, high-end modern flats and neo-Gothic houses. Three-bedroom flats range in price from \u00a32.5 million to \u00a35 million ($4.125 million to $8.28 million, at \u00a3.061 to the dollar), Mr. Elliot said. The apartment profiled here is priced lower because of its smaller size, according to Laura Richardson of Knight Frank St. John\u2019s Wood, the listing agent.\n\nWHO BUYS IN LONDON\n\n\u201cSt. John\u2019s Wood is a very cosmopolitan area,\u201d added Ms. Richardson, citing an American school and a French Lyc\u00e9e in the area as attracting expatriate buyers. In addition, she said, \u201cThere have been unprecedented numbers of Chinese buyers recently.\u201d\n\nInternational buyers are \u201ccertainly more prevalent in the top end of the market,\u201d Mr. Elliot said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBUYING BASICS\n\nLike many London properties, this apartment is being offered as a leasehold transaction, which means it has a renewable long-term lease expiring in 2174. \u201cYou\u2019d normally only get a freehold property if it\u2019s a house that hasn\u2019t been split up,\u201d Ms. Richardson said. Transaction costs include a solicitor\u2019s fee, which varies depending on the size and complexity of the transaction; she estimated the fee in this instance at \u00a34,000 or so. The stamp duty also varies depending on purchase price. For properties like this one, priced at \u00a31 million to \u00a32 million, the stamp duty is 5 percent. Most buyers don\u2019t hire their own real estate agent, so the seller\u2019s agent handles negotiations for both sides. But Ms. Richardson said that some foreign buyers hire a relocation agent to find promising properties for them, and they may charge an additional fee. Foreigners can buy without restriction.\n\nWEB SITES\n\nOfficial London visitor guide: visitlondon.com\n\nTransport for London: tfl.gov.uk\n\nSt. John\u2019s Wood Society: stjohnswood.org.uk\n\nLANGUAGES AND CURRENCY\n\nEnglish; pounds sterling (\u00a31 = $1.65)\n\nTAXES AND FEES\n\nAnnual service charges of about $5,000 cover building maintenance and access to the garden.
