This meeting, focusing on the need for radical structural change, is aimed at sending a strong message to Francis and the wider church.\n\nSponsored by the U.S.-based Women\u2019s Ordination Conference (WOC), this week\u2019s gathering is the third time in 15 years that ordination advocates have gathered to lament what they see as a major failure by the bishops to end gender discrimination within the church.\n\nWOC organizers estimate some 500 delegates will participate in the gathering during its three days of meetings, speeches and workshops. Dozens of exhibitors have already set up tables on the 4th floor of the downtown Marriott hotel here, hoping to draw delegates\u2019 attention. Most exhibitors share visions of a reformed Catholic church.\n\nMary E. Hunt, speaking on a morning panel, listed reasons the women should celebrate during the meeting. At the top of her list, she said, was the fact that women have \u201cavoided being co-opted\u201d into the Catholic priesthood while it remains a strictly hierarchical and closed institution.\n\nKnow a recent high school graduate?

She said: \u201cThe point is not whether women have successfully become what men tell us we cannot be due to our nature/anatomy and their limited understanding of our shared tradition. Rather, the task at hand is to see how the marginalization of women by men, whether in priesthood or elsewhere, reinforces structures of inequality and injustice of many sorts that have shaped power throughout the world.\u201d\n\nHunt explained: \u201cFor Catholic feminists, the job is not to get a few women into kyriarchal structures in the feeble hope of changing them from within. Rather, it is to envision and construct new models and new movements (some may be churches) in which people of good will cooperate to eliminate injustice and live harmoniously on a healthy Earth.\u201d\n\nThe streets of downtown Philadelphia are lined with banners welcoming Pope Francis. However Hunt cautioned that the enthusiasm Francis\u2019 visit is generating could reinforce the image of a dysfunctional papacy, making structural reform more difficult.\n\n\u201cI join those who laud this pope on matters of economics and the environment, among other things,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I lead those who critically analyze internal church matters and conclude that even what is positive about Francis\u2019 papacy needs to be marked with an asterisk when it comes to half of the world and half of the church. I wish it were otherwise because I know what greater power we could marshal to heal a broken world if only the brokenness of our own community were healed.\u201d\n\nElisabeth Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza, feminist theologian at Harvard Divinity School, spoke to the gathering about the way Pope John Paul II successfully co-opted feminist theological with papal language on the \u201cfeminine genius.\u201d She traced John Paul\u2019s strict separation of gender roles to European ideas popularized during World War II. This theology, she said, stresses the maternal motherhood and rests on notions that men and women are \u201cessentially\u201d different but complementary.\n\nAccording to Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza, Pope Francis has picked up this thinking, which celebrates the \u201cfeminine genius.\u201d She said, however, this notion cannot be sustained in the face of the reality of poor women.\n\n\u201cThe most pressing need for WOW is to create feminist spaces for discussion of feminist theologies of liberation,\u201d she said, adding that there is a great need for these now.\n\n\u201cWe need to become the virus that challenges Kyriarchal theology,\u201d she said.\n\nLater in the day delegates watched the well-crafted feature-length documentary, \"Radical Grace,\" which is beginning to be distributed into local communities. The documentary highlights the work of U.S. women religious who have, at times, been at odds with the church hierarchy on matters of advocacy and ideas of inclusion. From confronting U.S. bishops over the Affordable Care Act, to protesting for women's equality at the Vatican, \"Radical Grace\" follows three sisters who are transforming the image of women religious, U.S. politics, and even the church itself.\n\nAs modern-day nuns, Simone Campbell, Jean Hughes and Chris Schenk lead very different lives. Yet they are united by the common bonds of fierce devotion to their faith and commitment to the Catholic social teachings of justice, equality and freedom from poverty and oppression. Campbell works for social and economic reform via legislation like the Affordable Care Act. The documentary captures NETWORK's first \"Nuns on the Bus\" tour. Schenk works to restore women\u2019s leadership in the Catholic Church. It reveals stunning Roman mosaics of women bishops and priests dating back to the earliest days of Christianity. And the now deceased Hughes carries out her ministry on Chicago\u2019s violence-plagued West Side, providing services to the formerly incarcerated.\n\nRadical Grace is partnering with community organizations to help bolster grassroots and digital campaigns promoting women\u2019s leadership and equality. Its producers ask those wishing to screen the documentary in their local communities to make the request at their website.\n\n[Fox is NCR publisher and director of Global Sisters Report.
