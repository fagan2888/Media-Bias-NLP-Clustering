(CBS4) \u2013 A Denver broker that has been preparing for the Affordable Care Act for two years says it\u2019s been challenging and that more problems are still on the way.\n\nTom Crennen is an insurance broker with coloradohealth.com and has been preparing for Obamacare for a while now. He thinks that the problems are only just getting started.\n\n\u201cObamacare has been extremely challenging I guess is what I\u2019d have to say,\u201d said Crennen.\n\nHe\u2019s bought more software, added more staff and more man hours I order to help prepare for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cMy guys have been staying up until 3 a.m. on the system because that\u2019s when it runs the best,\u201d said Crennen.\n\nIn the first month 106,000 Americans have successfully enrolled and only about 27,000 of those have used the national website. The majority who have successfully signed up have uses state sites like Connect for Health Colorado.\n\nLINK: connectforhealthco.com\n\nAn estimated 7 million Americans will need to buy insurance.\n\nPresident Obama said Friday that the website is working better and they need to work together with providers.\n\n\u201cWe all share a similar value which is we want to make sure that Americans have good solid coverage,\u201d said the President.\n\nCrennen says even though President Obama has asked providers to reissue and extend cancelled policies, it\u2019s too late for the Dec. 15 deadline.\n\n\u201cWe think that about 70 percent of our clients are going to have to change to a different health insurance in 2014,\u201d said Crennen.\n\nHe says that the entire system is not bad but he is worried that in the time it takes to sort things out, some local insurance companies will go out of business.\n\n\u201cI think that probably maybe 50% of the health insurance brokers won\u2019t make it through,\u201d said Crennen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Denver broker that has been preparing for the Affordable Care Act for two years says it's been challenging and that more problems are still on the way.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://denver.cbslocal.com/2013/11/18/denver-insurance-broker-says-obamacare-problems-far-from-over/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/tom-crennen.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/tom-crennen.jpg?w=1500", "height": 844}, "type": "article", "description": "A Denver broker that has been preparing for the Affordable Care Act for two years says it's been challenging and that more problems are still on the way.", "title": "Insurance Broker Says Problems Far From Over With Affordable Care Act"}, "twitter": {"site": "/social/", "image": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/tom-crennen.jpg?w=1500", "description": "A Denver broker that has been preparing for the Affordable Care Act for two years says it's been challenging and that more problems are still on the way.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Insurance Broker Says Problems Far From Over With Affordable Care Act"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "CBSDenver.com in Denver is Colorado's Online News Channel with up to the minute breaking news, weather, sports and top spots.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Denver", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsdenver", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsdenver"}, "keywords": "links & info, local, news, syndicated local, affordable care act, coloradohealth.com, connect for colorado health, obamacare, president obama, tom crennen", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://denver.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1358cb67b88b4ef2e59895070c511d70?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, coloradohealth.com, connect for colorado health, obamacare, president obama, tom crennen"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9241\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think that probably maybe 50% of the health insurance brokers won\u2019t make it through,\u201d said Crennen.\nDENVER, Colo.
