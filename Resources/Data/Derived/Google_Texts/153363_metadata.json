He played, coached, climbed up the staff, married, started a family and became a hot coaching prospect \u2014 all while in the Bulldog program.\n\nAs Bobo oversees his first preseason practices as a head coach after opening drills at CSU on Friday, it\u2019s intriguing that this is the first time he has been working with non-SEC talent since that single season at Jacksonville State.\n\nSo on Saturday, I asked if he has had to adjust his talent evaluation standards. That in no way was meant to demean CSU or the Mountain West. The SEC is the pre-eminent football conference in the country, generally considered the best of the power five leagues, right?\n\nWhen I took a couple of swings at asking McElwain similar questions about the transition from Alabama to CSU during his three seasons in Fort Collins, he spoke at length, but detoured. I understood it and wasn\u2019t offended, but on Saturday, Bobo gave it a more sincere try.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d really have to see when we get in and start playing the teams,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cI think everything\u2019s going to be relative to the competition that you\u2019re playing. There\u2019s fast guys in the SEC, there\u2019s big defensive linemen, but they\u2019re recruited big guys here.\u201d\n\nHe noted that his staff \u201cbeefed up the defensive line\u201d in recruiting, both from the high school and junior college ranks.\n\n\u201cWe have some bodies that I\u2019m used to seeing on the defensive side,\u201d Bobo added. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard when you\u2019re looking at film to tell, and when you\u2019re reading the media guide and everybody lies sometimes about their heights and weights. When we get into the season, I think that will be a better question for me.\n\n\u201cBut as far as our team, we\u2019ve got size in places, (players) that are big like in the SEC. The depth, the overall depth, is probably a little greater where I came from.\u201d\n\nBobo retained three assistants from the McElwain staff, including Marty English, now the linebackers coach who has spent his 25-year career at his alma mater, Northern Colorado, plus Wyoming and CSU. That\u2019s valuable knowledge on several fronts, including recruiting and networking, but it\u2019s also important that English has a feel for the realities of the Mountain West.\n\nThe other holdovers, Alvis Whitted (wide receivers) and Jeff Hammerschmidt (special teams, tight ends), arrived in the league with McElwain. Also, holdover director of football operations Tom Ehlers has been with the program as a coach or administrator since 1989.\n\nAt some point, and this probably has happened already, Bobo will have to remind himself that he\u2019s not still in the SEC and that this isn\u2019t Athens.\n\nNot that those necessarily are bad things.\n\nAfter the first no-pads practice Friday, Bobo said: \u201cIf I was in Athens, I\u2019d probably be fully sweating and my script would be soaking wet. I think it\u2019s all relative to the climate you\u2019re in. It was definitely hot here and with the altitude we\u2019re in, they were a little bit short of breath. But we pushed \u2019em. \u2026 We want them to know what it feels like in the fourth quarter when you\u2019re tired and realize, hey, you can go a little big harder at the end.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting there, not where I want to be, but it was better.\u201d\n\nYes, it\u2019s all relative.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: CSU coach Mike Bobo adjusts to different talent level from SEC", "title": "Frei: CSU coach Mike Bobo adjusts to different talent level from SEC", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/09/frei-csu-coach-mike-bobo-adjusts-to-different-talent-level-from-sec/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-09T19:58:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:45:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University, Terry Frei"}, "article_summary": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 As did Jim McElwain, Colorado State coach Mike Bobo came to Fort Collins after serving as an offensive coordinator at a Southeastern Conference program.\nThe SEC is the pre-eminent football conference in the country, generally considered the best of the power five leagues, right?\n\u201cBut as far as our team, we\u2019ve got size in places, (players) that are big like in the SEC.\nAlso, holdover director of football operations Tom Ehlers has been with the program as a coach or administrator since 1989.\nWhen we get into the season, I think that will be a better question for me."}
