A man was shot to death outside a Spruill Avenue convenience store Saturday morning, and North Charleston police arrested a suspect.

Officers were dispatched to the Circle A store at 1813 Spruill Ave. shortly before 10 a.m., police spokesman Spencer Pryor said. They found a man lying on the ground who was suffering from gunshot wounds, Pryor said. The man was later pronounced dead.

Charleston County Deputy Coroner Dottie Lindsay identified him as Samuel Coardes, 25, of North Charleston.

Witnesses told police the victim and another man were talking outside the store when suddenly one of them pulled out a handgun and fired several shots. The gunman then fled the scene.

Police later arrested Tyrone Benn, 26, of Osceola Street in North Charleston, Pryor said. Benn was charged with murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. He is being held in the Charleston County jail pending a bond hearing today.

According to court records, both Coardes and Benn have lengthy criminal records. Pryor said investigators were still trying to determine a motive for the shooting.
