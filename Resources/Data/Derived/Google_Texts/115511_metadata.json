He was also hampered by some dropped passes, a few from top target Rashard Higgins, who still caught 10 balls for 110 yards. It was the 10th time this season Higgins finished with at least 100 yards receiving , but like most of his teammates, he looked back on the plays he didn't make, adding he felt like he let the coaching staff down.\n\n\"I feel like I let them down. I feel like I did some uncharacteristic things,\" he said. \"I kind of let myself down at the end of the day.\"\n\nGrayson did catch his first touchdown pass on a throwback from Charles Lovett. It was the third touchdown pass in Lovett's career, but the first in two years. He tossed a pair in 2011, one to Crockett Gillmore, the other to Matt Yemm. The one to Grayson was his longest.\n\nGoodbye \u2014 Interim coach Dave Baldwin said in the postgame press conference the current staff had been issued termination papers by the university, thanking the school for its generosity. The move does not mean necessarily he is no longer being considered for the job, or that a new coach could not retain anybody currently on staff.\n\nWhat it does allow is some guarantees for the staff.\n\n\"Reality hits at some point at any time, and it hit us,\" Baldwin said.c\"Each guy got a termination paper; that was given, and that was outstanding because that gave us dates and times and what to expect and all the things the university has done. They've stepped up. Regardless of what they do, they stepped up and they did a great job.\"\n\nInterim athletic director John Morris said after the game the university hopes to name a new coach by the start of the holidays.\n\nBowl notes \u2014 The attendance of 33,067 was the 10th largest in the game's 23-year history. ... Utah is still the winningest team in Las Vegas Bowl history, pushing its mark to 3-1. The program is now 14-4 all-time in bowl games, while Colorado State slipped to 6-8, ending a streak of two bowl wins, as well as a three-game run against schools from the Power Five. ... The 35-point margin of victory was the second largest in game history.\n\nTraining room \u2014 Wide receiver Elroy Masters Jr., did not play due to a practice injury this week. The team was also without safety Jake Schlager, who has missed most of the season with an ankle injury. The team hopes to get him a redshirt season. No injuries were reported from the game.\n\nMike Brohard: 970-669-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/mbrohard", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_27179752/colorado-state-quarterback-garrett-graysons-career-milestone-soured", "modificationDate": "2014-12-20T20:00:42-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1220/20141220__21rhscsunotesw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Brohard \n \n  -Sports Editor", "description": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Garrett Grayson's eyes were watering as he walked off the field, and they were still red when he met with the media after the game.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:27179752:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-20T19:58:20-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_27179752/colorado-state-quarterback-garrett-graysons-career-milestone-soured", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1220/20141220__21rhscsunotesw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Garrett Grayson's eyes were watering as he walked off the field, and they were still red when he met with the media after the game.", "title": "Colorado State quarterback Garrett Grayson's career milestone soured by Las Vegas Bowl loss"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Garrett Grayson's eyes were watering as he walked off the field, and they were still red when he met with the media after the game.", "title": "Colorado State quarterback Garrett Grayson's career milestone soured by Las Vegas Bowl loss", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_27179752/colorado-state-quarterback-garrett-graysons-career-milestone-soured", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1220/20141220__21rhscsunotesw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-20T19:58:20-0700", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2024-12-20T19:56:31-0700", "sailthru.title": "Colorado State quarterback Garrett Grayson's career milestone soured by Las Vegas Bowl loss", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "CSU", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Mike Brohard-Sports", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1220/20141220__21rhscsunotesw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-12-20T19:59:57-0700", "news_keywords": "Loveland Colorado ReporterHerald CSU Colorado State University Rams sports football basketball"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31df\"", "article_summary": "...
