Overall, the average rate hike nationwide is 5.6 percent, according to PWC.\n\nFirst, all that information isn\u2019t set in stone. Most states haven\u2019t compiled final premium information for the Obamacare exchange. Just seven states \u2014 Colorado, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Vermont \u2014 and Washington, D.C. have made final rate announcements. Of course, the states that did publish final rates had more reason to want the data out there \u2014 they had a lower average hike of 3.5 percent.\n\nBut the number of big losers is far outweighing the winners. Eight states are facing double-digit rate hikes, while just four states have reported decreases.\n\nLouisiana and Kansas are facing Obamacare premium hikes of more than 15 percent on average. Iowa, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee will see rate lower double-digit rate hikes as well.\n\nConnecticut, Rhode Island and Oregon reported rate decreases of one to two percent, according to PWC. But Mississippi \u2014 hailed by Politico earlier this month as the state Obamacare left behind \u2014 has the single largest premium decrease at 9.3 percent.\n\nThe data is incomplete, as well: Arkansas included its private-option Medicaid plan in its data, for one; Oregon only reported rate changes for one silver level plan for a single, 40-year-old nonsmoker \u2014 someone who\u2019s likely to have lower insurance costs in the first place.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t include information from Alaska, Hawaii, Texas, North Dakota or Massachusetts. Alaska alone has some of the highest rate hikes on Obamacare exchanges in the country \u2014 Premera Blue Cross is upping rates between 35 and 40 percent and Moda Health by between 22 and 29 percent.\n\nThere are a number of other complicating factors \u2014 some states don\u2019t require reporting of off-exchange rate changes; other states only require reporting of larger premium hikes; and the on-and-off-exchange pools are still in flux.\n\nSome states have cut off plans that aren\u2019t compliant with Obamacare; others haven\u2019t. Some insurers have cut off the plans themselves, hoping to push healthier customers into their exchange pools instead.\n\nAll in all, unless states issue final reports or the Department of Health and Human Services, which reviews exchange plans, issues a comprehensive report, there may not be a complete picture of what\u2019s happening in Obamacare exchanges or in the individual health insurance market outside of them.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Obamacare's failing to keep costs down", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Federal and state officials have kept fairly quiet about Obamacare premiums in the days before the health law's next open enrollment period, but one thing's for sure: rates are going up this year.", "title": "Eight States Are Facing Double-Digit Premium Hikes In 2015", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/12/eight-states-are-facing-double-digit-premium-hikes-in-2015/", "image": {"width": 1149, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Obama-Obamacare-Getty-Images-Brendan-Smialowski-e1452563418498.jpg", "height": 483}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare's failing to keep costs down", "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/12/eight-states-are-facing-double-digit-premium-hikes-in-2015/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Obama-Obamacare-Getty-Images-Brendan-Smialowski-e1452563418498.jpg"}, "title": "Eight States Are Facing Double-Digit Premium Hikes In 2015 Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-12 14:42:54", "sailthru.title": "Eight States Are Facing Double-Digit Premium Hikes In 2015", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "sailthru.description": "Federal and state officials have kept fairly quiet about Obamacare premiums in the days before the health law's next open enrollment period, but one thing's for sure: rates are going up this year.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Obama-Obamacare-Getty-Images-Brendan-Smialowski-e1452563418498.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdede5\"", "article_summary": "Eight states are facing double-digit rate hikes, while just four states have reported decreases.\nLouisiana and Kansas are facing Obamacare premium hikes of more than 15 percent on average.\nIowa, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee will see rate lower double-digit rate hikes as well.\nMost states haven\u2019t compiled final premium information for the Obamacare exchange.\nJust seven states \u2014 Colorado, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Vermont \u2014 and Washington, D.C. have made final rate announcements."}
