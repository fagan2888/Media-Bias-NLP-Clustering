His office has responded.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy has become a sensation on the Right, with his no-nonsense style and committee hearing takedowns of Obama officials garnering him praise and attention.\n\nHis high profile helped start chatter about a possible run for the House Speakership \u2014 but his office has indicated that the South Carolina Republican has no interest.\n\n\u201cHe is not interested in any leadership positions and believes one can have influence without the title,\u201d Gowdy\u2019s spokeswoman, Amanda Duvall, told The Hill newspaper.\n\nGowdy held visible positions in the committee ranks during the 113th Congress, which stretched from 2013 to this year. He became one of the most quoted watchdogs on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has been become prominent during President Obama\u2019s scandal-laden second term. He chaired an immigration subcommittee on the House Judiciary Committee. And Speaker John Boehner named him to lead the special House committee investigating Benghazi.\n\nBoehner reappointed Gowdy to the position for the next Congress.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the definitive report Chairman Gowdy and the Select Committee will present to the American people,\u201d the Speaker said.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a haul for a House representative who has only been in Congress since 2011.\n\nStill, conservatives dissatisfied with Boehner\u2019s leadership have consistently searched for an alternative, and Gowdy has been a hot name of late.\n\nAs reported by the Washington Examiner, the Tea Party Leadership Fund launched a campaign in September to elevate Gowdy to the Speakership. Supporters and activists on social media helped continue the discussion. One member of Congress, Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.), said he would be behind a Gowdy bid.\n\nBut if some elements of the Right are looking for a Boehner alternative, they\u2019ll have to search elsewhere.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Rep.
