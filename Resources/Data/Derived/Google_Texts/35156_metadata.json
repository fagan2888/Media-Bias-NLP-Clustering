In one of the responses to today\u2019s announcement, the Heartland Institute President argues that \u201cRepublicans in the House and Senate are right to oppose EPA\u2019s new global warming rules,\u201d and \u201cVoters will do well to remember who was on their side during the coming political battles.\u201d\n\nIn another response, the \u201cnon-partisan\u201d group says that challenging the Obama EPA\u2019s proposed policy could be great for the GOP. \u201cIf done intelligently,\u201d Heartland\u2019s Science Director(!) Jay Lehr writes, the challenge \u201ccould cost [Obama\u2019s] party the Senate in the November elections and dramatically increase the Republican majority in the House of Representatives \u2013 which will enable the Republicans to stymie any further legislative action by the president for the remainder of his term.\u201d\n\nNow that\u2019s some good Science Directing! And some good non-partisanship! Of course, this is also the same group that purchased billboards comparing those who believe in science to \u201cThe Unabomber\u201d and Charles Manson, so it\u2019s not as though anybody would take these folks seriously, right? Wrong. They are consistently featured and quoted by theoretically legitimate mainstream media outlets in coverage of the pretend \u201cglobal warming debate\u201d.\n\nHere then, in no particular order, are the top 7 most amusing responses from the Heartland Institute\u2019s \u201cexperts\u201d, as released this morning in response to today\u2019s EPA announcement:\n\n\u201cThis is Obamacare for the environment: guaranteed to raise costs, reduce choices, and destroy an existing industry. By the time EPA is finished, millions of Americans will be freezing in the dark.\u201d \u2013 Joseph Bast, President, The Heartland Institute\n\nWell, Republicans were completely wrong about the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d), and now, wisely, are quickly abandoning their attacks on it in advance of the 2014 election, so why not double-down and call conservative, flexible, market-based, state-controlled regulations to curb emissions \u201cObamacare for the environment\u201d?! Sure. That should work!\n\nAs to \u201cAmericans freezing in the dark\u201d, thanks to the EPA, we\u2019ll keep that in mind next time we hear how climate scientists are \u201calarmists\u201d for producing peer-reviewed, independently verifiable science.\n\n\u201cIt could be the greatest miscalculation of his presidency if, in fact, cooler minds in the opposition can mount a sensible campaign to educate the public as to why he is wrong and how the economic impacts will be absolutely disastrous in the immediate future. If done intelligently, this draconian action by the president could cost his party the Senate in the November elections and dramatically increase the Republican majority in the House of Representatives \u2013 which will enable the Republicans to stymie any further legislative action by the president for the remainder of his term.\u201d \u2013 Jay Lehr, Science Director, The Heartland Institute\n\nWho knew \u201cScience Directing\u201d was so similar to Political Consulting?! Oh, that\u2019s right. The folks who claim that climate science is \u201cjunk science\u201d and that is has been \u201cpoliticized\u201d do so all the time.
