The number of start-ups fell 25.5 percent annually in the same period.\n\nHere's the caveat: many of those start-ups were formed by people who lost jobs during Michigan's deep recession, but closed them when they became re-employed in the recovery.\n\nThe number of single-employee establishments in the state fell from 307,457 in 2010 to 173,834 in 2013, according to YourEconomy.org.\n\nBecoming self-employed in the Great Recession was \"a total act of desperation,\" said Rob Fowler, CEO of the Small Business Association of Michigan.\n\nStill, new-business growth in the state has been weak in the economic recovery.\n\nMichigan had 489,980 business establishments with two or more employees in 2013, up just 1 percent from 2011, according to YourEconomy.org.\n\nNed Staebler, CEO of business incubator and accelerator TechTown Detroit, said government regulation is \"not helpful to new firm creation.\"\n\nBut he said many other factors likely play a bigger role than licensing requirements in the struggle to create and grow a business.\n\n\"Compared to getting financing, product development, retail space build out, customer acquisition, etc., (licensing is) the least of an entrepreneur's worries,\" Staebler said in an email.\n\nFowler said his association's members are struggling more with federal regulations, such as the Affordable Care Act and Labor Department rules, than with state regulations.\n\nGov. Rick Snyder's efforts to trim business regulations and occupational licensing requirements are having a positive impact on Michigan businesses, he said.\n\nFowler also believes that the data isn't yet reflecting the renewed entrepreneurial climate.\n\nHe said he especially notices the change on college campuses, where entrepreneurship is \"cool again.\"\n\nMany universities have student-led entrepreneur clubs and offer degrees in entrepreneurship.\n\n\"I'm more optimistic about young people being entrepreneurial and the culture being entrepreneurial than I have been in 20 years, he said. \"The data hasn't caught up yet.\"\n\nEmail Rick Haglund at haglund.rick@gmail.com", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Rick Haglund", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "rick haglund, news", "title": "New business growth in Michigan remains weak", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"New business growth in Michigan remains weak\", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2015/04/new_business_growth_in_michiga.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15673739\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-04-12T11:31:50Z\", \"author\": \"Rick Haglund\", \"tags\": [\"@all-business\",\"@gr-river\",\"@la-river\",\"@mlive-app\",\"@mlive-river\",\"rick haglund\"] }", "twitter": {"description": "For the first time in decades, U.S. businesses are closing at a faster pace than new ones are being started.", "title": "New business growth in Michigan remains weak", "image": "http://www.mlive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "creator": "@rhaglund", "site": "@mlive", "card": "summary"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, April 12, 2015,  1:12 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"\", \"author_name\": \"rhaglund\", \"author_nickname\": \"Rick Haglund\", \"author_id\": \"2018\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Lansing News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "For the first time in decades, U.S. businesses are closing at a faster pace than new ones are being started.", "title": "New business growth in Michigan remains weak", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2015/04/new_business_growth_in_michiga.html", "image": "http://www.mlive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, April 12, 2015,  7:30 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "For the first time in decades, U.S. businesses are closing at a faster pace than new ones are being started."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc952b\"", "article_summary": "Rick Snyder's efforts to trim business regulations and occupational licensing requirements are having a positive impact on Michigan businesses, he said.\nBusiness closings represented 8.4 percent of all business in 2012, according to the latest census data analyzed by polling firm Gallup, while business start-ups comprised 8.1 percent of all businesses.\nBut he said many other factors likely play a bigger role than licensing requirements in the struggle to create and grow a business.\nMichigan had 489,980 business establishments with two or more employees in 2013, up just 1 percent from 2011, according to YourEconomy.org.\nNed Staebler, CEO of business incubator and accelerator TechTown Detroit, said government regulation is \"not helpful to new firm creation.\""}
