Avs coach Patrick Roy said Tanguay\u2019s jaw isn\u2019t broken, as first feared, but he won\u2019t play Saturday against the Carolina Hurricanes. There is no timetable on a possible return.\n\nEverberg, who has played reasonably well as a rookie winger, suffered a separated shoulder on a third-period hit from Washington\u2019s Tom Wilson.\n\nTanguay, who turned 35 on Friday, leads the Avalanche with seven goals. His loss means forwards such as Ryan O\u2019Reilly, the team leader last season with 28 goals, must start producing if the Avs are to have hope of being a playoff club. O\u2019Reilly has only two goals in 20 games this season.\n\n\u201cYou look at how many one-goal games we\u2019ve had, and if I could step up and contribute more, we\u2019d probably have three or four more wins,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a big issue for myself and something I\u2019m definitely struggling with. It needs to change soon if we want to win some more games.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly has put 45 shots on net, but his 4.4 shooting percentage is lowest among Avalanche forwards. His minus-11 rating also is the lowest among the forwards.\n\n\u201cI have to be better, that\u2019s for sure. What worked for me last year isn\u2019t working for me this year,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cYou look at all the great athletes in sports, they always find new ways to reinvent themselves, and that\u2019s something that I have to do. It\u2019s not easy right now. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re still winning games. We\u2019re not winning games, and if I can step up, who knows?\u201d\n\nRoy keeps telling his forwards to go harder to the net, screen the goalie and fight for loose pucks. That applies to O\u2019Reilly as much as everyone else.\n\n\u201cThese areas offensively need to be better for us if we\u2019re going to score,\u201d Roy said. \u201cAnd our lengths of our shifts have to be better. When you\u2019re staying out there for a minute and 20 seconds, it\u2019s going to catch up to you. Maybe Ryan isn\u2019t shooting the puck with as much confidence, but as a coach I\u2019m certainly not going to throw him under the bus. He\u2019s not the only one (who isn\u2019t scoring). Yes, last year he scored 28 goals and I\u2019m sure that puts some pressure on him, but he\u2019ll get something soon. He\u2019s working hard and doing a lot of good things out there.\u201d\n\nSaid O\u2019Reilly: \u201cIt\u2019s got to start inside myself. I\u2019ve got to be physical, use my size and get to the front of the net.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avs\u2019 Alex Tanguay out indefinitely with facial fracture", "title": "Avs\u2019 Alex Tanguay out indefinitely with facial fracture", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/21/avs-alex-tanguay-out-indefinitely-with-facial-fracture/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140103_031457_alex-tanguay-avs-010314.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140103_031457_alex-tanguay-avs-010314.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-21T12:20:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T14:10:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Tanguay was injured Thursday when he was hit in the face by a slap shot from Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin.\nWhat worked for me last year isn\u2019t working for me this year,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said.\nAvs coach Patrick Roy said Tanguay\u2019s jaw isn\u2019t broken, as first feared, but he won\u2019t play Saturday against the Carolina Hurricanes.\nYes, last year he scored 28 goals and I\u2019m sure that puts some pressure on him, but he\u2019ll get something soon.\nHe\u2019s working hard and doing a lot of good things out there.\u201dSaid O\u2019Reilly: \u201cIt\u2019s got to start inside myself."}
