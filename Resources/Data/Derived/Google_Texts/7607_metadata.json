The newspaper reviewed records of more than 9,000 suspicious fires from 2010 to mid-2013 and found that arson has decimated the city\u2019s northeast, southwest and far west sides.\n\nArson Chief Charles Simms said the city is making progress in its long struggle with arson. Removing vacant houses will eliminate targets for arsonists, he said, and the city\u2019s bankruptcy plan frees money for blight efforts and boosting the city\u2019s arson squad.\n\nThis year, the squad expects to hire four investigators, bringing its total to 14. Detroit has the nation\u2019s highest arson rate, but the number of suspicious fires declined 14 percent last year, records show. The majority of suspicious fires are believed to be intentional, Simms said.\n\n\u201cI am optimistic we\u2019re making big changes,\u201d said Simms, who took office last year.\n\nIn response to the newspaper report, Mayor Mike Duggan said Thursday that he was \u201ccompletely dissatisfied\u201d with unsolved arsons in Detroit and said he would reform how the crime is investigated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to keep doing things the way we have been,\u201d Duggan said.\n\nHomeowner\u2019s insurance in Detroit is at least double the state average because of arson, while the city last year spent $3.5 million to demolish at least 247 homes that have caught fire since 2010, the newspaper said. Last year, 17 people died from intentionally set fires.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize arson is a felony. They think it\u2019s just a crime against the insurance company,\u201d said Lori Conarton, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Institute of Michigan, an industry group that funds anti-arson efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime against all your neighbors.\u201d\n\nMore than 1,000 blocks in Detroit had two or more suspicious fires in 2010-2013. In all, property damage from arson cost the city and Wayne County about $248 million in 2013, according to estimates from the Michigan Arson Prevention Committee, a nonprofit funded by insurance companies to discourage arson.\n\n\u201cArson is like a cancer,\u201d said Louisa Papalas, the only Wayne County assistant prosecutor assigned to handle arson cases. \u201cOnce one home is set on fire, if it\u2019s left to stand, it spreads from one house to the next. Pretty soon, there are one to two viable homes on the block.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Detroit News, http://detnews.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arson is a raging epidemic in Detroit, where vacant buildings burn faster than the city can demolish them, and is among the major lingering challenges the city faces following its emergence from bankruptcy, according to a newspaper report published after months of research.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Arson is a raging epidemic in Detroit, where vacant buildings burn faster than the city can demolish them, and is among the major lingering challenges the city faces following its emergence from bankruptcy, according to a newspaper report published after months of research.", "title": "Report: Detroit faces longtime, costly epidemic of arson", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/19/report-detroit-faces-longtime-costly-epidemic-of-a/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/19/36da5bcf107a9d086e0f6a7067008418.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/19/36da5bcf107a9d086e0f6a7067008418.jpg", "title": "Report: Detroit faces longtime, costly epidemic of arson", "description": "Arson is a raging epidemic in Detroit, where vacant buildings burn faster than the city can demolish them, and is among the major lingering challenges the city faces following its emergence from bankr", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "Detroit last year had 3,839 suspicious fires and demolished 3,500 buildings, The Detroit News reported (http://bit.ly/1DuxtrV ) Thursday.\nDetroit has the nation\u2019s highest arson rate, but the number of suspicious fires declined 14 percent last year, records show.\nRemoving vacant houses will eliminate targets for arsonists, he said, and the city\u2019s bankruptcy plan frees money for blight efforts and boosting the city\u2019s arson squad.\nArson Chief Charles Simms said the city is making progress in its long struggle with arson.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crime against all your neighbors.\u201dMore than 1,000 blocks in Detroit had two or more suspicious fires in 2010-2013."}
