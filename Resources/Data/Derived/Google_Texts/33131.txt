U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) is a member of President Obama’s so-called “strike team” that’s pumping the benefits of the Obamacare program and encouraging sign-ups as the Dec. 23 deadline looms for individuals to get coverage by Jan. 1.

Appearing on MSNBC’s Thomas Roberts program Friday, Cartwright hammered away at some existing health care plans he said were inadequate and noted at one point that Americans losing those plans is “a good thing.”

Cartwright made the argument that present health care plans that don’t meet Obamacare’s minimum standards offer only “an illusion of coverage. They have immense deductibles, they have annual and lifetime caps.”

“There’s so many people out there with what I call ‘phony insurance polices,’ and the fact that they’re going to lose those policies sooner or later I think is a good thing,” Cartwright told Roberts, adding that Obamacare would “strengthen” the U.S. health care system.

Here’s the full clip from MSNBC; Thomas’ main question for Cartwright is stated about 3:00 in, and the congressman’s “good thing” statement hits at about 3:45:
