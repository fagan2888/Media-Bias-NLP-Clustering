But with each death of a black man in custody, their efforts to overcome mistrust have hit hard walls of skepticism and outrage.\n\nTwo and a half years into his job leading the city\u2019s police department, Commissioner Anthony Batts is frustrated that the people he was appointed to serve have lost their faith in justice.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t believe what I say,\u201d Batts said in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press.\n\nMayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake hired Batts in September 2012 after a previous round of police scandals involving excessive use of force, and she was still supporting her commissioner ahead of more protests Saturday.\n\nBatts also rejected demands by several African-American ministers that he resign. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he announced Friday.\n\nHe promised to be as transparent as possible without compromising an investigation that could lead to criminal charges. Six officers have been suspended with pay since Freddie Gray died of a spinal injury he suffered during an arrest Batts characterized as questionable.\n\nBoth Batts and the mayor, who took office in 2010, are African-American and no strangers to communities like Sandtown, a set of public housing projects not far from Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor and the Orioles\u2019 baseball stadium where Gray tried to outrun three bicycle cops who spotted him on a street corner on April 12.\n\nGray, 25, was pinned to the ground and already injured when he was handcuffed and hoisted into a van, police acknowledged Friday. He repeatedly begged for medical help, but officers instead added leg irons and locked him inside again. Gray was eventually hospitalized in critical condition, and died a week later.\n\nBatts, who spent decades policing in Long Beach and Oakland, California, before taking this job, insists he is part of the solution in Baltimore. He said he\u2019s fired 50 police employees and reduced officer-involved shootings, and the use-of-force reports police must file dropped from 598 in 2012 to 435 in 2014.\n\n\u201cI have been a reform commissioner. I have taken an organization that has many challenges and faced them head-on,\u201d he insisted, even as he acknowledged that some cases have \u201ctarnished this badge and the reputation of the department.\u201d\n\nWith each death in custody and each police brutality settlement, the trust erodes even more.\n\nA Baltimore Sun investigation revealed last year that the city has paid roughly $5.7 million in brutality settlements since 2011, involving 102 instances of excessive force.\n\nAnd taxpayers keep paying: Just days after Gray\u2019s death, the city\u2019s Board of Estimates approved $80,000 for 37-year-old Timothy Ashe, whose teeth were punched out by police officer after parking illegally. A week earlier, $175,000 was awarded to the family of Michael Wudtee, who was fatally shot by an officer at a gas station in July 2012.\n\nGray is at least the fifth black man to die after police encounters since Batts took charge:\n\n\u2014 Tyrone West, 44, died in July 2013; he stopped breathing after he was tackled and handcuffed by officers during a traffic stop. The autopsy blamed a heart condition aggravated by the struggle and hot temperatures. An internal review board said the officers were justified, but said officers \u201cmade several tactical errors.\u201d West\u2019s family is suing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Each death in Baltimore makes mistrust harder to overcome", "title": "Each death in Baltimore makes mistrust harder to overcome", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Each death in Baltimore makes mistrust harder to overcome", "title": "Each death in Baltimore makes mistrust harder to overcome", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/25/each_death_in_baltimore_makes_mistrust_harder_to_overcome/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/suspect-dies-baltimore.jpeg23-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Each death in Baltimore makes mistrust harder to overcome", "title": "Each death in Baltimore makes mistrust harder to overcome", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/suspect-dies-baltimore.jpeg23-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Juliet Linderman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But with each death of a black man in custody, their efforts to overcome mistrust have hit hard walls of skepticism and outrage.\nBatts, who spent decades policing in Long Beach and Oakland, California, before taking this job, insists he is part of the solution in Baltimore.\nSix officers have been suspended with pay since Freddie Gray died of a spinal injury he suffered during an arrest Batts characterized as questionable.\nAn internal review board said the officers were justified, but said officers \u201cmade several tactical errors.\u201d West\u2019s family is suing.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t believe what I say,\u201d Batts said in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press."}
