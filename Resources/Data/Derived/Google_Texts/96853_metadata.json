As for Silverstein, he\u2019s accused of publishing what critics call a hit piece by an outspoken opponent of the Obama Iran negotiations \u2014 one who presented himself as an open-eyed observer without acknowledging his own leanings.\n\nSamuels is no neutral bystander. He spoke strongly against the nuclear talks during an April 2015 panel discussion at the conservative Hudson Institute. Even earlier, in 2009, he published an essay on Slate.com arguing the \u201crationality\u201d of an Israeli air strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear project.\n\nThe Times article has been delighting administration opponents with its inside account of how Rhodes, who was an aspiring novelist before entering politics, tweaks the White House\u2019s messages for willing and sometimes gullible journalists to share with the public.\n\nIt\u2019s also touched off a furious side debate over Samuels\u2019s description of two prominent journalists, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor, as \u201chandpicked Beltway insiders\u201d who \u201chelped retail the administration\u2019s narrative.\u201d The two are complaining to Silverstein that Samuels misrepresented them as administration shills without giving them a chance to reply.\n\nGoldberg goes a step further and charges in a blog post that Samuels bears some personal \u201canimus\u201d toward him, based on some unpleasant history between the two. It goes back several years to a failed negotiation to bring Goldberg from The Atlantic to Tablet Magazine, where Samuels\u2019s wife, Alana Newhouse, is the editor and Samuels himself was a contributing editor (he\u2019s now literary editor).\n\nFull disclosure: Both Goldberg and Newhouse are former Forward staffers, though they didn\u2019t overlap. Goldberg moved on before I became editor in 2000; Newhouse served under me as Arts & Culture editor, and moved to Tablet in 2008 after I stepped down. I\u2019ve had complicated relationships with both, now long past, but I greatly admire their work, and I think they know it.\n\nIn Samuels\u2019s most damning passage, he writes that the Iran deal was sold to the American public through a \u201clargely manufactured\u201d narrative \u2014 namely, that Washington could work with Iran once it elected a \u201cmoderate\u201d president, Hassan Rouhani, in 2013.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Rhodes tells Samuels that while he\u2019d \u201cprefer\u201d that Rouhani \u201cturns out\u201d to be moderate, the administration is \u201cnot betting on that.\u201d The agreement, Rhodes notes, is \u201cstate to state,\u201d not with any particular Iranian faction.\n\nActually, Samuels notes, the nuclear talks secretly began months before Rouhani\u2019s election, when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was still president. This means the \u201cmoderate\u201d storyline is a dodge. \u201cEven where the particulars of that story are true,\u201d Samuels writes, the \u201cimplications\u201d offered to the public were \u201coften misleading or false.\u201d\n\nConservatives are now citing the article as proof that the nuclear deal was based on a pack of lies. At least one, Illinois GOP Senator Mark Kirk, is calling for Rhodes\u2019s resignation.\n\nThe article is long and engaging, and manages to slip almost unnoticed between direct quotes by Rhodes, along with other current and former administration aides, and Samuels\u2019s own observations. For example, although it\u2019s been widely reported that Rhodes denies Rouhani is a moderate, he never actually says that. It\u2019s Samuels who puts \u201cmoderate\u201d in quotes and makes it a critical factor in ensuring the deal\u2019s public acceptance \u2014 and by implication, its legitimacy.\n\nIn the actual Iran nuclear debate, the central question wasn\u2019t whether the regime was moderate, but whether the deal\u2019s actual terms enable America and its allies to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and for how long. The debate was about numbers of centrifuges and quantities and levels of enriched uranium. Centrifuges arise only once in Samuels\u2019s article, when he notes that Rhodes doesn\u2019t seem to have much \u201cpassion\u201d for such \u201ctechnical specifics.\u201d These are \u201cmatters for negotiators and area specialists,\u201d Samuels writes.\n\nOne of the critical questions debated was whether the West would have tools to monitor Iranian compliance, since both sides assumed that Iran might try to cheat. That is, that however moderate the regime looked, it couldn\u2019t be trusted.\n\nThe election of Rouhani did enter the debate, but not as an indication that the regime could be trusted. His election simply installed a regime that was willing to negotiate seriously. Obama\u2019s diplomats secretly started talking to Iranian officials months before the election (first reported by Laura Rozen), but the focus was whether and how to negotiate, and went nowhere. Only once Rouhani entered did negotiations get serious.\n\nWhat does arouse Rhodes\u2019s passion? Samuels says it\u2019s \u201chis own sense of the urgency of radically reorienting American policy in the Middle East in order to make the prospect of American involvement in the region\u2019s future wars a lot less likely.\u201d\n\nWhat would this radical reorientation look like? In another passage, Samuels explains \u2014 without quotations or attribution \u2014 his understanding of Obama\u2019s regional goals. That, it turns out, is not any known Obama policy but a favorite right-wing talking point: \u201cBy eliminating the fuss about Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d Samuels writes, \u201cthe administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey. With one bold move, the administration would effectively begin the process of a large-scale disengagement from the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe idea that Obama wants to disentangle America from its alliances with Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey and bond instead with Iran is a popular fantasy on the anti-Obama right. One of its most articulate presentations was a February 2015 essay in the online Mosaic magazine by Hudson Institute fellow Michael Doran.\n\nDoran shared the April 2015 Hudson panel stage with Samuels. The session was moderated by another Hudson fellow, Lee Smith, who is also a senior editor at the neoconservative flagship Weekly Standard and a regular contributor to (wait for it) Tablet.\n\nTablet and Mosaic are both highly regarded as journals of Jewish thought. Both are funded by philanthropist Mem Bernstein, who gives prodigiously to promote Jewish conservatism.\n\nAs for their access to the White House and The New York Times Magazine, that part is free. And priceless.\n\nContact J.J.
