Not surprisingly, Republicans buying that premise say the government is doing too much, while even more Democrats say it's not doing enough.\n\nIn other words, people believe \"The Man\" is keeping them down. But their definition of \"The Man\" differs greatly.\n\nNot everyone feels this way.\n\nIf you're well-off and educated, you're less likely to think things are inherently unfair. Just 38 percent of those with graduate degrees believe that and 44 percent of those earning $75,000+ a year do.\n\nBut that's still a sizable number of highly educated and financially successful people who believe everything is stacked against them. My Thanksgiving sparring partner even fits into that category.\n\nThe truth is, some folks just aren't that in touch with reality.\n\nIf you're one of the 10.6 million members of the working poor, you probably won't have the luxury of arguing with your crazy Uncle Bob over pumpkin pie. You'll be working, because your job doesn't give you flexibility or holidays off.\n\nFinding affordable child care can impossible, which means you could lose your low-paying job(s). You often can't afford to live in neighborhoods that are safe and have good schools.\n\nIt makes sense if you feel things are hopeless sometimes and the system is rigged against you.\n\nBut many folks want to feel like they've made it against all odds. That's why they live in McMansions, while 600,000 Americans are homeless on any given night.\n\nThat's not to say that many of these folks haven't worked hard or deserve success.\n\nBut it's a lot easier to achieve that if your parents could send you to good public or private schools and then to college. And if you didn't have to worry about the lights being turned off or being able to afford groceries the last week of the month.\n\nNowadays, a lot of successful folks still feel powerless. The economy is shaky, as are their long-term job prospects and retirement.\n\nAnd so they get worked up over welfare cheats and illegal immigrants getting \"free stuff\" -- a staple of Fox News -- because the system is stacked against hardworking folks like them.\n\nThis sense of alienation has been rising steadily since 2002, which probably helps explain why Americans were so jumpy about scary threats like Ebola and ISIS in the run-up to the midterm elections (with an opportunistic nudge from the media and politicians).\n\nFatalism plus politics is a powerful cocktail.\n\nSusan J.
