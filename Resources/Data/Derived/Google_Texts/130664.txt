It was a big news day in the panda world.

Guangzhou’s Chimelong Safari Park announced Tuesday that a set of panda triplets was born late last month, the same day that the Edinburgh Zoo announced that one of its pandas is believed to be pregnant.

The panda cubs, born on July 29 in southern China’s Guangzhou to a mother called Juxiao, are the world’s only panda triplets currently in existence, the safari park said, as triplets have a very low survival rate. The park called their birth a “miracle,” citing advances in panda breeding technology.

The hoopla surrounding the panda cubs comes because the animals, notoriously uninterested in sex and famously choosy about mates, only have a window of several days to conceive each year. As of 2004, there were only about 1,600 pandas believed to be left in the wild.

Of course, the triplets aren’t out of the woods yet. According to the Associated Press, 26% of male panda cubs and 20% of females die within their first year.

According to the San Diego Zoo, panda cubs usually open their eyes at around 50 to 60 days and begin crawling by about 10 weeks. The zoo also notes that sometimes pandas can become pregnant with more than one cub but only give birth to one, as their bodies reabsorb the other embryos.
