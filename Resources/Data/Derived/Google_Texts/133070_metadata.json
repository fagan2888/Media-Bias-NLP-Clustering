Now there\u2019s \"Obamacore,\" the name that detractors have cooked up for the Common Core State Standards. So far, 44 states have implemented the standards created by the bipartisan National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers.\n\nA new report released by the Southern Poverty Law Center titled \u201cPublic Schools in the Crosshairs: Far-Right Propaganda and the Common Core State Standards\u201d says there is a \u201cfierce grassroots campaign threatening to derail the Common Core State Standards\u2026fueled by far-right propaganda that relies heavily on distortions, outright falsehoods, and demonizing conspiracy theories promoted by antigovernment extremists.\u201d\n\nThe SPLC, based in Birmingham, Ala., is a nonprofit civil rights organization known for its legal victories against white supremacist groups and for uncovering numerous militia groups and extremists in America. It also offers educational programs that promote tolerance in schools.\n\nResearched by the SPLC\u2019s Intelligence Project and Teaching Tolerance program, the report notes that Christian conservatives and members of the Tea Party movement believe that Common Core standards are being used in schools as \u201cgovernment indoctrination camps\u201d to promote homosexuality and an anti-American, anti-Christian lifestyle.\n\n\u201cThese claims may sound outlandish\u2014and they are\u2014but the fact is, millions of Americans are absorbing this extremist propaganda, and it\u2019s having a very real impact,\u201d Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC\u2019s Intelligence Project, said in a statement. \u201cThese lies are being repeated in churches, legislative hearings, and town hall meetings across the country.\u201d It\u2019s a familiar narrative to anyone who followed the manufactured outrage over the health care reforms President Obama proposed in 2009; remember \u201cdeath panels\u201d?\n\nThe SPLC points out that the anti\u2013Common Core agenda has been seized by popular conservatives such as media personality Glenn Beck, who has called the standards \u201cevil,\u201d and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nPaul and seven other senators have signed on to sponsor legislation to stop federal funding for any aspect of the Common Core.\n\nJerusha Conner, an education professor at Villanova University, studies educational movements that include the Common Core, No Child Left Behind, and Race to the Top. She says that the SPLC report \u201cexposes how relentless campaigns promulgated by right-wing and libertarian politicians, think tanks, media, and academics have worked to spread myths about the Common Core and undermine public confidence in America\u2019s free, secular system of public schooling.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, education advocates from across the political spectrum say attention should focus on educators\u2019 concerns about the standards. These issues include whether the standards were adequately tested before implementation, whether the standards make teachers \u201cteach to the test,\u201d whether teachers received enough training about the standards, and whether it\u2019s wise and fair to evaluate them on the results of standard-aligned tests.\n\nSome on the right, such as Lindsey Burke, a Will Skillman Fellow in education at the Heritage Foundation, say conservatives aren\u2019t alone in their opposition to Common Core.\n\n\u201cBoth sides of the aisle have voiced thoughtful concerns about Common Core,\u201d Burke says. She notes that the heads of the two largest teachers\u2019 unions have spoken out against aspects of Common Core implementation. \u201cMore importantly, parents are frustrated with the Common Core\u2013aligned homework and tests their children are bringing home and don\u2019t know where to turn when they have questions,\u201d Burke continues.\n\nThe 40-page report cites that criticism comes \u201cfrom all points on the political spectrum and from some leading education experts.\u201d It also outlines some of the educational concerns but focuses more on the right\u2019s extremism about the standards.\n\nSabrina Stevens, executive director of Integrity in Education, a project whose mission is to restore integrity to the conversation about public education, says there are bigger educational issues to discuss than the extreme right\u2019s mission to destroy the Common Core standards.\n\n\u201cI think that the SPLC does important work and does a good job detailing some of the outlandish right-wing criticisms of the Common Core,\u201d Stevens says. \u201cBut it\u2019s troubling that well-founded, important critiques of CCSS aren\u2019t given this same kind of airtime, especially in light of CCSS\u2019 origins.\" Stevens points out the involvement of private enterprise in designing the standards: \u201cWe should be skeptical of a project that originates with people who stand to make a profit off of it, especially when the people who will be most directly impacted by it were completely left out of the design process. Yet that conversation rarely happens, because the media is too enamored with \u2018Obamacore\u2019 conspiracy theorists to listen to those of us raising more grounded and important concerns.\u201d\n\nBut the SPLC writes that these \u201clegitimate\u201d criticisms are undermined by the extreme right\u2019s \u201ccloud of fear-mongering propaganda and extremist hyperbole.\u201d\n\nThe report argues that the Christian right has long been against public education, citing many examples, include one in which a founder of the modern conservative movement, Rev. Jerry Falwell, said in 1979 he hoped to see the day when \u201cwe won\u2019t have any public schools.\u201d\n\nThe various anti-standard movements appear to be successfully derailing the implementation in many states.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 100 Common Core bills have been filed in state legislatures this year. Many are aimed at slowing or stopping the standards.\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing, Burke says. \u201cEfforts like Common Core national standards and tests further centralize education at the expense of state and local policymaking.\u201d\n\nThe far right\u2019s move to commandeer the Common Core standards comes at a time when support for public education is waning and private schools and home schooling are increasing, according to the report. Such conflict puts public education at risk for all kids in this country.\n\n\u201cThe higher standards of the Common Core may be for naught if schools do not have the resources and support they need to meet them,\u201d Conner says.\n\nStevens agrees. \u201cThis country has eliminated over 300,000 education jobs in the last few years; what does it do for \u2018readiness\u2019 when some students don\u2019t have college counselors or teachers to teach the foreign languages, arts, and science programs that will make them adequate, let alone competitive, applicants in the admissions process? Why are we buying new tests when children are getting gravely ill in schools with no full-time nurse?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Suzi Parker", "description": "How much is the far right undermining the new state standards?", "rights": "TakePart is the Social Action Network\u2122 of Participant Media. \u00a9 2008-2016 TakePart, LLC", "og": {"site_name": "TakePart", "description": "How much is the far right undermining the new state standards?", "title": "'Obamacore': How Propaganda Is Distorting the Common Core Debate", "url": "http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/05/14/undermining-common-core-state-standards", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/469040813_0.jpg", "height": 427}, "type": "article"}, "abstract": "How much is the far right undermining the new state standards?", "sailthru.date": "2014-05-14 11:04:14", "MobileOptimized": 320, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "education,in-the-news,teach,common-core-standards,common-core-standards-initiative,openpublish_article", "fb": {"admins": 1327833247, "pages": 9287842439, "app_id": 247137505296280}, "keywords": "Education, In the News", "tab-keywords": "Education, In the News, teach, common core standards, Common Core Standards Initiative", "twitter": {"description": "How much is the far right undermining the new state standards?", "title": "'Obamacore': How Propaganda Is Distorting the Common Core Debate", "url": "http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/05/14/undermining-common-core-state-standards", "image": "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/469040813_0.jpg", "creator": "@TakePart", "site": "@TakePart", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Now there\u2019s \"Obamacore,\" the name that detractors have cooked up for the Common Core State Standards.\nShe notes that the heads of the two largest teachers\u2019 unions have spoken out against aspects of Common Core implementation.\nPaul and seven other senators have signed on to sponsor legislation to stop federal funding for any aspect of the Common Core.\n\u201cBoth sides of the aisle have voiced thoughtful concerns about Common Core,\u201d Burke says.\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 100 Common Core bills have been filed in state legislatures this year."}
