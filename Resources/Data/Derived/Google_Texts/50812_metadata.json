All accounts are that he was very well received by the ultra-right conservatives of the Texas GOP. They like their Angus steaks bloody and rare and he delivered.\n\nFirst he laid out his agenda, which is actually quite clever:\n\n\u2026 from repealing \u201cevery blessed word\u201d of Obamacare and the Common Core educational standards, to auditing the Federal Reserve and standing with Israel and dissidents around the world. He even struck a populist note, saying, \u201cthe rich keep getting richer and richer, and everyone else gets left behind,\u201d while those in the \u201ccorrupt, bipartisan cabal in Washington\u201d succeed.\n\nMix together a dash of Rand Paul, a soup\u00e7on of Tea Party, a smidgen of standard Washington loathing and even a tiny skosh of Occupy Wall Street and you\u2019ve got the basis for an unusual GOP amuse bouche. Ladle on some Ronald Reagan secret sauce and you\u2019ve got a Republican recipe that actually sounds like it might work:\n\n\u201cThere was a time when we had another president, like President Obama, we had Jimmy Carter,\u201d he said to boos. \u201cAnd all of us remember how quickly things can change.\u201d\n\nThe senator, who at times has been a pariah within his own party in Washington and faced tough headlines over his role in the government shutdown last fall, said of Reagan, as he praised him for ending the Cold War: \u201cAll of the intelligentsia, all of the cognoscenti, they tittered at such uneducated, Philistine views. He didn\u2019t have the sophistication, he didn\u2019t have the nuance, he didn\u2019t understand detente \u2014 which I\u2019m pretty sure is French for surrender.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201ccognoscenti.\u201d And his little dig at the French is a very Reaganesque kind of joke.\n\nBut he\u2019s right about the bigger picture there as well. The intelligentsia did dismiss Reagan as a clown, to the extent that many of them literally couldn\u2019t believe he could win. It simply wasn\u2019t possible for someone with such a far-right hawkish worldview to become president. Surely someone with these simplistic ideas could never become president. He was nothing but an actor, for goodness\u2019 sake. We know what happened. And one cannot help hearing the echoes of that point of view today when it\u2019s taken as an article of faith that the American people must reject the GOP because of its extremism.\n\nCruz also made a case for himself as the new Reagan based upon a couple of structural factors that have not been commonly articulated by others:\n\n\u201cIn 1980, we saw the Reagan Revolution, we saw in the face of stagnation, in the face of feckless, naive foreign policy, in the face of America getting weaker and weaker, we saw a grassroots movement that turned the country around \u2026 that same thing is happening today.\u201d\n\nThat shows a conscious pivot from the domestic affairs that have dominated politics since the financial crisis back to foreign policy and national security, which have been traditional Republican strengths. (It\u2019s likely this will become an even greater focus if a Democratic woman gets the nomination, playing into their usual \u201cfeminization\u201d strategy in a literal way. Benghazi!\u2122 is just the opener.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Cruz's telling, the Tea Party of 2016 is like the conservative movement of 1980.
