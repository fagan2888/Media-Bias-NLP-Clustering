Field Representatives for U.S. Senators John Barrasso, Mike Enzi and Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis held public “office hours” Thursday in Sheridan. Sheridan Media’s Ron Richter has the story.

DeAnna Kay, Oklee Anderson and Matt Jones listened to a handful of residents concerns over what is going on in our Nation’s Capital. All three of the representatives took notes that will be passed on to Wyoming’s delegation in Washington D.C.

Topics ranged from national security and Obamacare, to the budget and electromagnetic pulse weaponry. I caught up with Sheridan County resident Mike Watkins following the meeting.

Following the “office hours” at the Sheridan County YMCA, the field representatives traveled out to Ranchester where a similar meeting was held at the Town Hall.
