Michael Bennet on Friday became the latest senator to publicly declare his support for the White House nuclear deal with Iran \u2014 ending weeks of speculation on how he would vote on the controversial agreement.\n\nAs part of his declaration, the Colorado lawmaker and former Democratic campaign chief also unveiled a new legislative proposal that Bennet says will strengthen the deal while steering more money to Israel for its national defense.\n\n\u201cOur primary objectives are to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon, make sure Israel is safe and, if possible, avoid another war in the Middle East,\u201d said Bennet in a statement that was released first to The Denver Post. \u201cThis agreement represents a flawed, but important step to accomplish those goals.\u201d\n\nBoth the timing and the context of his announcement are striking, as each provide a window into Bennet as both policymaker and politician as he moves forward with his 2016 run for re-election.\n\nOnly two days before, President Barack Obama secured the last vote he needed to keep the Iran deal alive in the face of a critical, Republican-led Congress.\n\nThat assurance came Wednesday morning when Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., became the 34th senator to pledge her support \u2014 a significant milestone because that meant Obama had recruited enough Senate allies to block a bill that would undermine the deal.\n\nBy coming forward now, Bennet still is able to register his support while avoiding the political fallout that comes with being the \u201cdeciding\u201d vote, a label that was used to great effect in past elections to target Senate backers of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhich is why Bennet\u2019s roll-out of a new legislative package that includes funding for Israeli security is also significant.\n\nSeveral major Jewish organizations and donors \u2014 including past Bennet supporters \u2014 have made clear they oppose the Iran deal.\n\nIntroducing the legislative sidebar then becomes an effort to blunt blowback while allaying Bennet\u2019s own concerns about Israeli security in the wake of the nuclear agreement. His partner on the legislative package is fellow Senate Democrat Ben Cardin of Maryland, who on Friday told The Baltimore Sun he would vote no.\n\n\u201cAs a good politician, (Bennet) is addressing both \u2014 what he thinks is the foreign policy component of this as well as the domestic politics,\u201d said Floyd Ciruli, a Denver-based political analyst.\n\nThe basic terms of the nuclear deal call for an easing of economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for a dramatic drop in the country\u2019s capacity to produce nuclear material, as well as new regime of international monitoring.\n\nWhether the specifics of the agreement are stringent enough to prevent Iran from one day developing nuclear weapons, however, is a hotly-debated question and one that has triggered no small amount of lobbying and political advertising in Washington and Colorado.\n\nBecause of this atmosphere, it\u2019s difficult to deny the political calculations that have gone into the timing and context of the move by Bennet, who recently finished a turn as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nImmediately following the announcement, a spokesman with the Republican National Committee slammed the move.\n\n\u201cSenator Bennet has shown his loyalty lies with Washington Democrats, at the expense of our national security, said RNC spokesman Fred Brown in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Clinton-Obama Iran deal not only falls short of the Administration\u2019s own goals, it empowers the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism while never ultimately blocking Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nBut Bennet supporters have said repeatedly that the actual decision was based on policy and not with Election Day in mind \u2014 and that it would have been easier politically to vote against it, especially since the White House already had secured the 34th vote it needed in the Senate.\n\nThe claim backed by several players on both sides of the debate, who confirmed Bennet has spent weeks talking to a wide range of voices \u2014 from weapons inspectors to former members of Israeli security forces \u2014 in trying to understand the deal\u2019s repercussions.\n\nBennet\u2019s staff said the boss even took calls last month while trying to teach his teenage daughter to drive.\n\nMark Dubowitz, a vocal opponent of the deal, said he has spoken with more than 200 members of Congress, either one-on-one or in a group setting, and he described Bennet as \u201cvery open-minded and thoughtful and serious in these conversations.\u201d\n\nBut he said he sensed deep conflict too in Bennet and other congressional Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey are all anguished about this agreement and I would use the word anguished,\u201d said Dubowitz, who serves as executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The Obama \u201cadministration has given them no choice.\u201d\n\nIn his statement announcing support, Bennet spoke of the tough time he had trying to come to a decision.\n\n\u201cIt is no surprise to me that there are sincere, heartfelt differences of opinion about the merits of this deal. \u2018There are no prophets in our time,\u2019 a former Israeli general told me. I agree. None of us knows what lies 10 or 15 years on the horizon,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said a few factors convinced him. One is that the major international players involved in the deal, such as China and Russia, would be unwilling to go back to the negotiating table if the U.S. backs out \u2014 leaving Washington without future leverage.\n\nAnother reason he cited is that signing the agreement would give the U.S. more credibility in the future if it is discovered that Iran cheats on the deal and the White House wants to take action.\n\nEven so, Bennet said he was not completely satisfied, which is why he is introducing the pro-Israeli legislation with Cardin. It\u2019s also why Bennet said it took so long for him to announce his position, as he still was sorting out the details of the package.\n\nThat legislation, which they plan to formally introduce soon, has several components. It forces the administration to keep track of Iran after it gets sanctions relief with the goal of finding out whether the money would go to terrorism groups.\n\nThe package also aims to give the U.S. more leverage if it\u2019s discovered Iran is cheating even a little bit.\n\nFinally, Bennet said it would \u201cprovide Israel the necessary conventional deterrence to ensure Iran cannot shield covert systems and facilities, no matter how deeply they are buried.\u201d\n\nThe Colorado lawmaker has a personal connection to the debate as well, especially when discussing what it means for the future survival of Israel and the Jewish people.\n\nIn earlier speeches, Bennet has talked about his mother\u2019s family and the struggle she and his grandparents went through as Jews in Poland during World War II.\n\n\u201cShe and her parents endured that war in and around Warsaw. They and an aunt were the only members of their family to survive. Everybody else in their family perished at the hands of the Nazis,\u201d he said in a floor speech delivered in May 2013.\n\nHis decision comes after weeks of pressure from all sides of the debate, from activists to administration officials.\n\nEarlier this week, dozens of former federal lawmakers wrote a letter in support of the Iran agreement.\n\nThe list included several notable Colorado Democrats, including former senators Gary Hart, Tim Wirth and Mark Udall, and ex-House members Patricia Schroeder and David Skaggs.\n\nThey described the deal as the \u201cmost viable means to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and protect the security of the United States, Israel and other allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe agree that no deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d they continued. \u201cBut we also agree that a good deal is better than no deal.\u201d\n\nAdvocacy groups have taken to the airwaves too. Two organizations \u2014 the American Security Initiative and Veterans Against the Deal \u2014 teamed up to spend $700,000 in Colorado as part of $6.2 million national campaign aimed at putting pressure on undecided lawmakers.\n\nIn the 30-second spot, one wounded soldier says he was \u201cblown up by Iranian bomb\u201d and \u2014 with a picture of Bennet glowing onscreen \u2014 he adds that \u201cevery politician who\u2019s involved in this will be held accountable\u201d and that a \u201cvote for this deal means more money for Iranian terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to make people aware,\u201d said Michael Pregent, executive director of Veterans Against the Deal.\n\nOther groups have advertised too, including J Street, which supports the deal, and Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran, an outfit tied to the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which opposes the agreement.\n\nAccording to one estimate from a Democratic firm that tracks media buys, opponents of the deal have spent more than $1.3 million on TV ads in Colorado \u2014 more than three times as much as supporters of the agreement.\n\nIt\u2019s one reason why Brent Scowcroft, former national security adviser to presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, said Bennet was making the tough, but right, call.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the courageous thing to do. It may not be good politics but its good policy,\u201d said Scowcroft, who supports the deal.\n\nOne survey released this week by the University of Maryland found that 55 percent of the respondents it polled wanted Congress to back the deal. A Quinnipiac University poll of Colorado voters this April found that 67 percent of the voters it reached supported a negotiated a settlement with Iran; 26 percent disagreed.\n\nNow that Bennet has announced his support, that means every member of the Colorado congressional delegation has registered his or her opinion \u2014 with every Republican against the deal and all the Democrats in favor.\n\nWhile Miksulski\u2019s backing of the deal drains much of the drama from the debate, the issue is not completely settled.\n\nHer endorsement means critics won\u2019t have enough support in Congress to pass a bill in opposition that can overcome a veto by Obama, who has threatened that move from the start.\n\nWith several Democrats still undeclared, though, there remains the possibility that a bill opposing the deal won\u2019t even make it to the president\u2019s desk \u2014 as Senate Democrats could have the numbers to simply filibuster the measure.\n\nIt\u2019s a scenario that one opponent called \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cDenying an up-or-down vote on this issue would be a miscarriage of our leadership,\u201d said Mark Wallace, CEO of the group United Against Nuclear Iran.\n\nMark K.
