Keep Fit will offer deductibles ranging from about $1,500 to $10,000, and premiums of roughly $150 to $300 monthly, after the Affordable Care Act tax credits are calculated.\n\nInsurers note that customers will be given ample assistance by experts and brokers in choosing a new plan, whether it is a 1-year fix or a more comprehensive shopping experience.\n\nState Insurance Commissioner Ann Flood announced Friday that she will allow all Michigan insurance companies to revive cancelled plans through 2014, even if they do not meet ACA standards for coverage.\n\nWhile the president left that decision in the hands of each state insurance commissioner, Flood said insurers may have trouble shifting gears this late in the game, with the first applicants receiving coverage on Jan. 1.\n\nThe Michigan Association of Health Plans said they agreed with the commissioner\u0092s decision to give consumers maximum flexibility as the health care system transitions toward new standards.\n\nMany Michiganders who need new coverage will still be sent to the ACA online exchange that categorizes health plans into four categories based on quality and price: platinum, gold, silver and bronze. The variety of plans will force those who lost their coverage in the wave of cancellations to choose the right mix of premiums, deductibles and co-pays.\n\nMarti Lolli, director of health care reform for Grand Rapids-based Priority Health, said it is \u0093nearly impossible\u0094 to design a bronze plan without big deductibles. That\u0092s because the bronze plans offer low premiums but force the consumer to pay 40 percent of overall expenses as out-of-pocket costs.\n\nAs a result, nearly all of the 12 bronze plans on the healthcare.gov web page for southeast Michigan require a family deductible of $10,000 to $12,000 yearly.\n\n\u0093For most people, a silver or a gold plan is what they need,\u0094 said Lolli, whose company is grandfathering all 2013 individual plans for another year.\n\nFor example, in exchange for higher premiums, Priority Health offers a silver family plan with a deductible capped at $1,500 and a gold plan with a $1,000 deductible for families.\n\nBlue Cross has a gold plan on the ACA exchange with deductibles as low as $150 to $250.\n\nBurke warned that the trend toward higher deductibles took hold before the dawn of Obamacare.\n\n\u0093The deductibles in the bronze plans are consistent with what we see now in the individual market,\u0094 he said.\n\nOf course, policies with a combination of low premiums and high deductibles lure many consumers who are in good health. But they present a significant financial risk because one major illness or injury can rack up bills of $15,000 to $50,000. Premiums vary by income, age and geography.\n\nThough the many breakdowns on the federal website have sharply limited enrollments, early indications are that many low-income people can sign up for a plan that, due to the tax subsidies, will cost them nearly nothing for premiums.\n\nAt the same time, some insurers say the subsidies for those with incomes at 300 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level are miniscule, which means they are paying at or near the \u0093retail price.\u0094 The maximum eligibility of 400 percent of the poverty line equals an income of about $46,000 for an individual and $94,000 for a family.\n\nA segment of people living above those income standards are nonetheless uninsured because they choose to not buy coverage. The Obamacare individual mandate will change that.\n\nIndustry experts say that many of the customers who buy on the individual market are small business owners who don\u0092t offer coverage at their workplace or the self-employed. About one-fourth of the individual market policy holders are seeking transitory coverage of 12 months or less due to a job change or other financial circumstances, according to BCBS.\n\nA study that was released on Thursday by Families USA, a nonprofit that advocates for health care consumers, put the best face on the situation.\n\nThe report described the individual market this way: just 5.7 percent of the population relies on that market; among those buyers, about 70 percent will qualify for tax subsidies or the ACA\u0092s expanded Medicaid coverage.\n\nThe conclusion, according to Families USA Executive Director Ron Pollack, is that the people who want to continue buying their plan on the individual market but do not qualify for federal subsidies represent\n\n0.6 percent of the nation\u0092s non-elderly population.\n\nFor those who will qualify for a subsidy, some careful calculations are ahead.\n\n\u0093People need to pay attention,\u0094 Pollack said, \u0093to the tradeoff between premiums and deductibles.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Michigan, Michigan news, Macomb Michigan news, MI Michigan news, US Michigan news, world Michigan news.", "title": "Insurers say high Obamacare deductibles only part of the story", "og": {"url": "http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20131123/NEWS/131129746", "image": {"width": "640px", "identifier": "http://www.macombdaily.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MD/20131123/NEWS/131129746/AR/0/AR-131129746.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "485px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Insurers say high Obamacare deductibles only part of the story"}, "twitter": {"domain": "macombdaily.com", "description": "Michigan health insurers and Obamacare advocates say the array of insurance plans on the online marketplace offer a mix of features \u0096 not just high deductibles of $10,000 or more \u0096 and once the uproar over the new system quiets most people on the individ", "title": "Insurers say high Obamacare deductibles only part of the story", "url": "http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20131123/NEWS/131129746", "image": {"src": "http://www.macombdaily.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MD/20131123/NEWS/131129746/AR/0/AR-131129746.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@macombdaily", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551763849", "iphone": "id520209090", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.macombdaily"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Michigan, Michigan news, Macomb Michigan news, MI Michigan news, US Michigan news, world Michigan news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Michigan health insurers and Obamacare advocates say the array of insurance plans on the online marketplace offer a mix of features \u0096 not just high deductibles of $10,000 or more \u0096 and once the uproar over the new system quiets most people on the individ"}, "article_summary": "Of course, policies with a combination of low premiums and high deductibles lure many consumers who are in good health.\n\u0093The deductibles in the bronze plans are consistent with what we see now in the individual market,\u0094 he said.\nThe variety of plans will force those who lost their coverage in the wave of cancellations to choose the right mix of premiums, deductibles and co-pays.\nIndustry experts say that many of the customers who buy on the individual market are small business owners who don\u0092t offer coverage at their workplace or the self-employed.\n\u0093People need to pay attention,\u0094 Pollack said, \u0093to the tradeoff between premiums and deductibles.\u0094"}
