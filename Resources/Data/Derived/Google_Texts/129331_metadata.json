Right now, cash reserves stand at $28.5 million and can cover the shortfall.\n\nThe budget plan is aggressive in two areas, enrollment projections and expense control, said Gary Drews, the recently replaced interim chief executive. He stayed on to see months of financial strategizing adopted.\n\nThe board, in executive session, approved a plan to consolidate call-center services under one vendor, CGI, instead of the current three, and to renegotiate for a fixed price, integrated service center, including technology, staffing, systems and maintenance.\n\nThe move should improve service levels and shave $4 million off the 2015 call-center cost of $22 million, according to the budget. The fiscal year begins July 1.\n\nThe budget includes an increase in exchange staff size from 53 positions to 78, including 11 contractor positions that will be converted to in-house jobs. The net salary increase will be $3.5 million, but an offsetting drop in contractor costs means a net increase of $1.7 million, according to the budget.\n\nStaff is projecting enrollment by the end of the next fiscal year, June 30, 2016, to be 217,306, of which an estimated 169,499 are expected to complete the process by paying their premiums. Lives covered through the exchange now total 123,462.\n\nOne of the biggest unknowns is how much money the exchange might be reimbursed by the federal government for costs it incurred handling Medicaid enrollees.\n\nThe fees on 2016 plans purchased through the marketplace during the next enrollment period will go from the current 1.4 percent of premiums to 3.5 percent, the same rate charged on the federal exchange. The broad market assessment charged every month on each private policy \u2014 purchased on or off the exchange \u2014 increases from $1.25 to $1.80 for 2016, its last year.\n\n\u201cI think this is a budget that can actually work,\u201d board member and finance committee chair Arnold Salazar said. \u201cI really think this is our best shot of making it work.\u201d\n\nThe new interim CEO, Kevin Patterson, who came on board a month ago, said all the budget schemes aiming for financial sustainability, after federal grants run out in 2015, will not work if the customer experience doesn\u2019t markedly improve over the last rocky open-enrollment period.\n\nTo that end, the budget includes $8.8 million in IT and other capital investment.\n\nElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado health insurance exchange board approves budget", "title": "Colorado health insurance exchange board approves budget", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/08/colorado-health-insurance-exchange-board-approves-budget/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150520__healthexchangep1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150520__healthexchangep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-08T14:36:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T07:23:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Connect for Health Colorado\u2019s $53.7 million budget, approved without dissent Monday, will generate a cash operating deficit of $4.6 million and a total deficit, after IT and other capital investment, of $13.3 million.\nThe state health insurance exchange bumped up its fee levels for next year as expected on Monday, but the change won\u2019t add enough revenue to cover costs during fiscal 2016.\n\u201cI think this is a budget that can actually work,\u201d board member and finance committee chair Arnold Salazar said.\nThe budget includes an increase in exchange staff size from 53 positions to 78, including 11 contractor positions that will be converted to in-house jobs.\nThe move should improve service levels and shave $4 million off the 2015 call-center cost of $22 million, according to the budget."}
