(Warning: Some of the videos contain language that may be offensive to some readers.)\n\nThe newest, however, uploaded as a first effort by contributor Laxbk, may be hard to top.\n\nThe scene opens with Hitler\u2019s officers complaining about the loss of health care through employers.\n\n\u201cJust tell them to sign up with the Obamacare exchange at Healthcare.gov,\u201d Hitler responds.\n\n\u201cNo one can get logged on. \u2026 The website is a joke,\u201d\n\nHitler then sends everyone \u201cwho has received an Obamacare waiver letter personally signed by Kathleen Sebelius\u201d out of the room.\n\nHe erupts.\n\n\u201cObamcare was supposed to be perfect. Premiums are supposed to be down $2,500 a year. It had everything. Free preventative care. No disenrollment for pre-existing conditions, even free birth control and abortifacients \u2026 for slutty college coeds,\u201d he shouts.\n\n\u201cAnd now you tell me people can\u2019t sign up? Do you realize how hard we worked with supreme leader Jarrett to make sure this thing worked?\u201d\n\nHe calls the program \u201ca big scam\u201d on Americans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just access to insurance, not care. So everyone will be happy, as long as they don\u2019t need actual medical care. When they do get care, they won\u2019t realize that everyone has the same problems getting seen by a doctor.\n\n\u201cThe lengths we went through to get this far; the \u2018executive order\u2019 on abortion to fool Stupak; the \u2018Cornhusker kickback,\u2019 the \u2018Louisiana Purchase,\u2019 \u2018deem and pass.\u2019 We even got John Roberts to call the fine a \u2018tax.'\u201d\n\nHe also complains that the health insurance companies \u201cwon\u2019t play along with us and operate at a loss to keep premiums from rising.\u201d\n\nThere are digs at Fox News, Ford Pintos, ACORN and Obama\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing left to do so now gentlemen,\u201d he concludes. \u201cLet\u2019s find a way to blame Bush.\u201d\n\nAnother Hitler parody has him planning to interrupt Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The president, members of Congress, celebrities and many others have gone on video to praise or criticize Obamacare, the administration\u2019s signature health-care law that will consume huge portions of the American economy and radically change the way health-care decisions are made.
