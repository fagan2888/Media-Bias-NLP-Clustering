Creationist Ken Ham, most widely known for debating Bill Nye “The Science Guy,” clarified his comments about funding the U.S. space program search for alien life and fired back at “messed up” Bill Maher and Neil deGrasse Tyson.

At the end of July, on the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, Ken Ham, president and founder of Answers in Genesis and the Creation Museum, wrote a blog post about all of the money being wasted on the search for alien life.

“I’m shocked at the countless hundreds of millions of dollars that have been spent over the years in the desperate and fruitless search for extraterrestrial life.”

Why? Because of the bible.

“An understanding of the gospel makes it clear that salvation through Christ is only for the Adamic race—human beings who are all descendants of Adam,” Ham wrote.
