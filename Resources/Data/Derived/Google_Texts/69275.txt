If you are going to be driving across or through Port Authority bridges and tunnels, be ready to pay more on Sunday.

Toll prices are scheduled to go up on Dec. 7, the fourth of five annual hikes set by in August 2011. The highest toll will be for trucks crossing the bridge without E-ZPass and at peak times.

That toll? $114.

All of the tolls depend on what kind of vehicle you have and whether you pay with E-ZPass or cash. Driving during peak hours can also make your toll payment more expensive.
