Since 2002, 13 developmentally disabled (I/DD) people died as a direct result of abuse, neglect, and lack of supervision, according to the records released by the state\u2019s Department of Public Health. Men and women with severe autism, cerebral palsy, and other debilitating conditions are the primary developmental centers\u2019 residents.\n\nTwo developmentally disabled women were forced into oral sex and sexual intercourse with a male patient in their co-ed living areas, while another patient was unable to give sexual consent and was ultimately raped. The report notes the facility failed to protect clients from sexual abuse by not implementing abuse prevention, reporting, or supervision policies.\n\nIn another situation, a 44-year-old patient with I/DD and the cognitive level equivalent to a 10-year-old, broke a rule by not staying where he was told to. He left the group and returned to his room, where he was followed by a 6-foot-3, 400-pound employee with a history of violence. The report indicates he threw the patient to the ground, stomped on his back, and chocked him until he lost consciousness.\n\nOnce he went into cardiac arrest as a direct result of the abuse, the employee did perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but after 10 attempts he reportedly said, \u201cf--- him,\u201d before walking away. The patient spent 11 days in an intensive care unit on a ventilator until he recovered, with shoe print-shaped bruises on his neck.\n\nA year later, another patient was admitted into an intensive care unit. After a few days, the patient died, but it wasn\u2019t until the autopsy report listed the cause of death as, \u201cblunt head trauma with skull fractures and bleeding in the brain.\u201d The staff member reported the patient fell out of their wheelchair and hit their head on the floor. The investigation reveals the facility\u2019s repeated failure to supervise patients put this particular victim at risk for \u201ceither imminent danger that death or serious harm would result.\u201d\n\nWhether clients were abused because of neglect from the facility, or beaten by their roommate, the Department of Health\u2019s report is one of startlingly dark behavior. One teenage resident successfully smothered another teenager to death after an employee skipped her normal rounds. Another patient suffered infections from misplaced feeding tubes that doctors, nurses, and care staff all failed to notice. The list of violations goes on.\n\n\u201cWe have over a century of evidence telling us that all institutions, no matter how beautiful, no matter how carefully designed, no matter how well-intentioned, fail. Every time,\u201d Julia Bascom, director of programs at The Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, a disability rights organization, told The Daily Beast. Bascom argues large institutions foster dangerous conditions, which is why, she says, they will continue to follow a historical pattern of failure.\n\nBeing subjected to abuse is one of the hidden areas of life for a person with a developmental disability, according to Mental Health Consultants. One of the most difficult aspects of abuse for the developmentally disabled is being able to identify signs, and for victims to communicate to caretakers and family members.\n\nDeinstitutionalizing patients is historically credited to end the ongoing omnipresent abuse and neglect in mental institutions. Take investigative reporter Nellie Bly\u2019s 1987 undercover experiences in New York City\u2019s most notorious mental institution on Blackwell Island. Her expos\u00e9 \"Ten Days In A Madhouse,\" was the public\u2019s first glimpse into rampant abuse in the asylums, which helped bring reform. Yet abuse still persists nearly 130 years later.\n\nA Better Future of Care for the Disabled\n\n\u201cAny time you take one group of people, force them together because they share a stigmatized characteristic, isolate them from the broader community, and exercise control over their lives \u2014 who they can see, what choices they can make, what and when they will eat, who they will socialize with, where they will live \u2014 it\u2019s an inherently bad thing,\u201d Bascom said. \u201cThe problem is that they are segregated and deprived of choice, control, and community. The problem is the setting.\u201d\n\nThe first step toward solving the problem is figuring out how a person with developmental disabilities wants to live his or her life, according to Bascom. The next step is deciding what time of support needs to be put in place in order to create their ideal reality of life, known as \u201cperson-centered planning.\u201d The process\u2019s main focus is to empower people with disabilities while keeping them and those around them safe, and improve their overall quality of life, according to Cornell University\u2019 Employment and Disability Institute.\n\nAccording to experts, giving people with disabilities the option to choose their own pathway toward success by figuring out what they need and addressing it to the best of their ability provides a humane approach to care.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "california, mental, institutions, physical, mental, and, emotional, abuse, published", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A government report outlines recurrence of neglect and abuse to patients living in mental institutions.", "title": "Gov't Report Reveals Horrifying Life Inside California Asylums", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/california-mental-institutions-physical-mental-and-emotional-abuse-published-329634", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/16/mental-institution-abuse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A government report outlines recurrence of neglect and abuse to patients living in mental institutions.", "title": "Gov't Report Reveals Horrifying Life Inside California Asylums", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/california-mental-institutions-physical-mental-and-emotional-abuse-published-329634", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/16/mental-institution-abuse.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/16/mental-institution-abuse.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-04-16T17:29:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T10:42:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A government report outlines recurrence of neglect and abuse to patients living in mental institutions."}, "article_summary": "A 900-page report recently exposed physical, sexual, mental, and emotional abuse cases from five mental health institutes in California.\nThe report notes the facility failed to protect clients from sexual abuse by not implementing abuse prevention, reporting, or supervision policies.\nDeinstitutionalizing patients is historically credited to end the ongoing omnipresent abuse and neglect in mental institutions.\nBeing subjected to abuse is one of the hidden areas of life for a person with a developmental disability, according to Mental Health Consultants.\nThe report indicates he threw the patient to the ground, stomped on his back, and chocked him until he lost consciousness."}
