Wednesday night, that same home was transformed into a memorial for the family.\n\nFriends and neighbors gathered in the Bever family front yard to pay their respects, remember and honor the five lost lives and the two that are forever changed.\n\nWednesday night, purple and white balloons floated above the Broken Arrow home.\n\nWhite was for the innocent lives lost - the Bever parents and their three children - and for the innocent lives forever changed - the 13-year-old and 2-year-old girl survivors. Purple was for domestic violence.\n\nCollette Langford said she was glad to see her community come together a week after the tragic attack.\n\n\"We've got five kids of our own, and four grandkids, and we just want to show support,\" she said.\n\nPolice said the oldest Bever brothers, 18-year-old Robert and 16-year-old Michael, stabbed six of their family members with a hatchet and knives - five of them lost their lives.\n\nSpecial Coverage: Bever Family Murders\n\nAccording to police and neighbors, the family kept to themselves. Few of their neighbors knew them and most of the people showing their support were perfect strangers, like Kristen White.\n\n\u201cEver since that day, you can't wake up without crying about it, thinking about it. You know, my 7-year-old daughter talks about it, thinks about it,\" she said.\n\nWhite also has a son the same age as the family's oldest girl who survived.\n\n\"As a mother, we're praying for her, love her. We hope that she gets through this,\" White said.\n\nOrganizer Glenna Parkman is taking donations for her, and her younger sister.\n\n\"Cards, and flowers, and animals and that she's going to be really, really happy,\" said Parkman.\n\nThe oldest Bever brothers are in the Tulsa County Jail being held without bond.\n\nPolice said they were planning a larger attack and had ammunition shipped to their house after the murders.\n\nOfficers said they plan to release the 911 call sometime next week.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A Broken Arrow neighborhood is planning a vigil to remember five members of a family murdered last week.", "author": "Allison Harris", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/29664215/community-remembers-murdered-ba-family-collects-goods-for-surviving-children", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8436617_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Broken Arrow neighborhood is planning a vigil to remember five members of a family murdered last week.", "title": "Community Remembers Murdered BA Family, Collects Goods For Surviving Children"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8436617_G.jpg", "description": "A Broken Arrow neighborhood is planning a vigil to remember five members of a family murdered last week.", "card": "summary", "title": "Community Remembers Murdered BA Family, Collects Goods For Surviving Children"}, "wnreadableurl": "community-remembers-murdered-ba-family-collects-goods-for-surviving-children", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2015/07/29", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS23", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd1a6\"", "article_summary": "The oldest Bever brothers are in the Tulsa County Jail being held without bond.\nSpecial Coverage: Bever Family MurdersAccording to police and neighbors, the family kept to themselves.\nNeighbors met Wednesday night at the Bever family home to honor the victims and the two surviving girls.\nFriends and neighbors gathered in the Bever family front yard to pay their respects, remember and honor the five lost lives and the two that are forever changed.\nWhite was for the innocent lives lost - the Bever parents and their three children - and for the innocent lives forever changed - the 13-year-old and 2-year-old girl survivors."}
