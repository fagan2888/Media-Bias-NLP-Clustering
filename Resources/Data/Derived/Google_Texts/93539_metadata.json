House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte is ready to release a series of principles today outlining concerns and priorities for a bill that would allow online retailers to collect sales tax. The principles \u2014 described during three briefings Tuesday \u2014 are expected to be broad while detailing some of the ways the Virginia Republican would like to simplify the bill that passed the Senate in May, the sources said. They also are expected to offer more details on how businesses could collect and remit sales taxes for online purchases. Goodlatte has expressed concerns that the Senate bill is still too burdensome for small businesses. Briefings for Judiciary Committee staffers and trade groups focused on the issue were scheduled for Tuesday to give Goodlatte\u2019s team a chance to detail seven points. Separate briefings were held for supporters and opponents of the issue. My story: http://politi.co/18awLNz\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the seven principles:\n\n-- Tax relief: No new precedents for taxing Internet sales. Do not want to require any more tax burden than is already due.\n\n-- Tech neutrality \u2014 Want a level playing field for all businesses so online, brick-and-mortar and brick-and-click businesses are all equal.\n\n-- No regulation without representation \u2014 Taxpayers should be able to protest bad enforcement.\n\n-- Simplicity \u2014 The system should be simple enough to not need a small business exemption\n\n-- Allow tax competition\u2013 States should be able to compete to keep their rates low\n\n-- Sovereignty \u2014 State activity remains sovereign and it must be the states imposing the taxes, not the federal government.\n\n-- Privacy \u2014 There is a need to protect consumers\u2019 data.\n\n** A message from CIT: Growmerica\u2122 [groh-mer-i-kuh] Definition: Growth opportunities created when CIT finances America\u2019s small and middle market businesses.

Visit cit.com. **\n\nThe view from the influence world:\n\nFrom the Marketplace Fairness Coalition, \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Chairman Goodlatte is committed, as are many in Congress, to finally addressing this critical issue and leveling the playing field for all American businesses. The release of these principles will be a great first step in the House of Representatives towards closing the online loophole and restoring basic free market competition.\u201d\n\nFrom NetChoice, \"Chairman Goodlatte\u2019s principles are a litmus test for any plan that would impose new tax burdens on catalog and online businesses; and the Marketplace Fairness Act clearly fails that test. MFA would let 46 states demand taxes and audits of every business in America, while forcing businesses to follow different rules, definitions, and filing requirements for every state where they have even a single customer.\u201d\n\nFrom the TruST Coalition, \u201cThe principles also make it crystal clear that the Senate-backed Marketplace Fairness Act is not a viable solution. We're hopeful that future iterations of this proposal delve more deeply into simplification measures for businesses increasingly concerned about complying with dozens of different state taxing and auditing jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nConservatives tap Reagan alum to whip support. Arthur Laffer \u2014 a former member of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Economic Policy Advisory Board \u2014 will hold a briefing for staffers and members today at 2 p.m. in the Capitol. Rep. Steve Womack, who introduced the House version of the Marketplace Fairness Act, and Colin Hanna, of Let Freedom Ring, will also make remarks. Laffer will discuss the study he authored earlier this summer that found potential for sustainable economic growth if Congress gives states the ability to collect the sales taxes from out-of-state online sellers.\n\nHAPPY WEDNESDAY!

From the trade association, \u201cWith all key indicators pointing to sluggish U.S. economic growth, today, at a 9:00 am briefing, Business Roundtable CEOs will share their expectations for sales, capital spending and hiring for the next six months. Expect to hear how business leaders are responding to continued fiscal uncertainty and political gridlock in Washington.\u201d\n\nDRIVING THE DAY. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget will host a discussion with Jared Bernstein, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, Maya MacGuineas, Jim Kessler and Derrick Morgan on the upcoming budget negotiations. Event begins at 8:30 a.m. in SVC 208/209.\n\nNOMINATED. President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate Tamara Ashford as a judge to the U.S. Tax Court yesterday. \u201cTamara has demonstrated unwavering integrity and a firm commitment to public service throughout her career,\u201d said Obama in a statement. Ashford is a deputy assistant attorney general for the appellate and review in the Department of Justice\u2019s tax division and previous worked for Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nDROP IN IRS AGENTS MEANS FEWER TAX CHEATS CAUGHT. There isn\u2019t a lot of risk today of being a tax cheat, an IRS watchdog has found. A report published by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration finds enforcement revenue collected by IRS agents declined by nine percent in FY2012, from $55.2 billion to $50.2 billion. TIGTA notes that the drop \u201ccorrelates to the 14 percent reduction in the number of enforcement personnel.\u201d Since FY2010, the tax-collecting agency has cut 8,000 full time positions, 5,000 specifically from enforcement. TIGTA said those staffing levels are part of the problem. Reuter\u2019s Patrick Temple-West has more: http://reut.rs/185HryJ\n\nQUICK POLL LOOK. The International Franchise Association found in a poll released late yesterday that 90 percent of franchisors want Congress to pass comprehensive reform that simplifies the tax code and lowers both individual and corporate tax rates. http://bit.ly/1f3t29s\n\nWHAT PROS ARE READING: Our Kelsey Snell has the inside look at Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah)\u2019s new tax proposal. \u201cHis plan would eliminate nearly every existing tax break in order to cut individual tax rates to as little as 15 percent and more than double the credits available for parents of minor children,\u201d she writes. http://politico.pro/16d7Hmb\n\nICYMI: A PREVIEW OF THE FISCAL FIGHT STORIES YOU SHOULDN\u2019T MISS:\n\n-- From Seung Min Kim, \u201cA slew of House Democrats \u2014 including all five members of its leadership \u2014 warn of the dangers of defaulting on the nation\u2019s debt and urge Obama to stand firm on his pledge to not negotiate on raising the debt limit.\u201d http://politi.co/1gu6nkw\n\n-- From Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan, \u201cHouse Republican leadership will attempt to pass a government-funding bill with language that defunds Obamacare, according to senior aides\u2026. The new strategy doesn\u2019t come without risks. First, Senate Democrats will move to strip the Obamacare language \u2014 and potentially change other items in the bill like the expiration date for funding, and the overall price tag.\u201d http://politi.co/18uZ5If\n\n-- Also from Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan, \u201cThe House Republican leadership\u2019s decision to try to defund Obamacare this week in their government funding bill, and their promise to wage a a no-holds-barred fight to delay the health care law as part of the debt ceiling fight, is a double-barreled strategy that could set Boehner (R-Ohio), Cantor (R-Va.), Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and the House Republican Conference up for two big defeats.\u201d http://politi.co/14gDJkx\n\nQUICK LINKS:\n\n-- American Petroleum Institute\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Jack Gerard said there is no way Congress passes comprehensive tax reform this year. http://bloom.bg/1aQTgwB\n\nDID YOU KNOW?
