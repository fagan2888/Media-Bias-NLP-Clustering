A young suicide bomber who looked younger than 10 years old blew herself up at a busy market in Potiskum, a northeastern town in Nigeria.

She managed to kill four others and wound 46 or so, a witness said, The Associated Press reported.

The girl exited a tricycle taxi in front of the market and set off her explosives, a survivor said. The attack appears the work of Boko Haram.
