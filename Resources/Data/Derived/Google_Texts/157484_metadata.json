President Obama is scrambling in a prime-time address tonight to show that his level of alarm about marauding Islamists in the Middle East matches that of his fellow Americans. How alarmed are Americans? The new WSJ/NBC News poll tells us the story: Only 26 percent of respondents felt the country is safer than before 9/11, awareness of the beheaded Americans is higher than any news story in five years and the president\u2019s job approval rating remained at 40 percent, the lowest of any president ahead of midterms in the past 20 years. Obama adopted a tougher tone last week, but Obama\u2019s golf outing on August 20 immediately after declaring himself \u201cheartbroken\u201d over the beheading of American James Foley can now go down in the books as one of the worst political botches of recent memory. And describing the beheading savages as a potentially \u201cmanageable\u201d problem and infamously saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a strategy yet\u201d sure didn\u2019t help.\n\n[Watch Fox: Live coverage of President Obama\u2019s address on escalating U.S. military involvement at 9 p.m. ET. Plus, full analysis and context from the best team in the business.]\n\nWhat does he want? He\u2019s not sure, but he wants it now! - The administration has worked hard to telegraph the message the president will lay out tonight. Obama is ready to start dumping arms on the remaining Syrian rebels still classified as moderate Islamists so that the Air Force can start dumping bombs on their former comrades in arms, the immoderate Islamists of ISIS. The president doesn\u2019t want Congress to authorize the airstrikes, since he claims he doesn\u2019t need the authority and their authorization would in some way reestablish Congressional primacy on making war. What the president wants is Congress to share the political culpability for the mission, which, given the sketchy state of the rebels Obama is now ready to directly arm after years of delay, is a very risky one. The vehicle for obtaining congressional \u201cbuy in\u201d is, appropriately, money. The president is expected to seek a $5 billion appropriation to fund the war, which gets Congress on the hook but doesn\u2019t insinuate that Congress has any authority to make or not make war. What\u2019s the money for? They\u2019ll figure it out later.\n\n[Poll Watch: The latest batch of Fox News Polls on President Obama\u2019s job ratings, including his handling of ISIS, the likelihood of ISIS attack on US soil, the president\u2019s leadership and how secure the U.S. is in a post 9/11 world will be released in the 6 p.m. ET hour during \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d ]\n\n-- 55 days until Nov. 4 --\n\nPOWER PLAY: KANSAS RACE FAR FROM FLAT\n\nWith Democrat Chad Taylor suing to remove his name from the Kansas Senate ballot and polls showing Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., and independent Greg Orman in a dead-heat, the reliable red state could be showing some blue hues. In a climate that appears highly favorable to Republicans and the state\u2019s history of not having a Democratic Senator since 1932, why is the race so close? Watch \u201cPower Play with Chris Stirewalt\u201d to find out.\n\nCHAMBER BETS THE FARM ON ERNST\n\nIowa\u2019s Republican Agriculture Secretary Bill Northey is featured in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s latest effort to boost Iowa Republican Senate hopeful Joni Ernst. Northey appears in the ad stressing his deep Iowa roots that span four generations saying, \u201cIowa\u2019s farm families will have a voice in Washington with Joni Ernst.\u201d The Chamber has committed over seven-figures in its campaign for Ernst.\n\nMcCain rips pro-Braley group over mailer - Roll Call: \u201cSen.

Peters concludes the ad stating, \u201cWhen it comes time to cast a vote, the decision to put men and women in harm\u2019s way is one of the toughest one\u2019s you can make and I will always think of the people I served with, their sacrifices and their families.\u201d\n\nPICK SIX: SURVIVING THE JUNGLE\n\nRepublicans need six more Senate seats to take control of the upper chamber. Which blue seats are the most vulnerable in this year\u2019s midterms? Here are the top picks among Fox News First readers: Arkansas (13.7%), Montana (12.9%), West Virginia (12%), Louisiana (11.5%), South Dakota (10%) and North Carolina (9.6%). Dave Foster, a Fox News First reader from Colorado, believes social issues will sink Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., as he battles Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo. Foster thinks that the GOP will fare better in Alaska and Louisiana, though.\n\nShare your top six picks.

Al Franken, D-Minn, is in serious trouble.]\n\nOBAMACARE A DRAG WITH LIKELY VOTERS\n\nDaily Caller: \u201cTwo months before midterm elections, Obamacare has the disapproval of a majority of registered voters \u2014 just above its all-time low level of support, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s latest tracking poll.\u201d\n\n[A new analysis by the conservative group American Action Forum finds take-home pay at small businesses was caught to the tune of some $22.6 billion due to ObamaCare, translating to a loss of nearly $935 for workers at companies with 50 to 99 employees.]\n\nSHUTDOWN NOT PART OF GOP\u2019S MIDTERM STRATEGY\n\nWashington Examiner: \u201cThe House will vote Thursday on a bill to fund the government through Dec. 11, holding spending levels at about the current level, Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky, announced late Tuesday. The bill caps annual spending at the 2014 $1.012 trillion level and it includes a provision to extend the Export-Import Bank until June 30\u2026 With the election just a few weeks away, both parties in the House and Senate are eager to pass the continuing resolution without typical partisan fighting so they can quickly adjourn and go home to campaign.\u201d\n\nBuuuut\u2026 - Sen.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, suggested Tuesday tying legislation to the continuing resolution to stop President Obama\u2019s executive order deferring deportations of young illegal immigrants, known as DACA. Cruz told reporters, \u201cI think we should use any and all means necessary to prevent the president from illegally granting amnesty.\u201d\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nNow that the midterm campaign is in full-swing, candidates are pulling out all the stops to press the flesh and win over crowds. Nothing fires up a crowd more than the right soundtrack. Music and campaigns have a rich history in American politics. The Founding Fathers used \u201cGod Save Great Washington,\u201d to not only mock \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d but rally the fledgling nation around George Washington. It was John Adams who first used lyrical mud-slinging to bash Andrew Jackson warning that slavery, pestilence, and even the Devil would come should Adams not be elected. As the diddy went: \u201cFire\u2019s a-comin\u2019, swords a-comin\u2019 / pistols, guns and knives are comin\u2019 /\u2026 if John Quincy not be comin\u2019.\u201d President Dwight Eisenhower popularized jingles with his famous \u201cI Like Ike\u201d campaign. In the modern age, politicians have favored everything from Motown to hip-hop but some have favored the bizarre, like when independent presidential candidate Ross Perot felt Patsy Cline\u2019s ballad about a hopeless romantic, \u201cCrazy,\u201d was a suitable campaign song.\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Deval Patrick, D-Mass., an Obama ally occasionally mentioned as a potential 2016 contender warned of the appearance of \u201centitlement\u201d for Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, who has struggled mightily to explain her family\u2019s massive post-presidency cash haul. Patrick told the Palm Beach Post that Clinton is \u201cfantastic and incredibly strong,\u201d but \u201cthe problem with inevitability is it\u2019s sometimes interpreted as entitlement and I think that voters want competition and they want their candidates to have to work for it.\u201d She\u2019s going to be working harder, it would seem. The new WSJ/NBC News Poll says Clinton\u2019s long campaign isn\u2019t wearing well with voters: \u201c\u202643% of registered voters view Ms. Clinton positively, compared with the 41% who harbor negative views. That\u2019s a steep drop from February 2009 when 59% viewed the newly confirmed secretary of state positively and just 22% held negative views.\u201d\n\nNO HARD FEELINGS: ROMNEY HELPS CHRISTIE RAISE DOUGH\n\nNew Jersey Star-Ledger: \u201cGov.

Channel 2 Action News reports Secretary of State Brian Kemp wrote to county election officials, telling them, \u201cPreliminary investigation has revealed significant illegal activities\u2019 including forged voter registration applications, forged signatures on releases, and applications with false or inaccurate information.\u201d\n\n\n\n[The Hill: \u201cThe Democratic National Committee is launching a new campaign to get supporters to pledge to vote in the midterm elections, an effort to mitigate the party\u2019s expected drop-off in turnout this fall\u2026the committee is blasting out an email from Vice President [Joe Biden] \u2026\u201d]\n\nObama-itis - The latest ad from Georgia Republican Senate candidate David Purdue attacks Democrat Michelle Nunn\u2019s liberal record. From the ad: \u201cIn her campaign plan Michelle Nunn admits she is too liberal and her foundation gave money linked to terrorists.\u201d The National Republican Senatorial Committee has also launched an ad featuring Nunn saying \u201cI defer to the president\u2019s judgment\u201d tying her to support of President Obama\u2019s support of amnesty for illegal immigrants.\n\nUGLY EARLY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AS SHAHEEN OPENS ON ATTACK\n\nIn a sign that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., sees trouble ahead for her re-election bid, she greeted Republican Scott Brown into the general election with an attack ad even before Brown had officially iced his party\u2019s nomination. Before polls closed Tuesday, Shaheen began running one television ad criticizing Brown and another featuring New Hampshire residents and communities she's helped. Brown is also wasting little time in drawing contrasts between himself and Shaheen, launching a spot seeking to paint Shaheen, as a rubber stamp for President Obama\u2019s agenda. The former Massachusetts Senator appears at an iconic local diner in the ad saying, \u201cI'll be an independent Senator that votes for New Hampshire first.\u201d\n\n[And Willey was a technicality! - Fox News: \u201cIf he's successful, Brown would become only the third U.S. senator to serve multiple states. Waitman Willey served [the Reformed Government of] Virginia and then West Virginia when it became a state during the Civil War and James Shields represented Illinois and Minnesota before being elected from Missouri in 1879.\u201d]\n\nPotential for GOP House Pickups - Republicans are setting their sights on two possible House pickups in New Hampshire. Rising Republican star Marilinda Garcia, who has potential 2016 candidates like Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, lining up to come to her aid, is looking to be a formidable opponent for Rep. Ann Kuster, D-N.H. Republicans are equally optimistic that former Rep. Frank Guinta, R-N.H., will be successful in his third attempt to knock off Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, D-N.H.. The N.H. Journal has more.\n\n[It pays to have an early primary - Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., visits Manchester, N.H., Friday to take part in a unity tally with Republican Scott Brown and Sen.

John Tierney, D-Mass., who is still reeling from his wife\u2019s conviction over shady business dealings. The scandal nearly cost Tierney his seat to Republican Richard Tisei in 2012. Moulton\u2019s positioning himself as an outsider, blaming Washington\u2019s dysfunction on Republicans and Democrats is likely to give him a boost as he takes on Tisei in November. More.\n\nBeacon Hill brawl ahead - Failed 2010 Democratic Senate Candidate Martha Coakley scored an unconvincing win to secure her party\u2019s nod for Massachusetts\u2019s gubernatorial contest. The Massachusetts Attorney General will face a bitter contest against Republican Charlie Baker, with recent polls showing the two are statistically tied.\n\nCUOMO COBBLES IT TOGETHER\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., and his running mate Kathy Hochul scored a decisive victory, with both receiving over 60 percent support. WSJ has the full breakdown of the race.\n\nRHODE ISLAND DEMS OPT FOR REFORMER IN FIGHT WITH FUNG\n\nRhode Island Treasurer Gina Raimondo, who successfully pushed a dramatic overhaul of Rhode Island\u2019s pension system, scored her party\u2019s nomination for governor.

Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., over his support of President Obama\u2019s energy, including a carbon tax which would be disastrous for the coal-rich state. From the ad: \u201cIf Congressman Nick Rahall won't vote for West Virginia, why should we vote for him?\u201d\n\nBUT YOU SHOULD SEE THE VIEW!\n\nNYT: \u201cWhat will $1 million buy in New York City? \u2026 A new development, 42 Crosby Street, is pushing the limits of New York City real estate to new heights with 10 underground parking spots that will cost more per square foot than the apartments being sold upstairs. The million-dollar parking spots will be offered on a first-come-first-served basis to buyers at the 10-unit luxury apartment building being developed by Atlas Capital Group at Broome and Crosby Streets, itself the former site of a parking lot. At $250,000 a tire, the parking spaces in the underground garage cost more than four times the national median sales price for a home, which is $217,800, according to Zillow.\u201d\n\nAND NOW, A WORLD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cAmerican public opinion, as you can see in the polls, radically changed from being against airstrikes to being heavily in favor that [President Obama] decided to do airstrikes.
