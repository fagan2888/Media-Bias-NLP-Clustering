At least 129 people were killed and 352 were wounded.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush, when asked on Nov. 15, 2015 by Chuck Todd on Meet the Press whether the US should send troops to fight ISIS, responded:\n\n\n\n\"Absolutely. And it ought to be designed by our military without their hands tied. We ought to know exactly what it'll take. And we can't do it alone. I think that's an important lesson from history. But we need to lead. But for the United States, who is going to take the leadership role? I think having a no-fly zone will be an important part of this. And there are many other things that we need to do in concert with our allies.\"\n\n\n\nSource: Meet the Press, \"Meet the Press - November 15, 2015,\" www.nbcnews.com, Nov. 15, 2015\n\n\n\nBen Carson, when asked about sending ground troops on Aug. 16, 2015, responded:\n\n\n\n\"Ground troops may well be necessary\u2026 I don't pretend to know the number [of ground troops] without a lot of information.

I personally had advocated that we do more to help the rebels against [Syrian President] Assad because I worried that terrorists would take and occupy territory, and that has come to pass, not only with ISIS but other Al-Qaeda affiliates and terrorist networks.

I'm the former chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, and in that capacity I learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war, and I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country.
