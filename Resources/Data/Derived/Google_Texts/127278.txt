Denver International Airport has begun construction on five new gates at the west end of Concourse C to accommodate the growing presence of Southwest Airlines.

The airline is primarily located on the C concourse but has some overflow flights on the A concourse. Those gates will be relocated to C when the $46 million, 39,000-square-foot extension is finished by November 2014.

The three-contractor project will be paid from DIAâ€™s Airport Capital Improvement Project funds, which are generated by airport revenues.

Two contracts are being awarded among existing on-call contractors and one through a competitive bid process. Milender White was selected for building the foundations, windows, walls and roof work, and IHC won the competitive bid for apron concrete paving, which is where the aircraft taxi and park.

The third contract for building interior and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems will be awarded among existing on-call contractors later this month.
