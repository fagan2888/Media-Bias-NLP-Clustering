Ralph Hise, co-chair of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services, has called expansion \u201cimpossible\u201d at this point.\n\nBut Sen. Josh Stein says it would be \u201cincomprehensible\u201d for the Republican-controlled legislature to turn its back on Medicaid expansion dollars again.\n\n\u201cSix billion dollars and 30,000 jobs we would have had if we had taken it two years ago,\u201d explained Stein. \u201cWell, we didn\u2019t. We are where we are today. They made the bad decision, but they can rectify that tomorrow.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Brad Wilson, President and CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield, also made the case for expansion at 13th Annual Economic Forecast Forum. Wilson told the audience the state has lost $1.1 billion by not expanding Medicaid.\n\nSen. Stein appears this weekend on NC Policy Watch\u2019s News & Views to discuss the chances for expansion in a tight budget year, as we preview the upcoming \u201clong\u201d legislative session.
