The new law, which was signed by Idaho Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter last month, makes it illegal for any videotaping or photography to go on at an agriculture operation without the owner\u2019s consent, with penalties of up to a year in prison and a $5,000 fine.\n\nAs the plaintiffs point out in a press release, Idaho\u2019s maximum sentence for first-offense animal cruelty is six months, meaning that the state now punishes those who document cases of animal cruelty more severely than those who commit it.\n\nOpponents of ag gag laws, which were introduced in 11 states last year and four this year, have long held that the laws are designed to protect the agriculture industry from the bad press of animal abuse expos\u00e9s. The laws do so at the expense of animal welfare and of transparency in the food system, allowing huge Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) \u2014 the operations often targeted for undercover investigations because of their records of animal abuse and public health problems \u2014 to operate out of the public eye.\n\n\u201cThe Idaho law is deeply distressing because it is aimed entirely at protecting an industry, especially in its worst practices that endanger people, at the expense of freedom of speech. It even would criminalize a whistle-blower who took a picture or video of wrongdoing in the workplace,\u201d Erwin Chemerinsky, constitutional law expert and dean at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, said in a statement. \u201cI am confident that this law will be struck down under Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court precedents.\u201d\n\nIdaho\u2019s law, which was introduced on February 11 and signed into law just three weeks later, is the first ag gag law passed in a state since 2012. The legislation was prompted by undercover footage of brutal abuse of cows on an Idaho farm that was shown on ABC\u2019s \u201cNightline.\u201d The video included scenes of farm workers beating and shocking the cows, and resulted in charges being brought against three of the farm\u2019s employees after the video was turned over to law enforcement. The Idaho bill was strongly supported by the Idaho Dairymen\u2019s Association, whose president said the group was \u201cextremely pleased\u201d that the bill passed.\n\nIdaho Senator Jim Patrick, who sponsored the ag gag bill, said he did so because individuals that videotape abuse on farms \u201cintend to destroy the business.\u201d \u201cWe want to make sure our food security is not at risk,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the well-being of animals that are raised for meat, and the transparency of the food system that in 2011 produced more than 92.3 billion pounds of meat and poultry, is what\u2019s actually at risk from laws like Idaho\u2019s. In the six other states that have ag gag laws on the books, activists and journalists have said they\u2019ve stopped attempting to document abuse on farm operations for fear of prosecution.\n\nThis chilling effect means that the public in these states has little chance of seeing footage that can expose cruel and dangerous practices on agricultural operations and lead to major change in the agriculture industry. In 2008, for instance, an undercover video exposed \u201cdowner\u201d cows, which can\u2019t stand on their own and are sometimes diseased, being used for beef. The video led to the largest meat recall in U.S. history and prompted the U.S. to ban the use of downer cows for meat.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The law allows Idaho to punish those who document cases of animal cruelty more severely than those who commit it.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The law allows Idaho to punish those who document cases of animal cruelty more severely than those who commit it.", "title": "More Than A Dozen Groups Sue Idaho Over Its New \u2018Ag Gag\u2019 Law, Saying It Violates Free Speech", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/19/3416028/idaho-ag-gag-lawsuit/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_119438338.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The law allows Idaho to punish those who document cases of animal cruelty more severely than those who commit it.", "title": "More Than A Dozen Groups Sue Idaho Over Its New \u2018Ag Gag\u2019 Law, Saying It Violates Free Speech", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_119438338-320x213.jpg", "creator": "@KatieRValentine", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_119438338.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_119438338.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-19T10:18:46+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/katiervalentine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf16b\"", "article_summary": "Health More Than A Dozen Groups Sue Idaho Over Its New \u2018Ag Gag\u2019 Law, Saying It Violates Free Speech CREDIT: ShutterstockA diverse group of organizations and citizens filed a lawsuit this week that aims to strike down Idaho\u2019s new \u201cag gag\u201d law, which makes it illegal for anyone to videotape or take photos of animal abuse at agricultural operations.\n\u201cThe Idaho law is deeply distressing because it is aimed entirely at protecting an industry, especially in its worst practices that endanger people, at the expense of freedom of speech.\nIn 2008, for instance, an undercover video exposed \u201cdowner\u201d cows, which can\u2019t stand on their own and are sometimes diseased, being used for beef.\n\u201cI am confident that this law will be struck down under Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court precedents.\u201dIdaho\u2019s law, which was introduced on February 11 and signed into law just three weeks later, is the first ag gag law passed in a state since 2012.\nIn the six other states that have ag gag laws on the books, activists and journalists have said they\u2019ve stopped attempting to document abuse on farm operations for fear of prosecution."}
