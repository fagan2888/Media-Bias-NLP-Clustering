In other words, every so often, and usually by accident, they tell the truth.\u201d\n\nPassing the torch?\n\nHoping to reoccupy the White House for another eight-year stint come 2017 \u2014 this time as president, rather than first lady \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also made her position clear when it comes to shaping America\u2019s mindset on social and moral issues. She let her LGBT activist roots show when she insisted last month that the government must force the religious convictions of Christians to support abortion.\n\n\u201c\u2018Far too many women are still denied critical access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth,\u201d Clinton argued, according to LifeNews. \u201cAll the laws we\u2019ve passed don\u2019t count for much if they\u2019re not enforced.\u201d\n\nRoe v. Wadeis not enough for the progressive presidential hopeful, who wants Christian tax dollars to pay for abortions and calls for biblical doctrine to be rewritten when it comes to killing preborn children. In other words, under a second Clinton administration, Christian values will not be tolerated.\n\n\u201cRights have to exist in practice \u2014 not just on paper,\u201d Clinton proclaimed. \u201cLaws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.\u201d\n\nOutlawing the Bible?\n\nLeftist media outlets reflect Clinton\u2019s rejection of biblical morality and her endorsement of the LGBT agenda.\n\n\u201cGold told me that church leaders must be made \u2018to take homosexuality off the sin list,\u2019\u201dNew York TimesColumnist and homosexual practitioner Frank Bruni expressed in his column last month titled \u201cBigotry: The Bible and the Lessons of Indiana.\u201d \u201cHis commandment is worthy \u2014 and warranted.\u201d\n\nBarber attests that the new progressive mindset endorsing sexual libertinism essentially ushers in the \u201canything goes\u201d attitude toward sexuality \u2026 a destructive path about which the Bible warns.\n\n\u201cOf course, if homosexual behavior, something denounced as both \u2018vile affections\u2019 and \u2018an abomination\u2019 throughout both the Old and New Testaments, is no longer sexual sin, then there can be no sexual sin whatsoever,\u201d Barber explained. \u201cTo coerce, through the power of the police state, faithful Christians to abandon the millennia-old biblical sexual ethic and embrace the sin of Sodom would likewise require that Christians sign-off on fornication, adultery, incest and bestiality. Such is the unnatural nature of government-mandated moral relativism.\u201d\n\nAnd the Leftist media are attempting to synonymize Scripture with hate speech, which they argue is unconstitutional and not protected under the freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cHate speech is excluded from protection,\u201d CNN anchor Chris Cuomo tweeted.\n\nBut even if biblical teachings were ultimately classified as \u201chate speech,\u201d the radical Left doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on in their argument to ban Christian expression under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201cBut there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment,\u201d concluded UCLA Law Professor Eugene Volohk, while responding to the issue in a Washington Post op-ed. \u201cHateful ideas (whatever exactly that might mean) are just as protected under the First Amendment as other ideas.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "During President Barack Obama\u2019s recent visit to Georgetown University, his message to students was quite simple  \u2014 that progressives like himself must mold how America thinks and make the media report things the way they want.", "og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/politics-govt/2015/05/19/obama-we-must-change-how-america-thinks", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5452168/ap823668116109.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "During President Barack Obama\u2019s recent visit to Georgetown University, his message to students was quite simple &#160;\u2014 that progressives like himself must mold how America thinks and make the media report things the way they want.", "title": "Obama: We must change how America thinks"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5452168/ap823668116109.jpg", "title": "Obama: We must change how America thinks", "description": "During President Barack Obama\u2019s recent visit to Georgetown University, his message to students was quite simple &#160;\u2014 that progressives like himself must mold how America thinks and make the media report things the way they want.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@onenewsnowcom"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "keywords": "abortion,America,Barack Obama,Belief,certain communist leader,Chris Cuomo,CNN,communism,Congress,conservative columnist,conservative media,conservative new media,Democratic presidential candidate,Eugene Volohk,Federal Communications Commission,first lady,Frank Bruni,freedom of seech,freespeech,Georgetown campus,Georgetown University,Gold,Hillary Clinton,homosexuality,Indiana,LGBT,Matt Barber,media outlets,media reports,Michael F.
