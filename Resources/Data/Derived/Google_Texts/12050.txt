Political newcomers Andrè Comeaux and Jean-Paul Coussan, both Lafayette Republicans, have advanced to the Nov. 21 runoff for the Louisiana House District 45 seat.

Jan Swift, also a Republican, ran third.

"I'm very proud of the work my team put in," Comeaux said. "I look forward to more hard work to finish the race."

Comeaux said he would ask Swift for her support.

"There were three good candidates; it's no surprise to anyone that there is a runoff." he said.

Coussan said he was excited by the results and "proud that all three candidates ran a clean campaign."

"I look forward to a competitive runoff," he said.

Coussan said his campaign would review the results and plan for the runoff after that.

Swift said she was disappointed there was not a higher turnout.

"We did not get the turnout statewide or in Lafayette Parish that showed people were totally engaged," she said.

In House District 39, newcomer Julie Emerson, a Republican from Carencro, defeated incumbent Rep. Stephen Ortego, D-Carencro.

Complete but unofficial results show Emerson with 6,149 votes to Ortego’s 5,902.

Ortego was competing for a second term in a district that includes parts of Lafayette and St. Landry parishes.

"We ran a clean campaign I can be proud of," said Ortego, who said his opponent was helped by "out-of-state money" in the campaign's waning weeks.

"Maybe this wasn't in the plan," Ortego said. "Perhaps I can serve our community in other ways."

Emerson did not return phone calls asking for comment.

In House districts 31, 44 and 96, incumbents took huge early leads against nominal opposition and were never threatened.

In House District 31, incumbent Nancy Landry headed for a runaway win over Evan H. Wright.

"It's been an honor and privilege to serve the people of District 31 for the past seven years," she said as victory appeared likely, adding that she would fight for the benefit of "families and businesses" in the next term. "I'm grateful to the voters."

State Rep. Vincent Pierre, D-Lafayette, said of his apparent victory in District 44, "There is a lot of unfinished business to do." He said he would focus on Medicaid expansion in Louisiana and revamping the incarceration system. "There are too many people going to prison for minor crimes," he said.

State Rep. Terry C. Landry Sr. said his victory in District 96 was a "victory for the people," including campaign workers and those who appreciated what he accomplished in his first term. "I've tried to be a good steward and represent people in a diverse district," he said.
