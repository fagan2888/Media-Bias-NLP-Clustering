This was perfectly understandable and justified. The GOP primary was the only game in town in that incumbent presidential year, and candidates\u2019 efforts to frame themselves as in agreement with the majority of their party\u2019s most energized primary voters almost always alienates centrist general electorate voters.\n\nFor the press, it will be tempting to reprise their 2012 shortsightedness by devoting near exclusive focus to the lively Republican primary. It would be a justifiable impulse. On the Democratic side of the aisle, the 2016 presidential primary was a foregone conclusion the minute Barack Obama accepted his party\u2019s nomination in 2008. What\u2019s to cover?\n\nBut the Democratic contest should provide the media with ample opportunity to highlight a fascinating and rapidly evolving political dynamic. The primary race is unlikely to be particularly competitive, but the Democratic electorate is deserving of scrutiny if only because those voters are challenging so many prevalent assumptions shared by many in the reporting community.\n\nFor example, the notion that the GOP primary electorate is composed of unrepresentative extremists is undone by this cycle\u2019s polling. A recent NBC/Wall Street journal survey is not the first to discover that the Republican electorate is now far more concerned with national security and terrorism than they are about the economy. A full 27 percent described national security as their top priority for the federal government. \u201cThat\u2019s followed by the deficit and government spending (24 percent), job creation and economic growth (21 percent) and religious and moral values (12 percent),\u201d NBC News reported.\n\nAccording to a January Pew Research Center survey, the GOP\u2019s top priorities track reasonably well with the public\u2019s top priorities.\n\nBy contrast, NBC/WSJ became the latest poll to find Democratic voters are primarily concerned with domestic issues starting with the economy and job growth/creation, but also including health care (namely, preserving the Affordable Care Act), and climate change. Only 13 percent of Democratic voters believe terrorism and national security should be the federal government\u2019s top priority.\n\nSimilarly, the Democratic primary electorate has upended conventional wisdom by demonstrating that they aren\u2019t nearly as concerned about Hillary Clinton getting a proper primary challenger as are the members of the political press. While 43 percent of self-described Democrats want a challenger to Clinton\u2019s dominance to emerge, an increase of five points from March, the majority of Democrats are contented with the coronation process.\n\n\u201cDespite the wave of negative news, some 56% of Democratic primary voters say they remain unconcerned about the absence of a potent primary threat to Mrs. Clinton, according to the poll, down from 61% in March,\u201d WSJ reported. \u201cThe survey also suggests non-white Democrats have rallied around the former first lady, with some 68% saying they are not concerned about the lack of a viable alternative.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen, liberals and moderate Democrats are also slightly more eager to see another candidate give Mrs. Clinton a run for the party\u2019s presidential nomination,\u201d the report continued.\n\nThat sentiment is prevalent in the press where the fringe elements of the Democratic coalition are vastly overrepresented. But a boring primary process doesn\u2019t sell commercials, so you\u2019re unlikely to see many news outlets thoroughly dissecting the Democratic coalition. The conclusions would undermine a variety of cherished assumptions among peddlers of colorless purveyors of conventional wisdom.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "The most interesting race is the one that isn\u2019t happening.", "title": "The Democratic Party\u2019s \u2018extremist\u2019 voters", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/05/04/another-poll-shows-democratic-primary-voters-out-of-touch/", "image": {"width": 309, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1-15-2015-priorities_01.png", "height": 599}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-04T23:21:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-04T19:31:41+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016, democratic primary, Hillary Clinton,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad08\"", "article_summary": "Only 13 percent of Democratic voters believe terrorism and national security should be the federal government\u2019s top priority.\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s \u2018extremist\u2019 votersposted at 7:21 pm on May 4, 2015 by Noah RothmanIn 2012, the political press briefly succumbed to a myopic fascination with the Republican primary electorate.\nFor example, the notion that the GOP primary electorate is composed of unrepresentative extremists is undone by this cycle\u2019s polling.\nThe GOP primary was the only game in town in that incumbent presidential year, and candidates\u2019 efforts to frame themselves as in agreement with the majority of their party\u2019s most energized primary voters almost always alienates centrist general electorate voters.\n\u201cDespite the wave of negative news, some 56% of Democratic primary voters say they remain unconcerned about the absence of a potent primary threat to Mrs. Clinton, according to the poll, down from 61% in March,\u201d WSJ reported."}
