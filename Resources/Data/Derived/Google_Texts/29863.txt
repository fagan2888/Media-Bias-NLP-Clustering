Since signing on with Fox News, Stacey Dash’s comments on various matters haven’t exactly endeared her to certain segments of the viewing audience. In October of 2014, Dash said Louisiana minority voters under the Affordable Heath Care Act adopted a “plantation mentality.” In February of 2015, Dash apologized for what she called a “failed attempt at humor” when she referred to rape victims as “the ones who like to be naughty might go out and play and and get hurt.”

In what comes as a uncharacteristic move for the conservative pundit, Dash disagreed with Geraldo Rivera’s statement that “Hip Hop has done more damage to black and brown people than racism in the last 10 years.” While appearing on Fox’s The Five, Dash offered the following:

“I love Geraldo, but I disagree. Coming from a Hip Hop family—my cousin is Damon Dash, and he started Roc-A-Fella Records with Jay Z—I know that this is a way for men to legitimize their lives. It sells, and it makes money, and it’s capitalist.”

After her “plantation” comments, Dash told Net-A-Porter some of her family members disowned her for her political views. Dash’s response to Geraldo and Juan Williams can be viewed below.
