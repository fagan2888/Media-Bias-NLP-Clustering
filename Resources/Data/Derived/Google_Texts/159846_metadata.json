Dunkin\u2019 is also dropping combo meals.\n\nRelated: Knock, Knock! Dunkin\u2019 at Your Door\n\nOn Feb. 4, Dunkin\u2019 reported its domestic same-store sales fell 0.8 percent last quarter, the first drop since the company went public in 2011. The chain also said customer traffic declined in the period.\n\nOn a phone call with investors, CEO Nigel Travis cited \u201crevitalized burger players\u201d as one of the chain\u2019s key stumbling blocks. One of the leading players Travis was referring to is McDonald\u2019s, which recently began offering breakfast all day.\n\nThe Golden Arches has benefitted tremendously from this change, with the chain reporting sales growth of 5.7 percent in its most recent quarter at U.S. stores open at least 13 months. The quarterly results were McDonald\u2019s best in almost four years and blew past analysts\u2019 expectations of 2.7 percent growth.\n\nAccording to Bonnie Riggs, a restaurant industry analyst at NPD Group, the modified menu has the potential to turn things around for the embattled donut chain by reminding customers that it served egg sandwiches all day long before McDonald\u2019s decided to do so. It\u2019s also a way to emphasize the wide variety of beverages that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts offers.\n\nBreakfast remains a rapidly growing market at fast food chains, and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts will most likely benefit by advertising more of its vast offerings, Riggs says. Once all of the chatter around McDonald\u2019s all-day breakfast dies down, Riggs says, \u201cthe change may have less impact\u2026.\u201d\n\nRelated: 9 Ways McDonald\u2019s Wants to Get You Excited About Its Food Again\n\nBut even though the breakfast market is growing, thanks to a stronger economy and low unemployment, that doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee success for Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Riggs says. \u201cIs the market getting crowded? Yes. Will everyone win? No. If you have a competitive point of difference that can address customer needs, those will win.\u201d\n\nDunkin\u2019 Donuts might also have been inadvertently helped by the news last week that Starbucks was tweaking its rewards program. Instead of customers being awarded points based on how often they visit a store, they will earn rewards based on how much they spend. The news created a firestorm of criticism from people who purchase the cheaper items on the menu.\n\n\n\nRiggs says that by Starbucks heightening awareness of its rewards program, \u201cit will also make customers of other stores aware of what loyalty program their store offers.\u201d Dunkin\u2019 Donuts could benefit from the free advertising, and its own rewards program could get a bump of popularity.\n\nThe new menu from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts is just the latest salvo in the breakfast wars, where the ammo is caffeine, syrup and sausage. McDonald\u2019s might have won the last battle, but this war is far from over.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Dunkin\u2019 Donuts is stepping up its battle plans in the breakfast wars against McDonald\u2019", "title": "A New Chapter in the Breakfast Wars as Dunkin' Fights Back", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/29/New-Chapter-Breakfast-Wars-Dunkin-Fights-Back", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Dunkin%27_Donuts.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/29/New-Chapter-Breakfast-Wars-Dunkin-Fights-Back", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Dunkin%27_Donuts.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Dunkin\u2019 Donuts is stepping up its battle plans in the breakfast wars against McDonald\u2019", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The new menu from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts is just the latest salvo in the breakfast wars, where the ammo is caffeine, syrup and sausage.\nDunkin\u2019 Donuts is stepping up its battle plans in the breakfast wars against McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks.\nIt\u2019s also a way to emphasize the wide variety of beverages that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts offers.\nBreakfast remains a rapidly growing market at fast food chains, and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts will most likely benefit by advertising more of its vast offerings, Riggs says.\nDunkin\u2019 at Your DoorOn Feb. 4, Dunkin\u2019 reported its domestic same-store sales fell 0.8 percent last quarter, the first drop since the company went public in 2011."}
