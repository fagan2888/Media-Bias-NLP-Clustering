Monday, the Kansas Senate Health Committee will discuss a bill that would criminalize surrogate pregnancies in Kansas.

A Wichita family will be there, hoping to stop the bill from going any further.

It wasn't always a guarantee that Geoff and Hilary Louvar could have children together.

Hilary has three children from a previous marriage but she had hysterectomy several years ago, before she married Geoff.

"Well it's our only option as far as having a child of our own with our own genetic bloodlines,” Hilary and Geoff Louvar said.

The Louvars turned to surrogacy and three years ago, Griffen was born through a surrogate mother.

"It's a miracle. I mean I lived life but I don't think you really live until you have a kid and I just thank God and her for making it a possibility,” Geoff Louvar said.

Last Thursday, Kansas Senator Mary Pilcher-Cook introduced a bill that if passed, would make surrogacy a crime. Anyone who played any part in a surrogate pregnancy would face up to a $10,000 fine or jail time.

The senator told us by phone, she introduced the bill to start a conversation about surrogacy.

"I think it's an opportunity for the committee members to weigh all the circumstances, to decide if we should act or maybe we should not act but above all it helps us to learn about the technology, about surrogacy, the people involved and their feelings about it,” Senator Mary Pilcher-Cook (R) Shawnee, said.

The Louvars tell us they will be at that committee hearing Monday, to try to persuade senators to keep surrogacy a legal option for families.

"I know families that are looking at surrogacy that this is their only option to have a kid and I can't imagine not having or of somebody else taking that away from me,” Hilary Louvar said.

The Louvars tell us this bill is especially personal because they were hoping to add on more to their family through surrogacy this year.
