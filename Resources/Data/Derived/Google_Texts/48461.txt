The Illinois Department of Human Rights has just published its “Pregnancy and Your Rights in the Workplace” poster for employers to use in order to comply with recent amendments to the Illinois Human Rights Act. Effective Jan. 1, 2015, Illinois now requires employers of one or more employees to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnancy, childbirth, or medical or common conditions associated with pregnancy. The Illinois Human Rights Act amendments also included a requirement for employers to post a notice issued by the Illinois Department of Human Rights and include information in their employee handbooks about an employee’s right to request a reasonable accommodation for pregnancy or childbirth. The amended Act can be accessed here.

The IDHR has provided a summary of the posting requirements. The poster, available in English and Spanish, can be downloaded from the IDHR website. In addition, the IDHR also has posted a Fact Sheet regarding the changes in the law with respect to pregnancy accommodations and non-discrimination, which is available here.
