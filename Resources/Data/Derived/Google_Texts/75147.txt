A 26-year-old university graduate penned an open letter this week expressing her deep displeasure with President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, saying it has “raped” her future — and now the letter is going viral.

Ashley Dionne, a recent college graduate, posted the letter detailing her experience with Obamacare on conservative radio host Dennis Prager’s Facebook page Monday. She said she received her bachelor’s degree in 2009 and went back to school for a second degree, but hasn’t been able to get more than 32 hours of work a week.

The letter was reposted by Prager later that night and has since been shared more than 1,000 times on Facebook.

Dionne told college news website Campus Reform she wrote the letter to warn the public of the problems with the Affordable Care Act.

“I wanted to get my message about Obamacare out, because I’m being directly and negatively affected by it, but I know it’s not just me,” Dionne said. “Obamacare will make my life more difficult.”

She added, “It will hurt more people than it will help.”
