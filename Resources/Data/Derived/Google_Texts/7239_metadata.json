When Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump \u201cplayed footsie\u201d with Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke on a Sunday talk show last month, the GOP lawmaker says he had to act.\n\nThat night, Sen. Ben Sasse posted an open letter on his Facebook page to supporters of Mr. Trump, saying that he would not support him if he were the nominee, nor would he swing over to Hillary Clinton. He would instead seek out a third candidate \u2013 a conservative, a constitutionalist.\n\nSenator Sasse (pronounced \u201csass\u201d) blasted Trump for dividing Americans and acting like a monarch. \u201cHave you noticed how Mr. Trump uses the word \u201cReign\u201d \u2013 like he thinks he\u2019s running for King? It\u2019s creepy, actually.\u201d\n\nRecommended: How much do you know about bipartisanship? Take our quiz.\n\nThe letter was politically risky, given Trump\u2019s popularity and Sasse\u2019s status as a freshman senator \u2013 99th in seniority. Nebraska\u2019s senior senator, Republican Deb Fischer, disagrees with his third-candidate strategy. Meanwhile, the GOP leadership in both the House and Senate say they will support Trump if he's the nominee.\n\nBut the move was typical Sasse, an independent-minded senator who is willing to go against the grain in Washington.\n\nThe Nebraskan believes the nation\u2019s leaders ought to focus urgently on a few big things \u2013 national security, the debt, the economy \u2013 and warns of a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d of presidential overreach. He ranks as the fourth most conservative member of the Senate, according to one voting scorecard.\n\nBut he pans the partisan screaming, the straw-man arguments, the \u201cfake budgets\u201d and non-urgent side issues. It\u2019s time for a more constructive politics, he argues.\n\nThis fascinates Sen. Susan Collins (R), a moderate from Maine who was recently ranked the most bipartisan in the Senate, according to an index by The Lugar Center.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very intrigued by him, to tell you the truth, because he\u2019s not easily categorized, and he\u2019s not predictable,\u201d she said in an interview on the Senate subway as it zipped her to her office. \u201cHe\u2019s very conservative, but he\u2019s not reflexively for one position or another. He\u2019s gutsy, as [his] speeches certainly prove. There\u2019s just a real solid core to him that I find very appealing.\u201d\n\nFar from isolating him, Sasse\u2019s forthrightness, fired by an intellect that\u2019s certified in five diplomas, has won him respect and admiration from colleagues on both sides of the aisle. He\u2019s a tea-party favorite without the explosives. A conservative who decries bare-knuckled politics as a substitute for principled governing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a rising star,\u201d says fellow Republican Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona.\n\nDemocrat Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who serves on several committees with Sasse, describes him as \u201cthoughtful\u201d and \u201cvery willing to listen to an argument.\"\n\nSasse did not follow the usual route to the Senate that travels through state and local offices or through the US House. A fifth-generation Nebraskan, he lives in his home town of Fremont, with his wife and three children, who have been home schooled. His dad was a high school teacher and coached football and wrestling there, and the young Sasse was recruited to wrestle at Harvard. He later earned a PhD in history from Yale.\n\nMost of his career has been as a strategic consultant, starting at Boston Consulting Group. He helped companies steer through crises in the utility, telecom, and airline industries.\n\nHis last job was as the president of Midland University in Fremont, where he was brought in to reverse course at the financially troubled liberal arts school that is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church. One of the youngest college presidents in the nation, he abolished tenure, cut back underperforming departments while building up others, and concentrated on recruiting.\n\nBut how does a guy who\u2019s a turnaround artist make an impact as 1 of 100?\n\nThe Senate is a long game, and Sasse has just one year under his belt. Speeches are one thing, but it can take years to work an important piece of legislation through the gates of a committee, onto the Senate floor, past a possible filibuster, through the House, and onto a president\u2019s desk for signature.\n\nIn a phone interview, Sasse says his experience as a university president is the most analogous to his new job, because it\u2019s not command-and-control. Faculty members have their own domain, and as president, you\u2019re more like a symphony conductor bringing out the richness of the group. He laments the lack of leadership in Washington and of a shared understanding and celebration of the \u201cAmerican idea.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the Senate is brand new to him, and for that, he\u2019s had to put his historian\u2019s hat on. As he worked his way up to his maiden speech last year, he kept a low profile, interviewing senators about what worked and didn\u2019t. He studied up on the ways and rules of the Senate, and has been in touch with the Senate historian\u2019s office.\n\nOn his office desk right now are eight books, including a volume of addresses on the history of the Senate by the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D) of West Virginia \u2013 a master of Senate rules and history \u2013 and \u201cShattered Consensus,\u201d by James Piereson, about the rise and decline of America\u2019s post-war political order.\n\nFormer Senate historian Don Ritchie describes Sasse as \u201coff to a good start,\u201d quietly observing the institution. \u201cThey are all in a hurry these days, and the Senate requires a certain amount of time to be heard, and to be listened to.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, senators develop areas of expertise as a way to make their mark, says Mr. Ritchie.\n\nThe boyish-looking senator appears to be doing just that. He is spending his energy on some big, long-term issues such as cyber-security in an age of terrorist jihad and also health care.\n\nThis week his office released a report saying that the Obamacare exchanges are not as competitive as the administration claims. He has also held fire to the administration\u2019s feet over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s troubled \u201cco-op\u201d program.\n\nSasse\u2019s focus on health care policy was evident even before he got to the Senate.\n\nAlongside his private sector and university activities, he had done stints in Washington before (the Justice and Health departments under President George W. Bush, and working for fellow Nebraskan Rep. Jeff Fortenberry before that). But his time in Washington didn\u2019t hurt his anti-establishment image among Nebraskans.\n\nIn 2014, he ran a fiercely competitive campaign, backed by three major conservative groups \u2013 Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, and the Senate Conservatives Fund. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell (R) of Kentucky, who was trying to swamp tea party upstarts, backed someone else. Sasse won every single county, putting replacement of the Affordable Care Act at the center of his campaign (his plan totaled more than 20 pages).\n\nHe hasn\u2019t succeeded in that quest yet. But he has already turned heads with his plain-spokenness and intellect.\n\nLast November, a year after being elected to his first political office, the student of history held up the mirror to his Senate colleagues in a startling maiden speech.\n\n\u201cThe people despise us all,\u201d he said in remarks that invoked Senate greats and Socrates. He urged the Senate to return to substantive debate and tackle America\u2019s big problems.\n\nSome colleagues see Sasse as part of a larger shift under way in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe talent, the commitment, the knowledge, the broadness of our members is much better today than it was nine years ago,\u201d says Sen. Bob Corker (R) of Tennessee, speaking of when he first entered the Senate. \u201cI look at Sasse as one of these people,\u201d says the Foreign Relations chairman, who recently reread Sasse\u2019s maiden speech to help him with one of his own. \u201cHe\u2019s just extraordinarily bright and insightful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "ac93a560d7250f264cdeb8960e1c51ea", "sailthru.author": "Francine Kiefer", "description": "As a freshman senator, Sasse broke with many colleagues by saying he will not support his party's nominee, if that nominee is Donald Trump.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/03/970482_1_0315-Sasse-Republican-Senate_standard.png?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "As a freshman senator, Sasse broke with many colleagues by saying he will not support his party's nominee, if that nominee is Donald Trump.", "title": "Defying Trump, Ben Sasse becomes a Republican symbol", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2016/0315/Defying-Trump-Ben-Sasse-becomes-a-Republican-symbol", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/03/970482_1_0315-Sasse-Republican-Senate_standard.png?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/03/970482_1_0315-Sasse-Republican-Senate_standard.png?alias=standard_380x253", "title": "Defying Trump, Ben Sasse becomes a Republican symbol", "description": "As a freshman senator, Sasse broke with many colleagues by saying he will not support his party's nominee, if that nominee is Donald Trump.", "card": "summary", "site": "@csmonitor"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-15", "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-15T18:11:25-04:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/USA/Politics/2016/0315/Defying-Trump-Ben-Sasse-becomes-a-Republican-symbol", "sailthru.tags": "section-politics,section-usa,class-article,storysource-monitor,brand-ump", "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-03-15T18:11-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "Gary Cameron/Reuters"}, "article_summary": "Senator Sasse (pronounced \u201csass\u201d) blasted Trump for dividing Americans and acting like a monarch.\nAs a freshman senator, Sasse broke with many colleagues by saying he will not support his party's nominee, if that nominee is Donald Trump.\nNebraska\u2019s senior senator, Republican Deb Fischer, disagrees with his third-candidate strategy.\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell (R) of Kentucky, who was trying to swamp tea party upstarts, backed someone else.\nMeanwhile, the GOP leadership in both the House and Senate say they will support Trump if he's the nominee."}
