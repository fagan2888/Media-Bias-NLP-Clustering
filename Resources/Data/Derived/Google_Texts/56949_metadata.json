Unlike most of Europe, where economies are stagnant, the country has enjoyed vigorous economic growth in recent years, fueled in large part by a booming export sector.\n\n\u201cEvery single one of us has contributed to where the company is today,\u201d said parcel carrier Rene Lubasch, a 16-year veteran of Deutsche Post who has been on strike since June 9. \u201cThe volume of packages we deliver has gone up by 28 percent. But we haven\u2019t received extra manpower, better work conditions or more pay.\u201d\n\nBut the strikes also have a clear political component, say analysts. Union leaders fear a new law from the coalition government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel to take effect July 1 will undermine their power, so they are taking action to cement their influence.\n\nThe law would require all unions in a company to adopt contracts negotiated by the biggest union among them. The \u201cone company, one collective agreement\u201d approach was traditional in Germany until 2010, when a doctors\u2019 union brought the issue to court and won a case that allowed even the smallest unions to bargain with managers for a separate contract.\n\nPushed hard by Labor Minister Andrea Nahles, a leader of the center-left Social Democratic Party in Mrs. Merkel\u2019s government, the measure carries the key implication that German courts could now step in to forbid strikes by smaller unions that have been proven most disruptive in recent months.\n\nGerman officials argue new rules will simplify labor negotiations and put more Germans to work.\n\n\u201cIt should only apply when two unions represent the same group of employees in one and the same operation and want to negotiate different contract terms for them,\u201d said German Labor Ministry spokesperson Dominik Ehrentraut.\n\nBut many labor leaders disagree, however, saying the change marks a direct threat to their power.\n\n\u201cOur strikes were a targeted and intentional provocation against this law, and to preserve trade unions in Germany,\u201d said Claus Weselsky, leader of the GdL train operators\u2019 union, referring to his nine multiday strikes over the past eight months. \u201cIf the law isn\u2019t overturned, it will destroy the GdL as well as other unions. The government has enacted a law that has targeted unions not just to weaken them, but to wipe them out.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Germany\u2019s national railway, two competing unions represent workers. The GdL is the smaller one, with 34,000 members. After July 1 it would be forced to defer to its larger rival union in collective bargaining, the EGV, which has around 100,000 members.\n\nDeutsche Bahn spokesperson Dagmar Kaiser blames turf wars between the two unions \u2014 not the new law \u2014 for the disruptive strikes that have cost the railway around $338 million. The German government is Deutsche Bahn\u2019s largest shareholder.\n\n\u201cUntil last summer, the two railway unions split professions between themselves: The GdL represented train operators, and the EVG mostly represented train conductors and engineers,\u201d Deutsche Bahn spokesperson Dagmar Kaiser explained. \u201cBut now they\u2019re in an all-out power struggle with each other to negotiate for the same professional group. That\u2019s the difference [with] how things were before.\u201d\n\nMixed bag for business\n\nA return to stable, single-union dominance should be music to business\u2019 ears, said labor attorney Martin Nebeling of Bird & Bird, a Dusseldorf law firm, greatly streamlining the collective bargaining process.\n\n\u201cIt is designed to make life easier and smoother for employers by only obliging them to negotiate agreements with one union,\u201d Mr. Nebeling said.\n\nBut the lawyer cautioned that the corporate bosses shouldn\u2019t be too optimistic.\n\nThere is a good chance Germany\u2019s top constitutional court might strike down the new law too, said Mr. Nebeling. The consensus in the German legal community is that the law\u2019s restrictions run contrary to the right to collective bargaining and striking in the German constitution.\n\n\u201cThe new system says, \u2018OK, we accept that principle, but if there is still one collective bargaining agreement and there is a big trade union, then people in a smaller union won\u2019t have [the] right to negotiate their own,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Nebeling. \u201cTheir right to [exercise] their collective right will from now on be limited.\u201d\n\nEven big unions are wary of the new rule, said Jan Jurczyk, a spokesman for the United Services Union, with 2.2 million members who include nursery teachers, media workers and 1,000 other professions. Backers of the law could make one think German unions are dedicated to destroying their country\u2019s economy. That\u2019s not true, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a completely misguided proposal,\u201d said Mr. Jurczyk, who added that the union is considering filing its own appeal against the law despite standing to benefit from less competition. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of political credibility for us. Competing unions are currently the exception and not the rule.\u201d\n\nContrary to the law\u2019s intended purpose of bringing stability to German labor relations, concern is growing that aggression and labor strife will increase.\n\nCompared to their European counterparts, Germany\u2019s 7.4 million trade union members strike relatively infrequently, according to the German national statistics office. Between 2005 and 2012, Germany lost, on average, 16 days per 1,000 workers to strikes. By contrast, France lost a whopping 139 days and Denmark lost 117. The United States lost around 10 days.\n\nKarl Brenke, a labor market analyst at the German Institute for Economic Research, said that the high visibility of recent strikes makes it feel as if labor relations in Germany are worse than they really are.\n\n\u201cWhen car manufacturers went on strike before, no one noticed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the railway goes on strike nowadays, you notice it more because people depend on the railway.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An unprecedented wave of strikes in Germany this year, fueled in part by an upcoming law to revamp labor-employer relations, is undermining the country's global reputation for order and efficiency, while putting new stress on Germany's much-praised model of cooperation between labor, business and the state.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An unprecedented wave of strikes in Germany this year, fueled in part by an upcoming law to revamp labor-employer relations, is undermining the country\u2019s global reputation for order and efficiency, while putting new stress on Germany\u2019s much-praised model of cooperation between labor, business and the state.", "title": "Germany\u2019s labor harmony hit by wave of strikes", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/21/germanys-labor-harmony-hit-by-wave-of-strikes/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/21/6_212015_ap794027394194-18201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/21/6_212015_ap794027394194-18201.jpg", "description": "An unprecedented wave of strikes in Germany this year, fueled in part by an upcoming law to revamp labor-employer relations, is undermining the country's global reputation for order and efficiency, wh", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Germany\u2019s labor harmony hit by wave of strikes"}, "Author": "Mihret Yohannes \u2014 Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Germany"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc06d\"", "article_summary": "The dramatic upswing in labor unrest reflects how workers want a bigger share of Germany\u2019s prosperity.\nBackers of the law could make one think German unions are dedicated to destroying their country\u2019s economy.\nCompeting unions are currently the exception and not the rule.\u201dContrary to the law\u2019s intended purpose of bringing stability to German labor relations, concern is growing that aggression and labor strife will increase.\nCompared to their European counterparts, Germany\u2019s 7.4 million trade union members strike relatively infrequently, according to the German national statistics office.\nBut we haven\u2019t received extra manpower, better work conditions or more pay.\u201dBut the strikes also have a clear political component, say analysts."}
