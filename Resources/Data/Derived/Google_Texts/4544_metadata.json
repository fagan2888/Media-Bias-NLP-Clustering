Neither are government regulations. Put the two together and things can get confusing fast.\n\nSo it\u2019s not surprising that federal regulators took a stab at making things a bit more straightforward for consumers in new rules unveiled in late February and published Tuesday in the Federal Register. Because those rules are part of a 530-page, dizzying array of changes set for next year and beyond, here are three specific changes finalized by the Department of Health and Human Services that affect consumers who buy their own health insurance in one of the 38 states using the online federal insurance exchange.\n\n1) Consumers could have access to more information about the size of the insurers\u2019 network of doctors and hospitals.\n\nMost consumers care about two things: the cost of the plan and whether their doctor or hospital is in the plan\u2019s network. The new rules would require insurers to give consumers 30-days\u2019 notice when a provider is being removed from the network. They must also continue to provide coverage for that provider for up to 90 days for patients in active treatment, such as those getting chemotherapy or for women in the later stages of pregnancy \u2014 unless the provider is being dropped for cause. Consumers will also see another change: The relative breadth of each plan\u2019s network will be noted with three size designations, which are roughly equal to basic, standard and broad.\n\n2) Consumers could be given slightly more warning about \u201csurprise\u201d medical bills from out-of-network providers.\n\nOne of the most common complaints from consumers \u2014 even before the federal health law passed \u2014 concerns bills they get from out-of-network providers. Such bills can hit consumers even when they go to facilities that are in an insurer\u2019s network because not all of the doctors and other medical staff in those facilities are part of the network. The new rules make a small change, requiring that amounts paid by consumers for ancillary care \u2014 such as anesthesiology or radiology \u2014 count toward their annual out-of-pocket maximum. That\u2019s important because once a patient hits that out-of-pocket maximum, the insurer is responsible for all in-network medical costs for the rest of the year. But the new rule only applies in cases where the insurer hasn\u2019t warned patients \u2014 generally at least 48 hours before the hospitalization or procedure \u2014 that they might receive care and bills from such out-of-network providers. Consumer advocates say insurers will simply issue form letters to as many patients as they can to avoid the rule, while insurers complain the rule doesn\u2019t get at the heart of the matter: the high charges they say are set by out-of-network providers.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Insurance,Syndicate,The Health Law,Copays,Deductibles,Federal Exchange,Obamacare Plans,Out-Of-Pocket Costs,Premiums,State Exchanges", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services issues new rules designed to simplify health coverage consumers buy through Healthcare.gov.", "title": "3 Obamacare Changes to Expect Next Year", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20160315/three-changes-consumers-can-expect-in-next-years-obamacare-coverage", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services issues new rules designed to simplify health coverage consumers buy through Healthcare.gov.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "article_summary": "1) Consumers could have access to more information about the size of the insurers\u2019 network of doctors and hospitals.\nOne of the most common complaints from consumers \u2014 even before the federal health law passed \u2014 concerns bills they get from out-of-network providers.\nThe new rules would require insurers to give consumers 30-days\u2019 notice when a provider is being removed from the network.\n2) Consumers could be given slightly more warning about \u201csurprise\u201d medical bills from out-of-network providers.\nMost consumers care about two things: the cost of the plan and whether their doctor or hospital is in the plan\u2019s network."}
