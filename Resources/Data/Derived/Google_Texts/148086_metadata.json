The latest round of closures leaves the impoverished Rio Grande Valley, a vast border community in southwestern Texas, without any clinics whatsoever. Since the abortion clinics that have managed to stay open under the new law are located in Texas\u2019 urban centers, there are little options available for women in the more rural areas of the state, who now have to navigate a 400-mile stretch that doesn\u2019t have a single facility providing abortion care.\n\nAnd there is perhaps nowhere more rural than the Lower Rio Grande. One of the poorest regions of the country, this area of Texas is home to thousands of so-called colonias, which are border communities that aren\u2019t technically considered to be Texas municipalities. Colonias often lack basic services that the state provides in other counties, like paved roads, electricity, sanitation systems, clean water, and safely constructed housing units.\n\nWomen here have been facing serious threats to their reproductive rights well before Texas\u2019 new law started shutting down abortion clinics.\n\nThe family planning network in Texas has been crippled by deep funding cuts.\n\nAlthough the national media typically focuses its attention on abortion, that\u2019s not the only type of health service that\u2019s disappearing in Texas. As the state\u2019s clinics are shuttered, women are also losing access to basic preventative care like birth control and Pap smears. On top of that, the family planning network in Texas has been crippled by deep funding cuts over the past several years.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has been building up a reproductive health safety net since the 1970s that been serving millions of women. For many women and men, it\u2019s their first point of access to health care. Now, under the cover of night, states like Texas are eroding that safety net with a combination of complicated strategies,\u201d Katrina Anderson, the Human Rights Counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, explained to ThinkProgress.\n\nIn 2012, state lawmakers decided to defund Planned Parenthood, and kicked the national women\u2019s health organization out of the local network of Medicaid providers \u2014 a move that has forced dozens of clinics to close, and has left low-income women scrambling to find new doctors. Coupled with rounds of budget cuts, this policy change has had catastrophic results. Now, the Texas Women\u2019s Health Program, which is intended to provide check-ups and birth control for low-income women, isn\u2019t effectively reaching the residents who need it most. Although the state program served about 287,730 women in 2005, that number dropped down to just 47,322 last year.\n\nPredictably, Texas\u2019 most vulnerable residents are suffering the most. In partnership with the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, Anderson\u2019s group recently published a report on the health care crisis in the Rio Grande Valley. The report collected stories from low-income and immigrant women who have essentially been locked out of the state\u2019s struggling family planning system \u2014 women who have been waiting for years to afford mammograms after finding lumps in their breasts, or have been forced to stop using their birth control because they can\u2019t spare the extra money for it.\n\nBut the women of the Rio Grande aren\u2019t anyone\u2019s victims. They\u2019re standing up, and they\u2019re fighting to take their community back.\n\nTransforming personal stories into policy change\n\nThe Rio Grande report, entitled \u201cNuestra Voz, Nuestra Salud, Nuestra Texas\u201d \u2014 or, our voice, our health, our Texas \u2014 is largely a collection of personal stories that paint a vivid picture of what\u2019s at stake in the region. But it also ends on a call to action. The authors included concrete policy proposals, like restoring funding for the Texas Women\u2019s Health Program and expanding Medicaid in Texas, to start making progress on issues of women\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using this report to build support for a policy blueprint for improving Latinas\u2019 reproductive access in Texas. We\u2019ll unveil that in January, at the beginning of the next Texas state session,\u201d Anderson explained. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to mobilize Latinas in the state, and partner with community groups to push for solutions to their local problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s unique is the way that we\u2019re pushing,\u201d Jessica Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas, the executive director of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, told ThinkProgress, explaining that activists have a multi-level approach to attacking those policy goals.\n\nThe two organizations have held letter writing campaigns, planned district visits, and met with congressional staff. They\u2019re planning a larger advocacy day for January, once lawmakers are back in session. And currently, activists are touring the state, traveling to cities like El Paso, Houston, San Antonia, and Corpus Christi to share the stories included in \u201cNuestro Texas.\u201d This push will culminate with a large event in the Rio Grande that will be attended by some state lawmakers who are committed to the policy proposals in the report.\n\n\u201cWhen we bring these women\u2019s stories to lawmakers, we can really see promise and hope for future change,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas noted.\n\nWhen we bring these women\u2019s stories to lawmakers, we can really see promise and hope for future change.\u201d\n\nAnd they\u2019re not confining themselves to Texas\u2019 borders. At the end of February, they held a congressional briefing on Capitol Hill to tell national lawmakers what they need to do to help expand health care access for the women of Texas.\n\nAnderson told ThinkProgress that last month\u2019s briefing, which was spearheaded by Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-TX), Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX), and Gene Green (D-TX), was well-attended. Advocates worked to highlight what\u2019s currently happening in Texas, make recommendations for federal policies to strengthen immigrant community\u2019s health care, and build momentum for securing reproductive rights for underserved populations.\n\n\u201cA lot of people on the Hill think \u2014 well, we passed the Affordable Care Act, we allocated more funds for community health centers, and that will make sure everyone has access. So we need to draw attention to the fact that\u2019s not actually the ultimate solution,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe\u2019re using Texas as a negative model of what can happen when you get rid of family planning programs.\u201d\n\nSince about 40 percent of Texas\u2019 population is Latino, examining the impact that state policies have on Latina women can help assess those laws\u2019 overall effect. But these issues are ultimately broader than the Latino community, and broader than Texas. Other states have also been slashing family planning funds in recent years. Title X, an incredibly effective and relatively low-cost program that helps save the government billions, has been cut by more than $23 million over the past two fiscal years.\n\nThe year of accountability\n\nAnderson told ThinkProgress that 2014 is really \u201cthe year of accountability\u201d when it comes to Texas women\u2019s health. Activists are taking advantage of every pressure point to push for real change.\n\nIn addition to lobbying on the state and federal levels, women from the Rio Grande Valley have also taken their issues all the way to the United Nations. Earlier this month, delegates from the Center for Reproductive Rights traveled to Geneva to share the \u201cNuestro Texas\u201d report with the UN\u2019s Human Rights Committee, pointing out that the situation in Texas could be considered a human rights violation.\n\nThey argued that the elimination of low-income and rural women\u2019s health care access violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the United States has ratified. Calling the Rio Grande a \u201chuman rights crisis,\u201d delegates urged UN officials to ensure that the United States lives up to its commitment to these values by remedying the issues in Texas.\n\nThe situation in Texas could be considered a human rights violation.\n\nLucy Felix, an organizer for the Latina Institute for Reproductive Health who\u2019s based out of the Rio Grande Valley, was one of the people who went before the UN to address the realities on the ground. \u201cWe\u2019re so thrilled to bring Lucy and have that voice represented,\u201d Anderson told ThinkProgress in an interview a few days before they left for Geneva.\n\nEvery four years, the ICCP treaty\u2019s monitoring body reviews each ratifying country. Since the U.S. is up for review this year, reproductive rights advocates hope it will be a good opportunity to highlight critical areas of improvement so that women can access their fundamental right to health care.\n\n\u201cWomen from rural North Dakota to the Rio Grande Valley of Texas are fighting to exercise their reproductive rights, which are firmly grounded in the U.S. Constitution and the ICCPR,\u201d the Center for Reproductive Rights notes on its website. \u201cThis report and the upcoming review of the U.S. opens the door to accountability and, one hopes, meaningful change.\u201d\n\nThe women who are going to change the state\n\nHere at home, where the women of the Rio Grande Valley are fighting for meaningful change in the Lone Star State, Anderson and Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas believe they\u2019ll succeed.\n\n\u201cThe reception has been really positive in Texas, especially among Latina lawmakers who are already champions on this issue,\u201d Anderson noted. \u201cThe Texas delegation in Congress is really supportive. It\u2019s really encouraging to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by all of the media attention we\u2019ve gotten lately, and we know that things are going to change in Texas. They just can\u2019t stay where they are now!\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas said. \u201cWomen are rising up and fighting back. They see the seeds of change that are being sown, and they\u2019re excited about what could happen.\u201d\n\nAnderson noted that Americans don\u2019t need to live in the Rio Grande to be invested in the issues that are going on there.\n\nThis goes beyond immigration, and beyond poverty. Everyone should be paying attention to this.\n\n\u201cAt the most fundamental level, these are basic human rights \u2014 the right to choose your family size, which impacts your whole level of participation in society. One of our most sobering findings was the fact that woman are struggling to get screened for cervical cancer, which is a preventable disease,\u201d she said, pointing out that the dismantling of the family planning safety net is forcing women to live with fear and uncertainty. \u201cThe cruelty is really made clear \u2014 okay, we\u2019re not going to fund these very cheap, simple solutions and we\u2019re going to make you suffer the pain of that. This goes beyond immigration, and beyond poverty. Everyone should be paying attention to this.\u201d\n\nBut the two organizations spearheading \u201cNuestro Texas\u201d are eager to emphasize that, despite the bleak headlines about the Rio Grande in the national media, these women aren\u2019t interested in being victimized. They\u2019re proud of their communities, and they have the strength to rise up against the challenges in Texas.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about construing us as victims. This is about us as sources of power that are fighting back,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas explained. \u201cAs the women we work with say: \u2018Don\u2019t pity me; fear me!\u2019 This is a growing political force, and politicians should watch out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are the women who are going to change the state,\u201d she added.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The women of the Rio Grande aren't anyone's victims.
