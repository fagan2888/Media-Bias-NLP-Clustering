Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute and a veteran of several campaigns. \u201cWhatever they want to talk about, Glenn can get the best people, even Democrats.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMore important than having any single economist on staff is someone who knows precisely whom to call when a question is raised about, say, how the international banking system works, or which regional Federal Reserve presidents get to vote, and then get those experts in a room with the candidate. The ultimate campaign economist, beyond his or her own expertise, is a walking, talking version of Facebook.\n\nBeyond the party\u2019s traditional triumvirate of economic concerns \u2014 tax reform, looser government regulation and free trade \u2014 candidates are also looking for help in developing proposals that can help them stand out, be easily understood by voters and withstand the volley of assaults that their opponents are sure to lob.\n\n\u201cThere is such a small set of people who can actually do what has to be done,\u201d Mr. Hassett said. After five campaigns, he said, he is sitting this one out so that he can offer advice to anyone who comes knocking.\n\nAnother economist likely to remain unaffiliated is Arthur Laffer, whose famed curve inspired Reaganomics.\n\nMany mainstream economists have pointed to the failures in Mr. Laffer\u2019s supply-side promises that lowering top tax rates will lift economic growth and lead to more federal revenues. But he holds a venerable position among Republicans and is frequently sought out \u2014 as much to pay homage to as to receive advice.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has met with nearly all of the top Republican hopefuls, he said, including the long-shot Tea Party hero Ben Carson (\u201ca rock star,\u201d Mr. Laffer said), and Jeb Bush, with whom he served as a pallbearer at the funeral of the Cuban-born millionaire Jorge Mas Canosa, who created a powerful anti-Castro lobbying machine in Miami.\n\nPoliticians aren\u2019t experts, Mr. Laffer said. \u201cThey give a speech and if anyone boos, they change their speech,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey\u2019re living, breathing polls and that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d\n\nSigning up with any one campaign is unlikely, he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty old and pretty inflexible.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Laffer has helped preside over a series of small dinner parties where candidates like Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, have gotten a primer in supply-side economics and the opportunity to meet with wealthy potential donors, including John Catsimatidis, the billionaire supermarket owner, who picks up the checks.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe latest, with Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, took place Thursday night at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan.\n\nMr. Laffer\u2019s co-hosts include Larry Kudlow, a former Reagan adviser and a CNBC commentator, and Stephen Moore, a flat-tax champion at the Heritage Foundation. Mr. Moore has been working closely with Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky on a new tax proposal, a 14.5 percent flat tax, which he unveiled on Wednesday in an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe dinners are partly meant to encourage candidates to adopt three ideas: lower tax rates, more open trade and pro-immigration policies. The group is concerned about the party embracing policies that hearken back to the \u201cfortress America\u201d ideas espoused by the onetime presidential candidate and conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan in the 1990s, Mr. Moore said.\n\nThey also, no doubt, want to push back against some younger and more moderate conservative voices \u2014 so-called reformicons \u2014 who have argued that the party should focus less single-mindedly on tax cuts and pay more attention to other issues like inequality, middle-class wage stagnation and the costs of higher education.\n\nJames Pethokoukis, a reformicon economist at the American Enterprise Institute who has met with several campaigns, has advised against a narrow focus on cutting tax rates.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey think the country is in bad shape, and they want big change, not incremental change,\u201d he said of the candidates. \u201cEveryone wants faster economic growth. I\u2019ve said the best way to do that is through a number of initiatives, and not try to find a magic bullet.\u201d He mentioned fewer government regulations and investments in education and infrastructure as examples of his suggested initiatives.\n\nMr. Pethokoukis said he was not planning on joining any particular campaign: \u201cI give my 2 cents to all comers.\u201d\n\nTim Kane, an economist at the Hoover Institution, said he had met with four campaigns, primarily to discuss his specialty, immigration. He added that there was a recognition that Republicans were vulnerable to Democratic charges that they didn\u2019t care about inequality. What they want to know, he said, is: \u201cHow do you combat it?\u201d\n\nAs the campaign heats up, some experts are signing on with specific candidates. Abby McCloskey, former program director of economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute, for example, is now policy director for Mr. Perry.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida has the backing of Wayne Berman, a veteran of several Republican presidential campaigns who is now a top official at the Blackstone Group. Though not an economist, he can provide Mr. Rubio with ties to Wall Street money as well as policy advice. Mr. Rubio also consulted with reformist economists before releasing his tax plan, which included a child tax credit.\n\nMr. Paul has also gone beyond the traditional fraternity of economists to name Mark Spitznagel, a prominent hedge fund manager and critic of the Federal Reserve, to serve as a senior economic adviser.\n\nMr. Bush is perhaps furthest along in putting together his economic team. As Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics and an adviser to the McCain campaign in 2008, said: \u201cHe has more support from mainstream economists and establishment economists.\u201d\n\nBoth Mr. Warsh and Mr. Hubbard, who is dean of the Columbia University business school, declined to talk about the campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen asked about the generation-long stagnation on middle-class incomes, Mr. Hubbard argued that \u201ccompensation didn\u2019t stagnate,\u201d citing large increases that employers have paid out in health and pension benefits. \u201cGlobal changes in the market make it difficult to get wage gains,\u201d he added. One challenge for Mr. Bush, unlike the other Republican candidates, is that memories of the housing bust and the ensuing financial crisis at the end of his brother\u2019s second term are still fresh.\n\n\u201cBoth Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton have relationships and history they will have to overcome,\u201d said Tony Fratto, a longtime G.O.P. strategist who is backing Mr. Bush. \u201cHe has to make his own case for his background and ideas, but she has a more complex challenge, namely explaining and differing from the sitting administration that she was part of.\u201d\n\nNewcomers to the political circus, like Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, don\u2019t have such baggage, but they also lack ties within the Republican establishment, compelling them to reach beyond the usual suspects. Laurence Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University who ran for president himself as a third-party candidate in 2012, said Mr. Carson called him to talk about the size of the deficit.\n\nMr. Kotlikoff was disdainful of the network that presidential candidates of both parties tend to rely on. \u201cThe problem with politicians,\u201d he said, \u201cis that they hire economists who instantly become politicians.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150619133628, "twitter": {"description": "Presidential hopefuls are auditioning economists, seeking policy advice, experience and connections, but most candidates have yet to team up with anyone in particular.", "title": "Matchmaking Season for Republican Presidential Candidates and Economists", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/20/business/economy/matchmaking-season-for-republican-presidential-candidates-and-economists.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003745243"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/20/business/20gopecon/20gopecon-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/20/business/economy/matchmaking-season-for-republican-presidential-candidates-and-economists.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003745243", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/20/business/economy/matchmaking-season-for-republican-presidential-candidates-and-economists.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business/economy", "hdl_p": "Matching Policy and Platforms", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/economy/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 19, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Hoover Institution", "keywords": "Presidential Election of 2016,Economics (Theory and Philosophy),United States Economy,Republican Party,Bush  Jeb,Rubio  Marco,Carson  Benjamin S,Paul  Rand,Buchanan  Patrick J,Hassett  Kevin A,Hubbard  R Glenn,Moore  Stephen,Perry  Rick,Walker  Scott K,Kane  Timothy J (1968- ),Warsh  Kevin M,United States Politics and Government,American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,Heritage Foundation,Hoover Institution,Laffer  Arthur Betz", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Patricia Cohen and Nelson D.
