Instead of spending the day at one of New York\u2019s famed museums or attractions, they\u2019ll be navigating the depths of the city\u2019s impound lots and forced to pay at least $185 to get their vehicle back.\n\nMiller has his reasons for pushing the proposal.\n\n\u201cBy registering out-of-state, you are either committing fraud by not registering your vehicle in New York state or you are avoiding paying state Department of Motor Vehicles fees,\u201d he told the New York Post.\n\nMiller said his proposal would allow out-of-staters to purchase an \u201cexemption sticker\u201d to protect their vehicles from the city\u2019s predatory tow trucks.\n\nAAA says the policy would be \u201cshortsighted and unfair\u201d because it would prevent some people from coming to New York City and spending the night.\n\nIt could also be another blow in a long-simmering conflict between the city and private rental services like AirBnb, which has been banned in the city but continues to operate.\n\nTourists looking to spend the night in New York City will now have an added reason to find a hotel with a parking lot or garage, rather than leaving their car on the street while sleeping in an apartment.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michael Miller, a Queens assemblyman, wants to tow away any cars left on city streets between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. that don\u2019t have a New York license plate.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Michael Miller, a Queens assemblyman, wants to tow away any cars left on city streets between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. that don\u2019t have a New York license plate.", "title": "New York City Proposal Would Outlaw Overnight Parking for Out-of-State Cars", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/3833598521_36e0dfc932_o.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-31T23:27:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1DkRLR5"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Michael Miller, a Queens assemblyman, wants to tow away any cars left on city streets between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. that don\u2019t have a New York license plate.", "title": "New York City Proposal Would Outlaw Overnight Parking for Out-of-State Cars", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/3833598521_36e0dfc932_o.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-02-01T03:01:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-31T23:27:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "nanny of the week, out of state car bans, nyc, new york city, car ban, new york city ban, nanny state, big government"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb37e\"", "article_summary": "At least that\u2019s the idea behind a proposal to ban overnight parking for out-of-state cars in New York City.\nBut parking your tires, your Ford or your Honda with a Massachusetts license plate on the streets of New York City overnight certainly won\u2019t be free.\nAAA says the policy would be \u201cshortsighted and unfair\u201d because it would prevent some people from coming to New York City and spending the night.\nMichael Miller, a Queens assemblyman, wants to tow away any cars left on city streets between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. that don\u2019t have a New York license plate.\n\u201cBy registering out-of-state, you are either committing fraud by not registering your vehicle in New York state or you are avoiding paying state Department of Motor Vehicles fees,\u201d he told the New York Post."}
