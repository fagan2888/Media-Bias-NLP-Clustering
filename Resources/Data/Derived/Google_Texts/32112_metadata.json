In a letter published on Tuesday, the coalition called for easier and more expansive access to the sorts of benefits that are traditionally enjoyed by full-time employees.\n\nFor \u201cthe millions of other independent workers across the country, it\u2019s time to explore modernized, portable systems,\u201d Logan Green, the chief executive of Lyft, said.\n\nThe group \u2014 which includes a total of 37 start-ups, venture capitalists and labor advocates \u2014 did not offer clear proposals for how they would help the nation\u2019s growing freelance work force obtain benefits like worker\u2019s compensation, retirement savings or sick leave. And many fundamental questions remain unaddressed, like whether companies should contribute financially to benefit plans.\n\nBut the coalition members said they will explore policy proposals that follow the model of the Affordable Care Act, which has made it easier and less expensive for many contract workers to get medical insurance. They also raised the idea of centralized human resource platforms, essentially easier ways for workers to connect to vendors of insurance and other benefits.\n\n\u201cWe are in agreement that flexible work should not come at the expense of desired economic security,\u201d the group said in the letter, which is addressed to federal and state regulators.\n\nMany new start-ups have faced questions about their relationships with their workers. Drivers for Uber, which is not part of the coalition, and workers for Handy, a household chores service, have argued in lawsuits that they accumulate enough hours to constitute full-time status but aren\u2019t being given benefits such as sick time, vacation and life insurance. Handy\u2019s chief executive is a member of the coalition.\n\nRegulators in California and other local jurisdictions have proposed redefining contract workers as employees for on-demand companies like Uber. Such a move could upend some on-demand businesses, which often rely on lower labor costs to offer cheaper services.\n\n\u201cWe believe these issues are best pursued through policy development, not litigation, with orientation towards action in the public, private and social sectors,\u201d the group said in its letter.\n\nThe coalition, which includes Anne-Marie Slaughter, the president of New America, and think tanks such as the Aspen Institute, brings together an unexpected alliance of interests. Led by Greg Nelson, a former adviser for the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, the coalition has been meeting for four months to come up with broad principles they can agree upon.\n\nIn the end, they shared similar pragmatic interests. On-demand companies are scurrying to find ways to fight off lawsuits and potential laws while also addressing growing public concern about how the companies provide for workers. Labor advocates such as the Service Employees International Union have toiled unsuccessfully at advocating for new laws. They say their best shot at helping workers get more benefits is by working with the tech start-ups.\n\n\u201cChange is inevitable \u2014 it\u2019s the progress that\u2019s optional,\u201d Andy Stern, president emeritus of the SEIU, said. \u201cThe people who have signed onto these principles are committed to trying to find a constructive way to make progress in building a 21st-century economy and companies that also promote flexibility and security for workers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151109230025, "twitter": {"description": "The coalition brings together an unexpected alliance of interests.
