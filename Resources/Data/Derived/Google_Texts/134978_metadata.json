Would Texas Sen. and presidential aspirant Ted Cruz be demanding a constitutional amendment requiring the Court\u2019s justices to stand for election in order to keep their jobs? And would liberals be rallying to the defense of the Court, and condemning any effort to alter its supposedly august traditions?\n\nOf course not. Throughout our political history, the team that loses in the Supreme Court has tried to alter the court\u2019s power and influence. This battle isn\u2019t about deep judicial principles or timeless heritage; it\u2019s about whose ox gets gored.\n\nThat\u2019s why Republicans during the Civil War proposed abolishing the entire Supreme Court and replacing it with a new one. The Court was still led by Roger Taney, author of the notorious Dred Scott decision on slavery. Creative GOP legislators pointed out that the Constitution simply provided for \u201cone Supreme Court\u201d; it didn\u2019t say anything about how the Court should be constituted.\n\nOthers proposed expanding the number of justices from nine to thirteen, which would give President Abraham Lincoln four new appointees. In his 1861 inaugural address, Lincoln had emphasized that \u201cthe people\u201d \u2014 not \u201cthat eminent tribunal\u201d called the Supreme Court \u2014 were the \u201crightful masters\u201d of the Constitution. There was nothing in the document about the size of the court, which had fluctuated between six and ten justices since 1789. So why not let Lincoln choose a few more?\n\nAfter Lincoln was assassinated, Congress would actually reduce the court\u2019s size to seven in order to prevent his successor, Andrew Johnson, from appointing new members. Following the election of Ulysses S. Grant in 1868, the Court went back to nine, where it has stayed ever since.\n\nBut it has also remained a ripe target, on every side of the political aisle. After he left the White House, the proud trust-buster Teddy Roosevelt proposed that judicial decisions be subject to popular recall. Striking down several of Roosevelt's prized economic regulations, the Supreme Court had become \u201ca menace to the welfare of the Nation,\u201d Roosevelt charged. Only the nation\u2019s voters could rein it in.\n\nTwo decades later, Roosevelt\u2019s distant cousin would suggest a different remedy. Frustrated by the court\u2019s rulings against his New Deal legislation, Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed that the president be allowed to add up to six new justices if none of the current crop retired. The Supreme Court, FDR claimed, had \u201cimproperly set itself up as a third House of the Congress \u2014 a super-legislature.\u201d\n\nFast-forward to last week, when Ted Cruz charged the court with behaving like \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a \u201csuper-legislature.\u201d In the Obamacare and same-sex marriage cases, Cruz said, the Court was \u201csimply enacting the policy preferences of the elite judges who are serving upon it.\u201d\n\nBut instead of allowing the president to appoint more judges, FDR-style, Cruz proposed that every justice \u2014 starting with the second national election after their appointment \u2014 sit for a \u201cretention election\u201d every eight years. Those who failed to win approval from a majority of all the voters \u2014 and from the electorates of at least half the states \u2014 would have to step down.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether this would actually help Cruz\u2019 fellow Republicans, who might stand to lose seats on the Court as the country shifts leftward on questions such as marriage equality. Maybe that why most GOP spokesmen have stayed quiet about Cruz\u2019s proposal, leaving it to Democrats to denounce him as reckless, irresponsible, or \u2014 to quote one popular Facebook page \u2014 a \u201cnut job.\u201d\n\nBut the same charge was leveled at everyone who wanted to tinker with the Supreme Court, including some of our greatest liberal heroes. Following Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s effort to institute popular recalls of court decisions, one business journal suggested that there was a \u201cserious question\u201d about Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cmental balance.\u201d\n\nCritics made similar insinuations about Franklin Roosevelt, who eventually backed down from his court-packing plan. But the rest of his key New Deal legislation was upheld by the Court, which most likely altered its doctrines to save its own skin.\n\nSo whatever you think of the Ted Cruz plan to control the Supreme Court, don\u2019t dismiss him as crazy; he\u2019s doing precisely what other politicians have done, whenever they find themselves on the losing side.\n\nAnd if his proposal goes down in flames, as it\u2019s likely to do, remember that even failed attacks on the Court can affect its behavior. The justices are political creatures, as Ted Cruz correctly noted last week. And they are watching.\n\nJonathan Zimmerman teaches history and education at New York University.
