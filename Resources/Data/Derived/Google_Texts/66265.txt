In today's edition of the "Good Stuff," a Texas restaurant owner sells his business to help an employee fight her brain tumor. CNN's Chris Cuomo reports.

Britney Mathis, 19, along with her mom and her sister, work hard at a German restaurant – the Kaiserhof Restaurant and Wunderbar – in Montgomery, Texas.

That was, until, she went to the hospital, for what seemed like a harmless rash.

"I went to the hospital and found out it was my blood clotting," Mathis told CNN affiliate KHOU. "So, they wanted to keep me and do CAT scans and MRIs and the next day they came in and told me I had a tumor."

Brittany already lost her father to the same type of cancer in 2000. What's worse is, she had to stop treatment, because she doesn't have insurance, or the money to pay for it.

That was, until the owner of her restaurant, Michael De Beyer, suggested something extraordinary.

He's decided to sell his business, just to pay for her care.

"I just can't be standing by and doing nothing," said De Beyer. "I have to try something because it's not right."

We should note that De Beyer has another motivation here– he's been looking for an excuse to retire for years and spend more time with his family.

The restaurant could fetch as much as $2 million.
