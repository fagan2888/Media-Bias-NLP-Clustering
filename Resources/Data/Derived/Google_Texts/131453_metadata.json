I remember thinking that information could be delivered through computers (as I was seeing with early educational software) and that students could even input responses that could be automatically evaluated. And the technology was very new then, so of course it would only get better (and of course it has gotten much better). What I failed to understand, at that age, was the critical importance of direct human interaction in the process of education.\n\nAccording to Politico, Rand Paul is \u201cplanning a major push on education reform, including education choice, school choice, vouchers, charter schools, you name it.\u201d As one specific example for improving education, Paul suggested that \u201cif you have one person in the country who is, like, the best at explaining calculus, that person maybe should teach every calculus class in the country.\u201d He allowed that \u201cYou\u2019d still have local teachers to reinforce and try to explain and help the kids, but you\u2019d have some of these extraordinary teachers teaching millions of people in the classroom.\u201d As an example, Paul lauded the work of Salman Khan, the creator of Khan Academy, a growing vault of education videos aimed to comprehensively cover a wide variety of traditional school courses and other topics as well.\n\nI like Salman Khan\u2019s videos \u2013 I think they can be a valuable tool. Just like all sorts of other educational media, talented teachers can utilize these assets wisely to help complement their teaching, and there are many different approaches that can be used to great success. Salman Khan does a very nice job of explaining difficult concepts. This happens to be a great strength of mine as well. And while my knack for explaining the concepts of calculus have been of tremendous value to me in my teaching, I must say that the \u201cexplaining\u201d aspect of teaching is one small part of what we do, and that the best teachers (and this goes for just about every discipline, not just higher-level mathematics) do not simply stand in front of the class and feed knowledge into their skulls. This sort of approach to education is one of the flaws in our system, as too often teachers gravitate toward this conventional approach.\n\nHere is the biggest problem with this approach (and thus with Paul\u2019s vision of education): If your brand of teaching is simply explaining things to kids, then you\u2019re not teaching them to think. You\u2019re not teaching them to problem-solve. You\u2019re teaching them to learn what you tell them, and to be able to reproduce something similar. What we need to do in education, however, and in particular in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) education, is to cultivate creative critical thinking skills. As former Secretary of Education Richard Riley said, \u201cWe are currently preparing students for jobs that don\u2019t yet exist, using technologies that haven\u2019t been invented, in order to solve problems we don\u2019t even know are problems yet.\u201d This is always in my mind as I teach my math courses. I have to constantly remind myself to get out of the way of the students, to not jump in with a hint or answer too quickly, and to challenge them to ponder a concept before I explain it to them.\n\nReal learning comes from engaging with material. Whether you\u2019re forming an argument about a character\u2019s motives in a novel, debating the root causes of World War I, trying to make sense of the relationship between temperature and pressure of gases, or trying to understand the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the best learning doesn\u2019t happen when the answers are simply given to you. Perhaps even more important, a set of knowledge isn\u2019t the only goal of education, and shouldn\u2019t even be considered the primary goal. Rather, the most important outcome is the development of a set of skills \u2013 skills that can only be honed through that direct engagement (not through watching someone else\u2019s demonstration). In STEM courses, the most important thing we teach is problem solving. Yes I want my students to know the basic theorems of calculus and to be able to compute a definite integral. But more important, I know that if I\u2019m educating the next generation of mathematicians, scientists and engineers, I need to prepare them to encounter problems that they haven\u2019t seen before (and, for that matter, that I haven\u2019t seen), and to take on these challenges unfazed. This isn\u2019t effectively done through a set of videos, channeled from one person to 2 million. This is done by highly talented teachers who give their students a taste of something and challenge them to take it a step further on their own and then nudge, assist as needed, and encourage. It\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all approach. It\u2019s an art.\n\nPart of the problem with the perpetuity of education reform is that everyone is looking for the answer to the question, \u201cHow do we best teach,\u201d as though there is some formula that is ultimately the best. They see teaching as a science experiment \u2013 as though one set of conditions and stimuli will prove to be optimal. That\u2019s not what it is. It is an art. Two great teachers may do things completely differently from each other. Furthermore, no two classes of students are the same. One great teacher may teach the same thing in very different ways to different groups of kids, depending on their strengths, personalities and the real-time feedback that the teacher reads from her class. Again, this is something that requires a talented, knowledgeable classroom teacher (the one directing the instruction and activity at each moment) who cultivates a relationship with each student \u2013 anathema to Paul\u2019s description of his own vision of education.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Tea Party senator has some wild and damaging ideas about education -- and overlooks what actually works", "title": "Rand Paul gets schooled: Libertarian fantasies don\u2019t help kids learn \u2014 teachers do", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Tea Party senator has some wild and damaging ideas about education -- and overlooks what actually works", "title": "Rand Paul gets schooled: Libertarian fantasies don\u2019t help kids learn \u2014 teachers do", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/10/rand_paul_gets_schooled_libertarian_fantasies_dont_help_kids_learn_teachers_do/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/rand_paul5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Tea Party senator has some wild and damaging ideas about education -- and overlooks what actually works", "title": "Rand Paul gets schooled: Libertarian fantasies don\u2019t help kids learn \u2014 teachers do", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/rand_paul5.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "James Goodman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Education, Education Reform, libertarians, Rand Paul, Salman Khan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "You\u2019re teaching them to learn what you tell them, and to be able to reproduce something similar.\nTopics: Editor's Picks, Education, Education Reform, libertarians, Rand Paul, Salman Khan, NewsWhen I was in elementary school, I remember wondering about the day when teaching would become automated, and human teachers would be obsolete.\nWhat I failed to understand, at that age, was the critical importance of direct human interaction in the process of education.\nThis sort of approach to education is one of the flaws in our system, as too often teachers gravitate toward this conventional approach.\nThey see teaching as a science experiment \u2013 as though one set of conditions and stimuli will prove to be optimal."}
