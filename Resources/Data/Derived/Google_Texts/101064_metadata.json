The audience was raucous at times, at one point shouting and clapping to drown out Trustee Stephen Brown when he spoke at length.\n\nSeveral people expressed support for the contract, which calls for teachers to receive a 3 percent raise this year and 2.5 percent increases in the 2016-17 and 2017-18 school years for the about 340 teachers.\n\n\u201cDo the right thing. Vote it in. And \u2026 let us begin anew to educate our children \u2014 all of the children,\u201d said Esther Babb.\n\nOthers, however, criticized the raises, calling them excessive given the district\u2019s poor performance on standardized tests.\n\nThe city\u2019s educators are \u201cno doubt wonderful teachers\u201d but there is a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between pay scale and results, said resident Eugene Clements. \u201cI\u2019m disturbed, a little, by rewarding the many people that are in this room wearing red shirts who are apparently not able to come to grips with the declining scores over the years,\u201d he said.\n\nBoard members also were divided. Brown and Garrison in particular raised several objections, including that more information was needed, that raises under the new contract are distributed unequally and that the agreement did not account for a tax that goes into effect in 2018 under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The tax, Garrison claimed, would cost the district between $600,000 and $700,000.\n\nBut Trustee Carol Feinstein said the regulations regarding the tax are not yet known and that it might not even go into effect. She also noted that, if the tax is imposed, the memorandum of agreement with the union calls for the contract to be reopened.\n\nTrustee Devry Pazant said he understood his colleagues\u2019 concerns but, if the district is going to move forward, \u201cThe last thing we need to worry about and focus on is the teachers\u2019 contract.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to waste time,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter about half an hour of debate, six board members voted for the agreement: Pazant, Feinstein, Howard Haughton, Junius \u201cJeff\u201d Carter, Betty Griffin and Molly Craig-Berry, who voted yes to the agreement but no to associated salary guides. Craig-Berry, who is chairwoman of the negotiations committee and signed off on the agreement, said before the vote that she \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d supported it, but the agreed-upon salary guides were not honored.\n\nBrown and Garrison voted against the contract. Henry Pruitt III abstained, saying he would have liked more discussion on it.\n\nFor 2014-15, the minimum salary on the guide was $52,310 for a teacher with a bachelor's degree at steps 1 and 2. The maximum was $104,731 for a teacher with a doctorate at step 22. Under the new contract, the 2015-16 minimum salary is $53,105 for a teacher with a bachelor's degree at step 1. Maximum is $105,431 for a teacher with a doctorate at step 22.\n\nBefore the vote, Brown asked the board to hold off until January, after the board receives a full, typed version of the contract. The memorandum of agreement, which was posted on the district\u2019s web site, is a two-page, handwritten document with three attachments: the proposed salary guides and the bargaining proposals put forward by the union and the board.\n\nBrown\u2019s motion was defeated 6 to 3. Brown, Craig-Berry and Garrison voted in favor.\n\nGarrison objected to Feinstein and Carter participating in that vote, citing a 2013 advisory opinion by the state School Ethics Commission. The state ruled that their membership in the New Jersey Education Association posed a conflict of interest and that they should not be involved in matters such as teacher contracts.\n\nFeinstein said that ruling was appealed and state Education Commissioner David Hespe determined that \u201cadvisory opinions are only opinions and do not amount to final agency decisions.\u201d\n\nEmail: lueddeke@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Roughly 100 people packed into the Dr. John Grieco Elementary School cafeteria for the school board meeting, many of them wearing red shirts with \u201cETA\u201d \u2014 signifying Englewood Teachers\u2019 Association \u2014 printed on them.
