The deal comes after the buyer sold Cole-Parmer Instrument to GTCR for $480M in July

Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO) has acquired Advanced Scientifics Inc. for $300 million in cash.

Advanced Scientifics manufactures and delivers single-use systems and equipment for preparing, processing, storing and transporting biopharmaceuticals. The target, which had about $80 million in revenue for 2014, will be added to Thermo Fisher's Life Sciences Solutions segment.

Waltham, Massachusetts-based Thermo Fisher provides services to life science businesses. Thermo Fisher says the acquisition will let it expand its offerings in the bioprocessing workflow space.
