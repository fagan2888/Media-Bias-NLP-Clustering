A bill in the Legislature would further restrict when school district referendums. (Photo: File/Press-Gazette Media)Buy Photo\n\nVoters in the Tigerton School District on Nov. 3 approved a referendum to exceed revenue limits for operating and maintenance costs by $2.5 million over five years. The vote wasn\u2019t even close.\n\nHowever, the vote would not have been held if a bill introduced in the Legislature within the last month were already law.\n\nAssembly Bill 481/Senate Bill 355 would restrict when referendums to increase a school district\u2019s revenue limits could be held. They would be restricted to the spring election (first Tuesday in April) or the general election, which \u201coccurs in even-numbered years on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November.\u201d\n\nSince this is 2015, no vote would have been held.\n\nProponents of the scheduling restriction say they\u2019re looking to hold referendums when turnout will be highest and prevent school boards from scheduling votes in, say, \u201cthe middle of January,\u201d according to a hypothetical posed by Sen. Duey Stroebel to the Wisconsin State Journal.\n\nFor increased voter turnout and because school districts foot the bill for special elections, we think school boards would be wise in having their referendums coincide with spring and general elections, but we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s something that the Legislature has to prescribe.\n\nThat proposal is one of two in a bill from Republican legislators that are solutions in search of problems. The cost of these solutions is a loss of local control.\n\nSchool referendums are democracy at the ground level. Elected school board members vote whether to hold a spending referendum. Approved spending plans then go to voters in the school districts, the very people who will be affected, and they vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d A simple majority is all that\u2019s needed.\n\nYou can\u2019t get much simpler than that.\n\nThe bill comes at a time when school districts have seen state aid decrease over the last five years. A referendum, then, is one of the only ways a school district can increase revenue.\n\nAB481/SB355 would also restrict the frequency of referendums. If voters reject borrowing money or exceeding revenue limits, then the school board could not bring the issue before voters for two years, with exception for fire or natural disaser.\n\nBackers of the bills want to prevent school boards from scheduling votes on slightly altered versions of the same referendum year after year and, in effect, wearing down voters. Again, this should be a local decision.\n\nSchool district residents have the power to vote out school board members who don\u2019t move on. Also, second and third votes give the board an opportunity to fine-tune and adjust a referendum to meet constituents\u2019 needs.\n\nMore importantly, this provision \u201ccould have a significant impact on school district operations and could force districts to spend down cash reserves in order to meet operational costs before the next round of state aid payments,\u201d according to a fiscal estimate from the state Department of Public Instruction.\n\nThat\u2019s because the two-year prohibition would ban short-term borrowing that school districts use to manage cash flow that result from the vagaries of state aid distribution as well as receipt of tax levy revenue.\n\nA public education is mandated in the state\u2019s constitution. Cuts to state aid have left school districts with little recourse than the referendum route. Further restricting that avenue will hurt public education, plus it\u2019s not needed.\n\nContact your local elected officials and tell them to scrap this bill.\n\nCONTACT YOUR LEGISLATOR\n\nThe following are the Northeastern Wisconsin legislators who have signed onto the bill:\n\n\u00bb State Sen.
