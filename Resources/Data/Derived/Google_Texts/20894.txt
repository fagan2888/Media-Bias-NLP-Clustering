The Los Angeles Times poses a question about a state that has some relevance to our earlier disquisition on the state of poor people in Mississippi. No peeking now. But here's a hint – its attorney general and former governor are both currently under indictment, and the latter thinks he should be president despite the fact that, if he had a clue, he'd drop it on his foot and break a toe.

Good guess!

Texas, whose officials have strongly resisted cooperation with the new law, had the highest level of residents lacking insurance before the law took effect and has made among the least progress of any state. Its uninsurance rate fell from 27% in 2013 to just under 21% in the first half of this year, making it the only state that has more than one-fifth of its residents uninsured. By contrast, in Arkansas and Kentucky, both of which started above 20% uninsured, just 9% of adult residents lack insurance. California has gone from just under 22% without insurance to just under 12%, experiencing the largest number of newly insured people in the country. In addition to Texas, most of the states with the highest levels of adults lacking insurance are located in the South and interior West in states including Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Nevada. By contrast, most of the New England states have 5% or fewer of their residents uninsured, a mark also achieved by Iowa, Minnesota and Hawaii.

I am shocked nearly senseless by these numbers. You mean if you offer states FREE MONEY! to help their citizens get healthy, the states that take the FREE MONEY! will have more citizens with health care? Holy hell, what about…The Oregon Study! (Pro tip: it's been rendered a crock by people using it in their stump speeches.) The gob, she is smacked, she is.

Correction: The blog originally stated that the current Texas governor was under indictment, when in fact we were referring to former governor and presidential candidate Rick Perry.
