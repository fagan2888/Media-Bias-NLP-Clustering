He's the director there and said the cold weather is taking its toll on southeastern Kansas.\n\n\"People are just trying to stay warm no matter what they can do, and as a result, we've had some extra fires because of it,\" Phillips said.\n\nThree fires in five days, he said, including one early Saturday morning, in Cherryvale, that left four people without a home. The cause for the fire is still under investigation, but Phillips said there's a common link between the others.\n\n\"Using space heaters some, one was a candle. One person, actually, used a device to try to stay warm in the house that they shouldn't have been using and that was a charcoal grill, actually, so had a fire as a result of that,\" said Phillips.\n\nThe Montgomery County emergency manager said the latest storm didn't cause any major problems across the county and the major roads were free of snow and ice.\n\nBut this winter weather is the talk of the town.\n\nCoffeyville Resident, Kevin Buetow said, \"Just long term cold is what it is.\"\n\nBuetow said he had ice close to ten inches thick on his pond.\n\nWhen asked if he had ever seen anything like that, he said, \"Not in a long time, not since I was a kid maybe.\"\n\nFor Violet Walker and her daughter there's a rainbow at the end of the day, or at least Tuesday night, when they make their way to Hawaii.\n\n\"Supposed to be 80 degrees there when we get there,\" Walker said.\n\nThey're going to a wedding and then vacation for a couple of weeks; and they just can't wait to say goodbye to the Kansas winter.\n\nAnyone needing help in southeastern Kansas to avoid the cold or snowy weather is encouraged to contact the American Red Cross at 1-888-460-1050.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Southeastern Kansas got the most snow out of the latest winter storm that blew through overnight, plus the sub-freezing temperatures.", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/24685624/winter-weather-taking-toll-on-kansas-residents", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24685624_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Southeastern Kansas got the most snow out of the latest winter storm that blew through overnight, plus the sub-freezing temperatures.", "title": "Winter Weather Taking Toll On Kansas Residents"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24685624_SA.jpg", "description": "Southeastern Kansas got the most snow out of the latest winter storm that blew through overnight, plus the sub-freezing temperatures.", "card": "summary", "title": "Winter Weather Taking Toll On Kansas Residents"}, "wnreadableurl": "winter-weather-taking-toll-on-kansas-residents", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2014/02/10", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS09", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "article_summary": "Southeastern Kansas got the most snow out of the latest winter storm that blew through, plus the sub-freezing temperatures.\nCoffeyville has seen three fires in five days due to people trying to stay warm in winter weather.\nHe's the director there and said the cold weather is taking its toll on southeastern Kansas.\nThey're going to a wedding and then vacation for a couple of weeks; and they just can't wait to say goodbye to the Kansas winter.\nAnyone needing help in southeastern Kansas to avoid the cold or snowy weather is encouraged to contact the American Red Cross at 1-888-460-1050."}
