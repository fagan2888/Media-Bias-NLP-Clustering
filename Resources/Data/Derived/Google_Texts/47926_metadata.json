The insurance powerhouse once had as many as 1,400 employees here when it added 300 jobs in 2001 and built their headquarters on Akers Street. The company has had some presence in Visalia since around 1991. Some still work in the Akers building, but the 150,000-square-foot office has been sold and divided since Cigna occupies only about 50,000 sq. ft. The current call center operation takes calls for overseas clients that include expatriate members. (Photo: Steve R. Fujimoto)\n\nBy voting Thursday night to approve a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill intended to avoid another federal shutdown, members of Congress also kept alive legislation that could save about 700 jobs in Visalia.\n\nNow it's up to the Senate to pass it, too.\n\nWhile the majority of the more than 1,600-page bill actually has to do with what the government can spend, other pieces of legislation were tacked onto it, which include spending $479 million to buy four more F-35 Joint Strike Fighters; a $93 million cut from the federal Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program; and essentially revoking a law that would allow legalizing marijuana in Washington, D.C., despite voters there having approved it.\n\nThe budget packet also includes provisions from House Resolution 4414, a bill passed by Congress in April that basically makes healthcare insurance plans sold to expatriates \u2014 Americans living in other countries \u2014 exempt from provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWithout the exemptions healthcare provider Cigna had announced that it might have to relocate about 700 jobs in Visalia \u2014 along with 500 more in Delaware \u2014 overseas in order to stay competitive with less-expensive foreign insurance plans.\n\nCigna is one of Visalia's largest employers.\n\nWith so many jobs at stake, representatives Devin Nunes, R-Visalia, and John Carney, D-Delaware, crossed party lines to develop HR 4414 and rallied cross-party support for it, despite concerns by some Democrats that it was part of an effort by Republicans to dilute the ACA.\n\nIt then went to the Senate but languished there for months, even though Cigna officials had told lawmakers that if the resolution wasn't passed by the end of the current Senate session \u2014 which had been scheduled to end Thursday \u2014 then the company would have to terminate services to expatriate clients conducted at its facility on Akers Street in Visalia as well as at its Wilmington, Del. facility.\n\nWhether that would have meant moving the operations overseas or ending insurance services to expatriates entirely wasn't clear Friday.\n\n\"I can't speculate on that,\" was all Jon Sandberg, a spokesman for Cigna, would say on the matter.\n\nMembers of the California and Delaware coalitions in the Senate had been trying this week to get HR 4414 up for vote, but with no success.\n\nSo some members of Congress decided on a different move \u2014 having the legislation rolled into the omnibus package passed late Thursday night with a 219 to 206 vote.\n\nIt was a rare case of GOP leaders in Congress and the White House both backing the same bill, while left-wing Democrats didn't, claiming that some of those provisions in the omnibus are handouts to special interests.\n\nWording on the portions of the Senate omnibus affecting expatriate health insurance is slightly different from HR 4414's wording, said Jack Langer, a spokesman for Nunes' office.\n\nHe noted that the changes were needed because \"Some in the Senate were concerned it was too broad and it might apply to other people other than expats.\"\n\nSo omnibus language is more specific, Langer said.\n\nCongress' top Republicans, Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, both approved adding the HR 4414 provisions to the omnibus.\n\nAs of Friday, it seemed that the insurance exemptions was likely to become law, as there seemed little doubt that the Senate would pass the budget legislation and avoid a government shutdown, Langer said.\n\n\"I'm hearing the same thing,\" Sandberg said Friday.\n\nIn written statement, Cigna officials said they were pleased by the House's actions, adding that \"If this legislation is enacted, companies will continue offering high-quality expatriate health care coverage from our offices located in the United States \u2014 a crucial benefit for every American who relies on this coverage when they travel or work overseas.\n\nThe senators extended their session to Friday and were expected to work into the night.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://vtd-tar.co/1DqRlg4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "HR 4414's wording included in bill to prevent government shutdown", "og": {"site_name": "Visalia Times-Delta and Tulare Advance-Register", "description": "HR 4414's wording included in bill to prevent government shutdown", "title": "Bill to save Visalia jobs gets a reprieve", "url": "http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/news/local/2014/12/13/bill-save-visalia-jobs-gets-reprieve/20349483/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/visaliatimesdelta.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "HR 4414's wording included in bill to prevent government shutdown", "title": "Bill to save Visalia jobs gets a reprieve", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5f537ca12186ba89e63e9f66a284a052f29afdfa/c=344-0-1652-1308&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Visalia/2014/12/14/B9315481312Z.1_20141214023451_000_G2L9D59AO.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@vtdnews", "site": "@vtdnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=870529059", "fb": {"app_id": 148799741837669}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/david.castellon.378"}, "Content-Type": "text/html;
