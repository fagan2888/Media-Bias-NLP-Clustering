WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Lawyers for a group of California teachers have filed a long-shot request for the Supreme Court to hold new arguments in a major labor union case that ended last week in a 4-4 tie.

The teachers said in their petition Friday that the court should rehear arguments once a new justice is confirmed.

The tie vote was a victory for unions in a case they once seemed all but certain to lose before Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February. The deadlock left in place a four-decade-old practice that allows public-sector unions to collect fees from members and non-members alike to cover collective bargaining costs.

The teachers claim the fees infringe their free speech rights.

The court almost never rehears cases. It would take five justices to agree to a rehearing.
