We aren\u2019t there yet. Yes, such things may well come to pass, but there are obstacles aplenty to overcome \u2014 not so much engineering snags, but cultural and regulatory issues.\n\nThe first widely publicized application of modern drone aircraft \u2014 dropping Hellfire missiles on suspected terrorists \u2014 greatly skewed perceptions of the technology. On the one hand, the sophistication of such unmanned systems generated admiration from technophiles (and also average citizens who saw them as valuable adjuncts in the war against terrorism). On the other, the significant civilian casualties that were collateral to some strikes have engendered outrage. Further, the fear that drones could be used for domestic spying has ratcheted up our paranoia, particularly in the wake of Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations of National Security Agency overreach.\n\nIt\u2019s as though drones have been painted with a giant red \u201cD,\u201d \u00e1 la The Scarlet Letter. Manufacturers of the aircraft, not surprisingly, are desperate to rehabilitate the technology\u2019s image, and properly so. Drones have too many exciting \u2014 even essential \u2014 civilian applications to restrict their use to war.\n\nThat\u2019s why drone proponents don\u2019t want us to call them \u201cdrones.\u201d They\u2019d prefer we use the periphrastic term, \u201cUnmanned Aerial Vehicle,\u201d or at least the acronym \u2014 UAV. Or depending on whom you talk to, Unmanned Vehicle System (UVS).\n\nWill either catch on? Probably not. Think back: do we call it Star Wars or the Strategic Defense Initiative? Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act? Popular culture has a way of reducing bombastic rubrics to pithy, evocative phrases. Chances are pretty good \u201cdrones\u201d it is, and \u201cdrones\u201d it\u2019ll stay.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not so bad, says Brendan Schulman, an attorney with the New York office of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel.\n\n\u201cPeople need to use terminology they understand,\u201d says Schulman, who serves as the firm\u2019s e-discovery counsel and specializes in commercial unmanned aviation law. \u201cAnd they understand \u2018drones.\u2019 I know that causes some discomfort to manufacturers and people who use drones for commercial purposes, but I have no trouble with the term. I think we can live with it.\u201d\n\nMichael Toscano, the president and CEO of the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, feels differently: not surprisingly, he favors the acronym \u201cUVS\u201d over \u201cdrone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018drones\u2019 evokes a hostile, military device,\u201d says Toscano. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what the broad applications of this technology are about. Commercial unmanned aircraft have a wide range of uses, from monitoring pipelines and power lines, to wildlife censuses, to agriculture. In Japan, they\u2019ve been used for years for pesticide applications on crops. They\u2019re far superior to manned aircraft for that \u2014 the Japanese government even partnered with Yamaha to develop a craft specifically designed for the job.\u201d\n\nNomenclature aside, drones are stuck in a time warp here in the United States. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prohibits their general use pending development of final regulations; such rules have been in the works for years but have yet to be released. Still, the FAA does allow some variances on the ban: government agencies and universities, after thrashing through a maze of red tape, can obtain waivers for specific tasks. And for the most part, field researchers who have hands-on-joystick experience with the aircraft are wildly enthusiastic about them.\n\n\u201cThey give us superb data,\u201d says Michael Hutt , the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Manager for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) . USGS is currently using drones \u2014 specifically the fixed-wing RQ-11A Raven and the hovering RQ-16A T-Hawk \u2014 for everything from surveying abandoned mine sites to monitoring coal seam fires, estimating waterfowl populations, and evaluating pygmy rabbit habitat.\n\n\u201cLandsat [satellites] have been the workhorse for most of our projects,\u201d continues Hutt, \u201cand they\u2019re pretty good as far as they go, but they have definite limitations. You\u2019re able to take images only when a satellite passes overhead, obviously, and you\u2019re limited to what you can see by the weather. Also, your resolution is only 30 meters. With the Raven or Hawk, we can fly anytime we want. And because we fly low and slow, our data is collected in resolutions of centimeters, not meters. It\u2019s just a level of detail we\u2019ve never had before.\u201d\n\nAnd highly detailed data, of course, translates as highly accurate and reliable data. Hutt offers an example: a project to map fossil beds at White Sands National Monument.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that these beds aren\u2019t static,\u201d says Hutt. \u201cThey tend to erode, or they can get covered up with blowing sand. It has been difficult to tell just what we have, and where the fossils are precisely. But with our T-Hawks, were able to get down to 2.5-centimeter resolution. We know exactly where the fossils are \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter if a sand dune forms on top of them.\u201d\n\nEven with current FAA restrictions, Hutt notes, universities are crowding into the drone zone.\n\n\u201cNot long ago, maybe five or six universities were using them, or had applied for permits,\u201d Hutt says. \u201cNow, there\u2019s close to 200. The gathering of high-quality data is becoming easy and cheap. That\u2019s because of aircraft advances, of course, and also because the payload packages \u2014 the sensors and cameras \u2014 are dropping dramatically in price. A few years ago, you needed a $500,000 mapping camera to obtain the information we\u2019re now getting with an off-the-shelf $1,000 camera.\u201d\n\nUnmanned aircraft may be easier to fly than F-22 fighter jets, but they impose their own challenges, observes Jeff Sloan, a top drone jock for USGS.\n\n\u201cDealing with wind is the major problem,\u201d says Sloan. \u201cThe aircraft we\u2019re using are really quite small, and they get pushed around easily. Also, though they can get into tighter spots than any manned aircraft, steep terrain can get you pretty tense. You\u2019re flying very low, and there\u2019s not much room for error.\u201d\n\nIf and when the FAA gives the green light for broad commercial drone applications, a large cohort of potential pilots with the requisite skill sets will be ready and waiting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that the best pilots are those who\u2019ve had a lot of video game experience,\u201d laughs Sloan, \u201cso it\u2019s good to know my kids have a future.\u201d\n\nBut back to the FAA: a primary reason for the rules delay is public worry over safety and privacy. Toscano says safety concerns are mostly just that \u2014 foreboding more than real risk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while before you see general risk tolerance, but it\u2019ll come,\u201d Toscano said. \u201cThe Internet started with real apprehension, and now, of course there\u2019s general acceptance. There are risks with the Internet, but they\u2019re widely understood now, and people realize there\u2019s a trade-off for the benefits.\u201d\n\nSystem vulnerability is tops among safety concerns, acknowledges Toscano. Some folks worry that a drone\u2019s wireless links could be severed or jammed, and that the craft would start noodling around independently, with potentially dire results.\n\n\u201cThat probably could be addressed by programming the drone with a pre-determined landing spot,\u201d says Toscano. \u201cIt could default to a safe zone if something went wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd what about privacy? Drones, says Toscano, don\u2019t pose a greater threat to privacy than any other extant technology with potential eavesdropping applications.\n\n\u201cThe law is the critical factor here,\u201d he insists. \u201cThe Fourth Amendment supports the expectation of privacy. If that\u2019s violated by any means, it\u2019s a crime, regardless of the technology responsible.\u201d\n\nMore to the point, says Toscano, we have to give unmanned aircraft a little time and space to develop: we\u2019re still at Drones 1.0.\n\n\u201cWith any new technology, it\u2019s the same story: crawl, walk, run,\u201d Toscano says. \u201cWhat Bezos did was show what UVS technology would look like at a full run \u2014 but it\u2019s important to remember, we\u2019re really still crawling.\u201d\n\nTo get drones up on their hind legs and sprinting \u2014 or soaring \u2014 they\u2019re going to need a helping hand from the FAA. And things aren\u2019t going swimmingly there, says attorney Schulman.\n\n\u201cThey recently issued a road map on the probable form of the new rules,\u201d Schulman says, \u201cand frankly, it\u2019s discouraging. It suggests the regulations are going to be pretty burdensome, particularly for the smaller UAVs, which are the kind best suited for civilian uses. If that\u2019s how things work out, it will have a major chilling effect on the industry.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Category": "IoT", "subtitle": "UAVs will rule the skies (unless the FAA says otherwise).", "description": "Jeff Bezos' recent demonstration of a drone aircraft simulating delivery of an Amazon parcel was more stunt than technological breakthrough.\u00a0We aren't there yet.\u00a0Yes, such things may well come to...", "author": "Glen Martin", "og": {"image": "http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/images/radar-social-icon2-120.png"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeff Bezos' recent demonstration of a drone aircraft simulating delivery of an Amazon parcel was more stunt than technological breakthrough.\u00a0We aren't there yet.\u00a0Yes, such things may well come to...", "title": "Drone on", "url": "http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/drone-on.html", "image": "http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/images/radar-social-icon2-120.png", "creator": "GlenWM5440", "site": "radar", "card": "summary", "account_id": 10295842}, "search_date": "2014-02-03", "search-content": "article", "keywords": "Industrial Internet,Internet of Things,Solid", "search-title": "Drone on", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Jeff Bezos\u2019 recent demonstration of a drone aircraft simulating delivery of an Amazon parcel was more stunt than technological breakthrough.\nCommercial unmanned aircraft have a wide range of uses, from monitoring pipelines and power lines, to wildlife censuses, to agriculture.\nThe first widely publicized application of modern drone aircraft \u2014 dropping Hellfire missiles on suspected terrorists \u2014 greatly skewed perceptions of the technology.\n\u201cThey give us superb data,\u201d says Michael Hutt , the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Manager for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) .\nDrones, says Toscano, don\u2019t pose a greater threat to privacy than any other extant technology with potential eavesdropping applications."}
