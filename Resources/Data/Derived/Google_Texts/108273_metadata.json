One had been shot in the head, he said.\n\nOne man was dead at the scene, and the second died later at a hospital.\n\nOther residents said the complex, which includes a number of smaller buildings, is usually peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe had a situation outside an apartment complex. We don\u2019t know what transpired, but two were shot,\u201d said Sonny Jackson, a Denver police spokesman.\n\nPolice are investigating, Jackson said.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Two men shot to death in Denver overnight", "title": "Two men shot to death in Denver overnight", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/15/two-men-shot-to-death-in-denver-overnight/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-15T08:28:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-15T08:28:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc28f\"", "article_summary": "Two men died after a shooting broke out at an apartment complex in Denver on Sunday morning, according to Denver police.\nPolice responded to the shooting outside the Lex at Lowry apartment complex, 240 South Monaco Parkway, at about 12:40 a.m., according to the department.\n\u201cWe had a situation outside an apartment complex.\nWe don\u2019t know what transpired, but two were shot,\u201d said Sonny Jackson, a Denver police spokesman.\nSharon Gibeault, 58, who lives in building A of the complex, said she heard the shots but thought they were fireworks."}
