There are two examples from last week\u2019s news cycle that shed some light on that question.\n\nAt the beginning of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, Anderson Cooper challenged Sen. Bernie Sanders on the Vermont liberal\u2019s willingness to describe himself as a democratic socialist. Indeed, the CNN host went so far as to pointedly ask, \u201cHow can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States?\u201d This is because, for more than a century, socialism has been a dirty word in American politics. Any liberal president who attempted a major economic or social justice reform\u2014be it Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and John Kennedy\u2019s civil rights promises or President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act\u2014could safely bet that his opponents would accuse him of pushing a socialist agenda.\n\nThis is an unsavory residue from our recent history. Although anti-socialist paranoia has existed in this country since the late 19th century, it reached its nadir during the Cold War, when many liberals joined their right-wing counterparts in denouncing any program that smacked of socialism with the hard communism of America\u2019s sworn enemy, the Soviet Union. There was a time not too long ago when even the suspicion of harboring socialist sympathies could get you blacklisted from jobs in government, academia, business, and entertainment. Although the political climate has changed considerably in the early 21st century, the nasty undertone associated with \u201csocialist\u201d is still strong enough that it\u2019s frequently used as a political insult.\n\nIn fact, that may be a big part of the reason why it has lost so much of its punch. By repeatedly insisting that traditional liberal candidates like John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama are actually socialist, the term\u2019s meaning has been so blurred that voters are not only having trouble identifying the genuine article, but even mustering up the energy to care.\n\nNevertheless, Cooper still knew that\u2014because every Democratic president since FDR can rely on being called a socialist by his critics\u2014a candidate who actually went by that title would need to be interrogated on the subject.\n\nI would argue that Cooper\u2019s question, though necessary, would have been even more powerful if he had approached the question of Sanders\u2019 \u201csocialism\u201d as an objective one\u2014i.e., exploring the pros and cons of socialist policies\u2014rather than by acknowledging its taboo nature and thereby implicitly validating it.\n\n\u2666\u25ca\u2666\n\nThis is where Bill Maher enters the picture. In a recent interview with Sanders, Maher began by openly confronting the irrational response to the word \u201csocialist\u201d in American political debate, exclaiming \u201c\u201cThey hear socialist and they think herpes, Bernie!\u201d From there, however, he didn\u2019t give Sanders a free pass, but interrogated him about the potential cost of his proposed programs. Indeed, when Sanders challenged his interviewer to explain why the socialized health care plan he was proposing couldn\u2019t work, Maher more than rose to the occasion. \u201cIf you\u2019re saying that the government is going to pick up the tab but not make the insurance companies, the hospitals, and the doctors not gouge people, then we are going to break the budget,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cIt has to work both ways. So you\u2019re going to make the hospitals do that? Because that is socialism.\u201d\n\nEven though I count myself as a Sanders supporter, I would argue that Maher performed an important service for the candidate by his questioning process. The danger facing advocates of new ideas in our country is that the media either won\u2019t take them seriously (hence the running complaint among Sanders-ites that the media barely covers his campaign) or that, by sheer virtue of being \u201cfringe,\u201d those ideas will be preemptively dismissed. When Cooper challenged Sanders about his socialism during the Democratic debate, he relied purely on the label itself. Maher refused to be confined by labels and insisted on applying the same rigorous examination process to Sanders that he would have used had Hillary Clinton been sitting on that stage instead.\n\nThis is without question a good thing, regardless of one\u2019s opinions about Sanders himself. After all, our founding fathers had ideas that would probably be considered socialist today, the first Republican president once proclaimed that \u201clabor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration,\u201d and many of America\u2019s most important social and economic reforms were inspired by overseas examples by political and intellectual leaders who didn\u2019t pay attention to ideological categories. When potentially useful ideas are opposed simply because they can connected\u2014credibly or otherwise\u2014with a taboo designation like \u201csocialist,\u201d we not only stifle the free debate that is vital to our democratic way of life, but weaken our nation\u2019s ability to grow and change as the times demand.\n\nThat is why, in the end, we should be encouraged by the likely legacy that Sanders\u2019 campaign will have, regardless of whether he is ultimately nominated and elected. By virtue of being taken seriously, it\u2019s a sign that Americans may finally be ready to think about major issues in a way that doesn\u2019t require labels.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Good Men Project", "description": "Matthew Rozsa looks at why the word socialism is stigmatized in current politics and how that changes.", "title": "The Right (and Wrong) Way to Discuss Socialism -", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 588, "identifier": "http://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/socialism.jpg", "height": 350}, "updated_time": "2015-10-17T16:42:21-04:00", "url": "http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/removing-stigma-socialism-mrzs/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thegoodmenproject", "published_time": "2015-10-17T19:00:18-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/MatthewRozsa", "section": "Featured Content", "modified_time": "2015-10-17T16:42:21-04:00", "tag": "Hillary Clinton"}, "fb": {"admins": 1467427114, "app_id": 794063960644791}, "twitter": {"description": "Matthew Rozsa looks at why the word socialism is stigmatized in current politics and how that changes.", "creator": "@goodmenproject", "image": "http://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/socialism.jpg", "title": "The Right (and Wrong) Way to Discuss Socialism -", "site": "@goodmenproject", "card": "summary"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee88\"", "article_summary": "When Cooper challenged Sanders about his socialism during the Democratic debate, he relied purely on the label itself.\nAt the beginning of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, Anderson Cooper challenged Sen.
