The venerable video game turns 30 today on what fans celebrate annually as \u201cWorld Tetris Day,\u201d a testament to the human desire for order, at least one psychologist says.\n\nWith simple graphics from the dot-matrix era of computing, Tetris challenges the player to tessellate multi-shaped bricks falling steadily downward, forever risking the asymmetry of \u201cgame over.\u201d The vintage game tickles the brain\u2019s basic pleasure in solving mental problems such as those presented in this \u201cworld of perpetual uncompleted tasks,\u201d said Tom Stafford of the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom.\n\nEssentially, the game leverages the \"Zeigarnik effect\": The brain is most interested in unresolved problems. \u201cIt shows how our minds are organised around goals and that our memory is not just a filing system where information is passively stored, but it adjusts dynamically according to our purposes,\u201d he told The Courier. \u201cIt involves us in a compulsive loop of completing and generating new tasks and that keeps us endlessly playing.\u201d\n\nPast research on the subject shows that players solve the tasks in one of two ways. Whereas some rotate the shapes mentally to consider possible moves, most others click to rotate the shape visually for a comparison. But both methods seek to accomplish the same goal: laying multi-shaped objects onto a plane with no overlaps and no gaps.\n\n\u201cTetris is pure game: there is no benefit to it, nothing to learn, no social or physical consequence,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cIt is almost completely pointless, but keeps us coming back for more.\u201d\n\nTrue to its vintage appeal, the game originated in the former Soviet Union \u2014 with approval for export coming from the KGB. In a profile in The Guardian, programmer Alexey Pajitnov describes working for the Academy of Sciences of the USSR during that era, when he developed an interest in the rudimentary video games born early in the decade.\n\n\"I've loved puzzles ever since I was a child, especially pentominoes,\" he said. \"In June 1984, it occurred to me that they might be a good basis for a computer game.\"\n\nThirty years after its release, the simple game has found new life on smartphones around the world as a classic application in killing time.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tetris, world tetris day, tetris 30th birthday, tetris and 30, tetris and creating order, psychology of tetris", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The enduring popularity of Tetris on the video game's 30th birthday \u2014 dubbed World Tetris Day by supporters \u2014 testifies to the human desire for order, at least one psychologist says.", "title": "Why Tetris Endures After 30 Years, According To Psychology", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tetris-turns-30-psychologists-say-video-game-fulfills-our-desire-order-286918", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/psychology-tetris-explained-video-game-turns-30.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The enduring popularity of Tetris on the video game's 30th birthday \u2014 dubbed World Tetris Day by supporters \u2014 testifies to the human desire for order, at least one psychologist says.", "title": "Why Tetris Endures After 30 Years, According To Psychology", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tetris-turns-30-psychologists-say-video-game-fulfills-our-desire-order-286918", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/psychology-tetris-explained-video-game-turns-30.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/psychology-tetris-explained-video-game-turns-30.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-06T17:06:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T19:09:34-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The enduring popularity of Tetris on the video game's 30th birthday \u2014 dubbed World Tetris Day by supporters \u2014 testifies to the human desire for order, at least one psychologist says."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc960f\"", "article_summary": "The venerable video game turns 30 today on what fans celebrate annually as \u201cWorld Tetris Day,\u201d a testament to the human desire for order, at least one psychologist says.\nAt least one psychologist says the enduring popularity of Tetris, which turns 30 today, is testament to the human need for order.\n\u201cTetris is pure game: there is no benefit to it, nothing to learn, no social or physical consequence,\u201d Stafford said.\n\"In June 1984, it occurred to me that they might be a good basis for a computer game.\"\nThirty years after its release, the simple game has found new life on smartphones around the world as a classic application in killing time."}
