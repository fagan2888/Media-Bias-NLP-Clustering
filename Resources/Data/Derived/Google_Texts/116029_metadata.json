Now the situation has gotten even more interesting.\n\nBuzzFeed News has twice reported that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is planning to stop a shipment of sodium thiopental when it arrives from India. The drug, which Gov. Pete Ricketts (R\u2013Neb.) plans to use to execute 10 inmates, is banned in this country:\n\n\u201cPlease give me a call when you have time to discuss,\u201d Nebraska Corrections Director Scott Frakes recently wrote to the would-be supplier of the state\u2019s execution drugs. His email contained an attachment: a 2013 court ruling that spells out that the drugs the state spent more than $50,000 on would not be allowed into the United States. The drugs aren\u2019t approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and the court ruling that Frakes attached makes it clear that the FDA has no choice but to seize the drugs when they come to the states. The shipment, enough for hundreds of lethal injections, is expected to arrive any day now, according to public records and emails obtained by BuzzFeed News.\n\nAn FDA representative has already, according to the story, warned the state that \"there is no FDA approved application for sodium thiopental, and it is illegal to import an unapproved new drug into the United States.\" But Nebraska's chief executive says Nebraska isn't \"bound\" by the court decision requiring the FDA to seize all incoming shipments of the execution drug\u2014and that the legislature doesn't have the authority to change existing death row prisoners' sentences.\n\nThe conflict presents libertarian opponents of both capital punishment and big government, like me, with a conundrum: Should the FDA's smackdown of a decision by a duly elected executive about how to govern his state be welcomed or denounced?\n\nMy disdain for agents of a heavy-handed federal bureaucracy is strong, but so is my conviction that the death penalty has no place in America today. To the extent that there are conditions under whch government intervention is justified, halting a sadistic practice that has already led to the state-sanctioned taking of innocent human lives seems like a strong contender. But is it worth embracing a precedent of federal agencies' powers outweighing states' decision-making rights?\n\nThe good news is that the veto override in Nebraska suggests the tide is turning against capital punishment. As such, I'm hopeful we're heading for a time when executions are a thing of the past because the people in all 50 states demanded an end to them\u2014no federal intervention necessary.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "State and federal governments set to clash, according to a report from BuzzFeed News.", "title": "Drama as FDA Prepares to Confiscate Execution Drugs Headed for Nebraska", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/06/18/drama-as-fda-prepares-to-confiscate-exec", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14346521752303.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "State and federal governments set to clash, according to a report from BuzzFeed News.", "title": "Drama as FDA Prepares to Confiscate Execution Drugs Headed for Nebraska", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14346521752303.jpg", "creator": "@sladesr", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-06-18T21:45:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/stephanie-slade"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd32b7\"", "article_summary": "BuzzFeed News has twice reported that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is planning to stop a shipment of sodium thiopental when it arrives from India.\nThe good news is that the veto override in Nebraska suggests the tide is turning against capital punishment.\nBut is it worth embracing a precedent of federal agencies' powers outweighing states' decision-making rights?\nHis email contained an attachment: a 2013 court ruling that spells out that the drugs the state spent more than $50,000 on would not be allowed into the United States.\nThe drugs aren\u2019t approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and the court ruling that Frakes attached makes it clear that the FDA has no choice but to seize the drugs when they come to the states."}
