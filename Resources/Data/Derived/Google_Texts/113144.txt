Sullivan's biography says he's a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps Reserves, serving as executive officer of an anti-terrorism battalion. He just was recalled to active duty for a tour in Afghanistan, returning to Alaska a week ago then heading out to Japan, where he signed an agreement with one of the world's largest financiers of liquefied natural gas projects.
