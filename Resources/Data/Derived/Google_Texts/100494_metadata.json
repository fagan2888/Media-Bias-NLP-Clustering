The average family will save nearly $500 a year we were told. Some families will save in the neighborhood of $1,800!\n\nNow, those same families will see double digit hikes in their premium costs. According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, Minnesota\u2019s rates have now jumped from the lowest in 2015 to the highest in 2016.\n\nWhat does this mean locally? Comparing the average monthly premium for a gold plan in southeastern Minnesota from 2014 to 2016, a 25-year-old will pay $504 more \u2013 or a 16 percent increase. A 60-year-old will now pay $1,128 more a year, or a 13 percent jump in costs for the same coverage.\n\nNot to worry, says the Post Bulletin. That\u2019s what federal tax credits are for!\n\nOf course, that simply means forcing the hardworking taxpayers to pay even more to fund an unaffordable health insurance program. Yes, federal subsidies can bring down the cost of these plans, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves about where this money comes from.\n\nMeanwhile we continue to do nothing to address the skyrocketing cost of healthcare. If the rates rise, we\u2019ll raise the tax credits again. Insurance goes up, taxpayers pay more. Second verse, same as the first.\n\nWith its track record of failure and frustration, everything is not fine with MNsure and it\u2019s time we made a change. Along with paying for Obamacare at the federal level, Minnesota\u2019s taxpayers have also spent hundreds of millions more on this state exchange debacle. MNsure\u2019s dysfunction has led to higher administrative costs for insurance carriers, costs which are then passed on to their premium paying customers.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear, there\u2019s not a lawmaker in this state that does not support Minnesotans being able to acquire affordable health insurance. But the facts have shown that MNsure is the textbook definition of fiscal irresponsibility and we need to do something about it.\n\nLast year House Republicans passed legislation that would improve transparency and lower rates by increasing access and competition. Yet despite the fiscal estimate from the Dayton administration showing our plan would provide tremendous savings for Minnesota\u2019s taxpayers, Democrats refused to make the reforms necessary to improve the access and affordability of health insurance in Minnesota.\n\nMy hope is that MNsure shoppers will be able to find healthcare premiums that they can afford while still having continuity of care. But whether it\u2019s wasting $250 million on MNsure\u2019s failing website or pumping more federal tax dollars into Obamacare, we\u2019re proving that throwing money at a problem only prolongs that problem.\n\nFor those customers who utilize MNsure, and those taxpayers who are funding its existence, it\u2019s time to pursue some common sense financial reforms.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Caledonia Argus", "description": "Representative  Greg Davids  I was flabbergasted after reading a recent Rochester Post Bulletin editorial that basically insinuated everything continues to", "title": "Health Insurance customers and taxpayers losing money with  MNSURE\u2019S premium hikes", "url": "http://ecmpublishers.com/2015/10/13/health-insurance-customers-and-taxpayers-losing-money-with-mnsures-premium-hikes/", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 104657219569742}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width, height=device-height, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe017b\"", "article_summary": "Let\u2019s be clear, there\u2019s not a lawmaker in this state that does not support Minnesotans being able to acquire affordable health insurance.\nNow, those same families will see double digit hikes in their premium costs.\nOf course, that simply means forcing the hardworking taxpayers to pay even more to fund an unaffordable health insurance program.\nMNsure\u2019s dysfunction has led to higher administrative costs for insurance carriers, costs which are then passed on to their premium paying customers.\nBut whether it\u2019s wasting $250 million on MNsure\u2019s failing website or pumping more federal tax dollars into Obamacare, we\u2019re proving that throwing money at a problem only prolongs that problem."}
