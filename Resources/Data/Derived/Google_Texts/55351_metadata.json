But it hasn\u2019t been easy. I have been barraged by readers and media about questions of how and why Casey Kasem can be denied tube feeding.\n\nThis can be a delicate and highly nuanced matter, dependent on the fact circumstances of each situation. Moreover, I don\u2019t want to comment on his particular case because I don\u2019t know all the facts. Pay attention to the italicized part of the CNN story I quote below:\n\nHe\u2019s suffering from dementia and bedsores, and his body is shutting down at a hospital in Washington state, court documents say. On Wednesday, a Los Angeles County judge gave daughter Kerri Kasem the authority to have doctors end his infusions of water, food and medicine. The ruling reinstates the 82-year-old\u2019s end-of-life health directive . Kasem doctor concluded that continuing the artificial nutrition and hydration would only \u201cat best prolong the dying process for him and will certainly add suffering to an already terribly uncomfortable dying process,\u201d said Kerri Kasem\u2019s lawyer, Troy Martin.\n\nThe key factual and ethical question here is whether his body is shutting down as part of the natural dying process. In that situation, people often stop eating and drinking spontaneously. In such cases, it can be medically inappropriate to force sustenance into a body that can\u2019t process it. Not knowing about Kasem\u2019s individual circumstance, I will not opine about his particular case.\n\nSecond, if Kasem\u2019s advance directive said he did not want tube-supplied food and water under these circumstances\u2013whatever we each might think of the morality of that\u2013he had the legal right to so instruct because tube-feeding is considered a medical treatment.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the broader issue. There has been increasing advocacy of late to deny tube supplied\u2013or, as I have recently noted, even spoon feeding\u2013to Alzheimer\u2019s patients who can process sustenance. What about them?\n\nMany bioethicists, and some doctors who treat Alzheimer\u2019s patients, increasingly argue that these patients should be denied sustenance as a matter of supporting their best interests. I am not referring to decisions made in accordance with an advance directive, but to the increasing assertion that the standard of care should be to deny feeding tubes. From the position paper of the American Geriatric Society:\n\nPercutaneous feeding tubes are not recommended for older adults with advanced dementia. Careful hand-feeding should be offered for persons with advanced dementia, hand feeding is at least as good as tube-feeding for the outcomes of death, aspiration pneumonia, functional status and patient comfort. Tube feeding is associated with agitation, increased use of physical and chemical restraints, and worsening pressure ulcers. Rationale: The current scientific evidence suggests that the potential benefits of tube feeding do not outweigh substantial associated treatment burdens in person with advanced dementia.\n\nRecommendations are one thing. Labeling feeding tubes in late-stage Alzheimer\u2019s patients as \u201cinappropriate care\u201d to allow bioethics committees to impose the death decision under a \u201cfutile care\u201d protocol is another. And that is where I think we are headed\u2013just as we are in patients with long-term diagnosed persistent unconsciousness.\n\nSo, I can\u2019t say whether Kasem is a new Terri Schiavo\u2013because her tube feeding was clearly medically appropriate as she was not otherwise dying. Thus the question in her case involved \u201cquality of life\u201d and egregious conflicts of interest on the part of Terri\u2019s husband.\n\nIn contrast, I can say that Alzheimer\u2019s patients generally are being looked upon increasingly as people who should not be sustained nutritionally after a certain point, even if that is what the patient or family wants . Also, under Obamacare\u2019s eventual cost/benefit protocols, I believe a time will come in which sustaining such patients will not be a covered procedure. Ditto, people with long-term profound cognitive disability.\n\nBottom line: Alzheimer\u2019s patients in all fifty states who can process food and water are denied medically supplied food and water. Such decisions are legal and deemed \u201cethical\u201d by many, an opinion with which I dissent.\n\nPost Script: Kasem died shortly after the court ruling described above.
