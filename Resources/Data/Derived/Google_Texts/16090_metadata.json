(AP) - Franklin-based Community Health Systems is bringing back-office jobs from across the country to a new Nashville office.\n\nThe health care giant announced Thursday that it will build a 240,000-square-foot office in the south Nashville neighborhood of Antioch at an estimated cost of $66 million. More than 2,000 jobs will move to Davidson County.\n\nThe firm had considered building in neighboring Williamson County, where its corporate headquarters is located. Franklin Republican state Rep. Jeremy Durham said Thursday he believes the decision to locate in Nashville instead was retribution for Williamson County lawmakers\u2019 opposition to Insure Tennessee, Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s proposal to expand Medicaid.\n\nCommunity Health Systems Chairman and CEO Wayne Smith said he met with many lawmakers to ask them to support expanded Medicaid but the decision to move to Davidson County was \u201cbased on business, nothing else, not politics.\u201d Considerations included the cost of land, opportunities for expansion and economic incentives, he said.\n\nDurham said \u201cthere was never a quid-pro-quo discussed\u201d at a January meeting with Smith, but Durham heard rumors at the time that the new office would move elsewhere if Williamson lawmakers did not support Community Health Systems\u2019 position. Those rumors later came to pass.\n\nDurham was a lead sponsor of last year\u2019s legislation dubbed the \u201cStop Obamacare Act\u201d to require Haslam to seek legislative approval to expand Medicaid in Tennessee.\n\nSmith said on Thursday that the company is moving its back-office functions like accounting and internet technology from hospitals in 29 states to the new Nashville office. He said he doesn\u2019t know how many current workers will chose to move to Tennessee, but he expects the company will hire a number of new people.\n\nNashville Mayor Karl Dean said the city is offering tax incentives that will amount to something like $8 million over 12 years. Tennessee Economic and Community Development Commissioner Randy Boyd said the state is still negotiating possible incentives with Community Health Systems that include job training and infrastructure improvements.\n\n___\n\nErik Schelzig contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Franklin-based Community Health Systems is bringing back-office jobs from across the country to a new Nashville office.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/14/haslam-to-announce-significant-economic-developmen/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Franklin-based Community Health Systems is bringing back-office jobs from across the country to a new Nashville office.", "title": "Community Health Systems to open new office in Nashville"}, "twitter": {"description": "Franklin-based Community Health Systems is bringing back-office jobs from across the country to a new Nashville office.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Community Health Systems to open new office in Nashville"}, "Author": "TRAVIS LOLLER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca2e6\"", "article_summary": "NASHVILLE, Tenn.
