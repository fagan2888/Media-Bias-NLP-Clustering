It is, for now, at the risk of losing 1 percent of its Medicare funding, a penalty that will extend Oct. 1 through Sept. 30, 2015. On a scale of 1 to 10, with larger numbers indicating the greater level of risk for \u201chospital acquired-conditions,\u201d Saint Vincent scored a 10.\n\nAllegheny Health Network is the 1-year-old hospital system that Pittsburgh\u2019s Highmark Health owns.\n\nHospitals appearing on the preliminary penalty list, which was issued this spring, have a chance to improve their infection rates before the final penalty list is issued later this year. In its first years, the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program measures bloodstream infections at catheter sites and urinary tract catheter infections, as well as avoidable injuries and infections such as bedsores and fractures.\n\n\u201cSaint Vincent has improved its performance significantly since the time period reflected in the report,\u201d AHN spokesman Dan Laurent said. \u201cOur internal projection, due to those improvements, is that we will not incur the HAC penalty for the current CMS year and believe we will be even less at risk for the penalty in the [next] fiscal year.\u201d\n\nThe penalty system, which will amount to about $330 million in withheld payments for the upcoming federal fiscal year across the country, is meant to force health care providers to confront hospital-acquired infection rates.\n\nThe rates have been falling for years, but the federal Affordable Care Act considers them still too high. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 25 inpatients on any given day, about 4 percent, \u201cis battling an infection picked up in a hospital or other health care facility,\u201d according to a new CDC survey.\n\nThat\u2019s about 600,000 hospital patients each year, which is well less than the 1.7 million-a-year estimate that prevailed through the 1990s and the 2.1 million annual figure that was the 1970s estimate.\n\nHospitals are duty-bound to continue the battle against hospital-associated infections and complications, said UPMC\u2019s chief quality officer, Tami Minnier, but a system that punishes a specific percentage of hospitals each year is an arbitrary and unfair one, she said. For example, hospitals that end up in the bottom quartile of performers in consecutive years but make improvements every year aren\u2019t rewarded for that improvement.\n\nSince Medicare tabulates the infection data using the hospitals\u2019 own billing data, those that are most diligent about self-reporting are likely to have higher rates, hospitals say.\n\n\u201cWhenever we start to use billing data [to] describe patient outcomes, it\u2019s not the right approach,\u201d Ms. Minnier said.\n\nMs. Minnier also said big teaching hospitals and hospitals in urban or high-poverty areas have built-in challenges that can cause higher infection rates. It\u2019s an argument that\u2019s also being made in Washington, D.C. \u2014 a bill now under consideration in the Senate would change Medicare\u2019s Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program so hospitals treating large low-income populations aren\u2019t unfairly penalized.\n\nMedicare is trying to adjust for those environmental factors by noting the size and location of a hospital and its medical school affiliation before assessing a final infection and injury grade. Still, the line separating the \u201cpassing\u201d hospitals from the \u201cfailing\u201d hospitals is not only arbitrary, but it\u2019s also razor-thin.\n\n\u201cNone of these are big event numbers,\u201d Ms. Minnier said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking in the hundreds; we\u2019re talking in the tens. [Fewer] than 10 cases could bump\u201d a hospital from the passing column to the penalty list and could result in that hospital losing 1 percent of its Medicare funding for the year.\n\nGiven that Medicare often accounts for 40 percent or more of a hospital\u2019s total patient revenue, 1 percent could equal hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars a year, in lost money for a hospital with hundreds of beds.\n\nStill, with this public policy experiment, Medicare \u201cis trying to introduce quality into the mixture,\u201d said Trish Perl, senior epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Health System. It\u2019s reasonable for Medicare and the public \u201cto expect some kind of accountability\u201d from its hospitals.\n\nDr. Perl, like others, said Medicare must calibrate its incentives and punishments in order to make sure hospitals don\u2019t \u201cend up robbing Peter to pay Paul.\u201d Cutting hundreds of thousands out of a hospital\u2019s budget could mean the possibility of losing several nurses, which could have the unintended effect of diminishing the quality of care rather than improving it.\n\nBy and large, hospitals have been dramatically improving in-house infection rates for decades.\n\n\u201cThings are much better. We\u2019re even impressed with how far we\u2019ve been able to come, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t places to go.\u201d\n\nHAC is the third prong in Medicare\u2019s new pay-for-performance incentive system, which is meant to reward quality of care rather than quantity of care. The first prong punishes hospitals with high readmission rates, and the second rewards hospitals for hitting certain quality benchmarks.\n\nBill Toland: btoland@post-gazette.com or 412-263-2625.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several risk Medicare financially punishing them for having greater-than-usual hospital-acquired infection and injury rates.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Several Pittsburgh-area hospitals are among the more than 750 nationwide at risk of being financially punished by Medicare for having greater-than-usual hospital-acquired infection and injury rates.
