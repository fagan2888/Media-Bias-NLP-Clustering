Wikimedia / CC BY 2.5\n\nFlorida scientists are sending out warnings about a particular caterpillar known as a puss caterpillar, noting that these little critters might appear cute and fuzzy, but in reality are quite dangerous to the human touch.\n\nUnderneath the fluff that makes the caterpillar resemble a cute crawling cotton ball, puss caterpillars have bristles that can break off onto human skin and cause \u201cinstant, immediate, and intense\u201d pain, according to doctors. The bristles can lead to a skin reaction, which could ultimately turn into vomiting, fever, convulsions, and a drop in blood pressure. Depending on the person, the reaction could be anything from an annoying itching sensation to a serious reaction requiring medical care. It\u2019s possible that the caterpillar\u2019s sting could be worse than that of a scorpion, jellyfish, or bee when it comes to pain. The puss caterpillar can be found in elm, oak, and sycamore trees in Florida.\n\nAccording to doctors at the Poison Center in Tampa, children need to be educated about the caterpillar\u2019s dangers. Because of the caterpillar\u2019s innocent appearance, many children are tricked into wanting to pet them. If you\u2019re stung by one of these little critters, cover the skin with scotch tape to pull out the spines, unless the reaction is bad enough to warrant a trip to the hospital. Ice can help soothe the area and reduce swelling and stinging. Afterward, a paste of baking soda and water over the area will help.\n\nAlso known as the Megalopyge opercularis, the puss caterpillar is sometimes referred to as the southern flannel moth, the pussy moth, tree asp, or asp caterpillar.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "puss caterpillar, pussy moth, asp caterpillar", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This caterpillar might be cute and fuzzy and resemble a cotton ball, but it can cause a severely painful skin rash.", "title": "Beware Of 'Puss Caterpillars': Cute, Fuzzy, And Poisonous", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/puss-caterpillars-are-cute-and-fuzzy-theyre-also-poisonous-florida-scientists-warn-their-302318", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/puss-caterpillar.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This caterpillar might be cute and fuzzy and resemble a cotton ball, but it can cause a severely painful skin rash.", "title": "Beware Of 'Puss Caterpillars': Cute, Fuzzy, And Poisonous", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/puss-caterpillars-are-cute-and-fuzzy-theyre-also-poisonous-florida-scientists-warn-their-302318", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/puss-caterpillar.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/puss-caterpillar.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-10T11:45:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-10T11:45:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This caterpillar might be cute and fuzzy and resemble a cotton ball, but it can cause a severely painful skin rash."}, "article_summary": "The puss caterpillar, also referred to as the pussy moth or the asp caterpillar, might look cute and fuzzy, but in reality contains venomous bristles that burn the skin.\nAlso known as the Megalopyge opercularis, the puss caterpillar is sometimes referred to as the southern flannel moth, the pussy moth, tree asp, or asp caterpillar.\nThe puss caterpillar can be found in elm, oak, and sycamore trees in Florida.\nWikimedia / CC BY 2.5Florida scientists are sending out warnings about a particular caterpillar known as a puss caterpillar, noting that these little critters might appear cute and fuzzy, but in reality are quite dangerous to the human touch.\nThe bristles can lead to a skin reaction, which could ultimately turn into vomiting, fever, convulsions, and a drop in blood pressure."}
