Souki called on the House of Representatives to \u201cget down to work in workman-like fashion\u201d and focus on the tasks that will enable government to run more efficiently while allowing Hawai\u2018i\u2019s families to pursue their dreams.\n\n\u201cLast year, I asked you to be bold in tackling some very difficult issues, and you answered the call by increasing minimum wage, restructuring HCDA, and taking care of the state\u2019s unfunded liabilities,\u201d Souki said of the prior year\u2019s legislative session. \u201cBut that was yesterday and yesterday\u2019s achievements. This morning, we must begin to take care of today\u2019s business with the same determination and boldness.\u201d\n\nIn other remarks, Souki acknowledged that O\u2018ahu\u2019s rail system will facilitate growth near its transit stations, but also expressed resignation at the city\u2019s proposal to raise the general income tax for the rail: \u201cWe will be holding the city\u2019s feet to the fire and closely scrutinizing its request to extend the GET tax on rail.\u201d\n\nThe House speaker also pointed out healthcare issues that needed addressing, including the Hawai\u2018i Health Connector, Hawai\u2018i\u2019s portal to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Souki asked the House to draft legislation to help the state\u2019s public hospital engage in private-public partnerships to deal with mounting debts. He said such partnerships could improve healthcare on Maui while saving taxpayers significant sums of money.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt behooves us to study this opportunity carefully and look at legislation for this and other potential partnerships,\u201d Souki said.\n\nIn addition, Souki called on lawmakers to create a statewide medical marijuana dispensary system. Although Hawai\u2018i legalized the growth, possession, and use of marijuana for prescribed medicinal purposes in 2000, no practical method of acquiring it was put into action. A task force created by the Legislature last year recently suggested dispensaries to address this issue.\n\n\u201cWe must also ensure the well-being of those who have unique health issues and who require a little more compassion from us,\u201d Souki said. \u201cI am speaking of those who need better access to medical marijuana. Yes, it is legal in Hawa\u2018ii. But there is no legal access to it. The time has come to fix this contradiction.\u201d\n\nSouki also asked House members to consider moving the O\u2018ahu Community Correction Center to Halawa by leasing the Kalihi parcel and putting the funds toward a new prison or adding to the current one in Halawa.", "article_metadata": {"expires": 0, "description": "During his opening remarks to the Legislature, Speaker Joseph M.
