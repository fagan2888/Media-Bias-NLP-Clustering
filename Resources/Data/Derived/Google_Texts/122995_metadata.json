She hopes the campaign will help people make informed choices when they eat out.\n\n\u201cIf you're going to a restaurant, and you'd like to eat light, you know at Live Well restaurants that they're doing these types of things,\u201d she said.\n\nPittsburgh restaurant group big Burrito, which owns Mad Mex, Casbah, Kaya, Soba, Eleven and Umi, recently joined the campaign, a move that she said reflects a cultural shift around healthy eating. The campaign, launched in October, includes 23 restaurants, she said. They are listed at livewellallegheny.com.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that restaurants said people didn't want this. \u2026 I think that is changing,\u201d Hacker said.\n\nThe campaign, which is voluntary, coincides with broader regulatory efforts promoting healthier eating at a time when more than a third of Americans are obese. Restaurant chains and other establishments with 20 or more locations need to include calorie counts on menus by the end of the year to comply with a rule in the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nStudies have shown that displaying calorie counts on menus doesn't significantly reduce how many calories people consume, but restaurants that display calorie counts tend to serve lower-calorie items.\n\nTo qualify for the Live Well campaign, restaurants need to eliminate cholesterol-raising trans fats, ban smoking and meet four other criteria from a list of options on the campaign's website. Options include listing calorie counts and nutrition facts, offering half-portions, offering healthy side dishes such as fruits and vegetables, offering brown rice and whole grain bread and providing locations to store bicycles at or near restaurants.\n\nBig Burrito restaurants were meeting many of the criteria, making joining the campaign an easy decision, said Bill Fuller, the group's corporate chef.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018well, we do this' \u2014 helping our customers who are trying to take care of themselves take care of themselves,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nMad Mex, which Fuller said will soon open its 14th location near Canonsburg, includes a link to calorie counts beneath a list of menu items on its website. Fuller doesn't expect to list calorie counts for menus at the other restaurants, which serve more varied and complex dishes.\n\nAll the restaurants can accommodate diners' preferences, he said, including substituting vegetables for heavier sides and reducing calories in other ways.\n\nFuller and Hacker encouraged diners to speak up and ask about options at Live Well restaurants.\n\n\u201cWe want to make people happy. And if we can't do something, we'll say we can't,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nWes Venteinher is a Tribune-Review staff writer.
