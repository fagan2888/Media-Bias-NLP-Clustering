DEADLY CRASHES\n\nBronx, Glasgow and Alaska: The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating yesterday's passenger train derailment in the Bronx. Four people were killed and at least 67 others were injured when the Metro-North Hudson Line train jumped the tracks near the Harlem River.\n\nPolice in Scotland are going to need several days to clear the wreckage of a helicopter that slammed into a busy Glasgow pub. About 150 people were inside the pub when the chopper crashed Saturday night. At least nine people are dead, and there's still plenty of debris for search teams to pick through.\n\nIt's so horrible reading about the deaths from the Glasgow helicopter crash. Truly an horrific event. \u2014 emma_clb (@emma_CLB) December 2, 2013\n\nA woman's heroic effort probably saved lives after a small plane went down in an extremely remote part of Alaska. Four people died in the accident, including her 5-month-old baby, who Melanie Coffee tended to while hiking half a mile out of the dark, foggy wilderness to meet rescuers and then lead them back to the crash site. Five others also survived the accident. They had head injuries and multiple broken bones.\n\nMother treks through foggy Alaska night to guide rescuers to plane crash http://t.co/110ikT7hFq via @wordpressdotcom \u2014 Limo4washingtondc (@Limo4dc) December 2, 2013\n\nAlexandria Field reports from New York. Matthew Chance is in Scotland.\n\n2. OBAMACARE\n\nBetter, but not perfect: Let's face it, the HealthCare.gov website was a mess on day one, and even day 15 for that matter. But how's it doing now - two months after the fact? The Obama administration says there's a \"night and day\" difference. The Obamacare sign-up website can now handle 50,000 users at one time and 800,000 over the course of a day. Those were two key goals when the site launched on October 1. There are still plenty of bugs to fix, officials admit, but they're happy with the progress.\n\nAnd this was kind of embarrassing. One of those notorious website glitches showed up yesterday morning, when the \"New Day\" weekend team put the website to the test.\n\nCNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta and Elizabeth Cohen check in with their prognosis of the Affordable Care Act website.\n\n3. PROTESTS\n\nTensions in Ukraine and Thailand: Protesters in the Ukraine are calling for a revolution. They're less than pleased with President Viktor Yanukovych's decision not to sign a landmark trade deal with the European Union. Estimates put the crowd at yesterday's demonstration in Kiev's Independence Square at 100,000. At one point, someone used a front-end loader to bust through police lines.\n\nOh Kiev, you had me at \"revolutionary tractor.\" pic.twitter.com/QDbxE60Kdi \u2014 Anonymous (@AnonyPress) December 2, 2013\n\nYanukovych is in a tight spot. He is under severe economic pressure from Russia not to join the EU, and there's a key EU demand that he was unwilling to meet: freeing former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, his bitter political opponent. This could get a lot uglier. Protesters are flooding in from the countryside, and the government says it won't back down.\n\nIt's a similar story in Thailand, where anti-government protests turned violent over the weekend. Yesterday, the protest leader urged Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to resign. He says she has two days to \"return power to the people.\" Today, Yingluck called for talks. Stay tuned.\n\nMichaela Pereira brings us news headlines throughout the morning.\n\n4. PAUL WALKER\n\nMourning \"Fast & Furious\" star: Legions of fans fondly remember \"Fast & Furious\" star Paul Walker after the actor died in a fiery crash over the weekend. The 2005 Porsche Carrera GT he was riding in slammed into a light pole and burst into flames about 30 miles north of Hollywood, killing Walker and the driver. Both men had just left a holiday toy drive.\n\nHard watching Fast and Furious movies knowing that Paul Walker isn't going to be in them anymore .. \u2014 \u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u062f\u0645 \u0641\u0632\u0627\u0644.. (@DeanoFazal) December 2, 2013\n\nNischelle Turner joins \"New Day\" at 6 with the latest in the investigation.\n\n5. CYBER MONDAY\n\nDigital dilemma: To work or cyber shop, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous discounts, or to take arms against a sea of Internet traffic ... yada, yada, yada. While it pales in comparison to Black Friday, Cyber Monday is still a big deal. Folks who keep track of such things say total sales today through retail websites could hit $2 billion. And one other thing: Cyber Monday really isn't. It's more like Cyber Week. You know what you need to do, now get in front of that computer screen and do it.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gbonewiggins/status/407343858327257088\n\n#CyberMonday: where no one gets killed at a store \u2014 Sean Davis (@SeandreThaGiant) December 2, 2013\n\nChristine Romans brings us the Cyber Monday forecast and recaps Black Friday.\n\nThose are your five biggies for the day. Here are a few others that are brewing and have the Internet buzzing.\n\n- Letter to Santa: We think this kid automatically qualifies for the nice list with this super-cute effort. Instead of simply asking for a Morphibian radio-controlled Killer Whale, this tyke wrote out the entire Web address - all 179 characters - so Santa could just click on the Crayon link.\n\n- Amazon drones: Say what you will about Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, but he sure does dream big. In the next four to five years, the giant retailer wants to offer a service called Prime Air, which would use drones to make deliveries in 30 minutes. They pretty much look like toy helicopters and could carry things that weigh up to 5 pounds. That's 90% of what the company sells.\n\n- Stay classy, North Dakota: Hmmm, do you suppose a new \"Anchorman\" movie is coming out anytime soon? Will Ferrell's Ron Burgundy character showed up in the frozen north over the weekend to anchor KX News. It's made with bits of news, so you know it's good.\n\n- Why does the fox jump? We already know what the fox says. So, why does he jump? That's been the great unanswered question, until now.\n\n- Nice ride: Why is that cop pulling you over? When you own a 1996 Toyota T100, it's because you're speeding. When it's a $100,000 Mercedes G55 AMG, it's because he likes your sweet wheels.\n\nThere you go. All you need to know to get an early start to your morning.\n\nBe sure to tune in to \"New Day\" from 6 to 9 a.m. ET.
