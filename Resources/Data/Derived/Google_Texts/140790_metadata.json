What does this dynamic mean? Simply put, any preparation that companies have done to avoid the Cadillac tax will continue to help them through the coming period of legislative uncertainty and change. That\u2019s good news!\n\nSince 1999, health insurance premiums have risen, on average, by 203 percent, and workers\u2019 share of premium costs have increased even more, at 221 percent. Over the same period, inflation has risen by just 42 percent and worker wages have increased by 56 percent. So while our actual earnings have gone up a modest 14 percent (less than 1 percent per year), an employee\u2019s share of health insurance premiums has outstripped our income increases by 165 percent Furthermore, after modest increases of 2 percent to 3 percent for the past several years, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that health premium costs rose at 5.3 percent in 2015.\n\nPart 3: How to Look Ahead with Pragmatism One of the unexpected thrills of working in the benefits business is getting to solve big challenges and getting to do it for real people\u2014your employees, to be exact. There is possibly no bigger challenge facing our industry than bending the benefits cost curve while maintaining or even increasing quality. It\u2019s a huge issue\u2014so much so that the Affordable Care Act has nearly 1,000 pages devoted to it.\n\nEstablishing the value of an HDHP with an HSA First, the bad news: the rise in HDHP adoption has also led to a great deal of anxiety around employees confronting unexpected costs and/or forgoing treatment because of an inability to pay first-dollar costs out of their own pockets. The good news is that a health savings account can help alleviate these concerns. When employers provide a sizable (and tax-deductible) contribution to an employee\u2019s HSA, it can provide employees with first-dollar expense coverage and, over time, help them to build a healthcare nest egg so that they\u2019re truly prepared for the unexpected if and when it occurs.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Shandon Fowler", "description": "Beyond giving employers more time, what does the Cadillac tax delay really mean for employers and employees?
