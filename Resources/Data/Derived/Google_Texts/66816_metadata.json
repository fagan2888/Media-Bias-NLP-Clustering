The state efforts are apparently connected to a network with the Christian advocacy group Focus on the Family at its core.\n\n\u201cWe are really seeing this dovetailing with LGBT people across the country gaining greater rights,\u201d said Eunice Rho, advocacy and policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes these bills. \u201cWe are now seeing this reaction where people are claiming based on religious belief that there should be special authorization to break laws or have new rights.\u201d\n\nThe Kansas bill, said Thomas Witt, executive director of the LGBT rights group Equality Kansas, is based on widely circulated \u201chorror stories about lawsuits over wedding cakes.\u201d He was referring to cases, such as one decided by the New Mexico Supreme Court last year, stemming from business-owner refusals to serve gay or lesbian customers.\n\nIn the New Mexico case, a photographer refused to provide services for a lesbian commitment ceremony. The couple sued under the state\u2019s anti-discrimination law and won, because New Mexico prohibits discrimination in public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\nKansas, Witt noted, does not outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Thus, \u201cwe have no legal recourse,\u201d unlike the couple in New Mexico. \u201dPeople already have the right to turn us away,\u201d he said.\n\nBut conservative legislators are also reacting to the possibility of same-sex marriage bans being struck down, as federal cases decided in Utah and Oklahoma move through the courts \u2014 and Witt said the Kansas bill would give government employees the right to refuse service even if same-sex marriage were legal in the state.\n\nThe Kansas Family Policy Council, a Christian conservative group in favor of the bill, said in an alert to its members that the bill \u201cwould extend important legal protections to individuals, business owners and religious institutions when it comes to their rights to stand on their religious views when declining to participate in and celebrate homosexual \u2018weddings.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn testimony supporting HB 2453, Robert Noland, executive director of the Kansas Family Policy Council, said, \u201cThe relatively recent developments in the area of homosexual marriage (the past 12 years or so) have quite literally turned thousands of years of religious and social mores on their heads.\u201d\n\nHe did not respond to a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In response to legalization of same-sex marriage, many states aim to broaden exemptions for providing services", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/7/wave-of-new-statebillsreligiousfreedomorlicensetodiscriminate.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/2/7/wave-of-new-statebillsreligiousfreedomorlicensetodiscriminate/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.Religious_Freedom.1391810712695.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "In response to legalization of same-sex marriage, many states aim to broaden exemptions for providing services", "title": "Wave of new state bills: Religious freedom or license to discriminate?"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/2/7/wave-of-new-statebillsreligiousfreedomorlicensetodiscriminate/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.Religious_Freedom.1391810712695.jpg", "description": "In response to legalization of same-sex marriage, many states aim to broaden exemptions for providing services", "card": "summary", "title": "Wave of new state bills: Religious freedom or license to discriminate?"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Gay Rights, Religion, Spirituality & Ethics, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Kansas, Witt noted, does not outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\nThe Kansas measure is an extreme permutation of a wave of new bills in state legislatures that purport to bolster religious freedom, but that opponents say constitute a troubling new trend to craft a license to discriminate based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and marital or family status.\nThe state efforts are apparently connected to a network with the Christian advocacy group Focus on the Family at its core.\nThe couple sued under the state\u2019s anti-discrimination law and won, because New Mexico prohibits discrimination in public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation.\nIn the New Mexico case, a photographer refused to provide services for a lesbian commitment ceremony."}
