I'm getting my girl fix. It's really rewarding. The girls come in and you just see their eyes light up.\u201d\n\nRockwell remembers a father one year who had tears in his eyes. He was out of work and said he would have been unable to let his daughter go to the prom without the help of the Cinderella Project.\n\n\u201cIt really touches your heart,\u201d Rockwell said. \u201cIt's something I hope I'm involved with for years to come.\u201d\n\nShe said each year the project provides about 85 to 120 girls with prom dresses and accessories. On the days the girls choose their dresses, volunteers provide assistance and seamstresses are available to handle minor fixes.\n\nThe volunteers, along with businesses and groups that donate space, make it all happen, Rockwell said.\n\n\u201cWe're really, really thankful for the people in the community stepping up and helping with things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's key to us being successful with the girls.\u201d\n\nThe Cinderella Project accepts donations of prom-style dresses and accessories, including shoes, purses and costume jewelry in excellent condition and contemporary styles. Donations are being accepted at any Pasco County high school. Cash donations to the Cinderella Project are used to buy new dresses and shoes when sizes are not available in the donated inventory.\n\nFor information or to make a donation, call (727) 463-4306 (727) 463-4306 or (630) 338-3681 (630) 338-3681.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 15 Mar 2014 17:33:32 -0400", "Description": "Pasco County high school girls who have no budget for prom once again can receive fashion assistance from some real fairy godmothers as the Cinderella Project returns for its 10th year, providing new", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Pasco County high school girls who have no budget for prom once again can receive fashion assistance from some real fairy godmothers as the Cinderella Project returns for its 10th year, providing new", "title": "Cinderella Project helps girls' prom dreams come true", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pasco-county/cinderella-project-helps-girls-prom-dreams-come-true-20140315/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140315/ARTICLE/140319393/EP/1/4/EP-140319393.jpg", "height": 427}, "updated_time": "2014-03-15T18:07:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Pasco County high school girls who have no budget for prom once again can receive fashion assistance from some real fairy godmothers as the Cinderella Project returns for its 10th year, providing n", "title": "Cinderella Project helps girls' prom dreams come true", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140315/ARTICLE/140319393/AR/0/AR-140319393.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-03-15T17:33:32Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-03-15T18:07:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Cinderella Project,high school,Pasco,prom"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca04f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe're really, really thankful for the people in the community stepping up and helping with things like that,\u201d she said.\nRockwell has been involved with the Cinderella Project as a volunteer for three years before taking on organizational duties this year.\nCash donations to the Cinderella Project are used to buy new dresses and shoes when sizes are not available in the donated inventory.\nHe was out of work and said he would have been unable to let his daughter go to the prom without the help of the Cinderella Project.\n\u201cIt's something I hope I'm involved with for years to come.\u201dShe said each year the project provides about 85 to 120 girls with prom dresses and accessories."}
