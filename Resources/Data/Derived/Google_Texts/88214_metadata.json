You know the type: The friend, acquaintance or relative you start out welcoming and wind up ruing. They turn your household upside down and inside out with their high maintenance idiosyncrasies and \u2014 if you are especially unlucky \u2014 their aversion toward leaving.\n\nAs a student in the 1960s, Kraft embodied one of the most vivid of this sort of household interloper, stepping into the expensive slippers of Sheridan Whiteside for a production of Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman's wild 1940 comedy, \"The Man Who Came to Dinner.\" After playing Sheridan as a young man, Kraft returns to the now age-appropriate role, starring in the Theatre of Western Springs production opening April 16.\n\n\"Sheridan is someone you love to have a love/hate relationship with,\" say Kraft of the chaos-inducing, larger-than-life radio star at the heart of the drama. \"The tricky thing is making this outrageously demanding fellow somebody the audience really likes. Sheridan is incredibly magnetic and charismatic. But he can use that power for good or for evil. \"\n\n\"Evil\" might be a bit strong. At his worst, Sheridan is a classic diva. As he recoups from a broken hip at the Masalia, Ohio home of the staunchly Midwestern Stanley family, Sheridan requires an entourage of secretaries, butlers, manservants and managers. He draws a non-stop parade of autograph hounds and aspiring Hollywood players to the household. He runs up the phone bill to astronomical heights, presumably hogs the bathroom and is the recipient of an endless stream of package deliveries \u2014 a cockroach farm, several penguins, a few octopi and a mummy among them. Wheelchair-bound, tyrannical and hilariously manipulative, Sheridan's ceaseless demands set the stage for a high-octane screwball comedy.\n\nWhile Sheridan may be the epicenter of the shenanigans on stage, the 22-member cast is packed with indelible comic personalities based on showbiz luminaries including Harpo Marx, Noel Coward and Cole Porter. References to 1940s-era pop culture fly fast and furious. The breakneck pace of the show provides one of the biggest challenges facing director Tripp Burton of Darien.\n\n\"It's all about the timing,\" says Burton. \"Kaufman and Hart write everything so exactly. There's not a wasted word. If you're not meticulous in every last pause and sentence, the whole thing falls apart. \"\n\n\"Zaniness is hard,\" notes Hinsdale's George Dempsey, who plays a doctor inveigling Sheridan to read his novel. \"This is one of those shows that is so nutty, you can't afford to goof off at all. Precision is crucial.\"\n\nKraft brings singular experience to the show's ringmaster of nuttiness. A Bellwood native and a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, his professional career started in the late 1960s when he toured opposite 1930s screen siren Dorothy Lamour in \"Hello Dolly.\" He spent most of his career in L.A., occasionally landing work in TV or film. \"But the cold hard fact is, only one-fifth of one percent of (Screen Actors Guild) members can actually make a living on screen,\" he notes. When a romance turned sour several years ago, he decided to move back to the Midwest.\n\n\"I had $14 in my pocket when I got here,\" he recalls. He also had his lifelong love of the theater. He joined the Theatre of Western Springs, and gleefully made his debut in 2001's \"The Quick Change Room\" and went on to roles in \"Slaughterhouse Five,\" \"Sly Fox,\" \"Unnecessary Farce\", and \"George Washington Slept Here.\" By day, Kraft works as something of an insurance whisperer, helping people who need insurance navigate the Affordable Care Act application process.\n\nReturning to Sheridan Whiteside is a prospect Kraft relishes. \"I definitely think I'll be better this time around. I've got way more life experience. I'm the right age.\" He's also buffer. \"People think it's easy, being in a wheelchair for the whole show,\" says Kraft, \"but I'll tell you, pushing yourself around just with your arms is a workout. I think I've gained several inches of muscle since we started.\"\n\n'The Man Who Came to Dinner'\n\nApril 16\u201326\n\n$18-$20\n\nTheatre of Western Springs, 4384 Hampton Ave., Western Springs\n\n(708) 246-3380; Theatrewesternsprings.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "'Man Who Came to Dinner' is the prima diva of houseguests", "Description": "It's been more than 40 years since Indian Head Park resident Jonathan Kraft was a houseguest from hell.
