Five boaters are safe after their 25-foot catamaran, Morning Brite, capsized and sunk Sunday, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.

About 8:45 a.m., boaters used an Emergency Indicating Radio Beacon to issue a “Mayday,” which helped Coast Guard officials locate them.

They were reportedly in the water about 62 miles east of Charleston, according to a Sunday media release.

Individuals aboard a fishing vessel called The Office reported being in the area of the search location and also responded to the boaters’ call for help. They rescued the five boaters, the release states.

Coast Guard officials from Charleston launched a 45-foot response boat to assist and took the rescued boaters to Remley’s Point boat ramp.

They were uninjured and reported to be in “good condition.”

The release states that the boaters’ possession and use of the emergency radio beacon helped tremendously in narrowing down the Coast Guard’s search and played a “major factor” in their rescue. The device is available at most marine supply stores, or online, and sends out a signal detected by satellites to help the Coast Guard locate mariners in distress.
