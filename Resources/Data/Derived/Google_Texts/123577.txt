Nine local dealerships fill Bonita Lakes Mall parking lot with new and used vehicles. They've been competing in sales all week to benefit United Way of East Mississippi.

"We bring several dealerships together so we can benefit a local charity and benefit the local community too because we drop our prices. All of the dealers are in one location so they can compete to earn your business," says Marlena Jo, Car Wars director.

A portion of the sales each of the nine dealerships make from Car Wars goes to United Way. Sara Odom with United Way says any donation helps aid community programs.

"I think it's nice that they are going to take a for-profit event and they're going to turn around and make a donation to the non-profits in our community."

"At this point, it's over $4,000 for this event," says Jo.

United Way keeps all of the funds local and disperses donations to organizations in our area.

"United Way is a place where you can make donations. They determine who needs that funding the most and so they spread it around. Maybe they'll give it to a hospital or a woman's shelter, or it could be for an afternoon kids program or a homeless shelter. They do a lot of different things in the community," says Jo.

Car Wars chose United Way because it benefits multiple local organizations.

"Each dealership has someone near and dear to their heart so by using United Way, they can use the money in a way everyone is happy and it gets spread out over the community," says Jo.
