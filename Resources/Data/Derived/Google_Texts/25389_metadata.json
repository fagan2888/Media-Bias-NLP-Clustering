But first: Anti-abortion groups are slowly making peace with Donald Trump.\n\nANTI-ABORTION GROUPS MOVING \u2014 RELUCTANTLY \u2014 TOWARD TRUMP. The unenthusiastic thawing of relations comes as the Trump camp has made moves that anti-abortion leaders view as potentially promising that he will champion their causes if he becomes president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the presumptive GOP nominee pledged to appoint \u201cpro-life\u201d judges, his clearest and most prominent effort to date to tap into one of the highest priorities of anti-abortion voters. The groups also hailed Donald Trump for hiring John Mashburn, chief of staff for Sen. Thom Tillis and a prominent opponent of abortion.\n\nThe campaigns' shift toward the general election means that Trump benefits from comparison with the Democratic front-runner. \u201cAs unpredictable as Donald Trump is, Hillary Clinton is completely predictable,\u201d said Penny Nance, CEO and president of Concerned Women of America. \u201cWe have no question about where she is on these issues.\u201d\n\nMore from Jennifer Haberkorn for Pros: http://politico.pro/1Ojh68e\n\nGOP HINTS AT OBAMACARE ALTERNATIVES, EYE EMPLOYER TAX BREAK \u2014 Several House Republicans outlined their health care priorities during an Energy and Commerce health subcommittee hearing on alternatives to the health care law on Wednesday, providing clues to the GOP task force report in the works.\n\nCommittee Chairman Fred Upton said that he wants to ensure that no patient loses coverage because he or she is sick and promoted the role of high-risk pools and guaranteed issue. Subcommittee chairman Joe Pitts praised pooling options and portability.\n\n\u2014 Stepping back from the employer-sponsored model? Pitts said health insurance is too closely tied to employment, suggesting that the GOP will cap or eliminate the tax benefits for employers who provide health coverage, Pro's Jennifer Haberkorn reports.\n\n\u201cEmployer sponsored insurance is a critical part of our health care system and must be protected,\u201d Pitts said, \u201cbut for many, their health insurance is too closely tied to employment. People who are laid off, fired or have to quit working can find themselves uninsured at a time when they can least afford it. We need better options.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Members are getting briefed today. Task force leaders will share early details of their report, per the Hill, although they're positioning the party's Obamacare alternative as a white paper, not legislation.\n\nTHIS IS THURSDAY PULSE \u2014 Where unlike some members of the health care industry, we keep our promises: You'll get a new \"Pulse Check\" podcast every week. Tips to ddiamond@politico.com or @ddiamond on Twitter.\n\nWith help from Jen Haberkorn (@jenhab), Sarah Karlin-Smith (@SarahKarlin) and Brett Norman (@BrettNorman).\n\nCHIP KAHN ON HEALTH REFORM, THE 2016 CAMPAIGN AND MORE \u2014 The head of the Federation of American Hospitals sat down with our \"Pulse Check\" podcast to discuss his role behind the infamous \"Harry and Louise\" ad campaign, how he sees the presidential election playing out for health care and what it takes to strike health policy deals on the Hill.\n\nWhile Kahn thinks the industry's moving in the right direction, he criticized many recent reforms as just warmed-over ideas. \"I'm frequently supportive, but just skeptical,\" Kahn told POLITICO. \"Policy makers \u2026 think what they\u2019re talking about is brand new, but frankly there\u2019s nothing new under the sun\" in health care.\n\n\u2014 Medicare's Part B demo is 'overreach.' Kahn said he understands why CMS is under political pressure to lower drug costs, but he doesn't think the agency's controversial Part B payment proposal is the way to do it.\n\n\"This is not a demonstration,\" Kahn said, pointing to the scope of CMS's proposal. \"I have concern for the precedent of moving national.\"\n\nListen to the podcast: http://bit.ly/1sg25ur\n\nSubscribe on iTunes: http://apple.co/1YTVD60\n\nTidbit we learned from the podcast\n\n\u00b7 Kahn thinks the best bills are finely aged. \"I think legislation's a lot like wine,\" he said. \"It takes time and you can't just slap it together.\"\n\nHOUSE TO WRAP UP OPIOID VOTES TODAY \u2014 The House overwhelmingly passed a bill Wednesday to establish a new federal task force to update best practices for pain management, along with several other measures targeting the opioid epidemic. Today lawmakers will vote on the Judiciary Committee\u2019s Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act before packaging it all up to conference with the Senate.\n\nAMA TAKES STRONGER STANCE ON OPIOIDS \u2014 For the first time, the nation\u2019s leading physician group is calling on doctors to avoid opioids, and preferably use non drug or non-opioid pain treatments.\n\nIn a letter to doctors, AMA President Steven Stack said physicians should avoid initiating opioids for new patients with chronic non-cancer pain and should limit the amount of opioids prescribed in post-operative and acute settings by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time if opioids are necessary.\n\nRead Stack's letter: http://huff.to/1T5DxOB\n\n\u2014 What's not in the letter: The AMA doesn\u2019t suggest mandatory education for physicians that prescribe opioids or call for a mandate that doctors use state Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs \u2014 although the association does say doctors should register and use the tools, which helps track any other providers that may also be giving patients opioids. And unlike recently released CDC guidelines, AMA doesn\u2019t suggest exactly how many days doctors should prescribe the drugs for.\n\nSLAVITT SAYS CMS NOW SUPPORTS UDIs \u2014 The agency would like to see the incorporation of unique device identifiers in electronic records and medical billing claims, acting Administrator Andy Slavitt said Wednesday in an unexpected change of his agency's position. Slavitt was testifying at a House Ways & Means Committee hearing, where he faced questions over CMS's new physician payment rule and other regulations that affect doctors. More for Pros.\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

It's the fifth consecutive month of spending growth below 5 percent, and the latest reminder that health care's period of slow growth \u2014 or \"slowth\" \u2014 isn't over yet.\n\n\u2014 But hospitals' rapid job growth continues. The hospital sector added 22,900 jobs in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest estimates. If that number holds up, it would be the largest single month addition of hospital jobs in Altarum's 25 years of data and suggests that the hospital industry has grown at a record 4 percent pace since last year.\n\nSee the indicators: www.altarum.org/HealthIndicators\n\nRICK SCOTT: FEDERAL ZIKA FUNDING NOW \u2014 The Florida governor brought his request for Zika funding straight to lawmakers on Capitol Hill yesterday. He didn\u2019t specifically endorse the White House\u2019s $1.9 billion request, but says that Congress needs to act soon. Asked if he\u2019d consider state funding in the meantime, Scott said that fighting the virus was a \u201cnational issue.\u201d He\u2019s meeting with HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell today.\n\nTODAY: PLANNED PARENTHOOD ENDORSES HASSAN \u2014 The organization is backing New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan in her hard-fought Senate race against sitting Sen. Kelly Ayotte.\n\nACCUSED PLANNED PARENTHOOD GUNMAN DEEMED UNFIT FOR TRIAL \u2014 A Colorado judge on Wednesday said that Robert Dear isn't mentally competent, sending him to a mental health institute instead of sending him to trial. Dear is accused of killing three people and wounding nine others at a Planned Parenthood clinic last year. http://wapo.st/1XmmGbX\n\nADOLESCENTS' ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS GETTING BETTER \u2014 That's according to a National Center for Health Statistics report out this week, which finds that just 2.3 percent of adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 lacked a place for preventive care in 2014, down from 4.5 percent in 2008. http://1.usa.gov/1UU0OUE\n\nLARRY ELLISON GIVES $200 MILLION FOR CANCER RESEARCH \u2014 The Oracle founder's donation will allow USC to create a new multidisciplinary center led by professor David Agus, a prominent cancer specialist who's treated many Silicon Valley executives.\n\nAccording to Agus, his new role was partly inspired by a comment from one famous former patient. \u201cI remember sitting with Steve [Jobs] and he said to me \u2018why can\u2019t you debug me?'\" Agus said on Wednesday. Read more: http://for.tn/1sfG9j3\n\nIt's the latest in a series of major donations to cancer research; Facebook billionaire Sean Parker last month announced he was donating $250 million to launch a new immunology institute, and Michael Bloomberg in March gave $50 million to Johns Hopkins.\n\nREPORT: CHARITY CARE FALLS IN 340B HOSPITALS \u2014 Most hospitals in the 340B drug discount program provided less charity care in 2014 than they did three years before, according to a new report by the AIR340B Coalition \u2014 a pharma-backed group critical of the program\u2019s rapid expansion in recent years. That\u2019s true of all hospitals as well, in part due to the coverage expansion under Obamacare, but most 340B hospitals \u2014 64 percent \u2014 are providing less charity care than the national average for all hospitals, the report found.\n\n\u2026 The 340B program discounts outpatient drugs for hospitals that care for underserved populations \u2014 often Medicare disproportionate share (DSH) hospitals. \u201cWe wonder whether the DSH metric is the correct one at all anymore,\u201d AIR340B spokeswoman Stephanie Silverman told reporters.\n\n\u2026 About a quarter of 340B hospitals provided 80 percent of all the charity care delivered in 340B hospitals.\n\nSee the report: http://bit.ly/1Tbdxjs\n\n\u2026 Advocates for 340B pushed back, saying hospitals in the program treat almost twice as many low-income patients as non-340B hospitals and provide nearly 60 percent of uncompensated care. \u201cOnce again the drug industry\u2019s Astroturf group gets it conveniently wrong on 340B,\u201d 340BHealth\u2019s Randy Barrett wrote in an email. \u201cEligibility in the program is not based on charity care but on the number of Medicaid patients and low-income or disabled seniors served by safety-net hospitals.\u201d\n\nEXCHANGE PLANS OFFER BETTER PROTECTION THAN EMPLOYER PLANS FROM OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS \u2014 That's according to a new Commonwealth Fund report that compares cost-sharing in marketplace plans versus employer-sponsored plans. For instance, researchers found that employer-based plans are more likely to require that beneficiaries meet a deductible for primary care visits. About 28 percent of silver plans in the exchanges required patients to meet a deductible before getting covered for primary care versus 35 percent for employer-based plans.\n\nSee the report: http://bit.ly/1UTZUrv\n\nTRUMP'S ECONOMIC PLANS CONFUSE EXPERTS, AGAIN \u2014 A top economic adviser to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said his policies would generate a surplus of as much as $7 trillion in a decade, a wildly optimistic estimate that\u2019s unlikely to pan out, POLITICO's budget writers report.\n\nSam Clovis spoke at a conference sponsored by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, and experts said the speech is likely to raise more questions about the economic advice that the presumptive Republican nominee is getting.\n\n\"I understand less about Trump's budget plan after listening to Mr.Clovis than I did before,\" David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, tweeted.\n\nPOLITICO Pro Health Care Report - Reaching the Tipping Point: Health Care Delivery Reform: A conversation about regional variation in health care delivery system reform.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
