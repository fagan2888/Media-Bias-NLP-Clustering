Those totals do not include employers that began coverage in 2014 and have not yet renewed their coverage through HealthCare.gov for 2015.\n\nThat\u2019s less than 1 percent of people with coverage in the U.S. small group insurance market that in 2013 had about 16.7 million people enrolled in health plans, reported Mark Farrah Associates, a market data firm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office in January estimated 1 million people would enroll for coverage through SHOP in 2015. No one expected the SHOP exchange to have a large enrollment, but industry officials say its early response has been substantially smaller than expected.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the cost and look at the take up rate, it certainly raises questions\u201d about whether SHOP has been worthwhile, said Alissa Fox, senior vice president of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. \u201cWe never thought the business equation made sense.\u201d\n\nEmployers with fewer than 50 full-time workers are eligible to buy coverage on SHOP. The federal government even offers businesses an incentive, a tax credit worth up to half of an employer\u2019s share of their workers\u2019 premiums. Among the conditions: The firm must employ fewer than 25 workers and their average salary cannot exceed $50,000. The credit is hardly used in high-cost areas of the country where salaries are higher.\n\nSimilar to the health insurance marketplace for individuals, the federal government operates the SHOP exchange in 34 states and 16 other states plus the District of Columbia run their own small business exchanges. The state exchanges also capture a small share of the small business market, based on more current figures compiled by Kaiser Health News. As of early October, five state-run SHOP exchanges \u2013 Idaho, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington \u2014 had sold coverage to fewer than 200 employers. New York and California have the highest enrollments, and together those two states account for about 6,500 employers and nearly 50,000 people.\n\nThe Obama administration hoped SHOP would make it easier and cheaper for small employers to offer coverage to employees and for their workers to have a choice of plans.\n\nUnlike the federal- and state-run health insurance exchanges for individuals that limit sign-up to a certain period during the year, the SHOP exchanges allow companies to enroll at any time.\n\nBut several factors account for the paltry enrollment in SHOP, say insurance brokers, insurers and state officials. Brokers say SHOP has fewer health plans and more expensive coverage policies than can be purchased outside the exchange. Several states only have one insurer on their SHOP exchange, including Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina and Nebraska, according to consulting firm Leavitt Partners.\n\nMany small employers have stuck with plans they purchased outside SHOP because the Obama administration gave them the option to remain with their existing policies until 2017. That enabled employers to stay in plans that don\u2019t meet all the new requirements of the health law, including so-called \u201cessential health benefits.\u201d These additional benefits can drive up the cost of policies, making it harder for the SHOP plans to compete.\n\nAnother factor that slowed enrollment in SHOP has been software problems in several states that made it hard for employers and employees to sign up. In addition, the SHOP exchange run by the federal government launched in October 2013 was only available if employers contacted an agent or broker. Its full web site was not running until fall 2014.\n\n\u201cWith all that stacked up against it, it does not surprise me that the numbers are so low,\u201d said Kevin Lucia, a research professor at Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, who studied the rollout.\n\nKevin Counihan, the Obama administration\u2019s top insurance exchange official, acknowledges SHOP will only be a \u201cniche product\u201d and most policies will still be sold outside the marketplace. Still, he expects as more employers and insurance brokers learn about SHOP, that its enrollment will grow. Asked in an interview about low enrollment, he said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really bother me\u2026something like this takes time.\u201d\n\nCounihan said the key will be to get more brokers interested in selling the SHOP plans.\n\nBut many brokers say they don\u2019t see the value of SHOP since it typically offers fewer options than outside the exchanges. \u201cThere really is no reason to go to SHOP unless you qualify for the tax credits,\u201d said Ken Stevenson, a Tallahassee, Fla., insurance agent. Four Florida insurers sell on SHOP, fewer than half available in the state. Florida Blue, the state\u2019s largest insurer, said less than 1 percent of its small group policies are sold on the SHOP.\n\nThe SHOP was set to expand to open for businesses with up to 100 employees in 2016, but Congress and President Obama rescinded that requirement this month.\n\nOne company to get the tax credit is Paloma Clothing, a women\u2019s clothing store in Portland, Ore. Co-owner Mike Roach said he signed up for SHOP plan last year on the recommendation of his insurance agent. The credit saved his company about $7,000. That savings, he said, made it affordable for Paloma to keep its share of its employees\u2019 monthly insurance premiums at 85 percent.\n\n\u201cThe tax credit saved us from the terrific, morale-crushing option of decreasing our health insurance coverage for our employees,\u201d he said. Eight of the store\u2019s 15 employees signed up for the SHOP policy sold by Moda Health. Most pay about $45 a month for their share of the premium.\n\nRoach said he is thankful for the health law. \u201cWow, finally someone did something to help small businesses deal with the rising cost of providing employees health insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cFor so many years \u2026 no one did anything but feel sorry for you.\u201d\n\nImage: BigStock Photo", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brokers say SHOP has fewer health plans and more expensive coverage policies than can be purchased outside the exchange.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Brokers say SHOP has fewer health plans and more expensive coverage policies than can be purchased outside the exchange.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Small Business Health Options Program struggles to gain members", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/bigstock-employment-71614821.jpg", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/11/small-business-health-options-program/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/bigstock-employment-71614821.jpg", "description": "Brokers say SHOP has fewer health plans and more expensive coverage policies than can be purchased outside the exchange.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare's Small Business Health Options Program struggles to gain members - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,health insurance, Health Policy, Obamacare, SHOP, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "SHOP", "published_time": "2015-11-05T10:33:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWow, finally someone did something to help small businesses deal with the rising cost of providing employees health insurance,\u201d he said.\nAfter nearly two years in operation and millions of dollars spent in development, the small business health insurance exchange created by the Affordable Care Act is struggling to catch on.\n\u201cThe tax credit saved us from the terrific, morale-crushing option of decreasing our health insurance coverage for our employees,\u201d he said.\nNo one expected the SHOP exchange to have a large enrollment, but industry officials say its early response has been substantially smaller than expected.\nNationally, about 85,000 people, from 11,000 small businesses, have coverage through the online marketplace known as the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, according to the latest federal data released in May."}
