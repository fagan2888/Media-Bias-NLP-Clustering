The September edition of New York Fashion Week always has a back-to-school feeling about it. Fresh off fabulous vacations, feeling rested and boasting a summer glow, the fashion flock come together to peruse what designers have in store for Spring 2015. With runway shows dialing up the drama thanks to the work of event producers, this season promises to be filled with plenty of Instabait.

Day 1 of NYFW began calmly enough, with pretty pastels from Coach and BCBGMaxAzria. A mere 12 hours later, show goers found themselves either underneath the stars at the Altuzarra for Target launch, alongside Keri Russell and Naomi Watts, or downtown, bearing witness to Gareth Pugh‘s dark performance art.
