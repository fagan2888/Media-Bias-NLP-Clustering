Below, Teresa Tritch, editorial writer on economic issues, responds to reader questions and comments about unfair scheduling and how to address it.\n\nIsn\u2019t this an opportunity for unions to step in and help? Laguna\n\nThe decline in union membership goes hand in hand with the rise of disadvantageous pay and scheduling practices. So it stands to reason that having a union would curtail unfair pay and scheduling practices, because unions offer a voice and a means to bargain for better pay and conditions.\n\nBut forming a union is not simply a matter of unions stepping in to help. Changes in the political, legal and regulatory landscape in recent decades have made union organizing difficult, while efforts to make unionizing easier have gone basically nowhere. For example, before President Obama was elected president the first time, he pledged to champion the Employee Free Choice Act, which would have let employees form a union by signing cards to that effect. But the support was not forthcoming. Nor has there been much rhetorical or political support for unions in recent years as they have come under attack in the states (see Wisconsin). In recent executive orders, Mr. Obama has raised the minimum pay of employees of federal contractors and instituted other beneficial changes that could be a model for private employers. But he has stopped short of pushing federal contractors to support collective bargaining.\n\nAnd he is one of the better politicians on labor rights and the agenda of working people!\n\nThe push to unionize will have to come from the grassroots \u2013 as is happening in the Fight for $15 effort \u2013 which has a dual aim: To get fair pay and to be able to unionize without retaliation from anti-union employers.\n\nThe article did not address the biggest problem with wages, the Obamacare mandate that practically limits works to less than 30 hours a week to avoid providing healthcare. This forces workers to hold two or three jobs and pay for their living cost plus pay for healthcare themselves. Many of them, with multiple jobs, earn over the government assistance threshold.\n\nBlame industry, but blame the U.S. government as well for punishing workers. leaningleft\n\nI think that government has contributed in many ways to the diminished state of labor today. But I don\u2019t agree that Obamacare is one of them.\n\nThe last time I looked into the impact of Obamacare on work hours, in June, there was no evidence that it had resulted in an increase in the number of people who were working part time but wanted and needed full time work, known as \u201cinvoluntary\u201d part timers.\n\nThe Editorial Board weighed in on the issue last January.\n\nThe threshold at which an employer must provide insurance to an employee under Obamacare or pay a penalty \u2014 30 hours \u2014 is sensible. Not many people work around 30 hours, so if an employer is inclined to cut a worker back from say, 31 to 29 hours, there are not that many people in the workforce who would be affected. If the threshold were set at 40 hours, many more workers would be in danger of having their hours trimmed, because a far greater share of the workforce puts in around 40 hours.\n\nAll that said, a lot of people are clearly scrambling to get enough hours of work to make a living. That is not only because they don\u2019t have enough hours. It is because pay is stubbornly low in so many fields. The need to have more than one job actually makes it all the more important for workers to have stable schedules so that they can juggle two or more jobs.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental problem is that as scheduling has become a tool for higher profits, it has also generated unfair practices,\u201d plus \u201cManagers are often compensated on the efficiency of their staff. A retail manager\u2019s best employee would not necessarily be the top seller, but rather the one who sells the most at the lowest pay.\u201d I.e., the nexus of the problem.\n\nand \u2026\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, bills in Congress and some states would curb some of the most disruptive scheduling practices, including on-call shifts or sending workers home early without pay. Approving these bills will require lawmakers to put the interests of workers ahead of their corporate contributors.\u201d What\u2019s the likelihood of that?\n\nWhen do we (on the productive and consumer sides) stop this? forbesgayton\n\nInteresting idea. Boycotts, like strikes, are hard fights, with potential for collateral damage. Please don\u2019t misunderstand: I\u2019m not saying, \u2018You could cause more harm than good.\u2019 That\u2019s a reactionary argument for doing nothing. I am just thinking aloud. In the absence of an organized effort, there is nothing to stop individuals from writing to a company to express dissatisfaction with how employees are treated. Presumably, image and brand are very important to corporations and, accordingly, they would want to know if you think the company\u2019s practices are at odds with their image and brand. It\u2019s relatively easy to fire off an email. Ask for a reply \u2013 and let me know what they say!", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150901175548, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "per": "Obama, Barack", "org": "House of Representatives;Senate", "keywords": "Obama Barack,Boycotts,Collective Bargaining,Government Contracts and Procurement,Labor and Jobs,Organized Labor,States (US),Wages and Salaries,Working Hours,House of Representatives,Senate,Wisconsin,Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/How Can America Fight Unfair Work Schedules?: Reader Q&A ( 20150901 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "The Editors", "SCG": "takingnote", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "The Editors", "byl": "The Editors", "twitter": {"url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/how-can-america-fight-unfair-work-schedules-reader-qa/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/09/01/opinion/1tritchWEB2/1tritchWEB2-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "Teresa Tritch answers reader questions about how union organizing, Obamacare and boycotts might affect worker schedules.", "card": "summary", "title": "How Can America Fight Unfair Work Schedules?: Reader Q&A"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/takingnote/post", "description": "Teresa Tritch answers reader questions about how union organizing, Obamacare and boycotts might affect worker schedules.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 1, 2015", "article": {"tag": "Featured Posts", "published_time": 1441144548, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2015-09-01T21:55:48-04:00"}, "geo": "Wisconsin", "utime": 20150901215548, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150901, "pdate": 20150901, "des": "Boycotts;Collective Bargaining;Government Contracts and Procurement;Labor and Jobs;Organized Labor;States (US);Wages and Salaries;Working Hours", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/09/01/opinion/1tritchWEB2/1tritchWEB2-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Taking Note", "description": "Teresa Tritch answers reader questions about how union organizing, Obamacare and boycotts might affect worker schedules.", "title": "How Can America Fight Unfair Work Schedules?: Reader Q&A", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/how-can-america-fight-unfair-work-schedules-reader-qa/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/09/01/opinion/1tritchWEB2/1tritchWEB2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/how-can-america-fight-unfair-work-schedules-reader-qa/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "How Can America Fight Unfair Work Schedules?: Reader Q&A", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/09/01/opinion/1tritchWEB2/1tritchWEB2-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 1, 2015"}, "article_summary": "Below, Teresa Tritch, editorial writer on economic issues, responds to reader questions and comments about unfair scheduling and how to address it.\nPhotoAmerican workers need protection from unfair scheduling practices like on-call shifts, the editorial board argued on Tuesday.\nLagunaThe decline in union membership goes hand in hand with the rise of disadvantageous pay and scheduling practices.\nSo it stands to reason that having a union would curtail unfair pay and scheduling practices, because unions offer a voice and a means to bargain for better pay and conditions.\nAll that said, a lot of people are clearly scrambling to get enough hours of work to make a living."}
