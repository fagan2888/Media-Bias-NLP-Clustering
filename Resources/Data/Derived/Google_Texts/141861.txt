“One in six Oklahoma struggles with hunger every day,” said Rodney Bivens, executive director of the Regional Food Bank. “We are thankful for this generous donation, which will provide 100,000 meals for Oklahomans struggling with hunger in central and western Oklahoma. We would also like to thank Olivia Munn for her continued support and dedication to ‘Fighting Hunger…Feeding Hope’ in her home state.”

Munn is a long-time supporter of the Regional Food Bank. In February 2013, Munn joined Vanity Fair and Juicy Couture, in a special celebration for “Vanities” calendar, which raised $20,000 for the nonprofit. After the May 2013 F5 Moore tornadoes, Munn and Rainbow Light joined forces to donate nutritional shakes in support of disaster relief efforts, which were valued at $25,000, according to the Regional Food Bank.
