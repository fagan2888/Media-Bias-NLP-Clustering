That would be a forgivable response to the agency’s Nov. 17 annual report, which revealed a $42.4 billion projected deficit in the PBGC’s multiemployer plan, a more than five-fold increase since last year.

What it discovered is that many plans were stopping short, though typically not by choice.



Rather than risk hastening their demise, the plans in many cases undertook only the measures they considered reasonable under the circumstances.



Raising employer contribution levels too high could prompt those companies to leave the plan entirely. Other plans reported they had filed rehabilitation plans that included contribution increases but couldn’t coax the unions representing workers in the plans to agree.

“Plans are making the decisions they are making in what they view as the best interest of the plan,” Bone said. “It’s not a question of neglect, but it is a reflection of the realities these plans face. We have to account for those realities. We have to make projections based on what actions they are taking. Not on actions they could be taking.”
