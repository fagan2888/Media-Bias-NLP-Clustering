When that strategy was ultimately unsuccessful, Murphy joined then-House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer in passing standalone legislation to repeal the military\u2019s gay ban.\n\nMurphy, an Iraq war veteran, said in an interview with the Washington Blade just before Congress repealed \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d he considered the issue a matter of national security.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in Afghanistan and Iraq and we cannot be forcing honorable men and women who are willing to take a bullet to keep our families safe to be thrown out just because they happen to be gay,\u201d Murphy said at the time.\n\nIn the same year \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d was repealed, Murphy lost his House seat to Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), who currently represents Pennsylvania\u2019s 8th congressional district. Murphy sought to win election in 2012 as Pennsylvania attorney general, but came up short in the Democratic primary. The former congressman later took a role as a senior national security fellow for the progressive think-tank Center for American Progress.\n\nNeera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, said in a statement \u201cthe Army and the nation are lucky\u201d to have Murphy\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cWhen he was a member of Congress, CAP was proud to work with Rep. Murphy on issues he championed, such as the Affordable Care Act, and as he led the repeal of \u2018Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell,'\u201d Tanden said. \u201cAs a senior fellow, Murphy contributed greatly to our work by leading on issues that affect 21st-century fighters, and he will no doubt do the same for the Army. Murphy served the country twice, first in the Army and later as the first Iraq War veteran to serve in Congress, and we know he will bring the same service to the Army once again.\u201d\n\nThe White House had no comment Sunday on the confirmation of Murphy, who was nominated by President Obama in August.\n\nStill pending before the Senate is the nomination of Eric Fanning as Army secretary, who would be the first openly gay person confirmed to the role. Fanning is currently serving as acting Army secretary. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kansas) has placed Fanning\u2019s nomination on hold as a result of comments Obama made on closing Guantanamo Bay detention camp.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former congressman who took a lead role in \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" repeal was confirmed Friday for the No. 2 civilian position in the U.S. Army.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "The former congressman who took a lead role in \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" repeal was confirmed Friday for the No. 2 civilian position in the U.S. Army.", "title": "Leader in 'Don't Ask' repeal confirmed to Army post", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/08/Patrick_Murphy_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "height": 470}, "updated_time": "2015-12-22T09:09:33-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/12/20/leader-in-dont-ask-repeal-confirmed-to-army-post/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former congressman who took a lead role in \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" repeal was confirmed Friday for the No. 2 civilian position in the U.S. Army.", "creator": "@chrisjohnson82", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/08/Patrick_Murphy_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "title": "Leader in 'Don't Ask' repeal confirmed to Army post", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "homepage news", "tag": "Patrick Murphy", "published_time": "2015-12-20T14:01:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-22T09:09:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "gay news, Washington Blade, Patrick Murphy, Don't Ask Don't Tell"}, "article_summary": "The former congressman who took a lead role in \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d repeal was confirmed Friday to the No.\nIn May 2010, Murphy amended a Pentagon spending bill to include \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d repeal.\nMurphy, an Iraq war veteran, said in an interview with the Washington Blade just before Congress repealed \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d he considered the issue a matter of national security.\nIn the same year \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d was repealed, Murphy lost his House seat to Rep.
