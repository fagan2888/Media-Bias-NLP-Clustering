CNBC's Eamon Javers takes a look at what Americans think about some major cases in from of the Supreme Court, including same-sex marriage and health care.

The Supreme Court is set to hand down two major rulings this week—one on gay marriage and the other on Obamacare—and it appears the public has largely made up its mind on both issues.

According to a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 57 percent of Americans favor the Supreme Court effectively legalizing gay marriage across the country. Thirty-seven percent said they opposed such a move, and just 6 percent said they are not sure.

There's a clear difference by party in the poll: 74 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of independents favor the high court legalizing gay marriage, versus just 33 percent of Republicans.



Also expected within days is a Supreme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act—otherwise known as Obamacare—and whether the law allows subsidies to be paid to those using the federal insurance exchange. A high court ruling could cause more than 6 million people to lose their health-care coverage, impacting those who live in states that declined to set up their own health insurance exchanges.
