I will get rid of Obamacare. You know, Ben wants to knock out Medicare. I heard that over the weekend. He wants to abolish Medicare. And I think abolishing Medicare, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get away with that one. And it\u2019s actually a program that\u2019s worked. So, it\u2019s a program that some people love, actually. So, if you look at what\u2019s going on with our country, if you take a look at the horrible deals that we\u2019ve made, including the Iran deal, including, even you take a look on a different subject, Sergeant Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five of the killers that they\u2019ve wanted for a long period of time. I mean, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 the whole thing is ridiculous. And that\u2019s why people are just so unhappy. I will make some of the great trade deals. I will bring our jobs back. I\u2019ll bring our money back. I\u2019ll bring our manufacturing back. Ben cannot do that.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump stated that fellow Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson \"wants to abolish Medicare,\" \"a program that's worked\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Donald Trump stated that fellow Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson \"wants to abolish Medicare,\" \"a program that's worked\"", "title": "Trump: Carson 'Wants To Abolish Medicare,' Which Is 'A Program That's Worked' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Trump-campaign-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/10/27/trump-carson-wants-to-abolish-medicare-which-is-a-program-thats-worked/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump stated that fellow Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson \"wants to abolish Medicare,\" \"a program that's worked\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Trump-campaign-Getty.jpg", "title": "Trump: Carson 'Wants To Abolish Medicare,' Which Is 'A Program That's Worked' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ben Carson, Donald Trump, entitlements, Medicare,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Medicare", "published_time": "2015-10-27T12:07:14-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "And it\u2019s actually a program that\u2019s worked.\nYou know, Ben wants to knock out Medicare.\nI will make some of the great trade deals.\nHe wants to abolish Medicare.\nAnd I think abolishing Medicare, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get away with that one."}
