Having flown off for spring vacation last week, this seems a natural time to ask: How have they done so far?\n\nThe short answer: Despite roadblocks, stumbles and infighting earlier this year, the new majority party entered the Easter break with governing momentum following hard-fought budget agreements in both chambers.\n\nDemocrats see things differently, of course. They point to the first 11 weeks of the 114th Congress and claim Republicans still don\u2019t know how to run things on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe numbers both support and belie this. It\u2019s true that only six bills have been signed into law thus far, but that\u2019s close to the norm during President Obama\u2019s time in office in years following elections. Six bills were enacted in the first three months of 2013; seven were signed in 2011.\n\nFor Republicans, however, simply getting bills onto the president\u2019s desk is a significant win. Obama had vetoed just two pieces of legislation in the first six years of his administration, but Republicans successfully forced vetoes on two in the past 90 days: One bill approved the Keystone XL pipeline and another would have blocked a National Labor Relations Board effort to streamline union elections.\n\nIn the House, Republicans felt they had momentum because they were able to rally enough members to pass a budget agreement, and a likely deal was reached on a fix for the formula to pay Medicare doctors, two high-priority items that were question marks going into the final week before the break.\n\nRepublican senators were similarly pleased with a budget agreement, and also praised the way Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opened up the amendment process on legislation, something that was a constant source of frustration under Harry Reid.\n\nBut things aren\u2019t completely unstuck on Capitol Hill, and even Republicans weren\u2019t universally singing their own praises, as some admitted that there is still a long way to go to get things on track. Most lawmakers questioned were reluctant to assign Congress interim grades, and the grades that were given for the first three months of the new Republican Congress fell all over the map.\n\nA Promising Start\n\nJanuary began, oddly enough, with bipartisan consensus. On the second day of the new Congress, the House passed a reauthorization of terrorism risk insurance by a vote of 416-5; the Senate passed it, 93-4, the next day, and Obama signed the measure into law four days later. It was the only piece of legislation the president signed in January.\n\nThe rest of the month in the House saw a number of Republican \u201cmessage\u201d priorities: votes to cancel Obamacare\u2019s 30-hour workweek provision and increase it to 40; approve the Keystone XL pipeline; fund the Department of Homeland Security while halting President Obama\u2019s immigration executive actions; and a bill to prohibit taxpayer-funded abortions, among others.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen a lot of arm waving and you\u2019ve seen a lot of what looks like motion, but not much has gotten done,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jim McDermott said.\n\nIn the Senate, the entire month was spent in a back-and-forth over the pipeline, culminating in 33 votes on amendments to the legislation. Some Democrats joined their GOP colleagues in cheering the open amendment process, which brought nearly twice number the votes as the 15 Harry Reid allowed in all of 2014.\n\nDick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, even praised new Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the Senate floor, and said he hoped the two parties could work together to continue allowing open floor debate.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last several weeks is the Senate I remember, the Senate I was elected to, the Senate where there was active debate, deliberation, amendments,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cAnd for some members, it\u2019s a new experience.\u201d\n\nSen. Marco Rubio also praised McConnell, but complained that Democrats have stepped in to block Republicans at nearly every turn. His grade for the 114th Congress\u2019 first three months: \u201cA for effort, probably C+ for results.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give Sen. McConnell a real bonus point for trying to have a process that works, that allows everyone a vote on their amendments,\u201d Rubio told RCP. \u201cHe\u2019s confronted, of course, a Senate minority party -- and Sen. Reid -- that\u2019s decided to become obstructionist \u2026 by putting up roadblocks in front of every initiative that the Senate\u2019s trying to do.\u201d\n\nDespite praise for the way they debated the Keystone legislation, the upper chamber spent nearly a month on the measure before Obama vetoed it, as promised. The attempt to override fell short, and Republicans\u2019 first priority in the new Senate fell flat, as predicted.\n\nFebruary started much the same as January. The Senate took up the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act -- which had passed the House without a single no vote three weeks earlier -- and passed it, 99-0. Obama signed it a week later, the only bill that would get his signature in February other than a one-week, temporary funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nBeyond that, the year\u2019s shortest month was consumed by the DHS impasse. Republicans insisted on amendments blocking Obama\u2019s action delaying deportation for possibly millions of undocumented immigrants and accused Democrats of supporting executive orders the GOP called unconstitutional. Democrats flat-out refused to even consider funding bills with the immigration riders attached and accused the GOP of playing games with national security and giving in to the far-right wing of the party.\n\nIn other words, it was the same old game of Capitol Hill gridlock.\n\nThe stalemate lasted weeks, with even House GOP leaders unable to marshal support within their own party for a temporary three-week fix (more than 50 Republicans voted against the measure). Ultimately, they reached a deal to fund DHS without any immigration riders.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve found new ways to obstruct even their own objectives,\u201d Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said of the GOP. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to obstruct the governing party, it\u2019s an entirely different thing to actually put obstacles in your own way. \u2026 The point when you\u2019re in charge is to govern and I think they, to put it charitably, are still getting the hang of it.\u201d\n\nSen. Mark Kirk, a moderate Republican facing a tough re-election battle in 2016, was highly critical of his party\u2019s attempt to attach immigration to homeland security funding. Despite that, he still gave the Senate an A- for the first three months of 2015.\n\n\u201cThe move to attach controversial stuff to a key spending bill was not a strategy that I agreed with,\u201d Kirk told RCP. \u201c\u2026 When you\u2019re blessed with the congressional majority, you\u2019re blessed with the power to govern. If you\u2019re going to govern, you have to govern responsibly.\u201d\n\nSome GOP members still consider passing DHS funding without the immigration amendments the biggest disappointment of the new Congress. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who was one of the most vocal opponents of the president\u2019s immigration actions, said it came down to messaging. Though he gave the Senate a B grade for its work so far, he said Republicans were \u201cineffectual\u201d in their DHS arguments.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, also called the DHS battle the biggest disappointment of the new Congress, and agreed that messaging was a big reason for the failure. Republicans had the right arguments, he said, but didn\u2019t make them stick.\n\n\u201cWe needed to run a two-month campaign,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cInstead, I think many members waited until the last couple weeks to try to make the argument.\u201d\n\nPost-DHS and in the race toward the Easter break, House Speaker John Boehner partnered with Democratic counterpart Nancy Pelosi to strike a long-term deal on the Sustainable Growth Rate payment method for doctors who treat Medicare patients, which Congress has tackled annually since 1997. House leaders came to a 10-year agreement on the payments. Majority Whip Steve Scalise predicted the day before the vote that there would be a huge majority supporting the fix, and the tally proved him right: The bill passed by a stunning 392-37 margin.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look now but we are actually governing,\u201d North Carolina Rep. Renee Ellmers said on the House floor last Thursday.\n\nBoehner called the \u201cdoc fix\u201d a \u201ctrue win for the American people\u201d but downplayed the process. \u201cIt was an opportunity that presented itself, and the door opened and I walked in,\u201d he said over the weekend on CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of Democrats supported the measure, and they were equally pleased an agreement was reached. Minority Whip Steny Hoyer gave Congress a D for its work thus far, but said without the SGR fix, it would have been an F.\n\n\u201cWe both wanted to make it permanent, and that bill was worked on in a way that I think \u2026 was a very positive performance of the Congress, of the House of Representatives,\u201d Hoyer said. Other than that, he called Republicans \u201ca deeply divided party\u201d and \u201cineffective in pursuing positive policy.\u201d\n\nAgreement wasn\u2019t as easy to achieve in the upper chamber, where an all-night vote session on budget amendments prevented senators from taking up the SGR fix before breaking for vacation -- thus missing the March 31 deadline. McConnell assured his colleagues late Thursday night that they would take it up the measure immediately upon returning in April.\n\nA senior GOP aide said the agreement in the House didn\u2019t necessarily mean there would be bipartisan support for big-ticket fixes down the road, including those needed for the highway trust fund and the debt ceiling. But the aide said leaders could use the Medicare fix as a blueprint for how to attack these deadline-oriented issues.\n\nSteve Israel, the chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, took a different view. He said the Medicare fix showed that Democrats hold a significant amount of power despite the GOP having its largest majority in the House since the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cWhat we know for a fact now is that nothing can happen in this Congress without Democratic votes,\u201d Israel stressed. \u201cFor as long as they\u2019re willing to acknowledge that they need Democrats to pass anything of any importance, we\u2019ll be willing to provide the votes. Our votes, however, can only support bills that reflect our priorities.\u201d\n\nAsked about Democratic claims that fractures in the GOP conference gave the minority power, a senior GOP aide pointed to the budget, which had passed a day earlier without any Democrats in support.\n\nBudget deals set priorities\n\nWhen Republicans met for a joint House-Senate retreat in Hershey, Pa., in January, one of the topics discussed was the importance of passing a budget proposal on each side of the Capitol. Though such outlines don\u2019t have the force of law, they serve as statements of priority and guidelines for appropriations the remainder of the year. Controlling both chambers, Republicans saw it as essential that they pass budget resolutions to lay the framework for their plans going forward. Despite a divide over defense funding and how to provide it, the House narrowly passed leadership\u2019s preferred version of the budget, 218-208.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge deal,\u201d Scalise said after the vote, calling the budget proposal \u201ca visionary document for America, for how we\u2019re going to get our country back on track.\u201d\n\nSenate Republicans were also able to narrowly push through their proposal, 52-46, with just Ted Cruz and Rand Paul joining all Democrats in voting against it.\n\nSeveral Republican senators, when asked how they viewed the work they had done so far this year, highlighted that vote as a substantial achievement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been tough,\u201d John McCain said. \u201cIf we get a budget done, I think it\u2019ll be progress.\u201d\n\nHis Senate pal Lindsey Graham expressed a similar sentiment, saying before the budget vote, \u201cI would say if we passed the budget, we\u2019re off to a good start. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019re no better than [Democrats] are.\u201d\n\nRubio said before the vote that he thought a budget agreement would provide necessary momentum for the work to come, adding that he expects the C+ grade he gave the chamber to rise to a B+ in the coming 30 days.\n\nMore than just the doc fix hangs in the balance for the Senate, however. While the House passed multiple bills aimed at helping victims of sex trafficking, the Senate got stuck on just one thanks to an amendment preventing funds being spent on abortions. Despite the trafficking legislation having broad bipartisan support, the Senate left for vacation without having passed it, still mired in substantial disagreements over the abortion language. The delay in that vote also held up a confirmation vote for attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch, who has been waiting more than a month since winning approval from the Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan vote. Durbin, who said his grade for this new Congress would be \u201cincomplete,\u201d admitted last week he was worried about the Lynch vote, and Democratic senators have been loudly pushing for McConnell to bring her nomination to the floor.\n\nDespite those disagreements, John Cornyn, the second-ranking Senate Republican and author of the trafficking bill, said he is confident a solution will come quickly after the recess. Following that and the Medicare fix, the Texas lawmaker says things will be looking up.\n\n\u201cI think hopefully in the next couple weeks we\u2019ll look back and things will look a little more hopeful,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now they seem kind of stuck.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans came into 2015 controlling both the House and Senate for the first time since 2006, with promises to govern effectively and prove they were more than just the party of no.
