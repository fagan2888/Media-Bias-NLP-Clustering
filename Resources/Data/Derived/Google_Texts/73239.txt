YUMA — The Arizona Attorney General’s Office is investigating nearly a dozen complaints that Yuma city officials violated open meetings law.

The Yuma Sun reports that 10 complaints have been filed in the last year alleging that the Yuma City Council and other staff held improperly held a retreat and executive sessions.

Six of the complaints came from Jack Kretzer, a former city council candidate and the other four from former Yuma Mayor Phil G. Clark.

City Attorney Steve Moore called the claims baseless and says no laws were broken.

Kretzer says officials have a habit of ignoring open meetings law when it’s “inconvenient for them.”

Attorney General’s Office spokeswoman Kristen Keogh says if any violations are found, disciplinary action could include training for council members or fines up to $500.
