After that, we will get into presidential politics as candidates start to test the waters.\n\nActually, possible presidential candidates are already making calculated moves. One possible candidate for the Republican ticket is Florida Senator Marco Rubio.\n\nRubio recently addressed the issue of retirement and Social Security. It's not a topic candidates and politicians want to touch upon a whole lot, as it's a subject that can quickly alienate voters.\n\nSocial Security is in the red by many trillions of dollars. There is no Social Security Trust Fund \u2014 it is a filing cabinet filled with a bunch of IOUs, mostly of government debt.\n\nOf course, even if the government made good on the promises of the Treasuries (through more taxes and/or higher inflation), Social Security would still have staggering unfunded liabilities.\n\nSo far, politicians have been able to play kick the can. There are \u201creforms\u201d every so often, usually in the form of higher payroll taxes. But for several decades, the government has simply spent most of any surplus money that has come in for Social Security. To add to the problem, Americans are living longer on average.\n\nRubio made several suggestions in regards to retirement in the U.S. First, he said the retirement age should be raised for younger workers, and he proposed that the Social Security tax should be eliminated for those continuing to work after they hit the age of 65.\n\nRubio also suggested that those with greater wealth should see a reduced growth rate in Social Security payments. Finally, he proposed that workers who don\u2019t have a retirement plan through their employer be given an option to enroll in a federal savings plan.\n\nIn other words, Rubio is trying hard not to offend any group of voters too much, while also trying to sound productive with his proposals.\n\nHis proposal to raise the retirement age for younger workers is something that is going to happen regardless of what anyone says. Rubio is simply stating something other politicians won\u2019t admit.\n\nHis proposal to eliminate Social Security taxes for workers over age 65 is actually a good one. Unfortunately, this is also the one thing that is the least likely to pass.\n\nRubio\u2019s proposal to reduce the growth in Social Security benefits is just a form of means testing. It is inevitable. The left will gladly support this plan unless they say it is not enough. Many people say wealthier people should not receive any Social Security benefits, but they are certainly not advocating that they should stop paying the taxes for them.\n\nThe last part of Rubio\u2019s plan is the most interesting. He wants to offer a Thrift Savings Plan. It would be a government retirement program for the approximately one-third of U.S. workers who do not have a retirement plan option through their employer.\n\nAnother MyRA Plan\n\nRubio\u2019s proposal sounds very similar to a plan being implemented by President Obama. I discussed Obama\u2019s MyRA plan after he announced it during his last State of the Union speech. The MyRA program is supposed to begin at the end of this year.\n\nConsidering the great job the government has done with Social Security, are we now going to trust it to run more retirement plans for Americans? Whether it's Rubio\u2019s federal savings plan or Obama\u2019s MyRA plan, it will be planned, implemented, and managed by politicians and bureaucrats.\n\nEven if these proposals are being made with the best of intentions, we know how twisted things become when they enter the political arena. The government has a way of making these things sound good when they are first proposed, at least to some people. Think Obamacare.\n\nWhat will happen when these government retirement plans go into full swing? Even if they are administered well from the beginning (unlike Obamacare), they will forever be used as political tools.\n\nThere will be changing tax rules. There will be rules on when you are allowed to withdraw \u201cyour own money.\u201d There will likely be rules on how you are allowed to invest \u201cyour\u201d money.\n\nOf course, the biggest threat of all will be the government\u2019s hunger for more money to spend in the future, particularly when it faces a situation of tight budgets and higher interest rates.\n\nReboot Your Retirement Plan Join Wealth Daily today for FREE.

If taking Social Security taxes throughout the working lives of U.S. residents and then spending it all isn\u2019t enough, let\u2019s just rinse and repeat.\n\nRemember the saying: \u201cFool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\u201d\n\nWill the American people get fooled again? I hope not.\n\nWe can\u2019t be sure what Rubio has in mind with his plan, but we know Obama\u2019s MyRA plan will \u201callow\u201d you to invest in government-guaranteed securities. Yes, you can get a guarantee from the government, just as you have gotten other guarantees for Obamacare and Social Security.\n\nLet\u2019s all remember Obamacare and the slogan, \u201cIf you like your current plan, you can keep it.\u201d The new slogan for government retirement plans can say, \u201cYour retirement savings will be safe and secure in the hands of the government.\u201d\n\nThe national government debt is over $17 trillion. The unfunded liabilities are currently estimated to be as high as $200 trillion. This is unfathomable. It is also unsustainable.\n\nAmericans tend to resist major tax hikes, especially if they don't involve a world war. But they tend not to resist more debt.\n\nPoliticians will be hungry for money to spend, but their ability to raise taxes will be limited. Their ability to issue new government debt and have it bought by the Federal Reserve, along with the governments of China and Japan, will likely slow down considerably. They will want to find new sources of money.\n\nWith these proposed government retirement plans, the idea will be to have Americans \u201cinvest\u201d in their retirement by buying U.S. government debt. This way, the politicians will have more money to spend so they can kick the can down a longer road.\n\nIn a couple of decades, when people want to retire and redeem their retirement investments, the money won\u2019t be there. It will be spent, just as the Social Security Trust Fund has been spent.\n\nBut that will be their problem, along with the new set of politicians. The current politicians don\u2019t have to worry about years down the road.\n\nStay Away\n\nMy best recommendation is to stay away from any new government retirement plan. You can plan and save for your own retirement without the help of the government.\n\nYou can buy your own investments for your portfolio and precious metals to guard against inflation. You can invest in residential real estate. Whatever you do, don\u2019t invest in government retirement schemes. Regardless of their stated intentions, they tend to not turn out too well.\n\nEven if investing in government debt is optional at first, the government can change the rules at any time and compel you to invest in the \u201cfuture of America\u201d \u2014 or, in reality, the needs of the big-spending politicians.\n\nIf we end up with some kind of optional retirement program that is anything like Social Security, stay away. The government will not give you a secure retirement. On the contrary, it will make it far more insecure by spending your hard-earned money.\n\nMake no mistake: the government is coming after your retirement. But that doesn't mean they're going to get it.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nGeoffrey Pike for Wealth Daily", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "obama myra retirement plan is a scam", "twitter": {"domain": "https://www.wealthdaily.com", "description": "Your retirement is once again under attack from overreaching politicians and shady retirement plans such as the Obama MyRA.", "title": "Obama MyRA Retirement Plan is a Scam", "image": "https://images.angelpub.com/2013/06/18196/wealthdaily_governmentscam.png", "site": "wealthdaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 80985383725}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Your retirement is once again under attack from overreaching politicians and shady retirement plans such as the Obama MyRA."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6123\"", "article_summary": "Whether it's Rubio\u2019s federal savings plan or Obama\u2019s MyRA plan, it will be planned, implemented, and managed by politicians and bureaucrats.\nFinally, he proposed that workers who don\u2019t have a retirement plan through their employer be given an option to enroll in a federal savings plan.\nI discussed Obama\u2019s MyRA plan after he announced it during his last State of the Union speech.\nIt would be a government retirement program for the approximately one-third of U.S. workers who do not have a retirement plan option through their employer.\nWe can\u2019t be sure what Rubio has in mind with his plan, but we know Obama\u2019s MyRA plan will \u201callow\u201d you to invest in government-guaranteed securities."}
