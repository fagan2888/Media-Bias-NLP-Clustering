Joe Heck, who is running for U.S. Senate.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Ross Miller, state Sen. Minority Leader Aaron Ford and Heather Murren were all approached to run, and they all declined.\n\nRosen, president of Congregation Ner Tamid in Henderson, made the decision to run after meeting with U.S. Sen. Minority Leader Harry Reid and representatives of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nCompared to Nevada\u2019s 4th Congressional District, CD3 is far from a safe bet for a Democrat.\n\nLarry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, a blog run by the University of Virginia political scientist, only last week changed the district\u2019s rating from \u201cleans Republican\u201d to \u201ctoss-up.\u201d\n\nThe most recent voter registration numbers show a 3,300-person voter registration advantage for Democrats in CD3, compared to the comfortable 30,000-person advantage they enjoy in CD4.\n\nThat race features a competitive Democratic primary between former Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, state Sen. Ruben Kihuen and philanthropist Susie Lee.\n\nThe only possible primary challenge Rosen faces is from Henderson lawyer Jesse Sbaih, a Muslim immigrant from Jordan.\n\nSbaih is largely self-funding his campaign \u2014 personally loaning himself $500,000 for his campaign while raising $54,000 last quarter.\n\nRosen raised $170,000 last quarter and has loaned her campaign $35,000.\n\nSbaih grabbed national headlines last month when he told several media outlets that Reid told him a Muslim could not win the race. Representatives from Reid\u2019s office have said Sbaih\u2019s religion was not the reason he was told he couldn\u2019t win.\n\nRosen, by contrast, has remained relatively quiet so far in the race. But she took some time after a forum hosted by the Stonewall Democratic Club of Southern Nevada on Tuesday night to answer some questions.\n\nHere are some of the highlights:\n\nOn raising the federal minimum wage\n\nAcross the nation, workers have been pushing for a $15 federal minimum wage as part of the Fight for $15 movement. But Democratic candidates haven\u2019t always been favor of a $15 federal minimum.\n\nIt\u2019s a split that divides the two Democratic presidential candidates, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton supports a $12 minimum wage, while leaving room for cities and states to set higher wages. Sanders supports a $15 minimum nationwide.\n\nRosen declined to put a number on what she thinks the federal minimum wage should be.\n\n\u201cI think the Fight for 15 is a great fight. I think, unfortunately, depending how the Congress works out, we may have to get there in increments. But I think we absolutely have to work towards that for sure,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cThe way it is now, the Republicans maintain an edge. It\u2019s going to for sure have to be in those increments because we don\u2019t have a majority.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI think there\u2019s been a lot of studies that say $12 is a good minimum wage. There have been others that say $15. I think we actually have to look \u2014 a lot of it depends \u2014 what\u2019s the rate of inflation. It isn\u2019t necessarily something you can lock in that stays stagnant, because we have cost of living increases with Social Security every year. Some years it\u2019s 3 percent, some it\u2019s 2 percent \u2014 it\u2019s tied to the rate of inflation.\u201d\n\nShe compared setting the federal minimum wage to a moving target.\n\n\u201cIf inflation and interest rates go back down, it might be a different amount,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cIf they start going way up, then that $15 could become something else. So, like I said, I think we need to move in the fight towards $15.\u201d\n\nShe added that she supports states taking a look at their own circumstances, such as state income tax levels, to set their own minimum wages.\n\nOn the Affordable Care Act\n\nRosen applauded the Affordable Care Act as a \u201cfabulous first step,\u201d highlighting protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what tied people to jobs. They were afraid to quit because, \u2018Oh my gosh, I have high blood pressure. Who\u2019s going to give me private health insurance?\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s going to be so much,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cThere have been a lot of things in there that are really great. I do think that we have to look at some of the things that work, improve those, and some things that haven\u2019t worked so well, we need to modify those.\u201d\n\nShe called the ACA \u201ca good bill,\u201d adding that improvements may be necessary as more details emerge about the bill\u2019s impact. \u201cWe probably need to work on negotiating prescription drug prices, the power of economy of scale with a large group, and level some playing fields there,\u201d Rosen said.\n\nOn the Iran nuclear deal\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal threatened to divide Democrats in Congress late last summer, with many raising serious concerns about how Iranian nuclear sites would be monitored and whether lifting sanctions on Iran could hurt Israel. The deal was particularly divisive within the Jewish community.\n\nReid publicly announced his support for the deal in August and was instrumental behind the scenes in ensuring the deal would succeed.\n\nRosen neither professed support or opposition to the deal, saying that \u201cright now, it is what we have; it is what we have to work with.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing a private citizen when all that happened, you can only know what you know from TV and the newspapers,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cI absolutely think that we cannot trust Iran. We have to be sure that we hold their feet to the fire in every instance. We need to be sure that we keep shining that spotlight. They\u2019re some of the leading sponsors of terrorism.\u201d\n\nShe said she thought the president \u201cmade the best deal that he thought he could at the time, or he probably wouldn\u2019t have made it.\u201d\n\nShe reiterated that the deal does not mean the United States will stop watching where money is invested in Iran and where Iran is spending its money.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t keep watching them,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t keep improving on the agreement where we have to or imposing sanctions where we have to.\u201d\n\nOn national security\n\nAsked whether she thought the U.S. should put \u201cboots on the ground\u201d to combat ISIS, Rosen said that should be a last resort because it puts lives at stake.\n\n\u201cI think it has to be part of a comprehensive plan,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cI think you have to have a comprehensive plan. Just to say, if I have a stew and it\u2019s too salty, well if you just throw one thing in it, you know, there\u2019s always more \u2014 it\u2019s never as simple as one thing. I think that should be a last resort because, obviously, that\u2019s the biggest toll we pay with human lives.\u201d\n\nShe said other countries in the Middle East need to have \u201cskin in the game\u201d in fighting terrorism within their borders.\n\n\u201cThe best thing we can do is talk to the people who are living in those neighborhoods \u2014 and when I say neighborhoods, those countries, they\u2019re there, they\u2019re living with it \u2014 and build those coalitions,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cUnless they have skin in the game and they have a buy-in to the future success of their country and of their people, what\u2019s in it for them?\u201d\n\nOn Sen. Harry Reid\n\nWhen Rosen is mentioned, it\u2019s often in connection with Reid\u2019s name. Rosen said she was \u201creally honored\u201d that Reid came and spoke to her, but she rejected the notion that she\u2019s \u201ca puppet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, Las Vegas is a really small community, and when they were looking for people to run, there were quite a number of people that they spoke with, and I was one of those people,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cI will say that I\u2019m not a puppet for anyone. I wasn\u2019t told, \u2018You\u2019re going to do this, and here you are,\u2019 because let me tell you, it\u2019s really, really hard work to do this.\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019s \u201chumbled and honored\u201d to run. She said she feels she\u2019s lived a life that she is proud of \u2014 working, raising a family, taking care of her parents and in-laws, and volunteering in the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really great to have Harry Reid or whomever come say, \u2018Oh you\u2019re terrific.\u2019 But I really feel that my life is representative of the people in the district and what they\u2019ve gone through,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cI was raised to believe that you need to leave the world a better place than how you found it, as corny as that sounds.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cNo matter what Harry\u2019s policies \u2014 Sen. Reid\u2019s policies \u2014 are, the reason I\u2019m running is not just because they spoke to me. It\u2019s because you have to really dig down deep and decide if you want to do it, because you\u2019re really exposing yourself and what you think and what you believe, and it\u2019s not always nice or pretty.\u201d\n\nIf she wasn\u2019t running, she said jokingly, she would probably be \u201cthrowing shoes at the television.\u201d\n\n\u201cKidding aside, it\u2019s really a great opportunity,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cI feel really blessed and honored that I have this chance to take a life I\u2019m really proud of and take that forward and hopefully do the right thing for all the people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jacky Rosen has kept a relatively low profile since she launched her campaign in January to represent Nevada\u2019s 3rd Congressional District.
