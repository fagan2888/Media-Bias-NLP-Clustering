And now that Obamacare isn\u2019t working, President Obama is rewriting his own law on a whim.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe may have his pen and his phone, but we have the Constitution, and we must abide by it,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said.\n\nRepublican complaints against Obama\u2019s unilateral actions were only exacerbated this week when the administration announced that individuals would be able to keep their so-called \u201csubstandard\u201d health insurance plans that do not comply with Obamacare until October 2017.\n\n\u201cThis is just another example of the president picking and choosing portions of the law that he wants to enforce,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve spent any time around the legislative process, you know that there\u2019s a big difference between the word \u2018shall\u2019 and \u2018may.\u2019 And you don\u2019t have the choice when you are implementing the law to decide that you\u2019re going to treat it as a \u2018may.\u2019 And that is what this president is doing.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Obama] is unilaterally deciding what portions of the law he is going to implement and how and when he\u2019s going to go about that,\u201d she said.\n\nChairman Issa, who has led the push against the IRS targeting of conservative groups, said what is more concerning is the lack of transparency by the Obama administration.\n\nOverreach at the IRS stands out, Issa said, while other abuses go unnoticed.\n\n\u201cThe harder ones are simple discovery,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery committee of the Congress has asked for and not received information on areas [such as] Benghazi, Fast and Furious, investigations of wrongdoing often having nothing directly to do with the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut repeatedly the president\u2014who promised us the most transparent administration\u2014has been the least willing to cooperate with Congress\u2019 need to hold people accountable,\u201d Issa said.\n\nThe lawmakers said H.R. 4138, the \u201cENFORCE the Law Act,\u201d sponsored by Rep. Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.) is the best solution to ensure the president abides by Article II, section 3, the obligation to faithfully execute the law.\n\n\u201cIt would be a clear delineation that Congress, either the House or the Senate, on behalf of the American people would have the ability to bring to the courts, just as an individual might if they have been harmed by their government, a concern about an executive order, or any overreach or misuse of the law,\u201d Issa said.\n\nThe bill would authorize the House or Senate to sue the executive branch for not enforcing laws and provide an expedited process through federal district courts.\n\n\u201cThis expedited review is crucial in order to ensure that when a lawsuit is brought against the administration to enforce our laws, the courts not only grant Congress standing, but also hear the case on an expedited timeline to prevent the president from stalling the litigation until his term is up,\u201d Gowdy\u2019s office said when announcing the legislation.\n\nGowdy said the most recent Obamacare delay emphasizes the need for his legislation.\n\n\u201cThe latest delay once again illustrates how the president will unilaterally change a law to suit his political needs\u2014even if it is his signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said in a statement to the Washington Free Beacon.\n\n\u201cThe administration is rewriting our laws by administrative fiat. This is not how our system was designed to work and the American people expect us to step up and take a stand,\u201d Gowdy said. \u201cThe ENFORCE the Law Act is one more remedy Congress can use to rein in executive overreach.\u201d\n\nIssa said the bill is the \u201cperfect example\u201d of what the House can do to \u201cpush back against any imperial presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe left is constantly bringing suits to the EPA based on not doing enough on clean air and clean water and so on, and they\u2019re always granted standing and then ultimately they often are forcing the EPA through \u2018sue and settle\u2019 to do things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet when the president does something through executive order, or the EPA does something beyond their jurisdiction, it\u2019s very hard to get into court. So this is a really smart way to do it.\u201d\n\nThe House is expected to vote on the bill next week. Though Democrats control the Senate, Issa said Republicans are serious about advancing the legislation and could attach it to a \u201cmust-pass\u201d bill, such as a budgetary measure, to force the Senate\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges that we\u2019ve had, specifically related to Obamacare, is that no one has standing in court yet,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said. \u201cMembers in the House of Representatives have a responsibility to the people that we represent\u2014 700,000 a piece.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "McMorris Rodgers: \u2018He may have his pen and his phone, but we have the Constitution\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.) and Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R., Calif.) laid out their plans to counter President Barack Obama", "title": "House to Vote on Bill to Stop \u2018Imperial Presidency\u2019 Next Week", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/house-to-vote-on-bill-to-stop-imperial-presidency-next-week/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/McMorrisRodgers-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.) and Oversight and Government Reform", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/McMorrisRodgers-150x150.jpg", "title": "House to Vote on Bill to Stop \u2018Imperial Presidency\u2019 Next Week", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0344\"", "article_summary": "So this is a really smart way to do it.\u201dThe House is expected to vote on the bill next week.\n\u201cClearly President Obama has taken the \u00fcber presidency to a whole new level,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said.\nThe House will continue its efforts to push back against the \u201cimperial presidency\u201d next week, by voting on additional legislation that would allow Congress to challenge executive moves in federal court.\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges that we\u2019ve had, specifically related to Obamacare, is that no one has standing in court yet,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said.\n\u201cThis is just another example of the president picking and choosing portions of the law that he wants to enforce,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said."}
