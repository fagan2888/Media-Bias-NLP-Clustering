She has no plans to make any public statements.\n\nJohnson, 27, is \u201chappy to be out, excited about her future, and optimistic about how things are going to go for her,\u201d her lawyer Marc Victor said.\n\nThe release from prison was the latest twist in the case that began with the December 2009 disappearance of 8-month-old \u201cBaby Gabriel\u201d and included police searches of trash containers and a Texas landfill.\n\nAuthorities have said Johnson initially told the boy\u2019s father that she killed her son and dumped him in a trash bin but later recanted and said she gave the infant to a couple at a park in San Antonio, Texas. With no sign of the child, prosecutors were only able to file lesser charges against her, including kidnapping, custodial interference and unlawful imprisonment.\n\nA jury deadlocked on the kidnapping charge \u2014 the most serious count against her that could have brought more than two decades in prison. She was sentenced to 5 1/4 years on the interference and imprisonment convictions.\n\nDespite Johnson being released from prison, the case isn\u2019t necessarily finished. Authorities could still bring charges against her if the child turns up dead.\n\nDeputy Maricopa County Attorney Angela Andrews, the prosecutor who tried the case, said she thinks about the missing baby every day and is bothered by the lack of closure.\n\n\u201cFor the family, for the prosecuting team, for the investigators who worked the case, there is absolutely no closure in the case,\u201d Andrews said.\n\nAt sentencing in December 2012, Johnson sobbed and apologized but didn\u2019t provide any information about the baby\u2019s whereabouts. Prosecutors had offered to only seek probation if Johnson would tell them Gabriel\u2019s whereabouts, but she refused.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arizona mom of missing baby released from prison", "title": "Arizona mom of missing baby released from prison", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Arizona mom of missing baby released from prison", "title": "Arizona mom of missing baby released from prison", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/12/arizona_mom_of_missing_baby_released_from_prison/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/missing-arizona-baby.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Arizona mom of missing baby released from prison", "title": "Arizona mom of missing baby released from prison", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/missing-arizona-baby.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Davenport and Brian Skoloff", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 An Arizona woman convicted in the disappearance of her young son was released from prison Friday without ever providing authorities details on the whereabouts of the missing boy.\nDespite Johnson being released from prison, the case isn\u2019t necessarily finished.\nProsecutors had offered to only seek probation if Johnson would tell them Gabriel\u2019s whereabouts, but she refused.\nA jury deadlocked on the kidnapping charge \u2014 the most serious count against her that could have brought more than two decades in prison.\nDeputy Maricopa County Attorney Angela Andrews, the prosecutor who tried the case, said she thinks about the missing baby every day and is bothered by the lack of closure."}
