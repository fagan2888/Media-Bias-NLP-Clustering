(David Maxwell/Bloomberg)\n\nMost of the past VA secretaries have been veterans but not physicians. Cosgrove is both. He also has experience running a massive and successful health-care organization that has been praised for its efficiency, outcomes and patient satisfaction.\n\nHere are some additional facts about Cosgrove to help shed light on why Obama would consider tapping him to lead the federal government\u2019s second-largest agency, as well as why he might shy away from choosing him:\n\nResume\n\nCosgrove, 75, is a decorated Vietnam veteran who served as a surgeon and head of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Casualty Staging Flight during the conflict.\n\nHe has worked at the Cleveland Clinic since 1975, becoming chairman of the network\u2019s thoracic and cardiovascular surgery department in 1989 and serving since 2004 as the clinic\u2019s CEO.\n\nCosgrove earned his medical degree at the University of Virginia School of Medicine and completed his clinical training at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, and Brook General Hospital in London.\n\nA Namesake Medical Device\n\nCosgrove helped develop a medical device and procedure used for repairing leaking heart valves. The Cosgrove-Edwards Annuloplasty System is widely used at U.S. hospitals, including at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nCleveland Clinic Details\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic is relatively huge, just like the VA. It works with an annual budget of $6 billion, with more than 75 facilities, including a main campus in Cleveland and outpatient clinics throughout Northern Ohio and a handful of medical centers outside the state.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic handled about 5.5 million patient visits last year, according to the network\u2019s year-end fact sheet. For comparison, the VA health system handled about 84 million outpatient visits in 2012.\n\n(Cleveland Clinic Photo)\n\nThe clinic employs about 40,000 workers, making it Ohio\u2019s second-largest employer behind Wal-Mart. The VA employed about 338,000 workers as of 2013, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic announced in September that it would shed about 3,000 workers through early retirement as part of a plan to trim spending by 5.5 percent as healthcare providers begin receiving lower Medicare reimbursements under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the Cleveland Clinic is a not-for-profit health network, so the staff reductions are not an attempt to shield shareholders from the health-care law\u2019s financial impacts.\n\nAs part of a somewhat unique setup, the clinic groups its physicians into institutes rather than traditional departments, bringing together doctors across multiple disciplines for each of its divisions. The VA recently began using a similarly holistic-minded approach to patient care.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic began publishing its clinical outcomes annually during Cosgrove\u2019s time as CEO, showing, for instance, how many patients die during each type of medical procedure. Relatively few hospitals follow that practice.\n\nVeterans groups have called on the VA to focus more on quality of care as a primary metric for holding staff accountable, so Cosgrove\u2019s focus on transparency and accountability bode well for him.\n\nCleveland Clinic Successes\n\nU.S. News & World Report regularly names the Cleveland Clinic as one of the nation\u2019s best hospitals. Its heart program, in particular, has been ranked No. 1 since 1995.\n\nObama praised the Cleveland Clinic for its efficiency and cost controls in 2009, when he and Democrats in Congress were working out the details of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nToby Cosgrove attends The New York Times Health For Tomorrow Conference at Mission Bay Conference Center on May 29.

The network has also reduced its emergency-department wait times by 76 percent compared to 2010, lowering the average to 11 minutes last year.\n\nThose numbers will sound attractive to veterans who have dealt with treatment delays lasting more than 90 days in some cases at the VA.\n\nCosgrove also oversaw a $1.25 billion fundraising campaign to support new construction and improvements for the clinic, including a major expansion of its urology and cardiac practices. The VA has struggled in recent years with delays and cost overruns for construction projects, so his experience and success in this area could prove useful.\n\nConflict-of-Interest Concerns\n\nAmid the national debate over conflicts of interest in medical research, Cosgrove has run into some trouble due to his ties to the Foundation Medical Partners hedge fund. He served as a general partner for the organization, which invested in companies that published studies on some of the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s experimental products.\n\nOther doctors at the clinic, as well as board members, were known to have similar links. As the details emerged publicly, Cosgrove asked the board to examine potential conflicts of interest within the organization. The review criticized Cosgrove for inadequate disclosure but did not cite him for ethical problems.\n\nThe clinic ultimately recommended that its physicians and researchers continue working with medical companies, but it warned that their connections would be regularly reviewed.\n\nStance on Obamacare\n\nGranted, this issue has little to do with leading the VA, but the president is unlikely to nominate someone who openly criticizes his signature legislation.\n\nCosgrove has publicly discussed drawbacks of the Affordable Care Act, but he has not opposed the health-care law. He said in a March Fox News interview that premiums have risen for about three-quarters of consumers who signed up for new plans under the law. He also noted that providers would be paid less for working with Medicare patients.\n\nCosgrove has visited the White House at least twice to discuss the Affordable Care Act, once with a group leading officials from the health-care industry and again as part of a meeting coordinated by Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs from major U.S. corporations.\n\nPolitical Donations\n\nCosgrove has contributed money to candidates from both sides of the political spectrum. Among the Democrats he backed are Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and former Sen. Bill Bradley (N.J.), when he ran for president in 2000.\n\nAs for Republicans, Cosgrove gave money to the Romney campaign in 2012, as well as to former Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) in 2000, among other candidates.\n\nDyslexia\n\nCosgrove is dyslexic, but he credits the disorder with helping him develop a knack for creative problem-solving.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not very good at the scholastic stuff, but we see other things that are different \u2014 and that\u2019s a big advantage,\u201d he said of dyslexics in a University of Michigan profile for a series on dyslexia success stories.\n\nFollow Josh Hicks on Twitter, Facebook or Google+.
