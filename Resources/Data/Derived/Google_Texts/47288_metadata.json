In Alaska, the rate is higher than the national average \u2014 27.8 per 1,000 teens age 15\u201319 years \u2014 but it has fallen significantly from 42.6 per 1,000 in 2008, according to the bulletin.\n\nThe Gulf Coast region, which includes the Kenai Peninsula, now has the second-lowest rate in the state, with 20.9 out of every 1,000 teens giving birth in 2014. The Northern and Southwest regions led the state, with 63.3 per 1,000 and 53.0 per 1,000 teens giving birth the same year, respectively.\n\n\u201cConsistent with national trends, Alaska has made great progress in reducing the statewide teen birth rate,\u201d the bulletin states.\n\nThe numbers are tabulated through data from the Alaska Bureau of Vital Statistics, which only includes live births. The numbers do not reflect miscarriages, stillbirths or abortions, said Katie Reilly, the adolescent health services coordinator for the Division of Public Health\u2019s Section of Women\u2019s, Children\u2019s and Family Services.\n\nThe Section of Epidemiology attributes the decrease partially to increased availability in contraceptives. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended long-acting reversible contraception as a contraceptive choice for adolescents who choose not to be abstinent. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act now requires that the contraceptive be covered, according to the bulletin.\n\nHowever, the reason for the regional disparity in the state is still unclear, Reilly said.\n\n\u201cMore research is warranted to understand and address the teen birth rate disparities in Alaska,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cWhat we know is that factors such as socioeconomic status in the state may contribute to these variations. The decline does actually decline with self-reported declines in sexual activity and abortions.\u201d\n\nMedicaid expansion may also help reduce births among teens by providing more access to family planning services, according to the bulletin. Alaska expanded Medicaid by an executive order from Gov. Bill Walker in 2015, and so has not had time to show results yet.\n\nMedicaid benefits include family planning services and contraceptives, which may help decrease the rates of teen pregnancy, possibly because of the link with socioeconomic status, Reilly said. However, the state does not currently have a reliable way of determining how many teens are on Medicaid at the time of conception, she said.\n\nBetter access to high-quality education and family planning services, including contraceptives, may have played a role, said Jessica Cler, the Alaska public affairs manager for Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nBetter education can help teens learn to prevent pregnancy and to practice healthy sexual behavior, such as reducing the frequency of sex or the number of partners, she said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood also offers online services through video visits, in which patients can receive medical advice and birth control prescriptions, Cler said.\n\n\u201cOur biggest effort is through comprehensive sex education programs, and I think those are key in seeing the reduction in teen birth rates, and the availability of birth control and family planning services has added to that effort,\u201d Cler said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our mission to have access to those planning services.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood offers sexual education at its four clinics in Alaska \u2014 Juneau, Fairbanks, Anchorage and Soldotna \u2014 and when representatives are invited into schools to teach, Cler said. The organization will only go into a school if it is invited, and the curriculum is tailored to the needs of the community, she said.\n\nThe Alaska Legislature has been seeking to curtail the role of abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, in public schools during this session.\n\nThough a bill that would have barred abortion providers from providing any education in public schools died in committee, a modified version would require anyone providing sexual education to have a valid teaching certificate and be employed as a teacher at the school or be supervised by a teacher. The curriculum and the person\u2019s credentials would also have to be approved by the school board and available for parents to review.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep. Wes Keller (R-Wasilla), is intended to provide parents with more control over educational standards, according to the sponsor\u2019s statement. The House passed the bill on Thursday and has now sent it to Gov. Bill Walker\u2019s office for his signature.Cler said Planned Parenthood was disappointed with the passage of the bill. School boards will now have to approve every curricula brought in for sexual education by outside organizations, which will make it harder for students to access sexual education, she said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe next step will be to ask the governor to veto the bill,\u201d Cler said in an interview. \u201cAccess to sex education is already limited in the state of Alaska, and there are already barriers to access (to health care) in our state.\u201d\n\nThe state provides education curriculum to schools around the state, Reilly said.\n\nUsually, the Division of Public Health tries to work with local community members who have established relationships, she said.\n\n\u201cEvery district has local control of the curricula and the requirements for graduation for their particular district,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been really important to Alaskans \u2014 having that local control.\u201d\n\nReach Elizabeth Earl at elizabeth.earl@peninsulaclarion.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Peninsula, Clarion, Kenai, Soldotna, Homer, Kasilof, Nikiski, Sterling, Anchor, Point, Seward, Seldovia, Newspaper, News, Weather, Sports, Obituaries, Real Estate, Jobs, Classifieds, Cars, Homes, Fishing, Outdoors, ELIZABETH EARL", "og": {"url": "http://peninsulaclarion.com/news/2016-05-07/teen-birth-rate-on-steady-decline-in-alaska", "type": "article", "site_name": "Peninsula Clarion", "description": "The number of teenage parents in Alaska is continuing its downward trend.
