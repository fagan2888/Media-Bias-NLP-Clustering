Democratic candidate Perrin Swanlund, a senior at West High School, has been invited but has not yet RSVPed.\n\nKern County Superior Court Commissioner W. Steven Shayer and Deputy District Attorney David Wolf, who are running to fill retiring Superior Court Judge Michael Lewis' seat, will attend.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Cory Woodward, who is running for re-election, and his two challengers, criminal defense attorney J.

They\u2019ll then answer questions relevant to their races on issues including the drought, taxes and Obamacare.\n\nAlso on the evening\u2019s agenda is a discussion of Measure F, the one-eighth-cent sales tax being sought to help fund Kern County libraries.\n\nCathy Abernathy, who is chief of staff of the Bakersfield office of Assemblywoman Shannon Grove, R-Bakersfield, will speak in opposition to the measure. Jones said organizers haven\u2019t yet determined who will speak in favor.\n\nThe forum will be at the Taft Petroleum Club, 450 Petroleum Club Road. Admission is free.
