The TSA screened more than 653 million passengers and confiscated 2,212 firearms found in carry-on bags in 2014. That represents a 22 percent increase in firearm discoveries over 2013 and more than three times the number of discoveries in 2005, the agency said on its blog.\n\nSLIDESHOW: 10 Outrageous Items TSA Confiscated in 2014\n\nThe confiscated firearms \u2013 83 percent of which were loaded \u2013 were intercepted at a total of 224 airports, or 19 more than last year.\n\nThese were the five airports where the most firearms were confiscated:\n\nDallas/Fort Worth International Airport Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston Denver International Airport\n\nThe TSA also confiscated more than 140 inert or novelty hand grenades in both checked and carry-on bags.\n\nWhile it\u2019s actually not illegal to travel by plane with a firearm \u2013 which may come as a huge surprise to many in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks \u2013 there are strict rules to follow for those who choose to do so. Travelers may only transport unloaded firearms in a locked, hard-sided container as checked baggage, for example.\n\nFirearms also cannot be transported in carry-on luggage and must be declared to the airline during the ticket counter check-in process. There are more details on how to legally travel with a firearm on the TSA website.\n\nSome travelers seem to take inspiration from action flicks or spy novels when it comes to hiding firearms as well as drugs in cell phones, credit cards, greeting cards, lipstick tubes, keys and other items. Other people appeared oblivious to the restrictions regarding flying with firearms.\n\nRelated: The Terrorist Bomb That Keeps TSA Agents Up at Night\n\nHere are some of the stunning discoveries:\n\nAn 8.5\u201d knife was discovered inside an enchilada \u2013 yes, an enchilada \u2013 at the Charles M.
