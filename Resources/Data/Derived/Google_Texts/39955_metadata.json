But Clinton\u2019s immigration path contains more switchbacks than a Colorado mountain road. One season she\u2019s a bleeding-heart Mechista. The next, she\u2019s channeling her inner Pat Buchanan with sound bites that would make a Trump loyalist cheer. \u201cA country that cannot control its borders is failing at one of its fundamental obligations,\u201d she thundered many moons ago. \u201cI am, you know, adamantly against illegal immigrants,\u201d she asserted in 2003.\n\nBut that was then. This is now. Like Forrest Gump\u2019s box of chocolates, you never know what yer gonna get with Transformer Hillary.\n\nAfter the horrific murder of San Francisco\u2019s Kate Steinle by a serial criminal alien who had been deported multiple times, Clinton disavowed sanctuary policies and stated she had \u201cabsolutely no support for a city\u201d that looked the other way.\n\nAlmost immediately, a campaign spokeswoman named Xochitl Hinojosa clarified that her boss believed sanctuary cities can \u201cenhance public safety\u201d and supported more amnesty (that is, more illegal immigration) to cure the bloody consequences of unfettered illegal immigration.\n\nAll clear now?\n\nBefore Clinton was for driver\u2019s licenses for aliens here illegally, she was sorta-kinda against them. Her slippery straddling evoked mockery among her Democratic presidential rivals in 2007, when she was asked during a debate whether she supported then-New York Democratic Gov. Eliot Sptizer\u2019s licensing scheme.\n\n\u201cWell, what Governor Spitzer is trying to do is fill the vacuum left by the failure of this administration to bring about comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d she babbled. After Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., unequivocally stated that \u201ca license is a privilege and that ought not to be extended\u201d to law-breakers, she protested that \u201cshe did not say that it should be done, but I certainly recognize what Governor Spitzer is trying to do.\u201d Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., jibed, \u201cUnless I missed something, Senator Clinton said two different things in the course of about two minutes, just a few minutes ago.\u201d Then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., declared that he \u201cwas confused on Senator Clinton\u2019s answer. I can\u2019t tell whether she was for it or against it.\u201d\n\nCynical birds of a feather flip-flop together. In 2006, both Obama and Clinton voted for the Secure Fence Act, which in theory mandated construction of a 700-mile barrier along the southern border. Barely two years later, both Democratic presidential rivals renounced their support after Texas special interests complained about the inconvenience to the \u201ccommunity\u201d and open-borders activists whined about onerous passport requirements.\n\n(The grand irony is that the Secure Fence Act was a bipartisan ruse all along \u2014 a Kabuki gesture from the \u201cimmigration reform\u201d illusionists in both parties that was purposely underfunded, slow-walked, and sabotaged by Bush administration bureaucrats and cronies.)\n\n\u201cYou know where I stand\u201d on immigration, Clinton is telling voters. But she doesn\u2019t stand so much as she slithers from one expedient position to another and back in order to mollify Big Business and identity politics racketeers.\n\nRest assured: The one role she\u2019ll NEVER play convincingly is that of truth-telling defender of \u201claw-abiding, decent, hard-working\u201d citizens who believe in putting American sovereignty and American interests first.\n\nAbout: Michelle Malkin\n\nMichelle Malkin is the author of \u201cCulture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks and Cronies\u201d & \u201cUnhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild\u201d.
