A 38-year-old woman was fatally shot early Saturday in Mount Pleasant’s Snowden community, authorities said.

Tameka Mitchell died of a single gunshot wound, Charleston County Deputy Coroner Brittney Martin said. She was a resident of Wadmalaw Island and also was known as Tameka Lynn Thompson, according to a death notice from Walker’s Mortuary, which is handling her funeral.

According to a news release from the Mount Pleasant Police Department, officers were called to the Snowden community about 2:30 a.m. to investigate a homicide. The Snowden community is off Long Point Road near Seacoast Church and Belle Hall Elementary School.

The release said police had a suspect who was described as a black male wearing all black clothing, 5 -10, 210 pounds and was believed to have been an acquaintance of the victim.

According to reports on social media, helicopters could be heard flying over the area shortly before 6 a.m.

Martha Coaxum awoke Saturday morning to flashing lights and investigators combing the property next door to the home she’s lived in since 1955.

Details of the fatal shooting were sparse Saturday, and Coaxum speculated that those who lived in the area weren’t much the wiser.

“It happened so early in the morning, everyone around here was probably asleep,” Coaxum said.

The family that lived in the home where the shooting occurred was relatively quiet, Coaxum said. The same could be said of the surrounding community there, Coaxum said.

“For that to happen so close to my home — It unnerved me, that’s for sure,” Coaxum said.

The shooting was the 14th homicide this year in the tri-county area.

An incident report providing further details about the shooting was not released Saturday night.
