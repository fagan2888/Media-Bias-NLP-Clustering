Adsit, a nine-year veteran of the department, and three other officers were injured on Dec. 3 when a motorist suffering a medical episode crashed into his bicycle as he monitored a group of Denver East High School students who walked out of school in during a protest.

Adsit underwent a number of surgeries immediately after the incident and has remained at Denver Health. On Dec. 11, he opened his eyes for the first time. According to a Dec. 20 statement from the family, he remains in critical condition.
