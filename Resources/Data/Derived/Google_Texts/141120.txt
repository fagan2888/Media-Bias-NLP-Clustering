NEW YORK (AP) — Ariana Grande upped her sex appeal with an ooh-la-la black leather mini and matching thigh-high boots but kept the signature girly high ponytail while British pop singer Charli XCX wore a yellow tiger-print leotard Sunday to the MTV Video Music Awards.

“I feel sexy in it,” said Charli, among the early red carpet walkers. “I think my spirit animal is probably a tiger.”

The 21-year-old Grande worked long zippers back and front on her strapless Moschino moto look. Charli’s tight animal-print leotard and leggings were designed by the same Italian brand.

Designer Jeremy Scott joined Charli in her yellow, yellow world in bright tuxedo tails — chest bared — with a big smiley face on the back.

Kesha, sometimes a red carpet shocker, went classic in a floor-length sparkler. Amber Rose, who is married to Whiz Khalifa, decided on a Vegas showgirl moment, her chest barely covered in strands of beads that exposed all as they cascaded down in loose loops to a tiny bikini bottom.
