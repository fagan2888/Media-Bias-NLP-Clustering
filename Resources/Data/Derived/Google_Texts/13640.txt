BATON ROUGE -- Thousands filled the Baton Rouge River Center on Thursday to hear presidential candidate Donald Trump speak.

“I’m a messenger — a messenger of common sense,” Trump, the Republican front-runner, said.

His speech was delayed nearly an hour after a crowd of people — Trump said 5,000 — waited outside to get in after the 7 p.m. start time.

Trump denounced the media several times, saying “they are the most dishonest people.” He praised the crowd of 11,000, joking that the media never show the people who attend his events.

Trump said protesters are the only reason the cameras turn around to show the crowd, “bending around like pretzels.”

“After that, I loved my protesters,” he said.

Trump said that if he’s elected president he would build up the military “so big, so strong, so powerful” by ordering the equipment soldiers need. He also said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act. “You’ve got to repeal it,” Trump said. “It’s so broken.”

He said he wouldn’t leave the White House often because of all the work he would be doing as president.

Trump said he was always opposed to the war in Iraq. He said President George W. Bush put the nation in “quicksand.”

And he said President Obama made a “horrible call” when he publicly set a date for American soldiers’ withdrawal from the country.

Trump said the United States is the most taxed nation in the world. “Our taxes are too high. Our middle class is getting wiped out,” he said. “You know I have a plan: lower taxes.”

Trump said that when he endorsed John McCain and Mitt Romney, both men lost the elections. So, he said, he decided something needed to be done: “I said, ‘Damn it, next time I’m just going to do it myself.’ ”
