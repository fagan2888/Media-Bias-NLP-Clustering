It will be great to welcome Taylor back to race in his home state. He\u2019s gone through so much to get back to racing. Overall, we expect a great race that is wide-open. It will be fun to see who rises to the occasion.\u201d\n\nBoulder-based Team Cannondale-Garmin \u2014 which won the Tour of Utah two weeks ago behind the efforts of Joe Dombrowski \u2014 is also fielding a young squad and will be without 37-year-old veteran Tom Danielson, who remains suspended by his team after testing positive for what the rider said was synthetic testosterone. Danielson was runner-up to van Garderen last year.\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Taylor Phinney, Rohan Dennis lead roster of young riders at USA Pro Challenge", "title": "Taylor Phinney, Rohan Dennis lead roster of young riders at USA Pro Challenge", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/14/taylor-phinney-rohan-dennis-lead-roster-of-young-riders-at-usa-pro-challenge/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150814__DV2075457p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150814__DV2075457p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-14T18:20:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T10:16:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "USA Pro Challenge"}, "article_summary": "\u201cRohan Dennis and Taylor Phinney are just two of several young, rising stars of the sport we will see this year.\nIf there\u2019s a theme at this year\u2019s USA Pro Challenge, it was made obvious with Friday\u2019s announcement of the final team rosters: Out with the old, in with the new.\nBoulder\u2019s Taylor Phinney, having recently returned to racing at the Tour of Utah two weeks ago after more than a year away recovering from a broken leg, will lead a wide open field of young riders at this year\u2019s race.\n\u201cProfessional cycling is seeing a changing of the guards at the elite level and we are at its doorstep,\u201d USA Pro Challenge CEO Shawn Hunter said in a statement.\nIt will be great to welcome Taylor back to race in his home state."}
