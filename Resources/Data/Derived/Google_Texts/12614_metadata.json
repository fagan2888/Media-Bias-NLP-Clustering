And that wasn\u2019t even too long ago.\n\nPrice moved into the neighborhood \u2014 from Lincoln Avenue to Speer Boulevard up to Colfax Avenue \u2014 in 1997 and has watched the neighborhood transform into a vibrant community that is ready to grow even more in the next few years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed watching the community grow,\u201d Price, the president of the Golden Triangle Association, said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here from the time of surface lots to where it is today. It\u2019s impressive.\u201d\n\nHe quickly became a board member with the Golden Triangle Association. His first survey the next year estimated about 400 residents living in the neighborhood; his most recent found approximately 3,000 people.\n\nThe city of Denver has also taken notice and put together a master plan for the neighborhood that outlines visions, goals and framework to build upon the growth happening in the area. Denver City Council approved the plan Nov. 10.\n\n\u201cThe current plan is really, truly a collaboration of residents, business owners and developers,\u201d said Anne Lindsey, chair of the Golden Triangle urban design committee.\n\nWith all the neighborhood has going for it \u2014 construction of new apartment units at 10th Avenue and Bannock, 11th Avenue and Cherokee and 1000 Speer Blvd., which will add about 600 units \u2014 there are still some challenges.\n\nKnown for containing the City and County Building, Colorado Capitol and Civic Center park, Golden Triangle has well-defined boundaries. But those major streets can act as a barrier, making the neighborhood difficult to access, a problem for people coming to places such as the Denver Public Library main branch and the Denver Art Museum.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an advantage in that it defines us as a neighborhood, but it also serves to isolate us,\u201d Price said of the boundaries.\n\nThe neighborhood plan emphasizes connectivity. While a few bike lanes are in place, future lanes could provide better access to the Cherry Creek Trail.\n\nThe FreeMetroRide that goes up and down 18th and 19th streets was originally planned to dip into Golden Triangle, but that has not yet been realized.\n\n\u201cIf we had a bus that would break that Colfax barrier and come down into the area, it would make a huge difference for visitors, shoppers and residents,\u201d Lindsey said.\n\nAs with all neighborhood plans the city approves, implementation is dependent on funding. Sarah Showalter, co-project manager for the plan with the city, said public-private partnerships that bring in outside funding is paramount to getting started.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t emphasize how important they are. Most successful plan implementation relies on this,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cIt\u2019s key.\u201d\n\nOther things, such as the reactivation of Civic Center, have also helped the neighborhood and brought more people in to live.\n\nWith more residents, business has followed, and the neighborhood is now home to several local restaurants and coffeehouses. Jason Calloway, who opened up the Rooster and Moon coffee house and restaurant at 955 Bannock St. five years ago, said businesses are great at supporting one another, and the neighborhood organization has provided assistance.\n\n\u201cWhat I like about this neighborhood is the independence of it,\u201d Calloway said.\n\nCity Councilwoman Jeanne Robb, who represents the area, praised the Golden Triangle Association, especially those who have worked to help bring the area to what it is today.\n\nRobb said: \u201cMy observation is they have a wonderful combination of a group of people who are urbanists, but also pioneers in the area.\u201d\n\nJoe Vaccarelli: 303-954-2396, jvaccarelli@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joe_vacc", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Golden Triangle neighborhood in Denver hopes to build on early success", "title": "Golden Triangle neighborhood in Denver hopes to build on early success", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/25/golden-triangle-neighborhood-in-denver-hopes-to-build-on-early-success/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141125__20141127_C4_ZCC27GOLDENp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141125__20141127_C4_ZCC27GOLDENp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-25T14:10:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T16:53:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s impressive.\u201dHe quickly became a board member with the Golden Triangle Association.\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed watching the community grow,\u201d Price, the president of the Golden Triangle Association, said.\nThe FreeMetroRide that goes up and down 18th and 19th streets was originally planned to dip into Golden Triangle, but that has not yet been realized.\nKnown for containing the City and County Building, Colorado Capitol and Civic Center park, Golden Triangle has well-defined boundaries.\nDavid Price remembers living in the Golden Triangle neighborhood on the border of downtown Denver back when there wasn\u2019t much housing, but there were plenty of parking lots and empty warehouses."}
