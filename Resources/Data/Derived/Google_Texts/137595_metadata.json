Absent mass hypnosis, this will be a tough sell. Dan Mitchell takes a scalpel to the Democrats\u2019 attempt at revisionist history (numerous links omitted):\n\nIn a 2014 study for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Stanford University\u2019s Robert Hall wrote about America\u2019s sub-par economic performance. His opening line was basically a preemptive refutation of Obama\u2019s claim \u2013 made during the State-of-the-Union Address \u2013 that the economy is strong. The years since 2007 have been a macroeconomic disaster for the United States of a magnitude unprecedented since the Great Depression. I don\u2019t know that I would use \u201cdisaster\u201d to describe the economy. That word would be much more appropriate for failed welfare states such as Italy and Greece. But Professor Hall was definitely correct that the U.S. economy has been sputtering, as illustrated by comparative business-cycle data from the Minneapolis Federal Reserve.\n\nThis is one of the linked Federal Reserve charts that pretty much says it all. The blue line is GDP growth during the Reagan recovery, the yellow line is the Clinton recovery, and the red line is the pathetic Obama \u201crecovery.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s chart shows that after more than six years, Obama\u2019s recovery, the worst of the post-WWII era, was still behind what the Reagan administration achieved in just two years.\n\nWhy has the Obama recovery been so lousy? Dan Mitchell continues:\n\nSo what accounts for America\u2019s anemic economy? Hall has about 50 pages of analysis, but since brevity is a virtue, let\u2019s look at some of what he wrote in his final paragraph. Labor-force participation fell substantially after the crisis, contributing 2.5 percentage points to the shortfall in output. The decline showed no sign of reverting as of 2013. \u2026an important part may be related to the large growth in beneficiaries of disability and food-stamp programs. Bulges in their enrollments appear to be highly persistent. Both programs place high taxes on earnings and so discourage labor-force participation among beneficiaries. The bulge in program dependence\u2026may impede output and employment growth for some years into the future. In other words, he pointed out that a large number of people have left the labor force, which obviously isn\u2019t good since our economy\u2019s ability to generate output (and boost living standards) is a function of the degree to which labor and capital are being productively utilized. And his work suggests that redistribution programs are a big reason for this drop in labor-force participation.\n\nIn other words, government welfare programs are crushing America\u2019s economic growth. Mitchell sums up (many links are present in the original but omitted here):\n\n[A]t some point we have to ask whether it really matters whether people are being lured out of the labor force by food stamps, disability payments, unemployment insurance, Obamacare, or any of the many other redistribution programs in Washington. What does matter is that we have a malignant welfare state that is eroding the social capital of the country. The entire apparatus should be dismantled and turned over to the states.\n\nMitchell\u2019s article includes a reprise of this image, which tries to identify the profusion of federal welfare programs\u2013more than 80\u2013that spend more than $1 trillion annually. No doubt some are missing. One wonders whether there is anyone in Washington who could even list all of the federal welfare programs, let alone understand how they work, and what their impacts are.

Barack Obama was set up for success, as he took office on the heels of a sharp economic downturn that had a limited, specific cause. The economy should have come roaring back as it did under Ronald Reagan, only if anything even more so, since the government errors that gave rise to the 2008 financial collapse were relatively easy to correct. Instead, the Democrats\u2019 left-wing policies inhibited economic growth and produced the worst recovery of modern times.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "It seems incredible, but the Democrats are promoting the idea that the Obama administration represents a sort of economic triumph, comparable to Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980s boom or Bill Clinton&#82\u2026", "title": "Obama: Always Wrong, Never In Doubt", "url": "http://on.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/01/obama-always-wrong-never-in-doubt.php", "image": "http://www.powerlineblog.com/wp-content/themes/powerline/images/icon.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "powerlineblog:article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.wp.com/www.powerlineblog.com/ed-assets/2016/01/barack_obama3.jpg?resize=620%2C412&w=240", "site": "@powerlineus", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "NOODP", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": "505151,john.hinderaker,scottwynnjohnson,750972908", "app_id": 154257474630565}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-18T01:22:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-19T01:23:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Why has the Obama recovery been so lousy?\nOne wonders whether there is anyone in Washington who could even list all of the federal welfare programs, let alone understand how they work, and what their impacts are.\nIn other words, government welfare programs are crushing America\u2019s economic growth.\nInstead, the Democrats\u2019 left-wing policies inhibited economic growth and produced the worst recovery of modern times.\nMitchell\u2019s article includes a reprise of this image, which tries to identify the profusion of federal welfare programs\u2013more than 80\u2013that spend more than $1 trillion annually."}
