Turns out “Star Wars” mastermind George Lucas had the same question we all did: Why didn’t Stephen Colbert want to take over “The Daily Show”?

Colbert was announced as David Letterman’s successor not long before Jon Stewart stepped down. Lots of people saw Stewart’s move coming, and the two are close from Colbert’s long run as a correspondent, and then the nine years in which “The Colbert Report” followed “The Daily Show.”

Colbert was supposed to be interviewing Lucas as part of an event at the Tribeca Film Festival, but Lucas turned the tables.
