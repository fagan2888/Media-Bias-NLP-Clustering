Nothing in shirts and shorts. Nothing on grass, except top draft pick Laremy Tunsil.\n\nGase brought the Dolphins draft choices and undrafted free agents to the team\u2019s training facility last weekend for nothing but classroom sessions on football and life.\n\nGase planned to school the players on schemes, positions and plays. It was like taking just the written part of the driving test.\n\nOther sessions included subjects similar to the NFL\u2019s old rookie symposium -- managing money, proper eating habits, handling the media and, presumably, proper bong headwear.\n\nI can\u2019t see Gase\u2019s former boss, Bears coach John Fox, going along with this idea. Fox always says he doesn\u2019t know anything about players \"until we get them on the grass\" (Tunsil notwithstanding, I figure).\n\nGase\u2019s plan would be a radical change for Fox and all the other football coaches who love having their guys play football and love saying \u201cfootball\u2019\u2019 when talking about football coaches and football players and football, football, football.\n\nGase talks about changes in rookie camp and the draft Miami Dolphins head coach Adam Gase starts rookies in the classroom instead of on the field in rookie camp. Miami Dolphins head coach Adam Gase starts rookies in the classroom instead of on the field in rookie camp. See more videos\n\nSpeaking of football, football, football, the players Gase took to school might\u2019ve been all footballed out. They\u2019ve played a season of college football, then worked out for the football combine, then worked out for their football pro days. That\u2019s a lot of football. That also seems to catch up to a lot of rookies in November, even though the NFL season doesn\u2019t end until January, or February if you\u2019re lucky.\n\nIn a division that includes Bill Belichick, the Dolphins rookie coach might\u2019ve hit upon a Belichickian move that cuts down on rookies hitting the rookie wall.\n\nBut good luck to Gase turning Ryan Tannehill into Tom Brady.\n\nDesposed Bears safety Antrel Rolle just never got it: The Halas Hall practice fields are bad in order to get players ready for Soldier Field.\n\nWait, they\u2019re changing almost everyone on ESPN\u2019s NFL pregame show except Chris Berman? Seriously, Bristol? OK, then someone help me out here: Is hate-watching Berman considered a medical event covered by Obamacare?\n\nWait, Michael Jordan was never a unanimous MVP? Shaq? Wilt? Russell? Seriously, people? Idiots.\n\nPhotos of Bulls legend and NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan through the years.\n\nSpurs general manager R.C. Buford was named Executive of the Year. I get the feeling the Bulls named Gar Forman Executive For One More Year.\n\nThe Big Ten reportedly is close to a football and basketball broadcast deal with Fox. Jim Harbaugh and Jesse Watters -- now there\u2019s a party.\n\nJust because John Danks and his regularly scheduled lousy starts are gone doesn\u2019t mean Carlos Rodon has to try to fill that role.\n\nSome of the late innings of both the Cubs and White Sox games Tuesday night made you wonder how Carlos Marmol could be in two places at the same time.\n\nWhat\u2019s up, Steve Buechele?", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "I can't imagine Bears coach John Fox doing what Adam Gase just did", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Former Bears offensive coordinator Adam Gase is drawing attention as head coach of the Dolphins for his novel approach to rookie minicamp: There is no camp.", "title": "I can't imagine Bears coach John Fox doing what Adam Gase just did", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/rosenblog/ct-adam-gase-john-fox-rosenbloom-20160511-column.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-57332591/turbine/ct-adam-gase-john-fox-rosenbloom-20160511", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Chicago Bears, Adam Gase, John Fox, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, The Rosenblog", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/87157773", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-05-11", "Description": "Adam Gase's plan would be a radical change for John Fox and all the other football coaches who love having their guys play football and love saying \"football.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Chicago Bears, Adam Gase, John Fox, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, The Rosenblog"}, "article_summary": "See more videosSpeaking of football, football, football, the players Gase took to school might\u2019ve been all footballed out.\nGase\u2019s plan would be a radical change for Fox and all the other football coaches who love having their guys play football and love saying \u201cfootball\u2019\u2019 when talking about football coaches and football players and football, football, football.\nMiami Dolphins head coach Adam Gase starts rookies in the classroom instead of on the field in rookie camp.\nGase talks about changes in rookie camp and the draft Miami Dolphins head coach Adam Gase starts rookies in the classroom instead of on the field in rookie camp.\nI can\u2019t see Gase\u2019s former boss, Bears coach John Fox, going along with this idea."}
