The dismissed count dealt with arguments that Florida has not paid adequate reimbursement rates to doctors and dentists and, as a result, has limited the amount of care available in the Medicaid program.\n\nIn a court document filed last month, plaintiffs in the case acknowledged that the Supreme Court ruling in the Idaho case required that the reimbursement-related count be dismissed. But Jordan agreed with the plaintiffs that two other counts \u2014 which include allegations such as care not being available with \u201creasonable promptness\u201d and outreach to Medicaid-eligible children being inadequate \u2014 should continue forward.\n\nJordan, who began hearing the case as a U.S. district judge but is now an appeals-court judge, held a trial in the case in 2012 and issued a 153-page decision in December that found widespread problems in the way the Medicaid program has provided care to children. The ruling included findings about the effects of low reimbursement rates but also dealt with other issues.\n\nThe December decision set the stage for another phase in the case to determine remedies. But in the meantime, the Supreme Court ruled March 31 in the Idaho case, which involved Medicaid providers arguing that reimbursement rates were too low and seeking to force higher payments. A divided Supreme Court rejected the providers\u2019 arguments.\n\nIn a document filed last month in the Florida case, attorneys representing the state Agency for Health Care Administration argued that the Supreme Court opinion prevents \u201cprivate enforcement\u201d of legal disputes about whether Medicaid is properly providing care. It said the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has enforcement powers.\n\n\u201cThe majority opinion \u2026 reflects the court\u2019s concern that statutory provisions which require enforcement of \u2018judgment-laden\u2019 standards be appropriately enforced by the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as Congress intended and not through private actions,\u201d the state attorneys argued. \u201cThis would ensure that HHS\u2019 \u2018expertise, uniformity, widespread consultation, and resulting administrative guidance could be brought to bear on these issues.\u2019 It would likewise avoid inconsistent interpretations of statute and avoid unintended consequences which may result.\u201d\n\nBut attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a document that Jordan should move forward with the case, even though the Supreme Court decision required dismissal of the reimbursement-related count.\n\n\u201cThis court should strongly reject defendants\u2019 contention that (the Idaho ruling) totally upends the well-established authority authorizing judicial enforcement of beneficiaries\u2019 rights under the Medicaid Act,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys wrote.\n\n\u2013Jim Saunders, News Service of Florida", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida Medicaid's system delays care and outreach to Medicaid-eligible children is inadequate, the federal lawsuit claims.
