Ted Cruz (Tex.) argue during the Republican debate on Thursday in Detroit. (Carlos Osorio/AP)\n\nNineteen states have voted in the Republican presidential primary process. And it\u2019s hard to imagine a more nightmarish scenario for the party\u2019s establishment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re left with a bully and a zealot,\u201d Republican media consultant Kim Alfano said.\n\nAt present, Donald Trump \u2014 the foul-mouthed billionaire who revels in breaking every political rule \u2014 is the favorite for the party\u2019s nomination. The alternative is Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), who may be the least-popular politician in Washington.\n\n[Trump throws the GOP into an identity crisis]\n\nThe only two realistic options for how the race plays out from here are (1) Trump gets the 1,237 delegates he needs to formally become the GOP nominee or (2) he falls short of the requisite delegates but enters the national convention in mid-July in Cleveland with the most delegates of anyone in the field (and with Cruz in second).\n\n1 of 46 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Trump captures the nation\u2019s attention on the campaign trail View Photos The Republican presidential candidate dominated the Super Tuesday contests.

John Sommers II/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nSo in an unsavory choice between the unpredictable Trump and the disliked Cruz, where does the Republican political class \u2014 strategists, major donors and the like \u2014 come down?\n\n\u201cThe difference between Cruz as the nominee and Trump being the nominee is the difference between pain you know you\u2019re going to have and pain you can\u2019t yet predict\u201d but know is coming, said Neil Newhouse, a partner at the Republican polling firm of Public Opinion Strategies.\n\n[The Republican Party\u2019s implosion over Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy has arrived]\n\nThe general-election race, Newhouse noted, would be markedly different depending on the Republican nominee.\n\nIf it\u2019s Cruz vs. Hillary Clinton, \u201cthe fight comes down to its essence \u2014 an ideological battle, with both sides campaigning to energize their bases while appealing to the moderate middle,\u201d he said. Trump vs. Clinton, on the other hand, becomes \u201ca personality-character contest, with less focus on ideology,\u201d Newhouse said.\n\nBut neither Cruz nor Trump are what Republicans hoped for at the start of the 2016 cycle, an election widely touted as one in which some of the party\u2019s supposed brightest stars \u2014 Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and former Florida governor Jeb Bush \u2014 were in the running.\n\n[The Republican establishment really, really doesn\u2019t like Ted Cruz]\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ted Cruz warns there could be an \"uprising\" if the \"Washington establishment\" tries to steal the Republican nomination, and said the campaign has \"gone into the gutter\" at times. (Reuters)\n\nThe problem for the GOP establishment was that its voters didn\u2019t like any of those options. Bush is out. Jindal never even got started. Rubio is hanging on by a thread. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is hoping for a quadruple bank shot over the next month to somehow catapult him into contention.\n\nWant to understand how weak the Republican establishment is and how disconnected it is from its base? Of the 19 states that have voted as of Saturday, an establishment candidate has won a grand total of one: Rubio, in the Minnesota caucuses. (Trump has won 12 contests, and Cruz six.)\n\nYet within some corners of the party, there remains an unwillingness to accept that the choices are \u2014 and will be \u2014 Trump or Cruz. The idea of keeping Trump from the nomination has become the all-encompassing focus of late. But ask the #NeverTrump folks what denying him the nomination means, and they will be loath to admit that the most likely next outcome is Cruz as the Republican nominee. The sense of \u201cwe\u2019ll get it worked out\u201d belies that, at every turn in this race, the establishment\u2019s best-laid plans have blown up.\n\nWhen most professional political Republicans are confronted with the choice between Cruz and Trump, there is an increasing tendency to side with the senator \u2014 a remarkable thing and a testament to just how much concern Trump\u2019s wildness as a candidate has occasioned.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I know what I\u2019m getting with Ted Cruz,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), one of Cruz\u2019s most vocal critics, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday morning. \u201cTactically, I disagree with Ted about shutting down the government to repeal Obamacare. I thought it was a bad idea. But, yeah, if I can work with Ted Cruz, I think that shows that there is hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope\u201d may be too strong a word for what the Republican establishment faces as the November election approaches.
