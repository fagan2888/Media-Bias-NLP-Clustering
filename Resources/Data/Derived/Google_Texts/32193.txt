Utah just scored a brand new hospital, as IASIS Healthcare said it has opened the $80 million Mountain Point Medical Center in the town of Lehi.

The 124,000-square-foot facility is one of five hospitals run by IASIS in the state.

According to IASIS, the hospital was designed to put a greater emphasis on outpatient care, as more hospitals work to lower inpatient utilizations in favor our outpatient or ambulatory care.

The hospital employs more than 250 people, mostly physicians and other medical staff and features a 60,000-square-foot medical office building as part of the campus.

In addition to its five hospitals, IASIS also runs Health Choice Utah, a managed health plan providing Medicaid services to residents in several Utah counties.
