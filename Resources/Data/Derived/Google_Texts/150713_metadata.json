According to a document leaked to The Wall Street Journal, he has summoned dozens of influential evangelical Christian leaders to a meeting at Trump Tower in New York City next month.\n\nYes, Trump -- the thrice-married former reality television star, erstwhile supporter of abortion rights, purveyor of pageants that parade scantily clad teenage girls in front of television cameras, the man whose name is emblazoned on casinos around the world -- is currently leading the Republican field among the most deeply religious segment of the GOP electorate.\n\nRelated: South Carolina GOP Puts Trump in the Crosshairs\n\nHowever, Trump isn\u2019t taking the evangelical vote for granted. A senior adviser told the Journal that Trump will gather the leaders for a \u201cprayer service.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s occasional nods to religion throughout the campaign so far have seemed like afterthoughts. He mentioned at one point that he can\u2019t remember ever asking God for forgiveness, and he talks about the Bible in the same breath as his own bestseller, \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d (Though he says he believes that the Bible is the better book.)\n\nThe outreach to evangelicals, who make up a vocal element of the GOP base, appears to be an effort to expand and solidify Trump\u2019s own base beyond voters who are just generally angry with the government and those particularly concerned about illegal immigration.\n\nTrump is certainly getting some love from the Christian right. On Wednesday, David Brody, the chief political correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network, wrote an adulatory column on the \u201cmagic of Donald Trump\u201d following the billionaire\u2019s well-publicized tangle with Univision newscaster Jorge Ramos on Tuesday night.\n\nRelated: Dump Trump\u2019s Deportation Plan for This Better Way\n\n\u201cMany politicians wouldn\u2019t have the stomach for the fight or if they did engage, they wouldn\u2019t have turned the tables as deftly as Trump,\u201d Brody wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s what voters want. They want a fighter. They want someone who is going to dish it back to agenda-setting reporters. You see, when it comes to the liberal mainstream media, conservative voters hold a true disdain for the lot of them but they don\u2019t feel they have the power or bully pulpit to fight back against them. Trump is their bully pulpit. Trump is their voice. And that my friends, is the magic of Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump delivered an \u201cattaboy\u201d to Brody in his increasingly influential Twitter feed on Wednesday.\n\nThe idea of the Christian right getting behind Trump \u2013 and it\u2019s not clear that the leaders are actually on board at this point \u2013 must seem like part of a continuing nightmare for the other candidates in the race.\n\nTrump has already grabbed the \u201cangry\u201d vote, much of which might otherwise have gravitated to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie or retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. If he can start to solidify support among members of the Christian right, that would also hurt Cruz, who just this week hosted a conference call with conservative pastors from across the country.\n\nRelated: Ailes Blasts Trump for His \u2018Disturbing\u2019 New Attack on Kelly\n\nBut it would also take a big bite out of Mike Huckabee, himself a former evangelical pastor, as well as other highly religious candidates including Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and, probably to a lesser extent, former Florida governor Jeb Bush.\n\nWhether Trump can really attract a strong following among evangelicals is an open question. But what\u2019s not is whether Trump can consistently beat expectations when it comes to amassing supporters.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Real estate billionaire and celebrity presidential candidate Donald Trump has apparently decided that claiming the Bible is his favorite book just isn\u2019t enough to earn him the continued support of the more religious elements of the Republican Party.
