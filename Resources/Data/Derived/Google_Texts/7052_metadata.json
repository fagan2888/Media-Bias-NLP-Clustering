Things like guest relations, concierge (and) entertainment,\u201d Corless said.\n\n\n\nDespite Orlando\u2019s booming tourist numbers, Disney is seeing problems at other locations.\n\n\n\nDisney Shanghai has been delayed and is around $1.5 billion over initial costs.\n\n\n\n\"When something bad happens on one side of Disney, it can send ripple effects to the other businesses, and that may be some of the cost-cutting moves we've seen announced,\u201d theme park analyst Sean Snaith said.\n\n\n\nCorless said there will be fewer character meet-and-greets, and some parades, like Fantasmic and the Main Street Electrical Parade, will be cut to once a night.\n\n\n\nThe change shouldn\u2019t be permanent, but the change is indicative of a company with a global reach.\n\n\n\n\"That doesn't mean it's not immune from shocks in Shanghai or Brazil and that doesn't mean Disney can just sit on its laurels,\u201d Snaith said.\n\n\n\nThe unions could not be reached for comment.\n\n\u201cWe are adding new attractions and entertainment offerings this year in addition to significant expansions opening next year and beyond. As our business continues to grow, we regularly make adjustments in our operations to ensure we are able to deliver great Guest and Cast experiences in the most efficient way possible,\" a Disney spokesperson said.\n\nSome cast members could end up having longer hours next week. The union contract only dictates that Disney maximize a 35 to 40 hour work week for employees.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s parks have seen a similar rollback on employee hours.\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2016 Cox Media Group.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Disney is coming off its most successful quarterly earnings report in company history, but many employees at Orlando parks learned their hours would be cut.", "author": "EndPlay", "og": {"site_name": "WFTV", "description": "Disney is coming off its most successful quarterly earnings report in company history, but many employees at Orlando parks learned their hours would be cut.", "title": "Disney to cut back on employee hours despite boom in Florida tourism", "url": "http://www.wftv.com/news/local/disney-to-cut-back-on-employee-hours-despite-boom-in-florida-tourism/92872509", "image": {"height": 90, "width": 160, "altText": "Disney World", "identifier": "http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2016/02/18/disney_1455822967712_1942909_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "title": "Disney World"}, "locale": "en_US", "video": {"description": "Disney is coming off its most successful quarterly earnings report in company history, but many employees at Orlando parks learned their hours would be cut.", "title": "Disney to cut back on employee hours despite boom in Florida tourism", "height": 0, "width": 0, "thumbnailUrl": "http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2016/02/18/Disney_to_cut_back_on_employee_hours_des_0_1943462_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "content-type": "video"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Disney is coming off its most successful quarterly earnings report in company history, but many employees at Orlando parks learned their hours would be cut.", "title": "Disney to cut back on employee hours despite boom in Florida tourism", "url": "http://www.wftv.com/news/local/disney-to-cut-back-on-employee-hours-despite-boom-in-florida-tourism/92872509", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2016/02/18/disney_1455822967712_1942909_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@WFTV", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Local,News,Orange County, StoryKeywords", "article": {"section": "Local", "published_time": "2016-02-18T22:06:52+0000", "expiration_time": "2018-02-07T19:18:00+0000", "modified_time": "2016-02-18T22:06:52+0000"}, "page-type": "article", "content_id": 92872509, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "News Template - DO NOT PUBLISH"}, "article_summary": "Disney Shanghai has been delayed and is around $1.5 billion over initial costs.\n\"That doesn't mean it's not immune from shocks in Shanghai or Brazil and that doesn't mean Disney can just sit on its laurels,\u201d Snaith said.\nCalifornia\u2019s parks have seen a similar rollback on employee hours.\nTom Corless, of WDW New Today, a Disney insider website, said an unknown number of employees will have their hours cut to 32 a week during the busy spring season.\nThe union contract only dictates that Disney maximize a 35 to 40 hour work week for employees."}
