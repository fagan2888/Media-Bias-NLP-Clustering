In an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Rosica said the pope\u2019s \u201cplaybook\u201d for the visit will not be \u201ca political manual,\u201d but rather \u201cthe gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat I do think is going to happen \u2026 is that he's coming as the cardinal said, as a pastor of souls, and his playbook for this visit, the lexicon, if you will, is not a political manual, it's not the handbook of a particular party, it's the gospel of Jesus Christ, which cuts across all divisions, which cuts across all of our categories,\u201d Rosica said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut in dealing with those real problems, Father Rosica, one thing about this pope, is that he\u2019s willing to step on feet on all sides of various issues. He's also going to be meeting with President Obama, and I don't have to tell you the Catholic Church is in something of a struggle with the Obama administration about the issue of religious freedom and the debate about the Obamacare mandate when it comes to contraception and insurance coverage of that, birth control by church-related groups. Do you expect him to bring that up with the president?\u201d Fox host Chris Wallace asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Rosica said, \u201cbut what I do think is going to happen \u2026 is that he's coming as the cardinal said, as a pastor of souls, and his playbook for this visit, the lexicon, if you will, is not a political manual, it's not the handbook of a particular party, it's the gospel of Jesus Christ, which cuts across all divisions, which cuts across all of our categories.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe beauty of this pope is we can't pigeonhole him. He's a gentleman. He deals with heads of state with great grace and dignity,\u201d said Rosica.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe visit to the White House, the president and his wife, and the whole team at the White House are doing a very good job, and they have a certain decorum that's required of them at that stage to welcome the pope as the greatest, I should say, not just the great, the greatest moral leader in the world right now, and this is an opportunity for the president and his whole team to welcome him and to listen to the message of a peacemaker,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe backdrop of this whole visit is not what's happening in American politics or a presidential campaign. The backdrop is a world steeped in violence and bloodshed and rancor and hatred, and here we have coming to your city, to our diocese, a real prince of peace. If there's any princely title that should be associated with Francis, it's a prince of peace, it's a bringer of peace,\u201d Rosica said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen peacemakers come, they upset those who are not at peace. So, if people are going to be upset in any side of the spectrum here, let them look inside themselves and see what those issues are first, because in the presence of Francis, as you know and as I know, you're in the presence of extraordinary goodness, of kindness, of intelligence and of humanity. So, humanity is coming to teach us how to be more human,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "If you\u2019re expecting Pope Francis to address the Obamacare contraceptive mandate or religious freedom when he visits the nation\u2019s capital on Tuesday, Father Thomas Rosica, adviser to the Vatican, said that won\u2019t happen.
