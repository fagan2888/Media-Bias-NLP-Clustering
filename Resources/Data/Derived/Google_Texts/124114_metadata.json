(CNN)\n\nDespite the suspect\u2019s initial claims that he had been hungry and acting purely out of self-interest when he held up a Paris-bound train last Friday, the French government is now officially investigating the foiled attempt by 26-year-old Moroccan gunman Ayoub El-Khazzani as a terrorist act.\n\nAs The New York Times reported Tuesday, El-Khazzani\u2019s consumption of streaming media just prior to the attack\u2014which a trio of Americans, along with British and French citizens, stopped\u2014represents a major fact informing French officials\u2019 strategy:\n\nFrench authorities formally opened a terrorism investigation on Tuesday after a thwarted attack on a high-speed train last week, saying the suspected gunman had watched a jihadi video onboard minutes before the violence. The decision to open an investigation was based on the actions by 26-year-old Moroccan suspect Ayoub El-Khazzani on the train Friday night and information from other European authorities about his travels and apparent links to radical Islam, prosecutor Francois Molins said. Molins said El-Khazzani notably watched the online video on his phone minutes before he walked through the Amsterdam-to-Paris train carrying an assault rifle and other weapons. Authorities say that they found the suspect\u2019s phone in a bag left in the train.\n\nThe paper added that investigators will probably file preliminary charges against El-Khazzani soon.\n\n\u2014Posted by Kasia Anderson\n\nMore Below the Ad", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ak-47, alek skarlatos, anthony sadler, ayoub el-khazzani, france, fran\u00e7ois hollande, islamist, legion of honor, mark mooligan, paris, spencer stone, terrorism, train, train attack", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "Despite the suspect\u2019s initial claims that he had been hungry and acting purely out of self-interest when he held up a Paris-bound train last Friday, the French government is now officially investigating the foiled attempt by 26-year-old Moroccan gunman Ayoub El-Khazzani as a terrorist act. \n - 2015/08/25", "title": "France Treating Thwarted Train Attack as a Terrorist Case", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/france_treating_thwarted_train_attack_as_a_terrorist_case_20150825", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/francesuspect_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite the suspect\u2019s initial claims that he had been hungry and acting purely out of self-interest when he held up a Paris-bound train last Friday, the French government is now officially investigating the foiled attempt by 26-year-old Moroccan gunman Ayoub El-Khazzani as a terrorist act.", "title": "France Treating Thwarted Train Attack as a Terrorist Case | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/france_treating_thwarted_train_attack_as_a_terrorist_case_20150825/", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/francesuspect_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "creator": "@truthdig", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, France Treating Thwarted Train Attack as a Terrorist Case, ak-47, alek skarlatos, anthony sadler, ayoub el-khazzani, france, fran\u00e7ois hollande, islamist, legion of honor, mark mooligan, paris, spencer stone, terrorism, train, train attack", "article": {"tag": "ak-47, alek skarlatos, anthony sadler, ayoub el-khazzani, france, fran\u00e7ois hollande, islamist, legion of honor, mark mooligan, paris, spencer stone, terrorism, train, train attack", "published_time": "2015-08-25T11:21:35-08:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-25T13:57:36-08:00"}, "description": "Despite the suspect\u2019s initial claims that he had been hungry and acting purely out of self-interest when he held up a Paris-bound train last Friday, the French government is now officially investigating the foiled attempt by 26-year-old Moroccan gunman Ayoub El-Khazzani as a terrorist act. \n - 2015/08/25"}, "article_summary": "French train attack suspect Ayoub El-Khazzani.\nAuthorities say that they found the suspect\u2019s phone in a bag left in the train.\nMolins said El-Khazzani notably watched the online video on his phone minutes before he walked through the Amsterdam-to-Paris train carrying an assault rifle and other weapons.\nThe decision to open an investigation was based on the actions by 26-year-old Moroccan suspect Ayoub El-Khazzani on the train Friday night and information from other European authorities about his travels and apparent links to radical Islam, prosecutor Francois Molins said.\nThe paper added that investigators will probably file preliminary charges against El-Khazzani soon."}
