All 17 seasons of \u201cSouth Park\u201d will be available for free until the Sept. 24 premiere of the animated Comedy Central series\u2019 18th season.\n\nAfter that, Hulu Plus subscribers will have access to the entire South Park library. Their still outrageous \u201cSouth Park\u201d will air simultaneously on SouthParkStudios.com and on Hulu. The online streaming service will have 244 episodes of the series, they announced at today\u2019s TCA press tour in Los Angeles.\n\nWhy Hulu?\n\nMatt: we were first trying to figure out how to rip off their player. then realized we couldn\u2019t.\n\nTrey: We always want our shows to have the best presentation. In the back of our minds we were thinking about how we could partner with Hulu.\u201d\n\nThe pair said they still write and direct every episode themselves. Reminiscing about how technology and TV have changed, both Parker and Stone marveled that their \u201cSpirit of Christmas\u201d was a viral video before viral videos. (It was passed around Hollywood as people copied and shared it on VHS.)\n\nAsked about future projects, they said they are \u201ctoying with a couple of things but nothing big.\u201d As far as keeping the creative juices flowing, \u201cSouth Park\u201d is \u201clike working out every day. When we\u2019re not working we\u2019re worthless,\u201d Stone said.\n\nHow old do they imagine their young kids need to be before they\u2019ll let them watch?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about 10 or 12 years payback time\u201d from their kids (each has a daughter now).", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Hulu,Matt Stone,South Park,Spirit of Christmas,Trey Parker,viral video", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ostrow Off The Record", "description": "Colorado's bad boys Trey Parker and Matt Stone have struck a deal with Hulu.
