Hopefully, Mr. Besson can use some extra brain power to figure out a way to bring Lucy back for another adventure.\n\nBest extras: This weak selection of bonus content only includes a 16-minute long marketing featurette \u201cThe Evolution of Lucy\u201d and a 10-minute discussion on its baseless scientific premise called \u201cCerebral Capacity: The True Science of Lucy.\u201d\n\nSeems if Mr. Besson believed as passionately in the \u201c10 percent\u201d theory as he claims in the onscreen interviews, Universal could have invested in a much longer documentary, covering both sides of the issue and taking a deeper look at the brain, clearly one of the most powerful and mysterious organs in the body.\n\nRead all about it: Universal released an online motion comic (http://www.lucymovie.com/intl/uk/graphicnovel/20/) offering some key scenes from the film based on Lucy\u2019s abilities. Devoid of words, it\u2019s basically a beautifully illustrated, slightly animated (triggered by scrolling down the Web page) storyboard but worth appreciating.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scarlett Johansson expands her mind to action-packed levels in director Luc Besson's sci-fi action movie, now available in the high definition format.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Scarlett Johansson expands her mind to action-packed levels in director Luc Besson\u2019s sci-fi action movie, now available in the high definition format.", "title": "Zadzooks: Lucy review (Blu-ray)", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/7/zadzooks-lucy-review-blu-ray/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/07/lucy-900.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/07/lucy-900.jpg", "description": "Scarlett Johansson expands her mind to action-packed levels in director Luc Besson's sci-fi action movie, now available in the high definition format.", "card": "summary", "title": "Zadzooks: Lucy review (Blu-ray)"}, "Author": "Joseph Szadkowski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Luc Besson, Scarlett Johansson"}, "article_summary": "Hopefully, Mr. Besson can use some extra brain power to figure out a way to bring Lucy back for another adventure.\nAs Lucy, I have to believe that Miss Johansson found herself emotionally strangled by her character.\nFamed \u201cFifth Element\u201d director Luc Besson offered movie audiences a mind-expanding, sci-fi film last August.\nAs the movie plays out, the more brain capacity used by Lucy, the more stoic and apathetic to humanity she becomes, robbing us of the actress\u2019 charismatic talents.\nRead all about it: Universal released an online motion comic (http://www.lucymovie.com/intl/uk/graphicnovel/20/) offering some key scenes from the film based on Lucy\u2019s abilities."}
