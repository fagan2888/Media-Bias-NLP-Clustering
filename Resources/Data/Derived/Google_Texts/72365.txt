Detectives say the man accused of fatally shooting a woman and injuring a man knew the victims and met with them at a Waffle House on Dorchester Road before the incident.

Officials say Davey Ramsey has been charged with murder and attempted murder in a shooting that took place on the 6800 block of Ridgebrook Drive at 12:46 a.m. Easter Sunday.

A judge denied bond for Ramsey Monday morning.

"The suspect reportedly picked up the victims and were heading to the Ridgebrook Drive residence of one of the victims when some type altercation took place resulting in shots being fired by the suspect," a spokesman for the North Charleston Police Department said.

Shalaine Jenkins, 20, was found suffering a gunshot wound in the roadway. She was declared dead on scene.

A male victim was found in front of a home with a gunshot wound to the upper right chest. He was taken to MUSC.

The investigation is ongoing.
