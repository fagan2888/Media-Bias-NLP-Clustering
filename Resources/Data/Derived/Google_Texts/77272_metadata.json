Ted Cruz, R-Texas, interrupted the smooth passage of what has been called Cromnibus and led to a weekend session that arguably gave outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid an opportunity to advance several of President Obama\u2019s nominees toward confirmation, including the once-stalled nomination of Murthy.\n\nOn Saturday, after the Senate voted 52-40 to bring Murthy\u2019s nomination to the floor for a vote, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., gleefully tweeted, \u201cWas worried Dr. Vivek Murthy might not get confirmed but thanks to @Ted Cruz, looks like he will. #TopDocNow #SurgeonGeneral.\u201d With Murthy confirmed to a post that had been vacant since July 2013, the White House push for gun control will proceed with renewed vigor.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s Chris Cox called Murthy a \u201cprescription for disaster for America\u2019s gun owners,\u201d in a letter to Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in February. Spooked red-state Democrats stalled Vivek\u2019s nomination. With the election over and control of the Senate lost anyway, Democrats seized the opportunity to leave America a going-away present.\n\nSince Reid detonated the nuclear option and changed the filibuster rule for nominees from needing 60 votes to just 51 votes, only one Obama nominee has been defeated. That was the nomination of Debo Adegbile to head the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division. Adegbile lost, largely due to his involvement in the case of cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted in the murder of Philadelphia police officer Danny Faulkner.\n\nMurthy is indeed a prescription for disaster for American gun rights. He has long set his sights on gutting the Second Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms, a right the Supreme Court has said is not only an individual right, but also a national one.\n\nGun control zealots had argued that the Second Amendment guaranteed only a \u201cwell-regulated militia\u201d had that right, meaning the National Guard, and that even if it were an individual right, it applied only to the federal enclave of the District of Columbia.\n\nMurthy\u2019s approach to attacking the Second Amendment has been to say private ownership of firearms is a public health issue. The 37-year-old Murthy is president and co-founder of the anti-gun group Doctors for America, which advocates ObamaCare and gun control laws. His group, which has been dubbed Docs vs. Glocks, has pushed Congress to ban \u201cassault\u201d weapons and \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines.\n\nDoctors for America has promoted the invasion of privacy by doctors by advocating they ask patients if they have guns at home, including asking children if their parents own guns. He would have doctors counsel their patients against exercising their Second Amendment rights. One wonders how private that information would remain if entered into the medical records the government would be privy to under ObamaCare.\n\nMillions of law-abiding Americans believe that a gun in their hand is better than a cop on the phone and that their constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms is inoculation against being another unarmed victim of an armed predator.\n\nMurthy\u2019s answer to crime is don\u2019t defend yourself and your family, but take two bullets and call him in the morning.\n\nIt\u2019s a bad prescription for all of us.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rights: No longer fearing electoral revenge from the National Rifle Association, an outgoing Democratic Senate pushed to confirm an anti-Second Amendment", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Rights: No longer fearing electoral revenge from the National Rifle Association, an outgoing Democratic Senate pushed to confirm an anti-Second Amendment radical, who thinks guns are a health issue\u2026", "title": "Lame Duck Dems Push Anti-Gun Murthy As Surgeon General", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/lame-duck-vivek-murthy-surgeon-general/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDeditorials"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2014-12-15 15:46:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-15T15:46:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee8f\"", "article_summary": "The 37-year-old Murthy is president and co-founder of the anti-gun group Doctors for America, which advocates ObamaCare and gun control laws.\nMurthy\u2019s approach to attacking the Second Amendment has been to say private ownership of firearms is a public health issue.\nHe would have doctors counsel their patients against exercising their Second Amendment rights.\n#TopDocNow #SurgeonGeneral.\u201d With Murthy confirmed to a post that had been vacant since July 2013, the White House push for gun control will proceed with renewed vigor.\nMurthy is indeed a prescription for disaster for American gun rights."}
