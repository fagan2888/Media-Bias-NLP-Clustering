According to a document about ACA and UC SHIP (the health care program some UC campuses use) issued by the University of California, the ACA, first passed in 2010, makes three important changes to the health care system.\n\nFirst, starting in 2014, insurance companies cannot deny coverage to Americans with pre-existing medical conditions. Second, almost everyone must have medical coverage or face a fine. Third, health insurance will be more affordable for low-income individuals and families due to subsidies based on household income and family size.\n\nStudents, faculty, and staff across campus have reacted to the law and the potential changes it brings to the United States health care system and UCSB\u2019s Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI). All UCSB students are automatically enrolled in GHI unless they can show proof that they have appropriate coverage elsewhere.\n\nMary Ferris, Student Health\u2019s Executive Director, shared her experience with the new law.\n\n\u201cUCSB students will see expanded health insurance benefits and more choices as a result of ACA,\u201d Ferris said. \u201cAlready the new minimum benefit requirements mandated by the law have resulted in great new health insurance coverage for students: no additional cost for birth control, no benefit caps on prescriptions or annual/lifetime maximums, and no limits on any specific type of visits such as acupuncture or chiropractic care.\u201d\n\nOther benefits she cited are the ability for students to obtain coverage through their parents\u2019 insurance plans and the inability for insurance to refuse coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\nOn the other hand, Ferris acknowledged that many students might opt out of purchasing GHI, which required higher premiums this year due to expanded benefits.\n\n\u201cFor Student Health, we may be faced with many challenges to continue our high level of services if students purchase different insurance plans that require them to seek care outside of Student Health,\u201d Ferris said.\n\nIn other words, if UCSB students choose to purchase insurance outside of the university, UCSB\u2019s Student Health will receive less funding.\n\nFerris\u2019s worries seemed largely based on concern for the wellbeing of students.\n\n\u201cWe are worried that students will be tempted to purchase other plans with minimal benefits, based only on the lowest price, and then find themselves with huge medical costs after an emergency room visit,\u201d Ferris said.\n\nFerris stated that negotiations regarding prices and coverage for 2014-15 have begun, and she encouraged students to join the GHI Advisory committee.\n\nWhile Ferris\u2019 evaluation of the ACA\u2019s immediate effects on UCSB students seemed primarily positive, other students and faculty do not share her enthusiasm. Cameron Rankin, a UCSB third-year and Executive Director of the UCSB College Republicans, condemned the ACA for a variety of reasons.\n\n\u201cThe most prominent [drawback] is the penalty Americans will face if they violate the mandate to purchase insurance,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cThis penalty carries the maximum fine of 2.5 percent of an individual\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Rankin expressed disapproval toward the potentially rising cost of health insurance.\n\n\u201cAs young and generally healthy people, our insurance rates historically have been the lowest of any age group,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cHowever, the new law requires that the high cost of insuring the elderly would be subsidized by passing the astronomical cost to us.\u201d\n\nLastly, Rankin cited increases in taxes as a major problem for many Americans.\n\n\u201cThere are 20 tax increases or entirely new taxes that will pull on the pockets of every American during the midst of a precarious economic recovery,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2014, when every aspect of the ACA goes into full effect, the effects it will have on campus will become much more clear.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Student Admin", "og": {"url": "https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/10/affordable-care-act-sparks-controversy-on-ucsb-campus", "site_name": "The Bottom Line", "type": "article", "description": "Allyson Werner National Beat Reporter The government reopened on Wednesday, Oct. 16, and, as a result, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has received the funding it needs.
