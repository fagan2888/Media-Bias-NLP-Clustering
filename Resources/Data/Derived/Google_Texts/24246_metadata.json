He was 69.\n\nVan Wieren was in the booth with the Braves between 1975 and 2008. If you ever tuned into a Braves game on TBS you heard the voices of Hall of Fame pitcher Don Sutton, Ernie Johnson, Skip Caray and Van Wieren. Only Sutton remains with us.\n\nI enjoyed Van Wieren\u2019s low key approach behind the mike. He was tremendously knowledgable, but he didn\u2019t let it get in the way of the game.\n\nDavid O\u2019Brien of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shares his memories of Van Wieren here.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf47\"", "article_summary": "Former Atlanta Braves broadcaster Pete Van Wieren passed away this morning after a long battle with lymphoma.\nVan Wieren was in the booth with the Braves between 1975 and 2008.\nDavid O\u2019Brien of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shares his memories of Van Wieren here.\nI enjoyed Van Wieren\u2019s low key approach behind the mike.\nIf you ever tuned into a Braves game on TBS you heard the voices of Hall of Fame pitcher Don Sutton, Ernie Johnson, Skip Caray and Van Wieren."}
