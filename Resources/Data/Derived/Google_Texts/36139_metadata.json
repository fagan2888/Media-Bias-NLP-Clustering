Rand Paul\u2019s amendment last Thursday to pause immigration from more than 30 Muslim nations with jihadist movements. Rubio claimed he did so because Paul\u2019s amendment would delay the travel plans of tourists\u2014 such as those seeking to go to Disneyland\u2014 by 30 days. Rubio said that had the amendment been simply limited to pausing immigration from those thirty countries, the amendment \u201cwould have had a lot of support, including mine.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHowever, Rubio\u2019s declaration that he would have voted to curb Muslim immigration runs contrary to a voting record which reveals the exact opposite. Indeed, Rubio\u2019s two signature immigration proposals\u2014the Obama-backed Gang of Eight bill and the Zuckerberg-backed I-Squared bill\u2013would both substantially increase Muslim immigration. Moreover, even after the Paris attacks, Rubio expressed his desire to admit Syrian refugees. All admissions of Syrian refugees would be additional to the admission of the existing inflow of tens of thousands of refugees and asylees.\n\nIn fact, in an earlier Hannity interview, Rubio said he\u2019d \u201chate to use'\u201dthe funding bill to block Obama\u2019s plan to expand Muslim refugee resettlement, saying that, \u201cYou\u2019d hate to use that [i.e. the funding mechanisms] because it would impact all refugees if you did it that way.\u201d\n\nIn Monday\u2019s interview, Rubio told Hannity:\n\n[Senator Paul\u2019s amendment] basically suspended all visa waiver travel, from anywhere in the world, and I think that\u2019s a step too far. I mean, you\u2019re talking about somebody\u2019s coming from Germany to go to vacation at Disney World, they literally would not have been able to come, because it put a 30-day suspension on all visa waiver travel from everywhere, from every country. So, it didn\u2019t need to go that far. But, the elements of it that would have limited to those countries, I think would have had a lot of support, including mine.\n\nRubio\u2019s suggestion that he would have supported Paul\u2019s amendment to curb Muslim immigration runs counter to his votes and statements in which he has indicated clear support for large-scale immigration from Muslim nations with jihadist populations.\n\nThe 2013 immigration bill Rubio co-authored with Chuck Schumer would have allowed large expansions in Muslim immigration. In 2013, the U.S. issued about 280,000 visas to Muslim migrants. This figure includes temporary guest-worker and student visas as well as green cards. Had Rubio\u2019s immigration bill gone into effect, the bill would have tripled the nation\u2019s issuance of all green cards over the next decade and would have doubled the nation\u2019s distribution of guest-worker visas. The bill would have also expanded opportunities for Muslim refugees to enter the United States.\n\nAs the Federation For American Immigration Reform explained in its analysis at the time: \u201cTitle III Subtitle D of S.744 [the Rubio-Schumer bill] undermines current asylum and refugee law by eliminating preexisting requirements aliens apply for asylum within a certain time frame of entering the U.S., allowing asylum officers to bypass immigration judges before granting asylum to unlawful aliens, and giving broad authority to the Administration to create new categories of refugees and stateless persons to be admitted into the country.\u201d\n\nConservative Review\u2019s Daniel Horowitz explained that Rubio\u2019s \u201cbill would have created endless avenues for this president to bring in an unlimited numbers of Islamic immigrants from the most volatile corners of the world.\u201d\n\nYet Rubio, only 16 days ago, said he stood by the provision in his Pelosi-backed immigration plan, telling The Guardian that his 2013 bill would \u201cstrengthen the refugee program.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s tendency to deliver one message on conservative talk radio while doing the opposite legislatively is not new.\n\nFor instance, in 2013 Rubio told told Sean Hannity that his La Raza-backed bill would not grant amnesty until the border is secure. Rubio said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of that [amnesty] begins until we certify that the border security progress has been real. That a workplace enforcement mechanism is in place. That we are tracking visitors to our country, especially when they exit.\u201d Rubio told Rush Limbaugh that if that were not the case, he\u2019d vote against his own bill. Rubio said: \u201cIf there is not language in this bill that guarantees that nothing else will happen unless these enforcement mechanisms are in place, I won\u2019t support it.\u201d\n\nHowever, Chuck Schumer made clear that the bill would grant amnesty to the illegal population \u201con day one.\u201d Rubio later disclosed this truth himself in a Spanish language interview, as the Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York exposed. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d Rubio said in a Univision interview. \u201cNobody is talking about preventing the legalization. The legalization is going to happen. That means the following will happen: First comes the legalization. Then come the measures to secure the border. And then comes the process of permanent residence.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the National Review documented many of Rubio\u2019s misrepresentations about his bill and his positions:\n\n[Rubio] has supposedly discovered that the enforcement provisions are inadequate, although he has done countless interviews touting that the bill contains the \u2018toughest immigration-enforcement measures in the history of United States\u2019 (which is what his website still says). At the same time, Rubio declares the bill 95\u201396 percent perfect.\n\nIn 2013, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Union President Chris Crane accused Rubio of having \u201cdirectly misled law enforcement officers.\u201d Crane said \u201cSen. Rubio left unchanged legislative provisions that he himself admitted to us in private were detrimental, flawed and must be changed.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump recently told Breitbart News, \u201cSenator Rubio is incapable of telling the truth. He should be disqualified for dishonesty alone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an interview with talk radio host Sean Hannity, Marco Rubio misrepresented his position on curbing migration from jihadist countries.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "In an interview with talk radio host Sean Hannity, Marco Rubio misrepresented his position on curbing migration from jihadist countries.", "title": "Marco Rubio Misrepresents on Muslim Immigration to Hannity", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Rubio-Speaks-Out-of-Both-Sides-of-His-Mouth.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2015/12/08/marco-rubio-misrepresents-position-muslim-immigration-sean-hannity/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an interview with talk radio host Sean Hannity, Marco Rubio misrepresented his position on curbing migration from jihadist countries.", "title": "Marco Rubio Misrepresents on Muslim Immigration to Hannity", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Rubio-Speaks-Out-of-Both-Sides-of-His-Mouth.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Chris Crane, Chuck Schumer, Daniel Horowitz, gang of eight, La Raza, Rush Limbaugh, Zuckerberg,2016 Presidential Race, Immigration, Jihad,Marco Rubio", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Zuckerberg", "published_time": "2015-12-08T16:15:49-07:00", "categories": "Immigration,Jihad,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The 2013 immigration bill Rubio co-authored with Chuck Schumer would have allowed large expansions in Muslim immigration.\nFor instance, in 2013 Rubio told told Sean Hannity that his La Raza-backed bill would not grant amnesty until the border is secure.\nIndeed, Rubio\u2019s two signature immigration proposals\u2014the Obama-backed Gang of Eight bill and the Zuckerberg-backed I-Squared bill\u2013would both substantially increase Muslim immigration.\nDuring Monday\u2019s interview, Hannity pressed Rubio on why he voted against Sen.
