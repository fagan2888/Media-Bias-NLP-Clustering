But recent research is beginning to unlock some of the mysteries.\n\nPlug-in vehicles\u2014those that run entirely on battery power or that combine electric and gasoline drives\u2014represent less than 1% of total U.S. vehicle sales, but in the past three years their numbers have grown rapidly. Sales nearly tripled in 2012 and are on track to nearly double this year, according to the Electric Drive Transportation Association, a trade group.\n\nSince 2009, the EV Project\u2014financed with grants from the U.S. Energy Department and operated by Ecotality Inc., a maker of electric charging stations\u2014has been collecting and analyzing data from more than 8,000 drivers of electric vehicles.\n\nAmong the findings: Owners of electric cars drive less, possibly because they are using electric vehicles primarily for short trips, to work or the grocery. Or it may be that they fear running out of juice. A separate survey found that limited range caused many EV owners to avoid longer or discretionary trips\u2014to the movie theater or to visit friends, for instance.\n\nThe EV Project's data also shows that buyers of plug-in vehicles are relatively more affluent than the average motorist. That reflects the cost of the vehicles: General Motors Co.'s gas-and-electric Chevrolet Volt costs around $40,000, while the all-electric Nissan Leaf sells for about $30,000. Owners are also more likely to be \"greener\"\u2014a large portion of electric-car buyers report having solar panels.\n\nThe results are important for the utilities that build, maintain and operate the power grid. EV Project data show that owners of electric vehicles tend to cluster in the same neighborhoods and plug in at similar times\u2014usually in the evening. This can increase the load on a single transformer significantly, and lead to the equipment aging more quickly, as well as to power outages.\n\n\u2014Yuliya Chernova\n\nEmail: yuliya.chernova@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2013-09-22T21:17:00.000Z", "article.section": "Special", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "A close-up look at a small but fast-growing group of Americans", "title": "Who Drives Electric Cars?", "image": {"alt": "Who drives electric cars?
