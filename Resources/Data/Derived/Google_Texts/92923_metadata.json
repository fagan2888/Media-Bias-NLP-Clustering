All are untrue, but they\u2019re being told all over America.\u201d\n\n\u2013Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), remarks on the floor of the Senate, Feb. 26, 2014\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that every one of the Koch brothers\u2019 ads are a lie, but I\u2019ll say this: Mr. President, the vast, vast majority of them are.\u201d\n\n\u2013Reid, a few hours later\n\nBy popular demand from readers, we will take a look at these statements by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) He made his comments as part of a harsh attack on the billionaire Koch brothers, who have backed Americans for Prosperity, a political group that has spent $30 million in the past six months, virtually all on ads attacking Democrats who support the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. At one point, he even declared, the brothers had \u201cno conscience\u201d and were \u201cun-American\u201d \u2014 political rhetoric that some might argue goes too far, given Reid\u2019s office.\n\nTaken by itself, as a blanket comment that all tales of woe under the new law are false, Reid\u2019s first statement appears ridiculous. But we don\u2019t like to play gotcha here at The Fact Checker. From the context \u2014 the focus on the Koch brothers \u2014 Reid appeared to be focusing on the tales told in the ads sponsored by AFP.\n\nAfter an eruption on Twitter and other social media, Reid returned to the floor to amend his statement: \u201cI can\u2019t say that every one of the Koch brothers\u2019 ads are a lie, but I\u2019ll say this: Mr. President, the vast, vast majority of them are.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator Reid wanted to be accurate so he went back to the floor to correct the record,\u201d said his spokesman Adam Jentleson. \u201cSenator Reid\u2019s argument is with the shadowy, secretive billionaires behind the ads who are spending millions to rig the system to benefit themselves and the corporations they control, not the people in the ads.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it appears Reid misspoke the first time, so we will evaluate his second statement. For the record, The Fact Checker awards Pinocchios but shies away from the word \u201clie\u201d because it is such a harsh, personal judgment. The Pinocchio scale is based on the idea that there are various types of misstatements, some worse than others.\n\nThe Facts\n\nBy our count on You Tube, Americans for Prosperity has run about 50 anti-Obamacare ads since July. Many are repetitive or on the same theme, frequently citing PolitiFact\u2019s designation of an Obama statement on the law as \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d Some of the Obamacare ads even feature actors, not real people, which some people might argue crosses a line.\n\nBut many of these ads have never been vetted by fact checkers. However, those that have faced scrutiny generally have not fared well.\n\nThe Fact Checker, for instance, has examined five of these ads, and has given four of them Two Pinocchios. However, one received just a single Pinocchio, and we praised it for sticking relatively close to the facts for an attack ad. (Update, March 11: One of the Two Pinocchio ads was downgraded to Three Pinocchios after new information emerged.)\n\nOne ad The Fact Checker evaluated starred a women in Michigan named Julie Boonstra. We raised serious questions about her allegations in this ad\u2014as did our colleagues at PolitiFact\u2014and our analysis was cited by Paul Krugman in the New York Times. Reid, in turn, cited Krugman in his floor speech.\n\nPolitiFact, meanwhile, has looked at six of these ads. In two cases, it said it did not have enough facts for its Truth-O-Meter, but otherwise it awarded one \u201chalf true,\u201d two \u201cmostly false,\u201d and one \u201cfalse\u201d for these ads. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org do not use a rating system, but have faulted two of the ads for lacking context or being wrong.\n\nWe should note that AFP is very aggressive with its ads. In the past, it has earned Four Pinocchios from The Fact Checker, and more than 80 percent of its PolitiFact ratings have been Pants on Fire, False or Mostly False. (The percentage declines if you include ads that did not yield a rating.) It has never earned a True or Mostly True rating, which for some political organizations might be a badge of honor.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nReid claimed that a \u201cvast, vast majority\u201d of AFP\u2019s Obamacare ads are lies. Vast majority is an imprecise and hackneyed phrase, but presumably it is above 75 percent. We\u2019re not sure what a \u201cvast, vast majority\u201d would be.\n\nWe also are not sure what would qualify as a \u201clie\u201d though on balance we might reserve that for Four Pinocchio or Pants on Fire and/or False statements. (Others might add \u201cmostly false\u201d and Three Pinocchio statements to the \u201clie\u201d pile, but personally that seems to go too far.)\n\nBut only one of the Obamacare ads vetted by the Fact Checker or PolitiFact achieved such ratings, though all had various problems and statements that went too far. Meanwhile, our colleague Greg Sargent has noted that two recent AFP ads, released after controversial Boonstra ad, appeared to go out of their way not to make statements that could be called into question.\n\nIn this case, even Reid\u2019s revised rhetoric went too far. He would have been on safer ground if he dropped the harsh rhetoric and had simply said that many of the ads have serious problems and even rely on actors, not real people.\n\nTwo Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Senate Major Leader harshly attacked the Koch Brothers, saying their anti-Obamacare ads are \"lies.\"", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Senate Major Leader harshly attacked the Koch Brothers, saying their anti-Obamacare ads are \"lies.\"", "title": "Harry Reid\u2019s claim that the \u2018vast majority\u2019 of AFP\u2019s Obamacare ads are \u2018lies\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/02/27/harry-reids-claim-that-the-vast-majority-of-afps-obamacare-ads-are-lies/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2012/07/reid.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/02/27/harry-reids-claim-that-the-vast-majority-of-afps-obamacare-ads-are-lies/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, repeal obamacare, affordable care act, harry reid, reid obamacare, reid all, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, repeal obamacare, affordable care act, harry reid, reid obamacare, reid all, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd750\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019re not sure what a \u201cvast, vast majority\u201d would be.\nThe Pinocchio TestReid claimed that a \u201cvast, vast majority\u201d of AFP\u2019s Obamacare ads are lies.\nVast majority is an imprecise and hackneyed phrase, but presumably it is above 75 percent.\n(Update, March 11: One of the Two Pinocchio ads was downgraded to Three Pinocchios after new information emerged.)\nTwo Pinocchios(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook"}
