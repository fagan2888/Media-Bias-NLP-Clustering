Over the last eight years, we have seen the increased liberalization of the court with the confirmations of Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan. Garland\u2019s nomination is another move to the left. From my perspective as a registered nurse in Augusta County, this truly concerns me as I\u2019ve seen the consequences of a Supreme Court that does not keep liberal, unconstitutional policies in reign.\n\nThe President\u2019s Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, has put us nurses doctors, and hospitals in a very tough position. We strive to offer the best possible care to patients, and we take pride in delivering it in a timely, compassionate manner. However, since the enactment of the law, more care is being offered, but at the expense of quality and individual attention. The law has placed a huge level of stress on health care professionals and a strain on hospital resources. This is not the fault of health care professionals but rather the unfair burdens imposed by federal policies that do not take in account the realities of health care.\n\nWe need a Supreme Court that will hold the federal government responsible for the burdens it places on the American people, whether it\u2019s EPA regulations or Obamacare. The President\u2019s pick, Judge Garland, has proved over the course of his career in D.C. that he is in the business of defending the federal government, rather than defending the Constitution or the people of the United States. That\u2019s not what the people of Virginia deserve. I respectfully ask our senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, to take responsibility for the people they represent and say no to Judge Merrick Garland.\n\nGEORGIA ALVIS-LONG\n\nNew Hope\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/04/21/court-nominee-defend-constitution/83352394/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Judge Garland is in the business of defending the federal government.", "og": {"site_name": "The News Leader", "description": "Judge Garland is in the business of defending the federal government.", "title": "Court nominee won\u2019t defend constitution", "url": "http://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/04/21/court-nominee-defend-constitution/83352394/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/newsleader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Judge Garland is in the business of defending the federal government.", "title": "Court nominee won\u2019t defend constitution", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/35a106a2ea6ae3b1f2cf775c1c33f3bc581c36c3/c=0-40-800-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/29/Staunton/B9321964345Z.1_20160429172201_000_GGRDUN8DL.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@newsleadernow", "site": "@newsleadernow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=858239247", "fb": {"app_id": 169868743049940}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "The law has placed a huge level of stress on health care professionals and a strain on hospital resources.\nPresident Obama\u2019s recent nomination of Judge Merrick Garland provides a unique opportunity for Virginians to reflect on the direction of the Supreme Court.\nThis is not the fault of health care professionals but rather the unfair burdens imposed by federal policies that do not take in account the realities of health care.\nWe need a Supreme Court that will hold the federal government responsible for the burdens it places on the American people, whether it\u2019s EPA regulations or Obamacare.\nOver the last eight years, we have seen the increased liberalization of the court with the confirmations of Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan."}
