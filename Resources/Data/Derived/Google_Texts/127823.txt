The second annual Fried Chicken Throw Down was held Saturday afternoon at the newest ReSurfaced location, in an underpass parking lot at 10th and Main streets on the Ohio River.

Ten local restaurants, including Farm to Fork Catering, Against the Grain and Joella's Hot Chicken, went up against last year's reigning champion Wiltshire on Market to win the titles of best chicken, best side dish, and best dessert.

Joella's Hot Chicken won the title of best fried chicken, while Wiltshire won best vegetarian side and best dessert.

The free event, hosted by Slow Food Bluegrass, included $3 chicken tastings and $2 side and dessert tastings.

A silent auction raised funds for a school garden grant sponsored by Slow Food Bluegrass. The grant helps children build gardens at their schools and includes support from a mobile kitchen classroom that will teach the students how to cook with what they've grown.

The event also raised awareness of the importance of pasture-raised chickens. Wiltshire on Market’s head chef Jonathan Exum uses Kentucky Proud and Marksbury Farm chicken, and he created a gluten-free boneless drumstick with a instant potato breading.

"It's pretty awesome,” Exum said. “It's like having mashed potatoes and chicken in the same thing.”
