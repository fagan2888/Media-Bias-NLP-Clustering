Christopher H. Smith, New Jersey Republican, praised the effort, saying the administration\u2019s handling of the abortion issue in the Affordable Care Act has been \u201cunconscionable,\u201d and the new website should be a helpful tool for consumers who don\u2019t want to pay for other people\u2019s abortions.\n\nSEE ALSO: Groups push for openness on subsidized abortions\n\n\u201cAbortion is not health care \u2014 it dismembers and chemically poisons defenseless unborn children and hurts women,\u201d Mr. Smith told a press conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday.\n\nAn Health and Human Services official said Thursday that \u201cnothing has changed\u201d from federal law, which says \u201cno federal funds, including administrative funds, are permitted to cover abortions or administer plans that cover abortions, except in the case of rape, incest, or when the life of the woman is endangered.\u201d\n\nRegarding payments for abortion coverage, the official added that issuers are required \u201cto collect separate payments from consumers with health insurance plans that cover abortion services for which the use of federal funds are prohibited. It does not specify a method that issuers must use to comply with the separate payment requirement.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Pro-choice activists sue to stop Tennessee abortion amendment\n\nArina Grossu, director of the Family Research Council\u2019s Center for Human Dignity, said \u201cit\u2019s not right\u201d that some health insurers in Texas and Rhode Island won\u2019t speak clearly about their coverage of elective abortions, even when directly asked about it.\n\nHowever, if consumers want answers, they can now visit the website and get as much current information as researchers can acquire, said Genevieve Plaster, a researcher with Charlotte Lozier Institute.\n\nMs. Plaster said they have been exploring these issues with companies since \u201cday one\u201d of the ACA, and they relied in part on a report issued in September by the Government Accountability Office.\n\nThe federal watchdog agency said it found 1,036 health care plans that cover elective abortion and 1,062 plans that do not.\n\nIn written comments to the GAO report, HHS Assistant Secretary for Legislation Jim R. Esquea said that states and state insurance commissioners were \u201cprimarily\u201d responsible for implementing and enforcing the ACA. However the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) \u201cacknowledges that additional clarification may be needed,\u201d Mr. Esquea wrote.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s event, advocates also urged passage of bills that would require insurance companies and health care exchanges to \u201cprominently display\u201d their coverage of elective abortion, including how surcharges are handled, and codify the Hyde amendment so that ACA would not fund elective abortions.\n\nThe Hyde amendment has been applied to federal laws for decades and says that taxpayer money cannot be used to pay for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest and endangerment of the life of the mother, and cannot pay for health insurance plans that cover elective abortions.\n\nThe Hyde amendment was applied to the ACA in a 2010 executive order by President Obama. However,in light of actual experiences with the ACA \u2014 in which the Hyde amendment appears to be flouted \u2014 Mr. Smith and nine colleagues have recently asked Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell and Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of CMS, to explain how they are interacting with insurance companies, states and others on this issue.\n\nMeanwhile, Kerri Kupec, an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom, said Thursday that if consumers find they are being forced to pay for other people\u2019s abortions, they can contact the legal defense firm.\n\nAlready, a Roman Catholic family in Connecticut took legal action with the alliance to ensure that they could purchase \u201cabortion-free\u201d health insurance, said Ms. Kupec. That case has been dismissed since Connecticut officials now offer such plans, she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Decrying the lack of \"transparency\" about abortion coverage in health care plans, pro-life groups are asking consumers to visit a new, privately operated website to see which insurance plans cover abortion, which do not, and which are \"unknown\" on the issue.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Decrying the lack of \u201ctransparency\u201d about abortion coverage in health care plans, pro-life groups are asking consumers to visit a new, privately operated website to see which insurance plans cover abortion, which do not, and which are \u201cunknown\u201d on the issue.", "title": "Website exposes insurance plans\u2019 abortion coverage", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/20/website-exposes-insurance-plans-abortion-coverage/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/20/11202014_ap8465642474148201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/20/11202014_ap8465642474148201.jpg", "description": "Decrying the lack of \"transparency\" about abortion coverage in health care plans, pro-life groups are asking consumers to visit a new, privately operated website to see which insurance plans cover abo", "card": "summary", "title": "Website exposes insurance plans\u2019 abortion coverage"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Christopher H Smith"}, "article_summary": "Decrying the lack of \u201ctransparency\u201d about abortion coverage in health care plans, pro-life groups are asking consumers to visit a new, privately operated website to see which insurance plans cover abortion, which do not, and which are \u201cunknown\u201d on the issue.\nThe federal watchdog agency said it found 1,036 health care plans that cover elective abortion and 1,062 plans that do not.\nAlready, a Roman Catholic family in Connecticut took legal action with the alliance to ensure that they could purchase \u201cabortion-free\u201d health insurance, said Ms. Kupec.\nSEE ALSO: Groups push for openness on subsidized abortions\u201cAbortion is not health care \u2014 it dismembers and chemically poisons defenseless unborn children and hurts women,\u201d Mr. Smith told a press conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday.\nAt Thursday\u2019s event, advocates also urged passage of bills that would require insurance companies and health care exchanges to \u201cprominently display\u201d their coverage of elective abortion, including how surcharges are handled, and codify the Hyde amendment so that ACA would not fund elective abortions."}
