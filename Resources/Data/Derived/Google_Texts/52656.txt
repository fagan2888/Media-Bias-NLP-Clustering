A storm caused massive power outages and damaged many buildings in the town of Newton late Thursday night.

Much of the town was without electricity for hours after 100 mph winds damaged the towns power grid.

Few restaurants were able to be open on Friday because of electrical outages.

Karen's Kitchen was one of exceptions. "It was swamped, we did about quadruple what we normally do," said Karen Walton, owner of Karen's Kitchen.

Walton says she served over 400 people; she usually only serves 100 customers a day.

Tree damage is spread across the town. Many trees had limbs down, some trees were completely uprooted or snapped in half.

"I've been busy for three day straight," said Ernie Williams, owner of Williams Firewood & Tree Service.

Massive piles of brush can be seen alongside many city streets. City crews were out the night of the storm to clear debris from roads.

The power for the majority of town has been restored. Remaining outages are expected to be repaired in the next few days.
