SAG-AFTRA members at National Public Radio have approved a two-year successor deal to their master contract, covering 400 on-air and off-air employees.

The deal includes a 2.5% pay raise on Jan 1, and another 2.5% pay raise on Jan 1, 2017. Negotiations began on April 22 in Washington, D.C., and concluded on July 1.

“I want to send my congratulations to the members and negotiators in bargaining this new contract,” said SAG-AFTRA president Ken Howard. “The overwhelming vote by the membership at NPR is another victory for the merged SAG-AFTRA.”

The union said the new deal includes retaining overtime and related pay for all members. Employees’ 403(b) retirement plan will remain fixed at 7% of pay and overtime for the next two years and union-guaranteed benefits remain intact. NPR also agreed to pay 70% of employees’ total health insurance premiums.

The deal is retroactive to July 1.

SAG-AFTRA also represents employees at other public TV and radio outlets including Chicago Public Media, KPBS in San Diego, KPCC in Los Angeles, KQED in San Francisco, WNYC in New York, KPLU in Seattle and WETA-TV/FM in Washington, D.C.
