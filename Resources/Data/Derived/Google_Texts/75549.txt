Some Distinguished Young Women met in Meridian Saturday to talk about this year's program.

Thirty-one local representatives from across the state were on hand at 15th Avenue Baptist Church for the annual winners meeting. The girls received information to prepare them for the upcoming state program. Distinguished young woman Anna Daniels talked to the girls about being prepared and what they can expect.

"I told the girls to be 100 percent prepared going into their week competing at state in meridian and to be completely at peace with the results of the competition and also to not get caught up in the competition and to just really enjoy the time that they have with each other," Daniels says.

The state program will be held July 14 through 16th at the Temple Theatre in downtown Meridian.
