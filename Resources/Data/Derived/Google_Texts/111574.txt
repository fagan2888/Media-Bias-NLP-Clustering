By the end of next year, American Airlines aims to vacate the US Airways headquarters in Tempe, according to a report by Phoenix Business Journal.

Per American Airlines spokesman Andrew Christie, the move from the Tempe CHQ building will not affect the 500 workers currently employed and located inside the building at Rio Salado Parkway and Mill Avenue.

“Ending our lease at the Tempe CHQ building at the end of 2016 doesn’t affect jobs in Phoenix – just where they’re located,” Christie told Phoenix Business Journal. “We have ample space to accommodate the work groups at other American Airlines buildings in Phoenix and Tempe including the Flight Training Center, Rio West Business Park, the 52nd Street building and Sky Harbor. Planning is underway to determine the exact relocation dates for the work groups.”

With the move, American Airlines will also be replacing signage both at Sky Harbor International airport and in various locations around the Phoenix area.
