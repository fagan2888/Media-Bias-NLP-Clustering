Presidential candidate and acclaimed neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson is scheduled to appear in Conroe next month.

The Montgomery County Republican Party announced Carson will address an audience at the Conroe High School auditorium at 7 p.m. Sept. 10. The auditorium seats 1,000 people.

Preferred seating tickets will be $75 each and general admission tickets will be $35. Children will be admitted for free but require reservations.

MCRP officials said all proceeds from the event will benefit the organization.

“Dr. Carson’s life story is symbolic of the American dream: a man reared in Detroit, Michigan, by a single mother who instilled a value system in him at an early age,” MCRP Chairman Dr. Wally Wilkerson stated in a news release. “Carson went on to become a highly skilled neurosurgeon who was the first to successfully separate conjoined twins attached at the head. His wife is a skilled violinist. He leapt onto the political scene when he criticized Obamacare at a National Prayer Breakfast with President Obama in the audience in 2013.”

Carson will be one of 10 GOP candidates participating tonight in the first presidential candidate debate for next year’s election.

Tickets can be purchased online at www.mcrp.org, emailing info@mcrp.org or calling Republican Headquarters at 936-441-5621. Personal checks should be made payable to MCRP.
