In West Virginia's third district, they had the opportunity to choose between two such candidates. In the end, they chose to unseat Congressman Nick Rahall, a long-serving Democrat with an equally long record of supporting life and marriage.\n\n\u201cCongressman Rahall has been a consistent and reliable pro-life vote during his tenure in the U.S. House,\u201d Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life of America (DFLA) , told LifeSiteNews. \u201cHis voice for the voiceless is needed more than ever within U.S. House and particularly within the Democratic Party. The pro-life community has lost an advocate who shares our commitment to ending abortion by providing more support and options for pregnant women and supporting working families in caring for their children.\u201d\n\nShe called Rahall \u201ca true whole-life hero.\u201d\n\nThe Beckley Democrat was elected to Congress in the Bicentennial year of 1976. Rahall has earned a 93 percent lifetime pro-life voting record over his 19 terms in the House, according to National Right to Life. He sponsored, co-sponsored, or voted for bills to ban partial birth abortion, to protect infants born alive during botched abortions, to deny taxpayer funds to underwrite abortion at home or abroad, to prohibit transporting minors across state lines for abortion, and to recognize the unborn child as a victim when a pregnant woman is assaulted.\n\nMost recently, he co-sponsored the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion\u201d Act, which codifies the Hyde Amendment government-wide, and the \u201cPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,\u201d which restricts abortion to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy on the grounds of fetal pain.\n\nA stalwart champion of marriage, Rahall supported a constitutional amendment to protect marriage as the union of one man and one woman, the \u201cMarriage Protection Amendment\u201d (H. J. Res. 51) introduced by Kansas Republican Timothy Huelskamp.\n\nA onetime staffer for Sen. Robert Byrd, Rahall will leave his perch as the top Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where he supports greater infrastructure spending, often in West Virginia. \u201cI can look across the spectrum of legislation that I'm very proud to have gotten through the Congress,\u201d he told West Virginia Public Broadcasting after the election.\n\nRahall united the often conflicting interests of his district, being a lifelong member of both the NAACP and the National Rifle Association. Rahall, whose grandparents emigrated from Lebanon, was also the most senior Arab-American lawmaker in the Congress.\n\nHis electoral woes began when Rahall voted for the original Affordable Care Act, conventionally known as ObamaCare. Although he was part of Bart Stupak's group of socially conservative Democrats who opposed taxpayer-funding of abortion, he and Stupak changed their votes in exchange for an executive order that Stupak has since branded a \u201cdouble-cross.\u201d\n\nRahall has voted against full repeal of ObamaCare, a position that placed his safe seat in jeopardy. In 2014, Rahall raised more than $2.3 million, nearly twice his 2012 campaign war chest. This year he was endorsed by an unusual coalition that included the AFL-CIO, teachers, and the NRA. Yet he lost to Evan Jenkins, himself a former Democrat, by 10 percentage points.\n\nRahall is replaced by another pro-life and pro-family lawmaker. Jenkins' website said, \u201cEvan knows that life begins at conception\u201d and recognized \u201cthat marriage is between one man and woman.\u201d He also supports repealing ObamaCare.\n\nRepublicans had not held the Third Congressional district seat since 1958.\n\n\u201cThe national Democrat message to support abortion destroys Democratic candidates in pro-life states and districts by pushing pro-life Democrats out of the party,\u201d Day said. \u201cWe are alienating a whole new generation of pro-life Democrats.\u201d\n\nShe believed Rahall may have been hurt with pro-life voters when West Virginia's moderate Democratic governor, Earl Ray Tomblin, vetoed a bill banning late-term abortion . His veto \u2013 and the Democratic Party platform's full-throated support for taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand through all nine months of pregnancy \u2013 made West Virginia voters question whether they could trust a Democrat who says he supports life.\n\n\u201cIn pro-life states and districts, Democrats, and particularly pro-life women, have a hard time pulling the lever for a candidate who is associated with a party that not only supports abortion but actively campaigns against providing any reasonable restrictions on a \u2018medical procedure\u2019 that takes a life,\u201d Day said. \u201cPro-life Democrats believe that life exists in the womb. Until the Democratic leadership accepts and respects that point of view, the party will not heal \u2013 and not win.\u201d\n\nThe issue is hardly restricted to socially conservative but economically liberal West Virginia. In Maine, one-time \u201cpro-life Democrat\u201d Mike Michaud flip-flopped on abortion in his efforts to become the state's first openly homosexual governor. Gov. Paul LePage, an outspoken pro-life Republican considered among the most likely to lose his race, won re-election.\n\nMissouri State Rep. Linda Black, another Democrat who voted for abortion restrictions, announced she was switching to the Republican Party one day after being re-elected for her fourth term in District 117. The party change, she admitted, had mostly to do with her position on social issues.\n\n\u201cWe are once again hopeful the national party elites will reassess their pro-abortion stance after the disastrous results of Tuesday night,\u201d Day said.\u201cThey are costing us elections and abandoning our founding values of protecting and advocating for those who need a helping hand. At the top of that list should be helping protect the rights of the unborn.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "The West Virginia lawmaker will be replaced by a pro-life, pro-family Republican who supports repealing ObamaCare.", "title": "Goodbye to a pro-life Democrat: Nick Rahall ends his 19 terms in Congress", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/Screen_Shot_2014-11-11_at_2.15.14_PM.png", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/goodbye-to-a-pro-life-democrat-nick-rahall-ends-his-19-terms-in-congress", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "The West Virginia lawmaker will be replaced by a pro-life, pro-family Republican who supports repealing ObamaCare."}, "description": "The West Virginia lawmaker will be replaced by a pro-life, pro-family Republican who supports repealing ObamaCare.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "article_summary": "\u201cHis voice for the voiceless is needed more than ever within U.S. House and particularly within the Democratic Party.\nIn Maine, one-time \u201cpro-life Democrat\u201d Mike Michaud flip-flopped on abortion in his efforts to become the state's first openly homosexual governor.\n\u201cThe national Democrat message to support abortion destroys Democratic candidates in pro-life states and districts by pushing pro-life Democrats out of the party,\u201d Day said.\nRahall has earned a 93 percent lifetime pro-life voting record over his 19 terms in the House, according to National Right to Life.\nIn the end, they chose to unseat Congressman Nick Rahall, a long-serving Democrat with an equally long record of supporting life and marriage."}
