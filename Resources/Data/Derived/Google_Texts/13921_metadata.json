Kasich, SB 193 removes all\n\n\n\nchallenger parties from the Ohio ballot in 2014, and makes it more\n\n\n\ndifficult for them to regain status as a recognized political party in\n\n\n\nOhio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill's sponsor, Sen. Bill Seitz said he introduced the bill because\n\n\n\nOhio had no election law in place for minor parties. This is true, having\n\n\n\nbeen the case since 2006 when a federal court declared Ohio minor party\n\n\n\nlaw unconstitutional in LPO v. Blackwell. In the absence of a law,\n\n\n\nfederal courts have directed the Ohio Secretary of State to allow any\n\n\n\nparty showing a modicum of support access to the ballot. In the\n\n\n\nintervening seven years Ohio lawmakers have not lifted a finger to change\n\n\n\nthis situation, but suspiciously chose to do so once it became clear that\n\n\n\nincoming Gov. John Kasich might have trouble getting reelected in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause Libertarian party gubernatorial candidate Because Libertarian party gubernatorial candidate Charlie Earl seems to\n\n\n\nbe attracting many fiscal conservatives disgusted by Kasich's record on\n\n\n\ntaxes, spending, and Obamacare/Medicare expansion, the Republican Party\n\n\n\nin the House and Senate decided to act to restrict voter choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than becoming more responsive to voters and making a positive case\n\n\n\nfor their party, the Ohio GOP is afraid to let voters have a freedom\n\n\n\noption. Even though our internal data suggest that we draw support\n\n\n\nequally from Republicans, Democrats, and independents, Republicans seem\n\n\n\nto have the most acute fear of Libertarians, perhaps out of the\n\n\n\nrealization that the GOP seldom lives up to their fiscally conservative\n\n\n\nposturing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Republican establishment, the immediate issue here is the decline\n\n\n\nof their party and the difficulty its leader faces in Ohio, but for the\n\n\n\nrest of us this is a voting rights issue. When political expediency is\n\n\n\nused to limit democratic participation, everyone should be alarmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Libertarian Party of Ohio has consistently lobbied for a fair,\n\n\n\nconstitutional election law for minor parties since 2006, but we have\n\n\n\nbeen ignored. Neither us nor any other minor party was consulted before\n\n\n\nSB 193 was proposed. No one in the entire state of Ohio came forward to\n\n\n\ntestify in favor of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the United States District Court for the Southern District\n\n\n\nof Ohio struck down Senate Bill 47, also, curiously, introduced by Sen.\n\n\n\nSeitz and challenged by the Libertarian party of Ohio, that in July made\n\n\n\nit illegal for anyone to hire out-of-state petitioners to collect\n\n\n\nsignatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's clear that Kasich, Seitz, and the GOP took this step in advance of\n\n\n\nSB 193 to further make it harder for the Libertarian Party to requalify\n\n\n\nin 2014. We hope that the court's decision, which clearly states that SB\n\n\n\n47 limits the right of political participation guaranteed by the First\n\n\n\nAmendment, signals that the court will also block SB 193 on similar\n\n\n\ngrounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's hope that SB 193 is merely a death rattle of a corrupt two-party\n\n\n\nsystem, and not another victory for those afraid that Americans might\n\n\n\nsucceed in putting government back in its place as a servant of the\n\n\n\npeople.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "bill-seitz,charlie-earl,john-kasich,ohio-libertarian-party,senate-bill-193", "title": "Courts should reject new law governing third parties in Ohio: Aaron Keith Harris with Libertarian Party of Ohio", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Courts should reject new law governing third parties in Ohio: Aaron Keith Harris with Libertarian Party of Ohio\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/11/courts_should_reject_new_law_g.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/cuyahoga-county-road-to-reform/photo/aaron-keith-harris-dabe5145eb08e31b.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11661999\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-17T16:30:47Z\", \"author\": \"Special to cleveland.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"bill-seitz\",\"charlie-earl\",\"john-kasich\",\"ohio-libertarian-party\",\"senate-bill-193\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/cuyahoga-county-road-to-reform/photo/13790917-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Aaron Keith Harris with the Libertarian Party of Ohio writes in a guest column that Senate Bill 193 is a \"stark demonstration of just how ruthless those in power work to fend off challenges to the status quo.\"", "card": "summary", "site": "@clevelanddotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, November 17, 2013, 11:30 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/cuyahoga-county-road-to-reform/photo/aaron-keith-harris-dabe5145eb08e31b.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"neomgspecial\", \"author_nickname\": \"Special to cleveland.com\", \"author_id\": \"11110520\", \"source_blog_name\": \"OPEN: Ohio Politics\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Aaron Keith Harris with the Libertarian Party of Ohio writes in a guest column that Senate Bill 193 is a \"stark demonstration of just how ruthless those in power work to fend off challenges to the status quo.\"", "title": "Courts should reject new law governing third parties in Ohio: Aaron Keith Harris with Libertarian Party of Ohio", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/11/courts_should_reject_new_law_g.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, November 17, 2013, 11:30 AM", "article_author": "Special to cleveland.com", "Description": "Aaron Keith Harris with the Libertarian Party of Ohio writes in a guest column that Senate Bill 193 is a \"stark demonstration of just how ruthless those in power work to fend off challenges to the status quo.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8842\"", "article_summary": "The Libertarian Party of Ohio has consistently lobbied for a fair,constitutional election law for minor parties since 2006, but we havebeen ignored.\nThis is true, havingbeen the case since 2006 when a federal court declared Ohio minor partylaw unconstitutional in LPO v.
