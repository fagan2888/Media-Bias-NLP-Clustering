Mayor de Blasio’s call, apparently unheeded, for protesters to stand down until after the funerals for Police Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu was meant to give a city torn apart by their barbarous double murder some time to come together and heal.

It’s not a bad idea. Even so, it misses the point.

New York City’s problem is not that we have people protesting. The problem is the nature of the protests.

Ever since a Staten Island grand jury found no probable cause to indict a police officer in the death of Eric Garner, the protesters in this city have shown disregard for the law.

They have also been accompanied by ugly calls for “dead cops” and chants likening the NYPD to the KKK. No surprise, it crossed into violence with some smashing windows on a police car and others assaulting cops during the occupation of the Brooklyn Bridge.

But instead of demanding protesters obey the law, the mayor and others for too long validated an anger based on a smear: that cops do not value black life. Not once did we hear Mayor de Blasio or Al Sharpton state the obvious: If Eric Garner and Michael Brown had in fact put their hands up and not resisted arrest, they would be alive today.

This was followed by the official indulgence of protesters who deliberately blocked traffic, tried to disrupt events, from the Thanksgiving Day parade to the Christmas tree lighting, and later occupied the Brooklyn Bridge.

A week later, Ismaaiyl Brinsley posted “they take 1 of ours . . . Let’s take 2 of theirs” and executed Officers Ramos and Liu as they sat in their car.

So let’s not pretend any of this is about the right to protest.

It’s lawlessness — done in a clear attempt to hold this city hostage — that is the real problem. And the city authorities who have until now winked at it.
