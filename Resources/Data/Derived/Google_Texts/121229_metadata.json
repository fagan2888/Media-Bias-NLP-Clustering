Johnny Manziel? Please end the Johnny Football-to-Denver rumors. There\u2019s no way Broncos honcho John Elway would want Manziel, right?\n\nMichael, just says no\n\nKiz: Breaking news! We need new office furniture here at Kickin\u2019 It Headquarters. Why? When our staff heard the Manziel rumors, we fell out of our chairs, laughing so hard that the chairs did not survive the fall. What Manziel needs more than a job is help. Broncos coach Gary Kubiak was happy to offer a fellow Texas A&M alum some friendly advice and heartfelt support. But hire him? No way. Rather than give Manziel the keys to his offense, here\u2019s thinking Kubiak knows it would be far safer for all concerned to call Johnny Football a cab.\n\nNow and for Trevor. I enjoyed your column on Rockies shortstop Trevor Story and his late grandfather. We\u2019ve known the Story family for 30 years, and my son played Little League ball with Trevor. His grandpa, Darrel the milkman, was special. He was my deacon at church and, as a fellow truck driver, he would always ask about my trips and tell me to \u201cKeep it between the lines.\u201d So, for me, the most memorable line in your column was: \u201cEvery time Story rounds the bases, it\u2019s a milk run.\u201d I\u2019ll think of that whenever I watch Trevor play.\n\nDavid, Texas proud\n\nKiz: Until the home opener, Story had never taken batting practice at Coors Field. Then the rookie went out and smacked two home runs in front of John Elway, Peyton Manning and 49,358 of his new best friends in Colorado. But, in every crowd, there\u2019s one Mr. Grumpypants. For proof, read on. \u2026\n\nThe Weiss and what fors. Don\u2019t tell the easy Story. Tell the real story about the Rockies. They took on too much money for the bullpen and have a bad manager in Walt Weiss.\n\nJon, plays hardball\n\nKiz: Weiss knows as well as anybody that another 90-loss season would not be good for his future in the Rockies dugout. But Tony La Russa or Joe Maddon would look like lousy managers with bad starting pitching. Through four games of this season, the earned run average of Colorado starters was 8.15. And Weiss managed to go 2-2 in those games? I\u2019d call that a minor baseball miracle.\n\nIrv ahead of the curve. And today\u2019s parting shot is our way of telling Irv Brown: No, it was you that made this show.\n\nI turned in for the first time to a sports-talk radio show 33 years ago, heard Irv and thought I had died and gone to heaven. He was the best: knowledgeable, entertaining, insightful and an incredibly nice guy. All the best to him in retirement.\n\nDoug, got in the hunt", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kickin\u2019 it with Kiz: Johnny Manziel was never on Broncos\u2019 radar", "title": "Kickin\u2019 it with Kiz: Johnny Manziel was never on Broncos\u2019 radar", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/09/kickin-it-with-kiz-johnny-manziel-was-never-on-broncos-radar/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160407_010517_johnny-manziel-1.jpg", "height": 461}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160407_010517_johnny-manziel-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-09T19:46:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T13:33:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Kickin' It With Kiz"}, "article_summary": "Johnny Manziel?\nThere\u2019s no way Broncos honcho John Elway would want Manziel, right?\nBroncos coach Gary Kubiak was happy to offer a fellow Texas A&M alum some friendly advice and heartfelt support.\nWhen our staff heard the Manziel rumors, we fell out of our chairs, laughing so hard that the chairs did not survive the fall.\nRather than give Manziel the keys to his offense, here\u2019s thinking Kubiak knows it would be far safer for all concerned to call Johnny Football a cab."}
