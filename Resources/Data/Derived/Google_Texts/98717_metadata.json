The publication also identified two of the losers: Larry Gagosian, the art dealer, and Hong Gyu Shin of Manhattan\u2019s Shin Gallery, who told The Times he was bidding for himself.\n\nThe art market tends to mirror the stock market, so it\u2019s no surprise that bidders were bullish. A sculpture by artist Jeff Koons sold at the same Christie\u2019s auction for more than $58 million, a record amount for a piece by a living artist. Tuesday\u2019s Christie\u2019s art auctions totaled nearly $691.6 million \u2013 another record. But if there\u2019s a market correction, or some other disappointment in the economy, you can count on a twinge of buyer\u2019s remorse.\n\nThe good news for the winner: There\u2019s probably a therapist specializing in such an affliction. And if the art market does turn, the losing bidders might be justified in feeling more than a twinge of schadenfreude.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The seven people bidding on Francis Bacon\u2019s study of artist Lucian Freud, the grandson of Sigmund Freud, may need a little analysis themselves after making the 1969 triptych the most expense artwork ever sold at auction.", "title": "Shock Therapy as Paintings of Freud Net Record $142.4 M", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/13/Shock-Therapy-Paintings-Freud-Net-Record-1424-M", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11132013_Francis_Bacon_Triptych.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/13/Shock-Therapy-Paintings-Freud-Net-Record-1424-M", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11132013_Francis_Bacon_Triptych.jpg", "creator": "@jackieleo", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The seven people bidding on Francis Bacon\u2019s study of artist Lucian Freud, the grandson of Sigmund Freud, may need a little analysis themselves after making the 1969 triptych the most expense artwork ever sold at auction.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfeb8\"", "article_summary": "The art market tends to mirror the stock market, so it\u2019s no surprise that bidders were bullish.\nAnd if the art market does turn, the losing bidders might be justified in feeling more than a twinge of schadenfreude.\nBut if there\u2019s a market correction, or some other disappointment in the economy, you can count on a twinge of buyer\u2019s remorse.\nA sculpture by artist Jeff Koons sold at the same Christie\u2019s auction for more than $58 million, a record amount for a piece by a living artist.\nTuesday\u2019s Christie\u2019s art auctions totaled nearly $691.6 million \u2013 another record."}
