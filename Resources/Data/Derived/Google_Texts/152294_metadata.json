That country long served as a buffer state for one purpose only \u2014 to suppress the implosion of the region. True, the Democrats who backed the invasion aren\u2019t much better, because they were swayed by the idiotic \u201cpatriotic\u201d fervor of 2003.\n\nBut at least they seem to recognize the error, even if it should have been visible at the time: Any U.S. leaders who take an action that, historically speaking, must inevitably hand Iraq to Iran and restore Iran as the dominant regional power needs to have their heads examined.\n\nIt is well known that John McCain, the former U.S. presidential candidate and prisoner of war, likes to pour oil into any fire he sees. It is in his nature to do so. The question is why we let him do so without at least first forcing him to pay penance for his past sins of warmongering.\n\nBomb, bomb, bomb\n\nThe senior senator from Arizona now wants to take his pyromaniac style of foreign policy into Iraq once more, echoing his \u201cbomb, bomb, bomb\u201d spirit of a decade ago. In that, he is guided not by any sense of patriotism, but by all the impetuousness of an anarchist that he can muster.\n\nMcCain is not only one of the chief propellants of the American pyromania that destroyed Iraq, but also one of the most senior still holding political office.\n\nThe most basic fact of the matter is this: Anybody who was out to topple Saddam Hussein \u2014 and thereby turn all of Iraq into a powder keg \u2014 at best showed complete ignorance of the history of the region.\n\nA deep-seated sense of religiously fueled enmity throughout the ages has shaped life in West Asia for ages. Shiites and Sunnis, when pitted against each other, and then presented with an opportunity, have always been inclined to make a blood sport out of the pursuit of the other.\n\nThe crucial role that Iraq has traditionally played in that kind of highly combustible environment was that it served as a satellite buffer state that essentially separated the Levant and Asia Minor from Iran/Persia, providing a check on the expansion of empires from either direction.\n\nInternally divided due to shifting borders and occupiers from repeated conquests, Iraq has often stood at the crossroads between large Western Sunni powers and the Shia Persian power to the east.\n\nEven before the rise of Islam and its factions, the area was the dividing zone between western and eastern empires. Even Rome sometimes held Mesopotamia, during its long-running struggle with what is now Iran.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The same hawks who suckered us into war with Iraq are at it again.
