Instead, at age 26 he set his own path and became the youngest city council member in the California city of Redlands\u2019 126-year history when five council members, Democrat and Republican, picked him out of 11 candidates to fill an open seat. He was elected to the seat a year later, his first election. Then his colleagues appointed him mayor in 2010 and again in 2012.\n\nToday Aguilar\u2019s going after another vacancy, the U.S. House seat for California\u2019s 31st Congressional District. The incumbent, Republican Rep. Gary Miller was in for a bruising race as the Democrats' No. 1 target. He chose to retire. Aguilar, a Democrat, and his opponent Republican Paul Chabot will face off in November.\n\nAguilar's story conjures images of former San Antonio mayor and now Housing Secretary Julian Castro. Castro also was 26 when he was elected to San Antonio's city council, and made city history as the youngest council member. Aguilar said he's interacted more with Castro's twin brother, Rep. Joaqu\u00edn Castro, D-Texas, who has publicly supported him and headlined an event for him with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Castro Sworn in As HUD Secretary 0:58 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nWith Aguilar achieving such quick success, it would be easy to assume he was the geeky, high achiever as a youth.\n\nBut Aguilar, 35, calls his older brother the \u201cbraniac\u201d of the family\u2019s two children. His mother would consider him the more likely to get in trouble and talk his way out of it, he said. His wife, whom he\u2019s known since high school, was the smarter, more mature one in college, he said, and he describes himself as a late bloomer.\n\n\u201cI was just a little cautious, insecure. I didn\u2019t want to mess things up. I definitely found my footing later,\u201d Aguilar said.\n\nThe late-arriving confidence hasn\u2019t always carried him to his goal. Aguilar also ran for Congress in 2012, but lost in the open primary.\n\nPresident Barack Obama won 57 percent of the district's vote in the 2012 elections. It is considered the most Democratic district held by a Republican.\n\nAguilar\u2019s challenge, like others across the country, will be to rev up the Latino vote - about 44 percent of eligible voters in the district - and still hang on to his crossover appeal that helped him become a council member.\n\nAguilar worked after college for former California Gov. Gray Davis in Riverside, when the area was still \"pretty red,\" he said. \"I'd have to go into a room and there likely weren't many supporters and I'd have to articulate the governor's position,\" Aguilar said. The experience taught him to be a good listener, to understand other viewpoints and find a solution, he said.\n\nAs is the case for many Mexican-Americans in the Southwest, Aguilar\u2019s roots in California trace back to at least his great grandparents. Like so many other Latinos with deep roots in the U.S., he\u2019s fuzzy on the family history, which he is still digging out. He knows the family went from Mexico to Kingman, California, through the railroad industry.\n\nHe is learning Spanish and is trying to raise his children to be bilingual. Speaking Spanish had segregated his parents, he said. \u201cMy parents and grandparents worked hard to teach us our culture and heritage, but they specifically kept us from learning Spanish. It\u2019s a decision they\u2019d probably like to have back now,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said he\u2019s not that different from many Latinos in the district and region, many who have been in the area for many generations.\n\nRepublican Paul Chabot, who got the most votes in the primary, thinks the long history of Latinos in the area will work more for him than for Aguilar. \u201cThe Latino population here in the Inland Empire, although it is next to Los Angeles, they are worlds apart. Latinos here are Democrats, but they are moderate, Blue Dog, pro family and pro life,\u201d he said.\n\nChabot, 40, is a military veteran and has worked for years as a deputy reserve sheriff in the area. He said his position on securing the border resonates more with the area\u2019s Latinos.\n\n\u201cI was born colorblind and raised colorblind and I don\u2019t see the controversy of race ever becoming an issue in our area,\u201d said Chabot, who was not the establishment GOP favorite, but has since begun to get national party support.\n\nAmong Chabot's main campaign issues are reforming Obamacare - which he has said hurts businesses and families - as well as cutting taxes and reforming schools and the military while running on a \"leaner budget,\" as he states in his campaign's website.\n\nThe district is in an area known as the Inland Empire, which leads the nation\u2019s 25 largest metropolitan areas in poverty. The city of San Bernardino, with a population of about 2 million that is 51 percent Latino, has the nation\u2019s second highest poverty rate behind Detroit.\n\nAguilar has promoted building infrastructure to attract jobs, increasing Title I funding for the local schools and making more college grant money available through the federal Pell grant program.\n\n\u201cThe city of San Bernardino is really why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d said Aguilar. \u201cTimes are tough and we need advocates who can work to bring investments to our community.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "California's House District 31 is a pick-up opportunity for Democrats and young Latino Mayor Pete Aguilar hopes to be the one to snatch it.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/young-latino-mayor-pete-aguilar-could-turn-red-house-seat-n180556", "site_name": "NBC News", "image": "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_34/623981/140818-latin-american-portrait-jsw-305p_090953c359426d7550072f42bf033c9c.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "California's House District 31 is a pick-up opportunity for Democrats and young Latino Mayor Pete Aguilar hopes to be the one to snatch it."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "California's House District 31 is a pick-up opportunity for Democrats and young Latino Mayor Pete Aguilar hopes to be the one to snatch it.", "title": "Young Latino Mayor Pete Aguilar Could Turn a Red House Seat Blue - NBC News", "image": {"src": "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_34/623981/140818-latin-american-portrait-jsw-305p_090953c359426d7550072f42bf033c9c.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "creator": "NBCNews", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-19", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/young-latino-mayor-pete-aguilar-could-turn-red-house-seat-n180556", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "News,Latino"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaebe\"", "article_summary": "Castro also was 26 when he was elected to San Antonio's city council, and made city history as the youngest council member.\nAguilar worked after college for former California Gov.\nToday Aguilar\u2019s going after another vacancy, the U.S. House seat for California\u2019s 31st Congressional District.\n\u201cThe city of San Bernardino is really why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d said Aguilar.\nThe city of San Bernardino, with a population of about 2 million that is 51 percent Latino, has the nation\u2019s second highest poverty rate behind Detroit."}
