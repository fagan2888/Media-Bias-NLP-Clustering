And in those cases, the corporations that would be affected by expiration of the bank could easily access private financing to maintain their sales.\n\nThe 80-year-old agency provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies. Its charter expires Sept. 30, and Congress is debating whether to reauthorize the bank or allow its life to end.\n\nDe Rugy found that 42 states received less than 2 percent of the bank\u2019s disbursements from 2007 to 2014. Of them, 35 received less than 1 percent. She said:\n\n\u201cWhile businesses in most states barely benefit from the Ex-Im Bank at all, their taxpayers are just as exposed to Ex-Im Bank liabilities as taxpayers in states that receive the most Ex-Im Bank backing.\u201d\n\nKatz wrote in a July commentary that only 2 percent of total U.S. exports involve Ex-Im financing. As of March, the agency devoted $32 billion of its total portfolio to wide-body jets, the vast majority benefiting Boeing.\n\nIn addition to examining the concentration of Ex-Im funds across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, de Rugy determined the percentage of state exports backed by the agency from 2007 to 2014.\n\nWashington state, once more, clearly benefited the most from Ex-Im financing, with 23 percent of exports backed by the agency. Wisconsin and Massachusetts followed, with 4 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively.\n\nIn 41 states, about 98 percent of exports had no Ex-Im backing, prompting de Rugy to note:\n\nThe Ex-Im Bank yields negligible benefits for the vast majority of state exports. But the concentrated benefits it yields to a few beneficiaries makes the reforms necessary to prevent widespread losses that much harder.\n\nOpponents of Ex-Im argue that the bank is the picture of corporate welfare and cronyism, and long ago dubbed the agency the \u201cBank of Boeing.\u201d\n\nSupporters contend Ex-Im helps small business compete in the global market and creates jobs in the United States. Many say businesses benefiting from the agency\u2019s financing would feel the squeeze if Congress chose not to reauthorize it.\n\nKatz points out that in reality few exports benefit from the bank:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The home state of Boeing\u2019s airplane division benefits the most from financing by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, a state-by-state analysis shows.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The home state of Boeing\u2019s airplane division benefits the most from financing by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, a state-by-state analysis shows.", "title": "Surprise?
