Cathy Rodgers (R-WA) the so-called Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act, arguing that it\u2019s just too expensive to inform consumers, and showing once again that House Republicans don\u2019t care about the burden \u2013 cost or health-wise \u2013 to the general public:\n\n\u201cThe government should not be placing more harmful barriers in the way of hardworking small businesses. This important legislation would roll back the FDA\u2019s burdensome menu labeling rule, giving American restaurants, grocery and convenient stores the flexibility they need to be successful. I commend Cathy for her work on this measure.\u201d\n\nRight. Calories? Who cares? Never more, if congressional Republicans get their way, will restaurant, convenience store, grocery store, and pizzeria chains, have to tell you what you\u2019re eating. If you\u2019re on a diet \u2013 especially when it is a medically necessary diet to you know, keep you alive \u2013 you\u2019ll just have to take your chances and forget that night out or game-day pizza.\n\nThis is not about small businesses. There is not even a pretense that this is not a giveaway to big corporations who want to rake in profits at your expense.\n\nPaul Ryan argues it\u2019s only \u201ccommon sense\u201d that Americans don\u2019t need to know what is in the food they\u2019re eating. Apparently, being able to make your own choices is \u201cburdensome.\u201d But what else to expect from a party that thinks even having access to healthcare is burdensome.\n\nRep. Fred Upton (R-MI) claimed in defense of this nonsensical piece of legislation that, \u201cWe have a classic example of the administration overreaching with a top-down, big government approach.\u201d\n\nBecause a top-down, big corporation approach is so much better. At least the government wants to protect us while corporations just want to make money.\n\nPresident Obama has stated his opposition to the so-called Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) protested that is low on common sense, saying \u201cThis unnecessary legislation would deny consumers critical information about the food that we eat.\u201d Critical is never burdensome.\n\nNumerous organizations have signed \u201cA Joint Statement in Opposition of H.R. 2017,\u201d providing a cogent and powerful defense of the consumer\u2019s right to know:\n\nWe, the undersigned organizations and researchers, oppose the \u201cCommon Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2015.\u201d We do not think that it is common sense to weaken a policy that would allow people to make their own, informed choices about how many\n\ncalories to eat at a time when obesity rates are at a record high. The bill would undercut the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) menu labeling regulations and undermine congressional intent to provide access to calorie labeling in a broad range of\n\nchain food service establishments. The national menu labeling law requires chain restaurants and similar food establishments to provide consumers with calorie information for standard food and beverage items on menus and menu boards. Studies show that providing nutrition\n\ninformation at restaurants can help people make lower calorie choices, and a national poll found that 80 percent of Americans support calorie labeling at supermarkets and restaurants. H.R. 2017 would undermine the benefits of the national menu labeling law\n\nand confuse and mislead consumers.\n\nThe signatories include the American Academy of Sports Dietitians and Nutritionists, American Cancer Society Cancer Action, the\n\nAmerican Council on Exercise, the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American Institute for Cancer Research, American Nurses Association, the American Public Health Association, the American School Health Association, and the American Society of Bariatric Physicians.\n\nObviously, if you are on a diet for health reasons, as many people are, whether for your heart or diabetes or because you had bariatric surgery, it is very important to know and keep track of what you\u2019re eating. This is not simply a matter of convenience to many people if they want to stay healthy or even alive. It is, as Rep. Schakowsky put it, critical.\n\nBecause the requirements being struck down are in the Affordable Care Act, this legislation qualifies as yet another Republican attack on Obamacare.\n\nNaturally, the American Pizza Community (APC), which includes Domino\u2019s, Little Caesars, Papa Murphy\u2019s and Papa John\u2019s \u2013 Peyton Manning\u2019s safety-net hating buddy \u2013 love H.R. 2017. They already oppose paying employees a living wage. Why not get a dig in at their customers while they\u2019re at it.\n\nAs an example of their opposition, you can view Domino\u2019s specially made video here. Yes, telling you what you\u2019re eating is, says Domino\u2019s, \u201cridiculous.\u201d For the record, the pizza industry gives 88 percent of its donations to Republicans.\n\nInterestingly, however, Restaurant Business informs us, those requirements \u201care supported by the National Restaurant Association, which was urged by national chains to accept a federal mandate rather than leave them to contend with a patchwork of state, county and municipal laws.\u201d\n\nObviously, the National Restaurant Association feels the Republican alternative is the burdensome option.\n\nThe Senate, of course, has its own version of this appalling piece of legislation (S. 2217), introduced by Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) currently under consideration by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. For a bill to become law, both House and Senate must pass it, and the president must sign it. Republicans can count on Obama\u2019s veto where this legislation is concerned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite the protests of many medical organizations, Republicans ignore the health cost to Americans in favor of corporate profits", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Despite the protests of many medical organizations, Republicans ignore the health cost to Americans in favor of corporate profits", "title": "GOP Says the Right to Know What You're Eating is Burdensome to Corporations", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/02/13/gop-right-eating-burdensome-corporations.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Paul-ryan-this-week-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-13T07:45:55+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act,FDA,Obamacare,paul ryan,President Obama,Republican Party,U.S. House of Representatives,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2016-02-13T07:45:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-13T07:45:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act, FDA, Obamacare, paul ryan, President Obama, Republican Party, U.S. House of Representatives"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe180d\"", "article_summary": "Paul Ryan argues it\u2019s only \u201ccommon sense\u201d that Americans don\u2019t need to know what is in the food they\u2019re eating.\n2017 would undermine the benefits of the national menu labeling lawand confuse and mislead consumers.\nPresident Obama has stated his opposition to the so-called Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act.\nThis important legislation would roll back the FDA\u2019s burdensome menu labeling rule, giving American restaurants, grocery and convenient stores the flexibility they need to be successful.\nNever more, if congressional Republicans get their way, will restaurant, convenience store, grocery store, and pizzeria chains, have to tell you what you\u2019re eating."}
