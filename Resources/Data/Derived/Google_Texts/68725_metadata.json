Whoooomph! Whoooomph!\n\nIt\u2019s the sound of the wall-thumping, window-rattling music coming from \u201cboom-box vehicles\u201d as they cruise the streets of the city.\n\nPicture yourself in your car at an intersection waiting for the red light to change. Next to you the Mrs. and in the back seat your 4- and 5-year-old grandchildren. In the next lane is a car with its boom box stereo screaming music so loud that your car doors are rattling, your safety glass windows are pulsating with the velocity of a high speed blender, profanity laced lyrics permeating our space as vile as the world below.\n\nInside the car, two teenage boys, in the back seat two young teen Lolita-types nodding heads in time to the music. All seemingly oblivious to the aural trail of anguish and annoyance they create as they wait for the light to change.\n\nFor me it\u2019s not the burden so much as it is the strength to bear it.\n\nLast week they stuck again, this time it was one of those heavy metal musical concerts on wheels rumbled down Collins Street through the historic district. The pick-up truck blasting noise with enough kick to vibrate everything around me; people holding their ears, dogs howling, birds circling erratically, squirrels climbing ferociously to the top of trees.\n\nYou run but you just can\u2019t hide from it!\n\nI understand it\u2019s the job of every generation to criticize and disparage the musical tastes of the younger generation. In the 1950s Elvis Presley shocked the older generation with his hip-grinding performances. The \u201860s brought us the Beatles and long hair. Chubby Checker\u2019s \u201cTwist\u201d was reviled from pulpits as decadent.\n\nIn the 1960s I frustrated my father with the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll music of Chuck Berry and Eddie Cochran.\n\nI suppose I am just being my father 50 years ago, but never has a generation imposed their vile music on the public in such a way as they do today.\n\nWhen rapper Ice-T sings, \u201cI\u2019m \u2018bout to dust some cops off,\u201d it\u2019s not only offensive, it\u2019s inflammatory.\n\nToday\u2019s youth and their rap music could use some of grandma\u2019s soap.\n\nYet the Supreme Court ruled that people have a legal right to impose that ribald style of music on others.\n\nTurn up the volume people, the courts have your back.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court put itself in the passenger seat of these boom box vehicles, ruling that people have a right to such behavior, regardless of the rights of others.\n\nFirst Amendment Rights, they say.\n\nMost people believe in the right to free speech, but debate whether it should cover flag-burning, tobacco advertising, hate speech and hard-core rap that impose on the privacy of others. Many would agree to limit some forms of free speech.\n\nPolice Chief Ed Duncan says he has received numerous calls from citizens complaining about loud music coming from vehicles.\n\n\u201cBefore the Supreme Court ruling, a city noise ordinance gave us a voice, that\u2019s not the case now,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we are going to be able to address because of the law. It\u2019s something that\u2019s out of our control.\u201d\n\nTo the state Supreme Court, here\u2019s a bulletin:\n\nThe blasting of offensive music on an unwilling audience violates the right to peace and tranquility. The majority of people don\u2019t care to hear their music, they don\u2019t care about the number of watts in their sound system, and they certainly don\u2019t care to hear the vile.\n\nBut there is hope.\n\nThe state\u2019s high court ruled, in State v. Catalano, that the state\u2019s ban on booming loud music from a vehicle can\u2019t be enforced because it carved out exceptions for vehicles blasting out sound for business or political purposes, while putting a restriction on other types of sounds. Such \u201ccontent-based\u201d restrictions are unconstitutional; the court noted, however, that the state does have an interest in keeping loud car radios from bothering people, if there a reasonably objective way to do it.\n\nThe Supreme Court left the door open to revising the law.\n\nState Rep. Dan Raulerson please take heed because our community needs your help to find that \u201creasonable and objective way\u201d to keep loud music from infringing on the rights of others.\n\nThe law needs to be re-written restricting the sound of \u201cboom box\u201d music to 25 feet while leaving out any types of exceptions, presumably making the bill constitutional and preserving our right of privacy.\n\nAnd that is music to my ears.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Fri, 24 Jul 2015 08:33:26 -0400", "Description": "PLANT CITY There seems to be no lack of things to be riled about these days depending on your philosophic, political or religious leanings, from ISIS to Iran, to Obamacare, to same sex marriage, to t", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "PLANT CITY There seems to be no lack of things to be riled about these days depending on your philosophic, political or religious leanings, from ISIS to Iran, to Obamacare, to same sex marriage, to t", "title": "Noise ordinance would be \u2018music to my ears,\u2019 columnist says", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/plant-city/noise-ordinance-would-be-music-to-my-ears-columnist-says-20150724/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2015-07-24T11:16:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Noise ordinance would be \u2018music to my ears,\u2019 columnist says"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-07-24T08:33:26Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-07-24T11:16:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBefore the Supreme Court ruling, a city noise ordinance gave us a voice, that\u2019s not the case now,\u201d Duncan said.\nPolice Chief Ed Duncan says he has received numerous calls from citizens complaining about loud music coming from vehicles.\nYet the Supreme Court ruled that people have a legal right to impose that ribald style of music on others.\nThe Supreme Court left the door open to revising the law.\nIt\u2019s the sound of the wall-thumping, window-rattling music coming from \u201cboom-box vehicles\u201d as they cruise the streets of the city."}
