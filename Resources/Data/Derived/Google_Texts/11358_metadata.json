It rose to $325 or two percent of income this year, and will spike to $695 or 2.5 percent of income for 2016.\n\nThe mandate is one of the most controversial aspects of the 2010 health care law and served as the centerpiece of the 2012 Supreme Court decision upholding it as constitutional.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. held that while the mandate wasn\u2019t allowed under Congress\u2019s powers to control interstate commerce, it was valid as an exercise of its taxing power.\n\nThe penalty was a third rail of sorts during the law\u2019s first two enrollment periods, however, as the administration instead highlighted the positive aspects of web-based insurance exchanges and government subsidies that made plans more affordable.\n\nBut President Obama has said it will be harder than ever to find people who haven\u2019t signed up during the first two years, and that reaching them is critical to making his signature law succeed.\n\nThe government estimates that just 10 million Americans will sign up for plans on the health care exchanges for next year, a small increase over the 9 million-plus enrollees it attracted for 2015 and far short of the 21 million that budget analysts initially projected.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The administration is warning HealthCare.gov customers to make sure they log onto the Obamacare website and get covered so they don't face a stiff penalty for lacking health insurance next year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The administration is warning HealthCare.gov customers to make sure they log onto the Obamacare website and get covered so they don\u2019t face a stiff penalty for lacking health insurance next year.", "title": "HealthCare.gov alert gives rare nod to Obamacare penalty", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/12/healthcaregov-alert-gives-rare-nod-obamacare-penal/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/23/207e463da2f2982f850f6a706700a4a8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/23/207e463da2f2982f850f6a706700a4a8.jpg", "description": "The administration is warning HealthCare.gov customers to make sure they log onto the Obamacare website and get covered so they don't face a stiff penalty for lacking health insurance next year.", "card": "summary", "title": "HealthCare.gov alert gives rare nod to Obamacare penalty"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "The administration is warning HealthCare.gov customers to make sure they log onto the Obamacare website and get covered so they don\u2019t face a stiff penalty for lacking health insurance next year.\n\u201cImportant: The penalty for not having health insurance is increasing,\u201d the message says.\nThe mandate is one of the most controversial aspects of the 2010 health care law and served as the centerpiece of the 2012 Supreme Court decision upholding it as constitutional.\nIt rose to $325 or two percent of income this year, and will spike to $695 or 2.5 percent of income for 2016.\nAn email blast to people with Web accounts on the federal portal says going without coverage next year \u201ccould cost you $695 or more,\u201d a rare nod to the law\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d requiring most Americans to either hold insurance or pay a tax penalty."}
