The race is 10-12 miles long and includes crawling through waist-deep mud and under barbed wire, being zapped by electric voltage, jumping in very cold water and through fire and carrying or throwing heavy items. The cost ranges from $60 to $200 (depending on when you register).\n\nIt's being held in Central Florida at Westgate River Ranch in River Ranch, Florida.\n\nAlthough popular, the race has been in the news recently in a negative spotlight.\n\nThe death of a participant in April at a popular obstacle-course style race has many questioning safety at these events. Avishek Sengupta, 28, died April 20 while competing in a Tough Mudder race in West Virginia.
