Should Russia grant Obama asylum in Rostov after the Ferguson Maidanites occupy Washington?\" And Svobodnaya Pressa, a popular Russian news website, ran an article calling the Ferguson protests \u201cAfroMaidan,\u201d in reference to Euromaidan protests in Kiev, Ukraine, earlier this year.\n\nIn that Svobodnaya Pressa article, Sergei Bespalov, the docent of the humanities division of the Russian Academy of Agriculture and State Service, attributes the events in Ferguson in part to the \u201cfact\u201d that white Americans have \u201cprejudice towards African-Americans \u2026 in their blood.\u201d Bespalov predicts further unrest, adding that \u201cif [Obamacare] is cancelled, this could \u2026 provoke racial conflicts,\u201d and that \u201ca significant part of African-Americans and Latinos could perceive [Obamacare\u2019s cancellation] as a challenge from the white majority.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising that the Russian media jumped on the opportunity to use the events in Ferguson as \u201cproof\u201d of American hypocrisy. But explicitly linking Ferguson to Maidan reveals the Kremlin's deep fear of dissent\u2014the fear that any breakdown in authority will automatically lead to widespread chaos.
