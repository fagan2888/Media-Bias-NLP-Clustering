That is fueling expectations for further monetary easing, in the form of cuts in interest rates or banks\u2019 reserve-requirement ratios.\n\n\u201cAfter an over 50% gain last year, the market looked overbought\u201d but investors are returning once again, said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital. \u201cGrowth is soft but there\u2019s further stimulus on the way,\u201d encouraging buying, he added.\n\nAdding to the positive sentiment, China\u2019s state-owned People\u2019s Daily said in an article Wednesday that the recent rally was due to prospects of further economic reforms and the government\u2019s pro-growth stance. The report cited statistics from the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Ltd. showing new trading accounts on the mainland climbing to 720,800 last week, higher than the historical weekly average of 240,000.\n\nStill, most of the turnover is coming from local mom and pop investors, while foreign investors have been more bearish.\n\nThe Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, a trading link giving foreigners easier access to Shanghai stocks, has seen a lackluster month for purchases of Chinese shares. Inflows netted 13.3 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) in the past month, representing 4.4% of the program\u2019s total 300 billion-yuan quota.\n\nVolatility is also putting off investors in the short term. The Shanghai Composite was down as much as 5% in early February. It remains at roughly 60% of its record value in October 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, stocks in Shenzhen, the smaller of the mainland\u2019s two markets, have surged 29% this year, raising concerns of a bubble in smaller stocks. BNP Paribas estimates that stocks in Shanghai have traded at 13 times price-to-earnings this year, compared with 25 times in Shenzhen. The index was up 2% to a record high of 3,577.30 Wednesday.\n\nDaily turnover in Shanghai has been climbing since February and at 603 billion yuan Tuesday, it was at its highest since late December. At the peak, turnover reached 795 billion yuan on Dec. 9, 2014, according to data provider CEIC.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Shanghai Composite marked six straight days of gains, its longest streak since early February when the market rose seven straight days. The benchmark began trading at its highest level since May 2008 by yesterday\u2019s close.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s yuan hit a two-month high against the U.S. dollar after weeks of severe depreciation pressure as bets that authorities would continue guiding the currency weaker mounted. Investors now say the central bank\u2019s actions signal a preference for a stable currency. The yuan hit 6.2284 against the dollar, appreciating as much as 0.4% since its previous close.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, some markets struggled to shake off concerns ahead of an announcement by the U.S. Federal Reserve Wednesday on its interest-rate outlook. Stocks Singapore, Korea and the Philippines were slightly off.\n\n\u201cInvestors will be holding their collective breath for the Fed\u2019s announcement, as it will give the clearest, most data-driven account yet of where the central bank stands on the interest rate hike scenario,\u201d says Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities. The Nikkei Stock Average NIK, +0.09% was up 0.6% at 19,544.48, gaining ground for the fifth time in the past six sessions.\n\nIn Australia, shares of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. FMG, +2.07% in Australia plunged 5.3%, after the world\u2019s fourth largest iron ore exporter scrapped a planned $2.5 billion bond sale, surprising investors.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Stocks in Shanghai climb to near a seven-year high, as hopes for further stimulus from Beijing encourage investors to return to the market following a correction earlier this year on worries over slowing growth.", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BN765_china__MG_20131023231329.jpg", "height": 398}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Chao Deng", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Markets", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Stocks in Shanghai climb to near a seven-year high, as hopes for further stimulus from Beijing encourage investors to return to the market following a correction earlier this year on worries over slowing growth.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/asian-shares-mixed-china-gains-on-stimulus-hopes-2015-03-18", "author": "Chao Deng", "parsely-title": "Chinese shares climb to near seven-year high", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-03-18T05:55:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Markets", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Stocks in Shanghai climb to near a seven-year high, as hopes for further stimulus from Beijing encourage investors to return to the market following a correction earlier this year on worries over slowing growth.", "title": "Chinese shares climb to near seven-year high", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/asian-shares-mixed-china-gains-on-stimulus-hopes-2015-03-18", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BN765_china__MG_20131023231329.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BN765_china__MG_20131023231329.jpg"}, "article.id": "5F21249A-CD35-11E4-A8AD-C8EA73942D9F", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Inflows netted 13.3 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) in the past month, representing 4.4% of the program\u2019s total 300 billion-yuan quota.\nReuters Shanghai stocks climb on Wednesday.\nThe Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, a trading link giving foreigners easier access to Shanghai stocks, has seen a lackluster month for purchases of Chinese shares.\nAt the peak, turnover reached 795 billion yuan on Dec. 9, 2014, according to data provider CEIC.\nDaily turnover in Shanghai has been climbing since February and at 603 billion yuan Tuesday, it was at its highest since late December."}
