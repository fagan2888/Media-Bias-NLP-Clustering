But it soon became evident that the Hawaii Health Connector\u2019s technical challenges were so great that they severely impacted the public\u2019s ability to use the site,\u201d said HMSA spokesman Floyd Takeuchi. \u201cIn addition, technical issues were not resolved and, in fact, the site still has issues that haven\u2019t been fixed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to reassign critical staffers to deal with ongoing problems caused by technical problems at the Hawaii Health Connector. In the process, it has impacted our ability to serve other members.\u201d\n\nAccording to financial reports, HMSA lost $30 million in the first-quarter. Company executives blamed the Affordable Care Act and made up some of the loss; it\u2019s now $8.4 million in the red.\n\nBesides technical problems, HMSA said few businesses are using the exchange, though a large number of businesses have chosen the same plans directly from HMSA. Takeuchi said that\u2019s indicative of the small business market\u2019s lack of support for the exchange.\n\n\u201cFrom a policy standpoint, our successful Hawaii Prepaid Healthcare Act negates the need for a Small Business Health Options Program exchange. Small businesses are already mandated, by a Hawaii law that has worked well for 40 years, to provide health coverage for most employees. We don\u2019t need the small business exchange,\u201d Takeuchi said.\n\nHMSA will continue to ensure another 5,000 people enrolled through the individual subscriber portion of the connector.\n\n\u201cHMSA supports the intent of the Affordable Care Act, which is universal health coverage for Americans. This is where our need is in Hawaii \u2014 enrolling individuals who don\u2019t have health plans, not signing up small business employees who already have health coverage as a result of the Hawaii Prepaid Healthcare Act. HMSA is also encouraged that some 30,000 Hawaii residents have been identified as possible candidates for Medicaid coverage through the Hawaii Health Connector,\u201d Takeuchi said.\n\nThe connector has been plagued with technical and administrative problems since it opened in October and has been ranked the most costly exchange in the nation.\n\nGov. Neil Abercrombie predicted hundreds of thousands of people would register with the exchange, and state officials initially estimated as many as 300,000 people would sign up for health insurance.\n\nHawaii\u2019s uninsured rate is about 6 percent, down slightly from the 8 percent uninsured when the exchangelaunched in October.\n\nSo far, just 10,800 people have enrolled for health insurance through the exchange, despite a $204 million grant to set build a web portal and market the exchange in Hawaii.\n\nThat equates to about $18,888 dollars per enrollee spent by taxpayers.\n\nA May study by Kaiser Health reported Hawaii\u2019s exchange, which has just more than 8,500 people registered, had a tab of about $23,899 per person, but the exchange enrollment numbers have improved slightly, according to the state Legislature.\n\nHMSA CEO Michael Gold and many others \u2014 including U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, D-Hawaii, state Senate President Donna Mercado Kim and Senate Minority Leader Sam Slom \u2014 believe the state should seek an exemption from the ACA.\n\nThe Hawaii Health Connector\u2019s costs could be significantly reduced by simplifying it to serve as an information hub, providing information on benefits and premiums for participating plans, Takeuchi said.\n\nOnce someone chooses a plan the connector site could direct him to the participating insurer\u2019s website to buy the plan. HMSA and Kaiser, the only insurers that offer health plans on the Hawaii Health Connector, are already set up to process orders for health plans, Takeuchi added.\n\nTom Matsuda, interim executive director of the Hawaii Health Connector, said, \u201cThe decision will prevent many Hawaii small business owners from taking advantage of the small business tax credits that are only available within SHOP to reduce employee health insurance premium costs by up to 50 percent,\u201d Matsuda said.\n\nThe state\u2019s insurance commissioner, Gordon Ito, agreed.\n\n\u201cHMSA\u2019s decision affects small businesses\u2019 choices and their ability to receive small business tax credits next year by reducing to just one the number of health insurance plans offered through the Hawaii Health Connector beginning in 2015,\u201d Ito said.\n\n\u201cIn 2014 and 2015, per the federal Affordable Care Act, only qualified health plans purchased through the connector are eligible for small business tax credits. With HMSA\u2019s withdrawal, small businesses that purchased an HMSA plan and obtained tax credits in 2014 will no longer be able to do so in 2015. This also precludes other small businesses that might have been interested in obtaining tax credits with an HMSA plan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Hawaii's largest insurance provider pulls plans from Obamacare exchange", "title": "Hawaii's largest insurance provider pulls plans from Obamacare exchange", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12/Screen-shot-2013-12-09-at-8.38.35-AM.png", "updated_time": "2014-11-07T15:23:52+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/166290/hawaii-obamacare-exchange-3/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Hawaii", "tag": "ObamaCare", "published_time": "2014-08-21T04:00:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-07T15:23:52+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Hawaii's largest insurance provider pulls plans from Obamacare exchange", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12/Screen-shot-2013-12-09-at-8.38.35-AM.png"}, "title": "Hawaii's largest insurance provider pulls plans from Obamacare exchange", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Hawaii's largest insurance provider pulls plans from Obamacare exchange"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde47f\"", "article_summary": "HMSA and Kaiser, the only insurers that offer health plans on the Hawaii Health Connector, are already set up to process orders for health plans, Takeuchi added.\nBy Malia Zimmerman | Watchdog.orgHONOLULU \u2014 Hawaii\u2019s health-care exchange, the Hawaii Health Connector, has taken another blow.\nWe don\u2019t need the small business exchange,\u201d Takeuchi said.\nHawaii Medical Service Association, the state\u2019s largest health insurer, won\u2019t participate in the Connector\u2019s Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, as of January.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to reassign critical staffers to deal with ongoing problems caused by technical problems at the Hawaii Health Connector."}
