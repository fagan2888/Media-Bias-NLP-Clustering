There aren\u2019t many jobs where you get to do that,\u201d she says.\n\nBut her co-workers and the parents of babies she\u2019s cared for say she\u2019s the one who works miracles. Calee Travis, R.N., chief nursing officer at Centennial, says, \u201cJenny gives a real big piece of herself to these families. She\u2019s one of those unsung heroes who goes above and beyond, but to her, it\u2019s just what she does.\u201d\n\nMurray connects deeply with all families, and for those whose newborn does not survive, she brings deep empathy and understanding. One of the families Murray will never forget had a baby who was born with a fatal chromosomal abnormality. \u201cI was here the day we told the family about the diagnosis, and I was here the day we took her off the ventilator,\u201d she says.\n\nTo help them honor and remember their baby, Murray bought a keepsake box and filled it with tiny mementos from their daughter\u2019s life: the socks she wore in the NICU, a lock of her hair, and a tiny set of carefully made hand- and footprints. \u201cIt was something they could keep forever as a memory,\u201d says Travis.\n\nFamilies treasure those kinds of gestures and others, like the cards she has sent some bereaved parents on their child\u2019s birthday and anniversary of death. Since making that first memorabilia box, Murray has put together more of them for other bereaved families.\n\n\u201cWhen families grieve a baby they\u2019ve lost early on, sometimes they don\u2019t have a ton of people who\u2019ve met the baby,\u201d Murray says. \u201cThey fear their memory will just die, so I try to be real cognizant of that, help them retain some memories, and to show them I remember and that I really cared about their baby.\u201d\n\nOf course, an infant\u2019s intensive care stay often ends on a joyful note. \u201cYou ride a real roller coaster of emotions in the NICU,\u201d Murray says. From the first time parents hold their baby, to the first time a mother has to go home with her newborn still in the NICU, to the day the baby is discharged, Murray helps parents cope with a wide range of emotions. \u201cI tell them we\u2019re going to get through this. We don\u2019t teach kindergarten here in the NICU,\u201d she laughs.\n\nOne priority is to help parents feel as though their baby \u201cis still their baby,\u201d as she puts it. \u201cWith all the special care the babies need, the nurses kind of take over. But I like making sure that families feel like part of the team, and integrating them into the NICU. Sometimes parents can\u2019t hold their babies for a few weeks, but they can put their hands on them to calm them, take their temperatures, or change their diapers.\u201d\n\nMurray has organized reunions for parents whose infants have stayed in the NICU at the same time. \u201cI really enjoy being able to celebrate as well as being able to mourn with some of the families,\u201d she says. She\u2019s gone to first birthday parties, and parents bring their children to visit Murray as they grow older.\n\nTravis praises Murray\u2019s relationships with co-workers and supervisors, too. \u201cShe\u2019s one of those people where I know I can just pick up the phone, call her, and have a down-to-earth, honest conversation,\u201d she says. \u201cShe not only has a lot of clinical expertise, but she pulls her load. She\u2019s very giving and people enjoy working with her. Other nurses look up to her as a mentor.\u201d\n\nMurray takes a more modest view of herself. \u201cI feel as though I\u2019m doing what I\u2019ve been called to do,\u201d she explains. \u201cSome of the things I do, I don\u2019t do to try to make a mark; I don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re something extra. Then I hear from parents how important it was to them.\u201d\n\nHer gift is being able to be present with the parents, whether that\u2019s for the happiest of moments or the most difficult. \u201cI believe I\u2019m in my niche,\u201d Murray says. \u201cI\u2019m exactly where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NICU nurse helps parents cope during infant illnesses.", "csrf-token": "pPSJJllfo6IEvNcn8gXj2BpevpEwJFg2ZslUtE2d1bo=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/August/EM_aug15_190x127.jpg?1448315759", "description": "NICU nursing manager makes deep connections with families during and after their infants' stays.", "card": "summary", "title": "NICU Nurse Helps Parents Cope During Infant Illness"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/August/EM_aug15_190x127.jpg?1448315759", "type": "Article", "description": "NICU nursing manager makes deep connections with families during and after their infants' stays.", "title": "NICU Nurse Helps Parents Cope During Infant Illness"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "NICU, Centennial Health NICU, neonatal intensive care unit nurse infant illness, nurse family infant illness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce735\"", "article_summary": "One of the families Murray will never forget had a baby who was born with a fatal chromosomal abnormality.\n\u201cYou ride a real roller coaster of emotions in the NICU,\u201d Murray says.\nBut her co-workers and the parents of babies she\u2019s cared for say she\u2019s the one who works miracles.\n\u201cWhen families grieve a baby they\u2019ve lost early on, sometimes they don\u2019t have a ton of people who\u2019ve met the baby,\u201d Murray says.\nOne priority is to help parents feel as though their baby \u201cis still their baby,\u201d as she puts it."}
