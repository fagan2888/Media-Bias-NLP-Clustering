Nearly every group named the Square and the University of Mississippi campus as favorite parts of Oxford, along with parks, neighborhoods with character, bike trails, transit and others.\n\nOft-named concerns involved heavy traffic and overdevelopment, the Square and its preservation, lack of affordable housing, clear-cut developments and others.\n\nEngineer Jeff Williams illustrated the difficulty of serving all constituencies.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s good and bad is the double roundabout on Old Taylor Road,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for traffic not real comfortable for pedestrians.\u201d\n\nThe Vision 2037 facilitator group will host more public input opportunities late this month. On April 27 the first planning workshop will be from 5 to 8 p.m. at Oxford Intermediate School, and on April 30 another planning workshop will be from 5 to 8 p.m. back at Oxford Conference Center.\n\nerrol.castens@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @oxfordcitizenec", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Errol Castens Daily Journal OXFORD \u2013 Some 16 years after its ambitious Vision 2020 long-range planning process, the city of Oxford launched an update that focuses on the community\u2019s bicentennial year.
