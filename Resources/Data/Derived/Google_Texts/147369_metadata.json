No different than many, a major concern of theirs is healthcare. As CNN Money notes, the sex industry consists of people who view themselves as entrepreneurs who sometimes can't afford to purchase healthcare.\n\nEnter the Affordable Healthcare Act (which is the same thing as Obamacare, you fucking idiots) to save the day.\n\nBay Area sex worker \"Siouxsie Q\" says she has been looking for the right plan\u2014to no avail\u2014since 2008. When she and her partner researched joint plans, they learned the expense would be $400 to $500 monthly. That's not exactly in their budget.\n\n\"We just couldn't swing [insurance] in the Bay Area\u2014we're lower middle class, recent college graduates, in Startup Land trying to make our way,\" the 28-year-old explained.\n\nHowever, when Obamacare goes into effect on Jan. 1, it will give Siouxsie and her partner a more affordable option: a bill of $175 to $200 each month. In the meantime, they're juggling two California exchange plans and expect to receive a $275 tax credit monthly. Anyone making less than $46,000 annually is eligible for a tax credit that will account for their monthly healthcare expenses.\n\nThe new legistlation will be further benficial for sex workers because it will cover screenings for disease, violence and contraception. In addition, it will also make it hard for insurance companies to refuse coverage due to HIV status and gender identity.\n\nPresident Obama, winning the hearts of sex workers one act a time.\n\n[via CNN Money]", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_feed_thumb/k46es26eib20hwcdea5k.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Julian Kimble", "description": "Everyone's covered.", "og": {"site_name": "Complex", "description": "Everyone's covered.", "title": "Uninsured Sex Workers Find Hope in Obamacare", "url": "http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/11/sex-workers-love-obamacare", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/k46es26eib20hwcdea5k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Everyone's covered.", "title": "Uninsured Sex Workers Find Hope in Obamacare", "url": "http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/11/sex-workers-love-obamacare", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/k46es26eib20hwcdea5k.jpg", "site": {"id": 13049362}, "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-03T12:00:06-0500", "p": {"domain_verify": "51da1c238ae41f7163c35ac3e762917b"}, "fb": {"app_id": 685812641524750}, "sailthru.content.type": "News", "sailthru.tags": "News, Sex, City Guide, Complex, Pop Culture, complex", "keywords": "News, Sex, City Guide, Complex, Complex Magazine, Style Guide, Fashion News, Celebrity Profiles, Sneakers, Sneakers Guide, Sneakers Blog", "sailthru.channel": "Pop Culture", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/k46es26eib20hwcdea5k.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The new legistlation will be further benficial for sex workers because it will cover screenings for disease, violence and contraception.\nSex workers are regular people who go through the typical trials and tribulations like everyone else.\nPresident Obama, winning the hearts of sex workers one act a time.\nAnyone making less than $46,000 annually is eligible for a tax credit that will account for their monthly healthcare expenses.\nAs CNN Money notes, the sex industry consists of people who view themselves as entrepreneurs who sometimes can't afford to purchase healthcare."}
