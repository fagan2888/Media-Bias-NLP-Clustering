Every country that approves marriage equality offers a reminder how far back the U.S. is falling. While same-sex marriage has seen several victories on the state level since the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act) in 2012, it has yet to gain legal status on a federal level despite the support of President Barack Obama.\n\nThat could be changing soon. A ruling from earlier this month that upheld four gay marriage bans means it's very likely the Supreme Court will take up the case. The court's decision could finally set a federal precedent.\n\nUntil then, though, supporters of marriage equality will be forced to watch celebrations in countries like Finland while they wait their turn.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "Let\u2019s hope America follows this example.", "language": "en", "title": "Finland Just Did What the U.S. Still Won't", "og": {"site_name": "Mic", "description": "Let\u2019s hope America follows this example.", "title": "Finland Just Did What the U.S. Still Won't", "url": "https://mic.com/articles/105318/a-european-country-just-did-what-the-u-s-still-won-t", "image": "http://thumbs.mic.com/YjQ5N2FiN2NlNiMvU3dpRmp2TWhpLWVIckJYYmhwMTk5TG0xZGdFPS8xM3g1NDU6NDY2M3gyNzk3LzEyMDB4NjMwL2ZpbHRlcnM6cXVhbGl0eSg4NSkvaHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tL3BvbGljeW1pYy1pbWFnZXMvY3hrNHF6eHB4Z2gzMHR2cHNvZmdpb2tuaTVoa2dlcWZ2aDZydXU1dzVsenp6aTk5emNva3V6OXdkaHZwb3ZsdC5qcGc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"user_id": 139909832, "description": "Let\u2019s hope America follows this example.", "creator": "HeyMattConnolly", "url": "https://mic.com/articles/105318/a-european-country-just-did-what-the-u-s-still-won-t", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/policymic-images/cxk4qzxpxgh30tvpsofgiokni5hkgeqfvh6ruu5w5lzzzi99zcokuz9wdhvpovlt.jpg", "title": "Finland Just Did What the U.S. Still Won't", "site": "@MicNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mic", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"pubDate": "2014-11-28T12:59:03.000Z", "isBlacklisted": "false", "modDate": "2015-10-07T18:18:03.000Z", "keywords": "identities, lgbt, World", "type": "evergreen", "id": 105318}, "fb": {"admins": "23342,215337,1410801,675670245,13000939,616963,1479330109,1267070071", "app_id": 141861192518680}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "original-image": "https://media3.mic.com/OWNlNDBkZGEzYyMvTEtWU3NMdkJNQUllZHpXaUUwR3ZZMm92b0tjPS8xM3g1NDU6NDY2M3gyNzk3LzE5MTB4MTAwMC9maWx0ZXJzOnF1YWxpdHkoODUpL2h0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9wb2xpY3ltaWMtaW1hZ2VzL2N4azRxenhweGdoMzB0dnBzb2ZnaW9rbmk1aGtnZXFmdmg2cnV1NXc1bHp6emk5OXpjb2t1ejl3ZGh2cG92bHQuanBn.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MicMedia", "published_time": "2014-11-28T12:59:03.000Z", "modified_time": "2015-10-07T18:18:03.000Z"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Mic on LinkedIn;action-uri=http://www.linkedin.com/company/policymic;icon-uri=http://linkedin.com/favicon.ico", "identifier-URL": "http://mic.com/articles/74689/the-8-most-dysfunctional-families-in-tv-history"}, "article_summary": "Until then, though, supporters of marriage equality will be forced to watch celebrations in countries like Finland while they wait their turn.\nSame-sex couples in Finland can now get married after a close vote in the country's parliament.\nThe 105-92 vote in favor makes Finland the 12th European country to legalize marriage equality.\nThe new law means gay couples can share a last name and have the same child adoption rights as heterosexual ones.\nIt's also the last Nordic state to do so, though it did allow for same-sex couples to enter into sanctioned partnerships in 2002."}
