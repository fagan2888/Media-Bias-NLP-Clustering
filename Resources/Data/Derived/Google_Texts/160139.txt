The group in charge of helping New Hampshire consumers understand the Affordable Care Act is ramping up its efforts to get young men covered.



The second enrollment period under President Barack Obama's health care overhaul law ends Feb. 15. Covering New Hampshire is rolling out a new television ad next week aimed at young men, and has also enlisted professional basketball player Matt Bonner for a public service announcement.



The 30-second spot was shown Friday at a meeting of the state's Health Exchange Advisory Board meeting. It features the San Antonio Spurs player saying, "Get out there, live your life and get covered."



Women over age 45 were more likely to have signed up last year, so Covering New Hampshire is focusing on younger men during this enrollment period.
