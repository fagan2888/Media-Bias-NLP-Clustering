(AP) - A federal judge has invalidated an oil and gas lease in Osage County for not including a site-specific environmental assessment, a ruling an attorney says could impact other leases in the county.\n\nThe decision involves a lawsuit about the National Environmental Policy Act and whether it requires the Bureau of Indian Affairs to consider the potential environmental impact of each specific well site, the Tulsa World reported Friday (http://bit.ly/1Vg57aN ).\n\nThe BIA has generally granted drilling permits based on an environmental assessment of the county conducted in 1979. But U.S. District Chief Judge Gregory Frizzell ruled that the countywide assessment is outdates and too generic to satisfy the law.\n\n\u201cUnlike 1979,\u201d the judge wrote, \u201ctoday, virtually every drilling operation in Osage County involves hydraulic fracturing.\u201d\n\nThe logic of this ruling, if applied to a pending 2014 class-action lawsuit, could impact nearly every lease signed since NEPA was enacted in 1970, said attorney Donald Lepp, who is representing the plaintiffs in both cases.\n\n\u201cThe BIA ignored its duties under NEPA when it approved the lease and drilling permits,\u201d Lepp said. \u201cAs virtually every lease and permit approved by the BIA in Osage County were handled similarly, the ruling will have impact beyond just this case.\u201d\n\nThe ruling poses yet another problem for an Osage oil industry that has been in turmoil for more than a year. The BIA, partly in response to the class-action lawsuit, has made it more difficult and time-consuming to get drilling permits, and producers took the BIA to federal court to block stricter environmental standards that they say would have made oil production virtually impossible in the county.\n\nOil producers shouldn\u2019t be blamed if BIA regulations aren\u2019t in compliance with NEPA, said Jamie Sicking, an attorney for the Osage Producers Association.\n\n\u201cThe real bad actor here again is the BIA,\u201d he said. \u201cThe producers have to trust that the BIA is doing their job correctly.\u201d\n\nBIA officials could not be reached for comment.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Tulsa World, http://www.tulsaworld.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal judge has invalidated an oil and gas lease in Osage County for not including a site-specific environmental assessment, a ruling an attorney says could impact other leases in the county.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/25/us-court-ruling-could-impact-osage-county-oil-gas-/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A federal judge has invalidated an oil and gas lease in Osage County for not including a site-specific environmental assessment, a ruling an attorney says could impact other leases in the county.", "title": "US court ruling could impact Osage county oil, gas leases"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A federal judge has invalidated an oil and gas lease in Osage County for not including a site-specific environmental assessment, a ruling an attorney says could impact other leases in the county.", "card": "summary", "title": "US court ruling could impact Osage county oil, gas leases"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "TULSA, Okla.
