This is not a figment of imagination or something taken from a film. It is a fact, acknowledged by their own books and by historical evidence. It happened everywhere, here and there.\n\nWhen confronted about his statements by CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday, Hamdan did not retract his claim or distance himself from the blood libel slur. His only defense was that he \u201chas Jewish friends.\u201d\n\nWhatever \u201chistorical evidence\u201d or \u201cfacts\u201d Hamdan believes himself to be remembering, this is nothing more than the infamous blood libel: the most persistent and longest-lived anti-Semitic myth in history, aside from the claim that the Jews killed Jesus.\n\nThe blood libel originated in medieval England with the death of William of Norwich. William was a 12-year-old tanner\u2019s apprentice who was killed in 1144. At the time of his death, his parents accused the local Jewish community of responsibility, but investigations revealed nothing.\n\nSix years later Thomas of Monmouth, a Benedictine monk, decided to investigate and sensationalize the murder.\n\nDrawing purely on anti-Semitic hearsay and sensationalism, he wrote a martyrdom account, \"The Life and Miracles of William of Norwich,\" in which he said local Jews, acting as part of an international conspiracy, crucified the young boy as part of a ritual to reclaim control of the Holy Land.\n\nMonmouth\u2019s work was used to garner financial support from pilgrimages to the boy\u2019s grave and laid the foundations for the blood libel.\n\nSimilar stories crop up throughout Europe in the Middle Ages, often accompanied by episodes of violence and retaliation toward Jews. Stories of mob lynchings and illegal trials abound, especially during the Crusades, when these stories were used to justify pogroms.\n\nIn the case of the disappearance of 2-year-old Simon of Trent in March 1475, the entire Jewish community was arrested and 15 men burned at the stake after being forced to confess under torture. Until 1965, Simon of Trent was regarded as a saint in the Catholic Church.\n\nThroughout history the specifics of the blood libel varied and expanded. It primarily involved the baking of Christian blood in Passover matzo, but early accounts also occasionally described the crucifixion of children, the poisoning of wells, and the use of Christian blood to heal cuts from circumcision.\n\nIt should go without saying that these lurid stories in all their manifestations are patently untrue.\n\nBut these accusations of ritualistic murder and cannibalism are found not only in anti-Semitic propaganda. Early Christians faced their fair share of slander, too.\n\nThe Christian writer Minucius Felix records one rumor, which spread widely in the second and third centuries, that early Christians would ritually kill and consume infants as part of their initiation rites.\n\nThese accusations are effective because they strike at the heart of society\u2019s fears about outsiders. They involve the most vulnerable (children), the destruction of public resources (wells), or the presence of secret organizations in society's midst.\n\nAccusing those who are religiously different of attempting to undermine society by engaging in the ultimate taboo of cannibalism provides a justification for dislike of and violence toward small nonconformist groups.\n\nBut the shadows of history are long, and the longevity of this particular slander is impressive.\n\nAs recently as 1928, Jews in Massena, New York, were victims of blood libel. And in 2005, 20 members of the Russian Duma attempted to ban all Jewish organizations on the grounds that Jewish groups were anti-Christian and practiced ritual murder.\n\nReferences to the Nazis are irresponsibly bandied about in modern discourse, but in the case of blood libel these myths helped sow the seeds of the Holocaust.\n\nIn his interview Hamdan linked blood libel to current events in Israel.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Israelis concentrate on killing children. \u2026 This is engraved in the historical Zionist and Jewish mentality, which has become addicted to the killing of women and children.\u201d\n\nBlood libel is only one chapter in the violent history of anti-Semitism, but it resurfaces throughout as a means of encoding anti-Jewish sentiment and justifying violence toward and mistreatment of Jews.\n\nAs Osama al-Baz, an adviser to former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, observed in 2013, some \u201cArab writers and media figures \u2026 attack Jews on the basis of \u2026 racist fallacies and myths that originated in Europe.\u201d\n\nHamas may be doing no more than repeating tired cultural clich\u00e9s and long-debunked slander, but myth and action go together. The history of Europe is a testimony to the devastating power of the blood libel.\n\nPeople and cultures are defined by the myths they create, but also by the myths they accept and propagate.\n\nJoel S.
