At first glance, the village was monochrome: unpaved roads, skeletal trees and earthen houses washed out by snow and dust.\n\nBut before long, the vibrancy of Tibet\u2019s culture set my senses ablaze. The grittiness of yak cheese in tsampa, a barley flour porridge; the splendor of the village temple, every surface a filigree of Buddhist deities and scripture; and the whipping prayer flags atop snowy pinnacles all impressed upon me Tibet\u2019s distinct beauty.\n\nNo one can blame nomads for choosing the comforts of modern life over an exacting traditional lifestyle. But the government resettlement campaign is forcibly imposing its own vision of modernity, often resulting in poverty and destroyed communities.\n\nBy isolating nomads from their traditions, the government depletes minority cultures like Tibet\u2019s of their power.\n\nChina needs a uniting idea other than the Communist Party. Its rise is a story of sovereignty: escaping past colonial subjugation to reach the heights of global power. Thus, the government should return sovereignty to the Chinese people by respecting their diverse histories and cultures, in all of their harsh truths and raw beauty.\n\nZACHARY NGIN\n\nSan Francisco", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150716032100, "twitter": {"description": "A reader writes, \u201cChina needs a uniting idea other than the Communist Party.\u201d", "title": "Sovereignty for Tibet", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/opinion/sovereignty-for-tibet.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003799555"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/opinion/sovereignty-for-tibet.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003799555", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/opinion/sovereignty-for-tibet.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Sovereignty for Tibet", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 16, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Communist Party of China", "keywords": "Tibet,China,Qinghai Province (China),Nomadic People,Communist Party of China", "news_keywords": "Tibet,China", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A reader writes, \u201cChina needs a uniting idea other than the Communist Party.\u201d", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A reader writes, \u201cChina needs a uniting idea other than the Communist Party.\u201d", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 16, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-07-16", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Communist Party of China", "published": "2015-07-16", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "geo": "Qinghai Province (China)", "slug": "16Ltibet", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150716032100, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/opinion/sovereignty-for-tibet.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A reader writes, \u201cChina needs a uniting idea other than the Communist Party.\u201d", "title": "Sovereignty for Tibet"}, "pdate": 20150716, "des": "Nomadic People", "articleid": 100000003799555, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Sovereignty for Tibet", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "Its rise is a story of sovereignty: escaping past colonial subjugation to reach the heights of global power.\nThus, the government should return sovereignty to the Chinese people by respecting their diverse histories and cultures, in all of their harsh truths and raw beauty.\nAt first glance, the village was monochrome: unpaved roads, skeletal trees and earthen houses washed out by snow and dust.\nBy isolating nomads from their traditions, the government depletes minority cultures like Tibet\u2019s of their power.\nTo the Editor:Re \u201cChina Fences In Its Nomads, and an Ancient Life Withers\u201d (front page, July 12):I recently traveled to Erthi, a village of farmers and herders in Qinghai Province."}
