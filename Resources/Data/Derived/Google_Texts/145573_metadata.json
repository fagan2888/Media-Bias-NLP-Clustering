He\u2019s not a household name. To the extent he is known, it\u2019s for running the politically unpopular federal bank bailout program. And he\u2019s the man many California Republicans are counting on to rescue their party. He is Neel Kashkari, a former U.S. Treasury official under Presidents Bush and Obama. And as of Tuesday, he\u2019s running for governor of California.\n\nSkip To:\n\nNeel Kashkari is challenging a popular Democratic governor with a $17 million campaign war chest \u2013 as a Republican in one of the bluest states in the nation. Why? \u201cIf I saw a deep bench of talented Republicans who were going to do that, I\u2019d go help them,\" Kashkari said. \"But I don\u2019t see it. And so if no one else is gonna do it, then I\u2019m gonna go do it. I\u2019m gonna go charge up this hill and fight to turn the state around and give middle class families a fair chance \u2013 and we\u2019re gonna break the cycle of poverty.\u201d &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; The 40-year-old Kashkari is a practicing Hindu, the son of Indian immigrants. As one of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson\u2019s top advisors, Kashkari essentially wrote the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) during the 2008 financial crisis. Then, Paulson assigned him to run TARP \u2013 prompting nicknames like the \u201cBailout Czar\u201d and the \u201c$700 Billion Man.\u201d &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; \u201cBoundless energy, I think, would be the first phrase that comes to mind,\u201d said Michele Davis, who worked with Kashkari at Treasury as Secretary Paulson's lead spokesperson. Davis also described him as \u201crelentless,\u201d and praises his analytical skills, his passion and his cool confidence under pressure. \u201cWhen the problems were coming at us fast and furious, it was really easy to be daunted,\" said Davis. \"And he needed only that split-second to catch his breath and then was immediately on to, okay, we can take this on, we can figure it out, let\u2019s just go get it done.\u201d In an interview with Capital Public Radio, Kashkari talked of running a new kind of Republican campaign. \u201cMy priorities are very simple: jobs and education,\" Kashkari said. On jobs, Kashkari supports tax incentives and regulatory reform; for education: career technical programs and a longer school year. If you ask him, he\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s pro-immigration reform, pro-choice and pro-same-sex marriage. But he\u2019d rather stick to his priorities. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cI believe my message of economic empowerment \u2013 a good job and a good education \u2013 will resonate with a very broad range of voters \u2013 Republicans, decline-to-states, moderate Democrats, high income and low income.\u201d\n\nTo Senate GOP Leader Bob Huff, that\u2019s the kind of top-of-the-ticket candidate his party needs as it tries to dethrone Democrats\u2019 legislative supermajorities.\n\n\u201cNeel brings a lot of things to the table that do capture the imagination probably of more of the mainstream of the \u2013 let\u2019s call it the political center of California \u2013 which, if you\u2019re at 29 percent registration as we are, that\u2019s where you have to aspire to,\" Huff said.\n\nThat\u2019s an unspoken comparison to the other declared Republican candidate, tea party Assemblyman Tim Donnelly.\n\nRepublican political consultant Beth Miller agrees Kashkari has a chance to broaden the GOP\u2019s appeal. But, she adds, Governor Jerry Brown starts the race in an \u201cextraordinarily strong\u201d position \u2013 and Kashkari faces plenty of challenges:\n\n\u201cHe is not well known. He\u2019s gonna have to communicate who he is. He\u2019s running as a Republican, but he\u2019s also publicly stated that he voted for Barack Obama. And he has a more moderate social agenda,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMost of all, there\u2019s TARP. Kashkari took beatings at congressional hearings like this one in 2008:\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cAnd you can sit there and not come to a decision as to whether or not a $3 million bonus is too much?,\" said Rep. Donald Manzullo (R-Illinois), of TARP's executive compensation rules. \"If you even have to ask that question whether it's too much, Mr. Kashkari, you're not the man for the job. I think you should step aside.\u201d\n\nKashkari defends TARP, saying it stabilized an economy on the verge of collapse \u2013 and made taxpayers a profit. But his opponents are already making TARP a campaign issue.\n\n\u201cHe was a banker at Goldman Sachs, and then his one public policy act was to hand $700 billion to Wall Street banks,\" said Dan Newman, one of the governor's political advisors. \"So it\u2019s hard to imagine how that makes one qualified to be governor of California.\u201d\n\nAfter a year of meticulously laying the groundwork for his campaign, Kashkari finally went public Tuesday in Sacramento. The event at which he spoke? Where else \u2013 an economic forecasting event.\n\n\n\nFull Interview, Part Three: Defending TARP, why he voted for Pres. Obama in 2008, why he's a better candidate than Gov. Brown and Asm. Donnelly, and why the Calif. GOP needs a makeover\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nBio Bits\n\n40 years old\n\nSon of Indian immigrants\n\nPracticing Hindu\n\nDivorced (2011)\n\nNo kids but two giant Newfoundlands dogs, Winslow and Newsome, who each have facebook & twitter accounts (watch out, Sutter Brown\u2026)\n\nLives in Laguna Beach, also owns a home in Truckee\n\nGrapes!!! https://t.co/VIv1Xqrbv0 \u2014 Neel Kashkari (@neelkashkari) September 13, 2013", "article_metadata": {"description": "He\u2019s been called the \u201cbailout czar\u201d and the \u201c700 billion dollar man.\u201d Now, Neel Kashkari is running for governor of California as a different kind of Republican.", "author": "Ben Adler", "og": {"url": "http://www.capradio.org/16824", "image": {"width": 1708, "identifier": "http://www.capradio.org/media/1109257/Kashkari-P.jpg", "height": 1280}, "type": "article", "description": "He\u2019s been called the \u201cbailout czar\u201d and the \u201c700 billion dollar man.\u201d Now, Neel Kashkari is running for governor of California as a different kind of Republican.", "title": "TARP's \"$700 Billion Man\" Wants To Lead California"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "nid": 16824, "keywords": "Capital Public Radio, CPR, TARP's", "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And as of Tuesday, he\u2019s running for governor of California.\nHe\u2019s running as a Republican, but he\u2019s also publicly stated that he voted for Barack Obama.\nHe\u2019s gonna have to communicate who he is.\nAnd he\u2019s the man many California Republicans are counting on to rescue their party.\n\u201cIf I saw a deep bench of talented Republicans who were going to do that, I\u2019d go help them,\" Kashkari said."}
