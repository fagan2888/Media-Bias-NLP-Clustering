His most ardent supporters say he can be a future president.\n\nThe Bible-quoting boxer, who by law cannot run for president before turning 40, has said his \u201cthoughts on the presidency \u2026 are merely aspirational.\u201d His first presidential race would be in 2022.\n\nThat could be harder than defeating Mayweather., but he can take comfort in the thought that Filipinos love the underdog. His rags-to-riches story \u2014 rising from extreme poverty to becoming the wealthiest Philippine congressman \u2014 has captured the imagination of the millions in his Southeast Asian nation.\n\nPacquiao the underdog played well at home after it was disclosed that even with his shoulder injured he still fought aggressively against Mayweather, said political analyst and public administration professor Prospero de Vera.\n\nHe said the way Pacquiao lost the fight \u201cactually enhances his political viability\u201d and could help him win as senator in elections next year.\n\nBut the higher the office Pacquiao seeks, the fiercer the competition and the closer the public scrutiny he will face.\n\nTwo popular athletes have been elected to the Senate in the last 30 years. One had first served as a city councilor, the other was a businessman and sportsman before running for the upper house. Both worked full time as legislators, unlike Pacquiao.\n\nBut, winning an election \u201cmost of the time is not connected with being prepared for the job,\u201d de Vera said.\n\nSo far, Pacquiao doesn\u2019t have much to show as one of 292 representatives in the lower house \u2014 he hasn\u2019t successfully sponsored a single bill and is a top absentee in the chamber over the past five years.\n\nMany Filipinos see Pacquiao\u2019s loss as his cue to retire from boxing. For them, Pacquiao has already sealed his legacy not just as one of the world\u2019s greatest boxers but also as a source of national pride. Others want him to also withdraw from politics and enjoy the fruits of his 20-year boxing career.\n\nYet others don\u2019t believe he will retire anytime soon from boxing or politics. For one thing, his fight winnings are too big to ignore.\n\nPacquiao, who according to Forbes was worth $82 million before the latest fight, is often approached for financial support by individual constituents or even entire villages for anything from a community basketball court to funding for fiestas and scholarships. He also shoulders the expenses of his large entourage of relatives, friends and an assortment of hangers-on.\n\n\u201cI think he is not yet ready to retire,\u201d said Raul Martinez, mayor of Pacquiao\u2019s hometown of Kiamba and his wedding godfather. \u201cNot everything is in place yet. He has so many commitments that if you sum up (his money), it won\u2019t be enough.\u201d\n\nDoling out benefits and building a patronage network is a Filipino politician\u2019s staple.\n\nPacquiao gives at least 50,000 pesos ($1,125) to each of the 144 villages in his impoverished southern Sarangani province and over 500,000 pesos ($11,285) to each of its seven municipalities every year just for fiestas \u2014 like celebrations of local patron saints. He also pays professional fees for show-biz personalities he invites to appear at the parties, Martinez said.\n\nMartinez said he will try to persuade Pacquiao to run in next year\u2019s election for governor instead of senator for practical reasons \u2014 he will most likely be unopposed and he can save a lot more money on a local election compared to a national campaign for a Senate seat, where he is also expected to contribute to the campaigns of provincial governors and thousands of municipal officials whose support he will seek to win votes.\n\nSome fans still want a rematch because they felt cheated by the lackluster Pacquiao-Mayweather bout, which boxing analyst Ed Tolentino calls the \u201cFiasco of the Century.\u201d\n\nTolentino said that pending investigations by Nevada authorities into whether there was fraud or \u201cother shenanigans\u201d in the bout, \u201cthe rematch is as good as dead.\u201d\n\nPacquiao lost by unanimous decision after 12 rounds. He said he thought he won despite his injured right shoulder. He is facing several damage suits in the United States for alleged fraud in connection with the injury from people who spent money to watch or bet on the fight.\n\n\u201cWhen the injury had not yet been disclosed, people were blaming Floyd Mayweather for the lackluster fight because he resorted to hit-and-run tactics, but now people are blaming Manny Pacquiao for robbing them of the \u2018fight of the century,'\u201d Tolentino said.\n\nHe said, however, that Pacquiao can still retire without soiling his record as a champion. \u201cI do not believe that his legacy will be defined by the performance in the Mayweather fight,\u201d he said.\n\nAssociated Press writer Teresa Cerojano contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boxing loss could be Manny Pacquiao\u2019s political win", "title": "Boxing loss could be Manny Pacquiao\u2019s political win", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/10/boxing-loss-could-be-manny-pacquiaos-political-win/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150510_095030_manny-pacquiao.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150510_095030_manny-pacquiao.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-10T09:52:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T22:00:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI do not believe that his legacy will be defined by the performance in the Mayweather fight,\u201d he said.\nIn a country where elections are also entertainment and political programs secondary, candidates often win because of star power and money.\nMany Filipinos see Pacquiao\u2019s loss as his cue to retire from boxing.\nHe said the way Pacquiao lost the fight \u201cactually enhances his political viability\u201d and could help him win as senator in elections next year.\nBut can he overcome his poor record as an incumbent congressman, his humble origins and lack of political savvy to win a Senate seat, or even higher office?"}
