He takes her blood pressure himself and even schedules her next appointment, tasks that most doctors shunt off to assistants.\n\nLast Saturday, Gaillard called my father, aghast about a letter she had just received from the Medicare Advantage program of UnitedHealthcare.\n\nGaillard, one of close to 900,000 aged New Yorkers covered by Medicare Advantage, was informed that my father\u2019s contract was being terminated effective Jan. 1; she would need to find another doctor.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cSomething ain\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nThat something is Obamacare. Due to reductions in funding under the law, the Medicare Advantage programs, in which Medicare provides money for private insurers to cover seniors, have quietly started to cancel the contracts of providers to save money.\n\nAlthough there was much attention last week to the fact that many health insurance plans purchased on the individual market will be cancelled under Obamacare, the havoc it is wrecking on Medicare Advantage patients and their providers has been barely noticed.\n\nYet this is exactly what critics of the program have warned, even as its slavish defenders vehemently denied any coming ill effects.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) was pooh-poohed after he said this August that \u201cthe chances are that soon [seniors] will open up the mail to the bad news that your Medicare Advantage . . . has been changed in a negative way for you because of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nIn order to fund other aspects of the program, Obamacare cuts $717 billion from Medicare over 10 years; $154 billion of that will come from Medicare Advantage.\n\nCiti analyst Carl McDonald warned his clients earlier this year that government payments to Medicare Advantage programs would decrease by 7% or 8% in 2014, proving \u201cenormously disruptive to Medicare Advantage, likely forcing a number of smaller plans out of the business and creating disarray for many seniors.\u201d\n\nMcDonald could not be reached for comment, but his warning has come to fruition.\n\nAccording to New York State Medical Society president Sam Unterricht, UnitedHealthcare is canceling the contracts of 2,100 Medicare Advantage doctors, with nearly 8,000 patients, in the New York metropolitan area.\n\nBrooklyn internist Mitchell Lipton, who has 60 UnitedHealthcare Medical Advantage patients, received a cancellation notice from UnitedHealthcare two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cMy reaction was: I hate Obamacare.\u201d\n\nUnterrich, a Brooklyn ophthalmologist, says Empire Blue and Emblem Health are also cutting Medicare Advantage physicians loose, but he does not yet know how many. He wants a congressional investigation.\n\nNationwide, UnitedHealthcare is canceling 10-15% of its contracts with Medicare Advantage providers.\n\nBack to my father, Herbert Gahr. He voted twice for Barack Obama, and now feels the President has betrayed him. He thought the government health-care program would bring him more patients, not snatch away those already under his care.\n\nThe classic adage about good health is \u201can apple a day keeps the doctor away.\u201d\n\nElderly New Yorkers beware: The federal Leviathan that is Obamacare is devouring apples; it could soon make your favorite doctor stay away for good.\n\nGahr is an independent journalist.
