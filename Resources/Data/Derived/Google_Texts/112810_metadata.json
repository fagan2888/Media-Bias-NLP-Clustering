And what happens next will likely be up to not just the Heat, but Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh as well.\n\nThrough his agent, James informed the Heat on Tuesday that he has decided to opt out of the final two years of his contract, a move that means he becomes a free agent on July 1. He will be able to sign with any team, including Miami, and Heat President Pat Riley said he \u201cfully expected\u201d James to take advantage of his early termination option.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to sitting down with LeBron and his representatives and talking about our future together,\u201d Riley said.\n\nThe Heat have been preparing for this for some time. James, Wade and Bosh all got six-year contracts when they teamed up in Miami in July 2010, the last time free agency was accompanied by the sort of frenzy that will envelop the league over the next few weeks. But each of those deals came with options to leave either this summer or in 2015, in part to allow both the players and the team to have financial flexibility.\n\nJames \u2014 who averaged 27.1 points this past season \u2014 was owed $42.7 million for the next two seasons, though that seems irrelevant in the sense that he\u2019ll be getting plenty of money from the Heat or someone else for years to come. If he stays with Miami, he could sign a deal that would give the team room to maneuver within the structures of the salary cap and luxury-tax threshold.\n\nRUMOR MILL: Latest Nuggets draft and free-agency buzz\n\nSo could Wade and Bosh, if they choose to opt out as well \u2014 and if both do, Miami would potentially have plenty of cash to spend on roster upgrades. Neither has announced their plans, though both have previously said they want to remain in Miami.\n\n\u201cNo news here yet,\u201d Wade said Tuesday.\n\nJames stayed silent as well, with agent Rich Paul being the one who informed the Heat of the four-time NBA MVP\u2019s plan. But last week, while still dealing with the sting of losing the NBA Finals to San Antonio, James expressed how enticing the idea of flexibility is to him.\n\n\u201cBeing able to have flexibility as a professional, anyone, that\u2019s what we all would like,\u201d James said last week. \u201cThat\u2019s in any sport, for a football player, a baseball player, a basketball player, to have flexibility and be able to control your future or your present. I have a position to be able to do that. \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of times that you\u2019re not in control of your future as a professional.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s in control now. He turns 30 next season. He might just be entering his prime.\n\nJames said last week that he, Wade and Bosh owed it to one another to have a conversation before deciding where to play going forward. It is unclear if those discussions have taken place.\n\nAnd while James opting out was largely expected, the ripple effect of the move was seen all over the sports world.\n\nThe NFL, on its Twitter account, posted a photo of James dunking a football over the crossbar at the stadium his beloved Dallas Cowboys call home, light-heartedly asking him if he wanted to pass some time in a training camp while making his decision. And U.S. Soccer, also in a tweet, said it has a new team for him \u2014 then attached a photo of men\u2019s national team jersey bearing James\u2019 name and No. 6.\n\nEven hockey got into the act.\n\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019d be 6-10 on skates,\u201d someone posted to the Carolina Hurricanes\u2019 Twitter account, in a message to James.\n\nFor now, all that seems certain is James sticking to basketball. What team, that\u2019s now up for debate.\n\nHe\u2019s been with the Heat four seasons, been to the NBA Finals in each of those years, winning two championships and winning more games than any other team over that span. He seems to have largely recovered from the hit his image took when he left Cleveland for Miami in 2010, often saying he\u2019s much happier now as a person than he was then.\n\nPlus, his life has changed. He married longtime girlfriend Savannah Brinson last year, and the couple is expecting their third child.\n\n\u201cPlayers have a right to free agency and when they have these opportunities, the right to explore their options,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThe last four seasons have been historic and LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and Erik Spoelstra have led the Miami Heat to one of the most unprecedented runs in the history of the NBA.\u201d\n\nAP Sports Writer Tom Withers in Cleveland contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "LeBron James tells Miami Heat he will become free agent", "title": "LeBron James tells Miami Heat he will become free agent", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/24/lebron-james-tells-miami-heat-he-will-become-free-agent/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140624_075648_lebron-james-2.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140624_075648_lebron-james-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-24T07:54:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:19:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddcf2\"", "article_summary": "MIAMI \u2014 LeBron James delivered his message loud and clear, without actually saying a word.\nHe will be able to sign with any team, including Miami, and Heat President Pat Riley said he \u201cfully expected\u201d James to take advantage of his early termination option.\nJames stayed silent as well, with agent Rich Paul being the one who informed the Heat of the four-time NBA MVP\u2019s plan.\nAnd what happens next will likely be up to not just the Heat, but Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh as well.\nWhat team, that\u2019s now up for debate."}
