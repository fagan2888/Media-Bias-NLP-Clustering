But Catherine Lhamon, President Obama\u2019s assistant secretary of OCR, has interpreted her mandate very broadly\u2014issuing guidance to universities that they must adjudicate sexual assault themselves and could lose federal funding if they don\u2019t tilt the proceedings in favor of accusers.\n\nSome Republican Congressional leaders are perfectly aware that OCR has effectively become a rogue agency. Sen. Lamar Alexander has confronted OCR bureaucrats and accused them of subjecting schools to regulations that were never approved by the legislature, \u201ccircumventing principles of transparency and accountability,\u201d he said, according to The College Fix.\n\nThe question, then, is this: Why would a Republican-controlled Congress opt to increase OCR\u2019s budget? Writes Paul Mirengoff at Powerline, \u201cWhy is a Republican Congress about to reward OCR for not following the law?\u201d\n\nThis outfit does all it can to impose the left\u2019s agenda at the K-12 and college levels. In doing so, it often ignores the law, defining perfectly legal conduct as unlawful. If the OCR\u2019s resources are stretched thin, it\u2019s because of the Office\u2019s overreach, based on a willful misreading of the law. By increasing OCR\u2019s budget, Congress rewards its misconduct. The budget should be slashed, not increased.\n\nOCR maintains that it needs more funding in order to complete is current investigations of colleges. But the Competitive Enterprise Institute\u2019s Hans Bader\u2014a former OCR attorney\u2014argues that additional funding will merely incentivize the agency to launch even more witch hunts:\n\nA government official with inside knowledge says that this increase was included after a \u201ccouple Democratic Senators recently circulated a Dear Colleague Letter asking for a $6 million budget increase for the OCR, so they could complete their Title IX investigations in a more timely manner.\u201d But this budget increase will not reduce the number of incomplete investigations, but rather increase them over the long run. OCR just uses budget increases to make up new legal obligations for colleges out of thin air, and find violations based on conduct previously deemed legal. That it turn leads to even more open, incomplete investigations.\n\nExpect to see more of the same from OCR in the coming year\u2014particularly if Republicans refuse to rein in the agency.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Stop the madness.", "title": "Omnibus Gives More Money to OCR, the Agency in Charge of Title IX Witch Hunts", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/12/18/omnibus-gives-more-money-to-ocr-the-agen", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14504650592131.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stop the madness.", "title": "Omnibus Gives More Money to OCR, the Agency in Charge of Title IX Witch Hunts", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14504650592131.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Civil Liberties", "published_time": "2015-12-18T19:17:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd30ca\"", "article_summary": "By increasing OCR\u2019s budget, Congress rewards its misconduct.\nThe question, then, is this: Why would a Republican-controlled Congress opt to increase OCR\u2019s budget?\nOCR is charged with ensuring that universities are in compliance with Title IX, the provision of federal education law mandating gender equity.\nExpect to see more of the same from OCR in the coming year\u2014particularly if Republicans refuse to rein in the agency.\nSome Republican Congressional leaders are perfectly aware that OCR has effectively become a rogue agency."}
