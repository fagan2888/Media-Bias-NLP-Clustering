He had with him a 3-month-old baby girl.\n\nTroopers say Jacksonville is where Jackson's fianc\u00e9, the infant's mother, lives.\n\nThe Nissan was going eastbound on Highway 111 when it went off the road to the left, struck a ditch, a tree, then overturned. Troopers say alcohol nor speed were a factor in the crash. The man and baby were properly buckled in. Troopers believe the best explanation is that Jackson was not familiar with the wide intersection.\n\nTroopers say Jackson was pronounced dead at the scene while the infant was transported to Vidant in Duplin where she died.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The crash happened on Highway 111 near Jackson Store Road, just south of Beulaville and just east of Chinquapin around 4 o'clock a.m.", "language": "english", "author": "WITN", "og": {"url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Man-and-infant-killed-in-double-fatal-Duplin-County-crash-302351971.html?ref=971", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/504*315/fatal+crash+320.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The crash happened on Highway 111 near Jackson Store Road, just south of Beulaville and just east of Chinquapin around 4 o'clock a.m.", "title": "Man and infant killed in Duplin County crash"}, "twitter": {"description": "The crash happened on Highway 111 near Jackson Store Road, just south of Beulaville and just east of Chinquapin around 4 o'clock a.m.", "creator": "@WITN", "url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Man-and-infant-killed-in-double-fatal-Duplin-County-crash-302351971.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/504*315/fatal+crash+320.jpg", "title": "Man and infant killed in Duplin County crash", "site": "@WITN", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "fb": {"app_id": 100653909772, "pages": 45809529741}, "keywords": "Man and infant killed in Duplin County crash", "google-site-verification": "SAIlGc4W5cz6VdYh4YTfTRgDO0fVlzEwt0FUQF1Qp3g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Man and infant killed in"}, "article_summary": "Troopers say Jackson was pronounced dead at the scene while the infant was transported to Vidant in Duplin where she died.\nTroopers are investigating how a Georgia man crashed the Nissan Altima he was driving early Sunday morning in Duplin County.\nTroopers say Jacksonville is where Jackson's fianc\u00e9, the infant's mother, lives.\nTroopers say alcohol nor speed were a factor in the crash.\nThe crash happened on Highway 111 near Jackson Store Road, just south of Beulaville and east of Chinquapin around 4 a.m."}
