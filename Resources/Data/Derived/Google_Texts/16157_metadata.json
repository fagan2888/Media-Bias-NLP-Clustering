Among these are California (2.1 million uninsured eligible for assistance), Texas (1.5 million eligible), Florida (1.1 million eligible), New York (865,000 eligible), and Pennsylvania (656,000 eligible).\n\nTen percent (3.1 million) of the nonelderly uninsured fall into a coverage gap in which they earn too much to be eligible for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for financial assistance through an ACA marketplace. The gap exists in the 20 states that have opted not to expand Medicaid \u2013 the state/federal insurance program serving low-income people \u2014 under the health care law.\n\nAmong states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, the largest number of people in the coverage gap live in Texas (766,000 people), Florida (567,000), Georgia (305,000), and North Carolina (244,000).\n\nNew Estimates of Eligibility for ACA Coverage among the Uninsured is available at kff.org\n\nFor more information on the uninsured population in the United States, see our updated fact sheet Key Facts About the Uninsured Population.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress.com", "application-name": "The Henry J.
