MANCHESTER, N.H. â€” Gov. Chris Christie was asked "five quick ones" by NBC's Matt Lauer during a one-on-one interview on the "Today" show with the governor that aired Thursday morning.

Here's a look at how Christie responded to the rapid-fire questions.

LAUER: "President Obama made my country?"

CHRISTIE: Weaker.

LAUER: "In 2017, Obamacare will be?"

CHRISTIE: Repealed and replaced.

LAUER: "In 2017, gay marriage will be?"

CHRISTIE: Hmm. Decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, I suspect.

LAUER: Which way?

CHRISTIE: Don't know.

LAUER: "In 2017, Common Core will be?"

CHRISTIE: Probably no longer a factor in American life.

LAUER: And last one, "In 2017, my work address will be?"

CHRISTIE: We'll see. I don't know. I don't know.
