More than 3,600 people have been confirmed dead after Saturday\u2019s 7.8 magnitude earthquake destroyed buildings and caused landslides; strong aftershocks have hampered the recovery. Hundreds of climbers are stranded on Mount Everest\u2014including many unreachable by helicopter\u2014and more than a dozen climbers have died. Here\u2019s a list of ways to help.\n\nAn Apple profit jump on strong iPhone sales in China. Among the questions facing the US tech company when it reports quarterly earnings: When are more share buybacks coming? How much did bigger-screen iPhones boost China sales? And will iPad sales ever bottom out?\n\nUkraine and the EU try to mend their frayed relationship. A summit in Kyiv is the first formal meeting since the crisis with Russia began. The EU is concerned that Ukraine is not moving quickly enough to open up its economy and political system, while Kyiv is frustrated by EU divisions over Russian sanctions.\n\nAbe in America. Japan\u2019s prime minister visits Washington as the US and Japan prepare to sign an expanded defense accord and finalize a major trade pact. On Wednesday, he will be the first Japanese leader since World War II to address a joint session of Congress\u2014and critics are alert for any sign he might downplay Japanese wartime atrocities.\n\nExecutives and politicians headline \u201cDavos with palm trees.\u201d Sessions at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles include Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg interviewing three former US treasury secretaries.\n\nOver the weekend\n\nCapgemini bought Igate for $4 billion. Europe\u2019s largest technology services provider will pay $48 per share for its US rival, valuing Igate shares 4.7% higher than last week\u2019s closing price. The purchase is seen as complementary to the French company\u2019s European operations, and could represent a new challenge to IBM.\n\nDeutsche Bank cut back. Germany\u2019s biggest lender said it would reduce its ownership in its Postbank consumer banking unit and shrink its securities business to achieve cost savings of \u20ac3.5 billion ($3.8 billion) annually. The bank will also close 200 branches as it tries to reassure investors worried about rising legal costs and a poor stock performance.\n\nRatan Tata invested in Xiaomi. The chairman emeritus of Indian\u2019s Tata conglomerate became an advisor to the Chinese smartphone manufacturer after investing an undisclosed sum. Tata\u2019s involvement may help Xiaomi to navigate India\u2019s business and political landscape as it tries to expand in its largest market outside of China.\n\nDBS beat expectations. Southeast Asia\u2019s largest lender reported a record first-quarter net income of S$1.3 billion ($953 million), 3% higher than a year earlier and far higher than expectations. Higher interest rates offset a general slowdown in lending, and the sell-off of a Hong Kong property investment added S$136 million in revenue.\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s chairman stepped down. Ferdinand Piech, the chairman of the automaker\u2019s supervisory board, resigned suddenly after losing out in a power struggle with CEO Martin Winterkorn. Piech aired his criticism of Winterkorn publicly several weeks ago, creating a leadership crisis at the top.\n\nQuartz obsession interlude\n\nMarc Bain on how history and science support the fashion industry\u2019s recent embrace of gender-neutral clothes. \u201cThe rules that govern what men and women should wear are actually fairly arbitrary. We know that because they keep changing. In fact, men and women in Europe and other cultures wore more or less the same garments for centuries.\u201d Read more here.\n\nMatters of debate\n\nGlobalization is unraveling. Overseas profit margins are shrinking, and the economic benefits are looking flimsy.\n\nDrones are the most accurate weapon. Bombing and shelling are far worse in terms of civilian casualties.\n\nStarbucks proved that Obamacare worked. The coffee chain once drew workers with great healthcare, but now offers tuition subsidies instead.\n\nCirque du Soleil has no chance in China. The group\u2019s acrobatics are nothing the Chinese haven\u2019t been doing for centuries.\n\nWeird workers are an asset. Fostering quirkiness among staff increases creativity and collegiality.\n\nSurprising discoveries\n\n\u201cHurricane Isis\u201d was dropped from the 2016 list of storm names. It was expected to cause too much fear.\n\nChina is building a great wall of trees. It\u2019s designed to combat the desertification of the country\u2019s northern provinces.\n\nQuicksilver makes a \u201ctrue wetsuit\u201d for executive surfers. The pants, jacket, and tie are made of neoprene and another water-friendly fabric.\n\nStephen Hawking weighed in on a boy-band defection. In a parallel universe, the physicist said, \u201cZayn is still in One Direction.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a new Rubik\u2019s Cube world record. Teenager Collin Burns solved the puzzle in 5.25 seconds\u2014though a Lego robot is even faster.\n\nOur best wishes for a productive day.
