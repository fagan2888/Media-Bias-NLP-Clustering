The house had been on the market and vacant for months \u2014 and neglected for years.\n\nMy friend, D.C., is in the market for a house. I\u2019m along for the ride because I like this stuff, being sick in that way, and because D.C. thinks that because I write these columns, I know what I\u2019m doing. (Someone should to talk to him about that \u2026 )\n\nWe\u2019ve looked at a dozen houses. Some were brand new, \u201cturn-key\u201d properties, with the price tags to go with that description.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like a new car,\u201d I tell him, shaking my head. \u201cNowhere to go but down.\u201d I am biased against new houses.\n\nSome were fixed up, but poorly.\n\n\u201cWhy pay extra for someone else\u2019s mistakes?\u201d I ask. I am against paying for, and then tearing out, perfectly good materials just because I don\u2019t like them.\n\nSome houses started off on the wrong track \u2014 and stayed on it. For those, I had just one word. \u201cScrape.\u201d\n\nBut a couple of the houses we saw, like this particular fixer, had potential.\n\n\u201cThe place can only go up from here,\u201d I said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to feel guilty about tearing good stuff out, because there isn\u2019t any. You could put in the finishes you want, with my approval, and instantly add to your investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a house, not for trouble,\u201d said D.C. His worry level is an 11 on a scale of 10.\n\nAnd \u2026 I see what he sees in this hurting house. The interior paint is filthy and nicked; outside, it\u2019s peeling. The wood floors need refinishing. There\u2019s dog urine on the baseboards. The pool is as brown as a pond. The fireplace has smoke stains. The oven door is broken, and the cabinets come in five styles and colors. The carpet is trashed. The ceiling has water stains; it\u2019s buckled and cracked in places. In one room, there\u2019s a hole big enough to crawl through.\n\nThe contractor climbs down from the attic and confirms what we suspect. The place needs a new roof, and has mold beyond what he\u2019s allowed to tackle (which is 6 square feet).\n\nOne of the two 15-year-old air-conditioning units is broken. And we mean smashed, as if someone hit it with a hammer, which they probably did one August day when temperatures were hot, tempers hotter and money tighter than a pin-up\u2019s girdle.\n\nBut beneath it all is a well-proportioned house. It\u2019s in a great neighborhood, surrounded by much nicer homes. It has good light, good bones and good flow.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d D.C. asks.\n\n\u201cIf it were my money, which it\u2019s not, I\u2019d make an offer,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cBased on what?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHeart math.\u201d\n\nHis eyebrows ask for an explanation.\n\n\u201cThe asking price, minus costs and time and stress to repair, plus a gut-level feeling that you could make the place rock.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the house has potential?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d\n\nSyndicated columnist Marni Jameson is the author of two home and lifestyle books, and the forthcoming \u201cWhat to Do with a Houseful of Memories\u201d (Sterling Press). Contact her through www.marnijameson.com.\n\nSix foreclosure-buying tips\n\nAs D.C. weighed making an offer on his bank-owned fixer-upper, I summoned in my mind all the tips I\u2019ve extracted from experts in home restoration, fixing, flipping and foreclosures, and factored in my own experience building and remodeling. Here\u2019s my advice.\n\n1. Follow the formula. When you\u2019re making an offer on a foreclosed property, start with the bank\u2019s asking price, then subtract 150 percent of what it would take to get the home up to baseline \u2014 and that means a refreshed interior, intact walls, working appliances and a serviceable roof. For example, say the asking price is $400,000, and it would cost $50,000 to do all the necessary repairs and replacements. Add half the cost of the repairs for your time, energy and sweat for a total discount of $75,000. Offer $325,000. Submit your offer with a summary of the contractor\u2019s repair estimate, and an explanation that you are subtracting $25,000 for assuming the risk of the unknowns. And make no bones about it: there are risks.\n\n2. Be brutally unsympathetic. When you\u2019re making an offer on a bank-owned property, don\u2019t worry about offending the owner with a low offer. You can\u2019t, because banks have the emotional capacity of ice machines.\n\n3. Show and tell. Take pictures of damaged areas and include them with the offer. Often with foreclosures, including this one, the ice machines, a.k.a. the bankers, haven\u2019t set foot on the property. The machine doesn\u2019t know how run-down the house is and has likely based the listing price solely on neighborhood comparable properties, known as comps.\n\n4. Get real estimates. Do not wing it. I repeat, do not guess how much the repairs will cost. Get a written estimate from an experienced contractor \u2014 better yet, several. We paid the contractor $100 for his time to look the place over, take measurements and prepare a comprehensive bid for what it would cost to bring the home up to baseline \u2014 not for extras. This is not in lieu of a home inspection; you\u2019ll want one of those as well.\n\n5. Stay cool. The ice machine might make a counteroffer. But even ice machines understand the cost of carrying an empty property for months.\n\n6. Stick to your number. You, unlike the bank, have the advantage of not being a machine. Figure out the most you will pay, and if the bank won\u2019t accept it, walk. This is often hard, especially for the heart part of the heart-math equation, but do not get emotional. There are other houses. If the bank accepts your offer, then you can get emotional. And you will have plenty of reason to.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Doing the unemotional math on buying a fixer-upper", "title": "Doing the unemotional math on buying a fixer-upper", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/20/doing-the-unemotional-math-on-buying-a-fixer-upper/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150220__20150221_C2_FE21AHMARNIp1.jpg", "height": 437}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150220__20150221_C2_FE21AHMARNIp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-20T17:08:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:05:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2da\"", "article_summary": "The word \u201cpotential\u201d alone is dubious, as in, \u201cthat kid has potential,\u201d \u201cthat relationship has potential,\u201d \u201cthat job has potential.\u201d The word \u201cpotential\u201d gets called out when one wants to infuse a precarious situation with rosy hope and optimism.\nPut the word \u201chouse\u201d in the same sentence, and you\u2019ve just added another barrel to the shotgun.\nIt has good light, good bones and good flow.\nWhen you\u2019re making an offer on a bank-owned property, don\u2019t worry about offending the owner with a low offer.\nI am against paying for, and then tearing out, perfectly good materials just because I don\u2019t like them."}
