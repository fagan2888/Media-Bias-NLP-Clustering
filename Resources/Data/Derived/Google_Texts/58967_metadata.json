The firm, exclusively serving healthcare and financial services companies, today announced a new executive team structure and the launch of a strategic business unit, to serve the firm\u2019s growing life sciences portfolio.\n\n\u201cOn the heels of a strong 2015 we are solidifying our executive team, which will equip the company to better anticipate and address the needs of today\u2019s CMO,\u201d said Rich Levy, CEO of PARTNERS+simons and Myelin Communications. \u201cBy unifying creative and technology under one leader, investing in strategic thought leadership and forming a new life sciences business unit, we are positioning the agency to deliver results-driven work that forward-thinking clients demand.\u201d\n\nEffective immediately, Andrew Pelosi will become General Manager, overseeing account management, media, delivery and business development. Bob Minihan will add technology to his responsibilities as Chief Creative Officer, better reflecting the convergence in thinking across these two disciplines.
