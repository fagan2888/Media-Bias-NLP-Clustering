What skills or qualities do you have that your opponents do not?

An effective legislator must have extensive public policy experience and the backbone to enact reforms. Among the 11 candidates on the ballot, I have the most public policy experience and the most extensive record of enacting common sense, pro-taxpayer and public safety reforms. I have 32 years of public service as a Naval Officer, mayor, Governor Wilson’s Insurance Advisor, Legislative Health and Insurance Policy Advisor and as CEO of a local, small business chamber of commerce.

Sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS Midway called me “Hurricane Hanley” because I got the mission done. I take action. I have enacted 12 balanced budgets, cost-saving pension reforms, defeated tax increases, banned the corrupt use of eminent domain, reduced the fire threat and wrote HMO, mental health and workers’ compensation reforms. I’m the only candidate who has written legislation and gotten bad bills vetoed. I’m endorsed by prominent conservatives and job creators.

If elected, what will be your top priorities and why?

Among the 11 candidates on the ballot, I provide on my website, KevinHanley.org, the most extensive list of reform ideas to ignite the California Comeback. I have posted videos and over 100 of my published articles on how I will fight to balance the budget; reduce crime; prevent catastrophic fire; preserve Proposition 13; cut California’s high taxes; create abundant water and energy supplies and private sector jobs; reduce traffic congestion; repeal laws that encourage illegal immigration; replace onerous Obamacare provisions with reforms to guarantee patient choice of physicians, hospitals and treatments; and end the “Train to Nowhere” and the Twin Tunnels.
