I wanted to interrupt this person and tell them the truth of it, which is that my \u201cwitness\u201d is shot full of holes.\n\nCaregiving for an elderly person with dementia can seem like a piece of cake early on in the process. But as it progresses, and more of their brain switches off, it becomes increasingly fraught.\n\nOn top of that, I keep getting sick. Not, terrible sick, but bad enough to suck all the life out of me and make every day feel like a march through knee deep mud. I\u2019ve had two colds in two months. Colds aren\u2019t much of anything, unless you\u2019ve got asthma. But put a cold together with asthma and no sleep and all the rest of my life right now and you\u2019ve got a recipe for lungs that just won\u2019t work.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in March. I somehow did not get pneumonia, which the doc assured me was what happened to most folks. But I did get such a bad case of on-going, never-stop asthma that, as he told me, \u201cYour lungs aren\u2019t moving air.\u201d Enter the miracle of antibiotics and steroids, and I got all healed up and back in the race again.\n\nThen, along came another cold. It sent Mama to the er last week. Now it\u2019s gone down into my lungs and formed an alliance with the asthma. I\u2019m probably going to have to do the antibiotics/steroids all over again.\n\nWhy am I telling you this?\n\nBecause I want you to understand that my \u201cwitness\u201d is a weak and faulty thing. When I\u2019m lying on the sofa, coughing and hacking, I\u2019m not exactly doing a good job as a caregiver. Mama, who can no longer follow a book or a plot on tv, and so is no longer amused by either books or tv, demands constant amusement.\n\nWhen I\u2019m sick, I can\u2019t do this. Instead of working with her to keep her wound up and moving, I end up letting her sit on the sofa like a zombie, or I send her to her room where she falls asleep. That\u2019s not good care of someone with dementia. But it\u2019s all I can do when I\u2019m sick.\n\nI\u2019ve never resented the spring storms the way I have this year. They set off my arthritis, and somehow or other the stress with Mama seems to make that worse. Plus, I feel the weight of taking care of her in a storm in a way I never felt the weight of taking care of the kids when they were little.\n\nCompared to her, they were ez pz. When they were very small, I just picked them up and did what needed doing. When they were full-on kids, they did what I told them in difficult situations without argument.\n\nBut Mama is a never-comprehending rubics cube. She trusts me and will do what I ask of her. But if I\u2019m not there, she fights whoever is trying to help her. That adds a dash of salsa to the storms that, for some reason, seems too much.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m dealing with right now: Too much. It\u2019s all too much. And I\u2019m not sure why.\n\nI think I\u2019ve solved the doctor thing. I simply went on a doctor hunt, and it turned out that I landed on the right square early on in the search. The doc and the staff at the er last week were kind, and they understood my situation almost without my telling them. That was a blessing.\n\nEverything is do-able. Today.\n\nThat\u2019s the only promise a caregiver for someone with dementia has: Today. Or, maybe not even today. It may end up that all you know is that things are going good right now. In an hour, it can change, and you are dealing with a full-on hallucination or making a fast trip to the er.\n\nBut for today, for this minute, I have loads of help from my kids, and Adult Day Care, and I have prescriptions that seem to be working with Mama and my only problem is that I Do. Not. Want. to go to the doc myself.\n\nI would rather eat dirt than go spend another $160 at an urgent care place to get a script for antibiotics and steroids. But I know that primary care docs with their $20 copay take about 3 weeks to see you, and this isn\u2019t worthy of an er (which is much more miserable than going to an urgent care facility, anyway) so, I have to do the $160 do to get a couple of scripts that, to be honest, I could write myself.\n\nSee how I whine? See how negative I\u2019ve become?\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about when I say my \u201cwitness\u201d is less than shiny bright and pretty.\n\nIn truth, Mama\u2019s dementia is doing at least as bad a job on me as it is on her and I can\u2019t figure out why. I hit some sort of wall when she stopped sleeping at night. I know part of that wall was simple exhaustion.\n\nOne of the two hardest nights of her dementia so far was last month, when I was sick and she would not stay in bed. I felt so lousy, and she was up and roaming and had to be managed all night long. Before these new meds, she argued with me and refused to go back to bed and had hallucinations that terrified her and made her unmanageable.\n\nThat night was about 30 years long, and the next day, I was so sick I had to get medical help for myself.\n\nThen, when we put her in the in-patient diagnostic and she just slept through the night and didn\u2019t do any of this for them so they could help us with it, I hit some sort of despair point. I cried for days and couldn\u2019t stop crying. We finally managed to get a script that actually does help, that not only lets her sleep at night but clears the hallucinations.\n\nThings should be all better now. In fact, they were looking up, then we got this blamed cold. The high wire act of dementia care is such that something as simple as a cold can cause everyone to fall off and into the net. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened to me.\n\nThe thing I hang onto is something a man whose name I never learned told me years ago. I taught a class at Youth With a Mission in Hawaii a few years back. It was a glorious experience, spending an entire week in that beautiful Christian environment. Everyone I talked to was a spirit-filled, all-in Christian who wanted to change the world for Christ.\n\nOne evening, I was sitting out, watching the sunset, when a man with a baby joined me. We got to talking and he told me the story of how he came to adopt this baby. Long story short, the baby had no one, and he was reluctant to take on raising a child at his advanced age. But when he and his wife did adopt the baby, the child blessed their lives with love and wonder as only a baby can.\n\n\u201cGod only wants to bless you,\u201d he told me.\n\nI keep thinking of that comment when things are difficult with Mama. \u201cGod only wants to bless you.\u201d\n\nI believe that, and I know it\u2019s true of me and my situation right now. Mama has been a blessing to me all my life. Seeing her home is not a punishment. It\u2019s a gift. A blessing.\n\nThat thought is what dries my tears and pulls me back out of despair. I write these blog posts as unsparingly as I can because I think that as a society we need to face up to the fact that we not only abandon our elderly, we abandon their care givers.\n\nCare for people who have dementia is a act of life and love. It is pro life for real. Euthanasia, which is being pushed as an \u201canswer\u201d to dementia and a \u201crelief\u2019 for caregivers, is satanic. It is from the blackest pit of hell.\n\nWhat we need to do as a society is take off our blinders and help people who are caring for their family members with dementia. We need something like the Rain Teams that Christians once formed to help people with AIDs, only for families who are caring for loved ones with dementia.\n\nCare of the care-giver is a forgotten piece of the equation of caring for our elderly. I can tell you that as the dementia gets worse the caregiver begins to need love and support every bit as much as the person they are caring for.\n\nMy \u201cwitness,\u201d such as it is, is a call for us to do better. It is not a \u201cwitness\u201d of my heroism and perfection. It is, rather, a witness of my weakness and failures. I am not a cheerfully self-sacrificing saint. I am everyman and everywoman, just muddling through and hanging on and falling flat and getting back up.\n\nI do not fall into raptures of grace when I am dog tired and at my wit\u2019s end. I sit down and cry. I am not always reasonable. I do not always do the right thing.\n\nI am you. And me. And every one of us.\n\nThat, and not some idea of perfection, is my witness. It is why I can say without equivocation that caregivers of elderly parents with dementia need help. They need love. They need comforting and support.\n\nThe Lord only wants to bless us. And the first blessing comes from His command that we \u201cLove one another.\u201d\n\nAll His blessings are blessings of love and life. Seeing Mama home is a blessing of love and life. If we rise to this challenge that I am making and will continue to make, and help caregivers of people with dementia, we will be blessing ourselves and one another with love and life.\n\nI write about Mama with as much honesty and raw reality as I can. The reason is that I am issuing a call. I am calling Christians to formulate means to help caregivers of people with dementia in the simple, human ways that they need help. Put life and love back in their days of chaos. God wants to use them to bless you.\n\nAll God ever wants to do is bless each and every one of us. And the first and only true blessing is love.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Public Catholic", "description": "Catholic in the Public Square", "title": "We Need Caregiving for Caregivers of Parents with Dementia", "url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/publiccatholic/2015/05/we-need-caregiving-for-caregivers-of-parents-with-dementia/", "image": "http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/publiccatholic/files/2015/05/MAMA-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,patheos.mkt5005.com,www.patheos.com", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd88e\"", "article_summary": "It is why I can say without equivocation that caregivers of elderly parents with dementia need help.\nI am calling Christians to formulate means to help caregivers of people with dementia in the simple, human ways that they need help.\nThey need love.\nThe high wire act of dementia care is such that something as simple as a cold can cause everyone to fall off and into the net.\nI can tell you that as the dementia gets worse the caregiver begins to need love and support every bit as much as the person they are caring for."}
