We sometimes discount the importance of religion as the stabilizing force that allowed us to proceed in relative calm from the chaos of war to an enduring nation guided by faith and the rule of law.\n\nOne of the media\u2019s favorite questions to politicians is: \u201cDo you believe America is a Christian nation?\u201d Well, it is of course a historical fact that we were founded by a religious people, most of whom were Christians. But if one tries to expound on that point, even to acknowledge its historical significance, some immediately want to paint you as an intolerant believer in theocracy.\n\nThe media so often dumbs down the debate that the general public fails to appreciate how uniquely fortunate we were that our American Revolution was the exception to the rule played out repeatedly in world history \u2014 bloodshed, violence and enduring chaos.\n\nAmong revolutions, America\u2019s was extraordinary in that once we threw off the yoke of the King, we didn\u2019t also cast off our traditions. We kept our religious faith. We maintained a thousand year history of English common law. We considered our revolution to be a continuation and natural progression of the battle for individual rights that began at Runnymede in 1215.\n\nConsider, for example, how the American Revolution differed dramatically from the French Revolution.\n\nIn America, we fought to be free of the British King but we maintained our several hundred year tradition of limited governmental power and we kept our bedrock religious faith. We didn\u2019t forget or attempt to turn away from the quest for individual rights that began with the Magna Carta. We built upon its keystone. Our founders were not bashful in acknowledging God\u2019s Grace in our history.\n\nContrast that with the French Revolution, where the king and religion were to a degree inseparable and rejected simultaneously. As a result, violent chaos and destruction ensued.\n\nThe American Revolution was also extraordinary in that it gave birth to the first real meritocracy. Barbara Tuchman writes of how novel it was that the American Revolution opened up progress to people from all walks of life, not just the nobility.\n\nWhile it took awhile for the Republic to include everyone, the fact that it occurred and remains is, to my mind, nothing short of a miracle.\n\nSome modern critics worry though that we do not separate religion from government enough. They seek to not only divide faith from our government but also from the private sector businesses of our citizens. They argue that the Christian owners of Hobby Lobby should be forced by law to keep their faith out of their business.\n\nBut when the U.S. government decreed that Hobby Lobby would be forced to purchase insurance covering procedures its owners found morally objectionable, they responded, unbowed, in a way that speaks to the core of America\u2019s founding principles. Their lawyer wrote:\n\n\u201cObamacare asks us to abandon our faith to remain in business or abandon our business to remain true to our faith.\u201d\n\nIn a free country, such a question should be unthinkable. Such a question is inconsistent with liberty. Indeed, such a question is antithetical to the American tradition.\n\nModern day pundits act as if the separation of church and state means that our origins were based upon a purely secular state devoid of the influence of religion.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. To a person, all of our presidents have acknowledged the guiding influence of their faith.\n\nToday\u2019s critics sometimes imply that you can\u2019t have both faith and freedom. Some think you must choose between faith or freedom, or put a different way \u2014 liberty or virtue.\n\nI disagree.\n\nI believe that Liberty is absolutely essential to virtue, and vice versa. After all, it is the freedom to make individual choices that allows us to be virtuous.\n\nDon Devine gets to the heart of the matter in his book, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Way Back.\u201d He writes: \u201cFreedom needs tradition for law, order, inspiration. Tradition needs freedom to escape stagnation, coercion, and decline. The great achievement of the Constitution\u2019s framers was in providing a means for synthesizing freedom and tradition.\u201d\n\nGovernment can\u2019t impose virtue, we must impose it on ourselves.\n\nGovernment can\u2019t provide salvation, only the individual can choose to be saved.\n\nGovernment can supply bread, but it can\u2019t mend a broken spirit.\n\nTo paraphrase Os Guinness, \u201cLiberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is voluntary restraint.\u201d\n\nThis does not mean government cannot or should not reflect our values. In fact, it must. I believe that leaders guided by faith, leaders guided by virtue, are essential.\n\nMost of our presidents recognized this principle, especially President Washington. He recognized that freedom requires an undergirding of faith. Washington believed that democracy depended upon a virtuous people. His prayers and writings, and those of the other great presidents in our history contained in the pages of \u201cOur Presidents & Their Prayers: Proclamations of Faith by America\u2019s Leaders,\u201d reveal how integral our religious traditions were to our founding, and I believe, to our future as well.\n\n\u2022 Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, is a first-term U.S. Senator and a candidate for president of the United States. He is the author of the book, \u201cOur Presidents & Their Prayers: Proclamations of Faith by America\u2019s Leaders\u201d (2015).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans often take for granted that our country was born of a religious people.
