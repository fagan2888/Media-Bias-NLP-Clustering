Films starring Bradley Cooper, Johnny Depp, Chris Hemsworth and George Clooney are among the biggest film flops of 2015.

Rock the Kasbah starring Bill Murray is number one on the list by Forbes.

Mortdecai starring Johnny Depp and Aloha starring Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone also made the top ten.

Cyber crime thriller Blackhat starring Chris Hemsworth is in third place, while Clooney’s sci-fi family film Tomorrowland came in fourteenth place.

Rock the Kasbah sees Murray as a washed up music manager stranded in Afghanistan – it also starred Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson and Zooey Deschanel.

Forbes estimated it only made $2.87m (£1.9m) at the box-office but cost $15m (£9.95m) to make.
