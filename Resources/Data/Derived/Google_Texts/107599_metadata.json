(Photo: File/Hattiesburg American)\n\nHATTIESBURG - It\u2019s been little more than a year, and hundreds of people have been helped with getting prescriptions, dental care and health care at no cost, thanks to new services offered at Edwards Street Fellowship Center.\n\n\u201cHattiesburg is considered a hub for medical care in this area, but it was amazing people could not access the health care they needed,\u201d said Ann McCullen, Edwards Street executive director.\n\nIt started in fall 2014, when a diverse group got together to determine the need for free medical care in Forrest and Lamar counties, McCullen said.\n\n\u201cWe brought together business, faith, medical and education leaders in the greater Hattiesburg area to discuss if there was a need for free health care in this area,\u201d she said.\n\nThe group determined there was a population that could be served.\n\n\u201cThey make too much for Medicaid, but they can\u2019t afford the premiums, co-pays and deductibles of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to 2014 data from the Mississippi Department of Health, 21 percent of Hattiesburg-area residents do not have health insurance.\n\nFrom the conversations of that group, the Fellowship Health Clinic was born \u2014 in stages. Its mission was to use volunteer lay and professional resources to provide high-quality medical, dental and pharmaceutical care at no cost to eligible uninsured and underinsured adults of Forrest and Lamar counties.\n\nIn February 2015, Edwards Street entered into a partnership with St. Vincent De Paul Community Pharmacy in Biloxi to provide free prescriptions to eligible patients. Since then, it\u2019s provided more than 700 prescriptions at no cost. No medicines are kept on-site; instead, they are mailed to clients at their homes. There are no prescriptions issued for controlled substances.\n\n\u201cThe people we\u2019re seeing for pharmacy services are primarily the working poor,\u201d McCullen said. \u201cClients include an elderly man whose retirement income is insufficient to pay for his 10 daily medications.\u201d\n\nFree dental referral services began in April 2015. William Carey medical students talk with adult clients and conduct health history assessments. They refer clients who need tooth extractions to one of seven general dentists or three oral surgeons who pull the teeth for free. Clients can also be referred for free dental cleanings to Pearl River Community College-Forrest County dental students.\n\nSince the program kicked off, more than 270 people have been interviewed and assessed. Of those, 64 percent have been referred for further treatment.\n\nThe Fellowship Health Clinic finally opened Jan. 15, after a dedication service to unveil the newly remodeled space. The clinic is located in the former Grand Affairs Bakery at 1919 Edwards St., next door to the fellowship center. Edwards Street had been using the space for children\u2019s and community programs.\n\nNow, the small building has two exam rooms, a lab, consultation room, lobby and a nurse\u2019s office. Local artists, including Dollye Kirk and Cindy Fortenberry, have donated their work to decorate the space.\n\nIn January, the clinic was open for two half-days. Patients could see the doctor for general wellness exams and family medical care by appointment only. In February, the clinic offered appointments on one full day and one half-day. And in March, it has offered care on one full day and two half-days. Since its opening, 78 patients have been treated.\n\nMcCullen said one issue that has kept the clinic from being open more days per month is the expense of lab tests.\n\n\u201cSome of these people haven\u2019t seen a doctor in more than a decade,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s an average of four lab tests on every person.\u201d\n\nClinic Medical Director Stephen Baum, M.D., is a volunteer. He also works as medical director of Work Well and the Veterans Affairs Clinic at Merit Health Wesley.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very blessed to have this brand-new clinic,\u201d Baum said. \u201cWe\u2019re able to do what any primary care clinic is doing. We see patients, we diagnose, we test, we get their medications for them.\u201d\n\nBaum said the clinic\u2019s appointment book stays full.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of patients,\u201d he said. \u201cWe work with our medical students to see the patients. Some of these people haven\u2019t had medical care in years.\n\n\u201cSome have a need for further tests, so we call and request to get those tests donated.\u201d\n\nBaum said the ailments of the patients echo the ailments of the general Hattiesburg population.\n\n\u201cHigh blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, depression, arthritis,\u201d he said.\n\nThe clinic offers integrated health care provided by Baum, nursing students and faculty from Southern Miss\u2019 College of Nursing and School of Social Work, medical students from William Carey University, and additional medical and health professional volunteers. The only paid positions are the ones held by a part-time clinic director and a part-time social worker.\n\nIn addition to seeing a medical provider, every patient sees a social worker, who helps the patient comply with doctor\u2019s orders. The social worker can meet with the patient in between doctor visits.\n\nChristopher Oglesby, third-year William Carey medical student, started out doing the free dental screenings. Now, he feels a personal connection to the patients he sees at the clinic.\n\n\u201cI saw a lot of the same struggles faced by the clients here as my mom faced raising three boys by herself,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like I can empathize with the patients and I wanted to pursue (this) wholeheartedly.\u201d\n\nOglesby said his work at the clinic will help him when he gets his medical degree.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much more than medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get to explore all the socio-economic problems the patients go through.\n\n\u201cIt (will) make us better future physicians.\u201d\n\nMcCullen said it\u2019s not the goal of the clinic to take care of its patients for their lifetimes.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be someone\u2019s medical provider for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are the gateway provider. It may be they need help with us for a few months with their prescriptions so they can save up their money for more traditional care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to help people become healthier for the long term because that way they can help their families, get a better job and make Hattiesburg a better place to live.\u201d\n\nTo make an appointment:\n\n\u2022 First: attend a screening, 9-11 a.m., first and second Tuesdays of the month\n\n\u2022 Where: Food pantry lobby, Edwards Street Fellowship Center, 1919 Edwards St.\n\n\u2022 Who: Uninsured and under-insured adults, 18 and over\n\n\u2022 What to bring: Photo ID that shows proof of residency in Forrest or Lamar counties, all insurance cards, documentation of household income and expenses\n\n\u2022 What happens next: After being screened, eligible clients will be given an appointment at a future date\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.thec-l.com/1MMNcmE", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Hundreds of people are getting prescriptions, dental care and doctors\u2019 visits at no cost at Fellowship Health Clinic.", "og": {"site_name": "The Clarion Ledger", "description": "Hundreds of people are getting prescriptions, dental care and doctors\u2019 visits at no cost at Fellowship Health Clinic.", "title": "Hundreds gets free health care at Hattiesburg site", "url": "http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2016/03/28/hundreds-gets-free-health-care-hattiesburg-site/82329260/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/clarionledger.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hundreds of people are getting prescriptions, dental care and doctors\u2019 visits at no cost at Fellowship Health Clinic.", "title": "Hundreds gets free health care at Hattiesburg site", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f97b22e55915969b9bb9d847d4edee17bd117266/c=104-0-696-592&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/27/JacksonMS/JacksonMS/635947084792251803-clinic.jpg", "creator": "@clarionledger", "site": "@clarionledger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=815835309", "fb": {"app_id": 127619637301465}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "News, health care, free, Edwards Street Fellowship Center, Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Ellen Ciurczak"}, "article_summary": "It started in fall 2014, when a diverse group got together to determine the need for free medical care in Forrest and Lamar counties, McCullen said.\n\u201cWe brought together business, faith, medical and education leaders in the greater Hattiesburg area to discuss if there was a need for free health care in this area,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHattiesburg is considered a hub for medical care in this area, but it was amazing people could not access the health care they needed,\u201d said Ann McCullen, Edwards Street executive director.\nThe Fellowship Health Clinic finally opened Jan. 15, after a dedication service to unveil the newly remodeled space.\nFrom the conversations of that group, the Fellowship Health Clinic was born \u2014 in stages."}
