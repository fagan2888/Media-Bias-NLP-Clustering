He\u2019s cool, indie and funky, but people for some reason never pictured the fact that we could gel on a track the way we did.\u201d\n\n\n\nChromeo also collaborated with A$AP Ferg on the video for \"Jealous (I Ain't With It).\u201d Macklovitch explained how the group got the rapper to appear in the clip.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy brother A-Trak (Alain Macklovitch) runs Fool\u2019s Gold and Fool\u2019s Gold is actually the first to ever put on an A$AP Ferg show,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe minute his \u2018Kissin\u2019 Pink\u2019 verse came out on the first Rocky mixtape, my brother zeroed in on him and was like, \u2018We\u2019re going to book you at our first Christmas party.\u2019 Ferg has been a fan ever since. We like the idea that we\u2019re probably the only band right now that can get Soko and Ferg in the same video.\u201d\n\nBillboard's Bonnaroo 2014 Video", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "One of the goals Montreal electro-funk duo Chromeo had for its fourth album, \u201cWhite Women,\u201d was to reconnect with fans who enjoyed the group\u2019s earlier work.", "title": "Bonnaroo 2014: Chromeo Talks Reconnecting with Fans on \u2018White Women\u2019 Album & Choosing Collaborators (Video)", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6121422/bonnaroo-2014-chromeo-talks-reconnecting-with-fans-on-white", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/bonnaroo-2014-chromeo-david-macklovitch-billboard-650.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the goals Montreal electro-funk duo Chromeo had for its fourth album, \u201cWhite Women,\u201d was to reconnect with fans who enjoyed the group\u2019s earlier work.", "title": "Bonnaroo 2014: Chromeo Talks Reconnecting with Fans on \u2018White Women\u2019 Album & Choosing Collaborators (Video)", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6121422/bonnaroo-2014-chromeo-talks-reconnecting-with-fans-on-white", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/bonnaroo-2014-chromeo-david-macklovitch-billboard-650.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "One of the goals Montreal electro-funk duo Chromeo had for its fourth album, \u201cWhite Women,\u201d was to reconnect with fans who enjoyed the group\u2019s earlier work.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Bonnaroo 2014: Chromeo Talks Reconnecting with Fans on \u2018White Women\u2019 Album & Choosing Collaborators (Video)  | Billboard"}, "article_summary": "One of the goals Montreal electro-funk duo Chromeo had for its fourth album, \u201cWhite Women,\u201d was to reconnect with fans who enjoyed the group\u2019s earlier work.\nWe like the idea that we\u2019re probably the only band right now that can get Soko and Ferg in the same video.\u201dBillboard's Bonnaroo 2014 Video\n\u201cMy voice sits in a certain register and you\u2019ve got somebody like [Toro Y Moi] who sits in a whole other register.\nBonnaroo 2014 Full Coverage: Photos, Video & More\u201cWe wanted to reconnect with fans that discovered us in \u201906-\u201907 when our record \u2018Fancy Footwork\u2019 connected with a bigger audience,\u201d Chromeo singer/guitarist David Macklovitch, also known as Dave 1, tells Billboard at the 2014 Bonnaroo.\n\u201cMy brother A-Trak (Alain Macklovitch) runs Fool\u2019s Gold and Fool\u2019s Gold is actually the first to ever put on an A$AP Ferg show,\u201d he explains."}
