Rather, it\u2019s because Office Space tells a story driven by the very same technological challenges we\u2019re facing in healthcare today.\n\nAs you probably recall, Y2K was an issue of concern in the late 1990s due to legacy software code that was written using two-digit syntax for time-stamped events \u2014 for example, 99 instead of 1999. The problem, of course, was that this prevented the software from distinguishing the year 2000 from the year 1900\u2026or 1800\u2026or 2200. In hindsight, this seems like a \u201cduh\u201d moment to us \u2014 but it was no one person\u2019s error, and it wasn\u2019t even limited to software. Yes, computer scientists were already discussing the Y2K problem in the 80s (meaning the 1980s, of course), but the problem pre-dated computer systems and was present in non-digital worlds as well \u2014 for example, printed forms that only had space for a two-digit year format.\n\nThe main characters in the movie Office Space worked for a company call Initech, and their job was to update banking software and ensure that it was Y2K-compliant. Some banks and other types of businesses couldn\u2019t replace their legacy software without massive costs and disruption, yet the legacy software itself was poised to create disruption that might be even more severe.\n\nAnd that captures the true hallmark of Y2K \u2014 and of ICD-10. No one can say with any real certainty how much disruption the new code set will create. It\u2019s as though we have to prepare for a hurricane that might be Category 5 and might be little more than a brief thunderstorm. The crazy part is that we won\u2019t know which until it starts.\n\nSo, what do you do when no one knows what will happen?\n\nYou make sure you\u2019re prepared.\n\nAs with anything else, there are extremes to consider. To continue the Y2K analogy, you can be the person who had plenty of canned food on hand and had taken out some extra cash ahead of Jan. 1, 2000, in case ATMs temporarily stopped working.\n\nEither way, preparation is the key to a successful ICD-10 transition. The only \u201cwrong\u201d way to approach ICD-10 is not to take it seriously.\n\nSome people say it will be worse than 5010. Some say it won\u2019t be anything like 5010. In the ever-deepening stack of published opinions about the anticipated impact of ICD-10, there are a few that are no doubt correct. But everyone who says they know exactly which is correct is either lying or fooling themselves.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get ready. Here are four denials management best practices that will help ensure you are prepared for ICD-10:\n\nNo. 1: Analyze where it makes sense to segment workflow by specialization or expertise.\n\nThere\u2019s one thing that the recent announcement from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) changes, even if no other payers follow suit. For the first year following implementation, there will be a non-trivial subset of claims that won\u2019t be denied or audited, based solely on an unspecified ICD-10 diagnosis code, as long as the code is from the right \u201cfamily\u201d of ICD-10 codes.\n\nNow, think back on all of the articles you\u2019ve read over the past four years that cited coders and other healthcare professionals who retired or planned to retire because of ICD-10. In some cases the writers may have exaggerated the scale of this mass exodus, but they certainly weren\u2019t making it up.\n\nThe change announced by CMS means that these professionals, even if they haven\u2019t been fully trained on ICD-10, can choose to pick up contract or temporary work focused exclusively on Medicare claims. Already-expert denials-management specialists will have no trouble working on denied Medicare claims for the first year following implementation, because the denial won\u2019t be based on ICD-10-related specificity.\n\nProviders need to be prepared to leverage this. Reach out to your network now, so that if you need additional help managing a backlog you know exactly who to call and they know exactly what kind of help you\u2019ll need.\n\nNo. 2: Improve denials management processes that won\u2019t be impacted by ICD-10.\n\nNinety percent of denials are preventable, and 60 percent are recoverable \u2014 at least today. The best way to be prepared for an increase in your overall denial rate is to get it as low as possible before that increase occurs. It can\u2019t spike as high if it\u2019s lower to begin with.\n\nProviders need to uncover the root causes of denials \u2014 this will enable confident, efficient routing of denials into ICD-10-related and non-ICD-10-related work queues. Management can then more easily and accurately gauge the impact of ICD-10 on their denial rate and, more generally, their AR days and other key financial metrics.\n\nNo. 3: Identify the denials that have the greatest impact and that are most likely to be appealed successfully.\n\nEvery denial matters, but some matter more. In addition, some denials aren\u2019t worth appealing because there\u2019s such a low likelihood that the appeal will be successful.\n\nWhen staff work these likely-unrecoverable denials, there are zero plusses and two clear minuses. It\u2019s a waste of time, and the time wasted could have been spent working a denial that is recoverable. This leads to even more delayed and lost revenue; you\u2019re digging a hole even as you\u2019re working to fill it back up.\n\nNo. 4: Get a holistic view of your current denials processes \u2014 who does what and how long does each step take?\n\nThis is similar to understanding the root causes of denials, but the difference is that you need to identify the root causes of why it takes staff so long to work a denial. In all likelihood, it\u2019s because they spend the majority of the time compiling and sourcing the information they need to start working the denial.\n\nFinding the clinical documentation\u2026calling the payer\u2026logging into the payer\u2019s website\u2026finding and filling out the correct appeal materials. The list goes on. These are the kinds of things that make denial management so time-consuming for even highly efficient healthcare organizations \u2014 problems that aren\u2019t caused by ICD-10, and that won\u2019t get any better through ICD-10 training or ICD-10-focused preparations. Yet improving and streamlining the denials management process is the best way to prepare for what is perhaps the single greatest fear related to ICD-10: an increasingly unmanageable backlog of denied claims.\n\nSimply put, it\u2019s pretty simple:\n\nNo one knows exactly what is going to happen after Oct. 1, 2015. It\u2019s good to have a Plan B\u2026but it\u2019s better to have the right Plan A.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nCrystal Ewing is ZirMed\u2019s senior business analyst and manager of regulatory strategy.
