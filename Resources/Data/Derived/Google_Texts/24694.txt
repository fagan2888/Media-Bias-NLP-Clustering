FERNANDINA BEACH, Fla. - Fernandina Beach police said 17-year-old Zachery David Howard is charged with six counts of residential burglary, five counts of grand theft and three counts of vehicle burglary after a rash of incidents.

They also said in the last incident he had a partner, who has not been caught yet.

According to police, the two were spotted breaking into a home on South Fletcher Avenue just before 3 a.m. Saturday. Then they tried to break into a parked car before taking off. That was when an officer spotted them and gave chase westbound on Atlantic Boulevard at speeds of over 70 mph. Police said eventually the duo ran out of options and tried to get away on foot. That's when the officer caught up with Howard.

Later, Howard confessed to that robbery and also to helping rob five other homes the previous Saturday on South Fletcher Avenue. In those cases, the thieves ran off with more than $11,000 worth of flat-screen televisions, sound systems and other electronic devices. Police said the thieves also broke into at least two vehicles that night.

The second offender remains still at large, although detectives are actively working to make more arrests in this case.
