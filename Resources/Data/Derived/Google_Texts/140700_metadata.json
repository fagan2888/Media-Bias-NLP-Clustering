Most notably, the online payment function hasn\u2019t worked, so users have had to pay for insurance through the mail.\n\nBut that will now change after a site upgrade over the weekend that allows Vermont Health Connect users to pay monthly premiums online.\n\nLawrence Miller, Secretary for the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, has been working with the Department of Health Access to help get Vermont Health Connect back on track.\n\n\u201cAny Vermonter who is enrolling by March 15th for April 1st coverage will be able to pay online in the normal part of the process, and anybody who has been enrolled will be able to go online and pay their bill that way as well,\u201d Miller said.\n\nOver the weekend a few people enrolling for coverage used the online payment system before it was fully installed. On Monday, there will be training for state and call center workers who are helping people enroll for coverage.\n\nMiller said the upgrade also addressed a large number of issues on the back side of the website that mainly affected the navigators and call center workers, and other small improvements that the average Vermonter wouldn\u2019t notice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all driven toward system stability and improved functionality on the back end, really this payment processing is the only big change that Vermonters will see for themselves,\u201d Miller explained.\n\nLate last year, when the problems with the exchange website came to light, rules were changed to allow people to extend their existing coverage through the end of March. Those people will need to sign up for a plan through Vermont Health Connect by March 15th to avoid any potential lapse in coverage.\n\n\u201cAnd they need to pay by the end of March, which is one of the reasons that getting electronic payment up and running was so important for us,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMarch 31st is the end of the 2014 enrollment period for Vermont Health Connect, unless a person gets married, has a child, or loses insurance coverage. There is no open enrollment for Medicaid, so anyone who qualifies for that program can sign up at any point during the year.\n\nVermont mandated businesses with fewer than 50 employees to go through the exchange, and that differs from the federal requirement. Small businesses were allowed to circumvent the exchange this year and buy plans directly through Blue Cross or MVP. Miller said those businesses will continue to directly enroll through carriers as long as necessary.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be working on bringing small businesses up. But we want to be clear that those folks should continue to direct enroll. As we have with this system update, we\u2019re not going to bring it out until it\u2019s been fully tested, fully validated, and is truly ready for prime time,\u201d Miller said. He expects the small business functions will be ready for 2015 enrollment.\n\n\u201cWe need to continue to focus on system improvements, bringing on the rest of the features, and doing so in a way that Vermonters experience meaningful improvement, and that our call center staff, navigators and others who have to touch this system, including the carriers, get reliable predictable experiences, time after time. I think we\u2019ve had enough where we\u2019ve said what we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019re clearly in the mode we need to just show what we can do,\u201d Miller said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "Vermont Health Connect, the state\u2019s online health insurance exchange, opened last fall, but the site has not functioned as it should.
