If you are a small business owner, you know that offering health insurance helps you attract and keep good employees. As a small business owner in New York City, you also know how frustrating dealing with health insurance can be. Given all the changes, this is a mine field to figure out. As a result, while some small business owners have found secure coverage, many have opted out and offer no coverage for their employees, instead sending their employees to the individual market place.

What a lot of small businesses don’t know (but should) is that The Affordable Care Act also introduced the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP), also known as the Small Business Marketplace in New York. It was created specifically for small businesses with employer tax credits not offered through the individual exchange.

To help make it easier EmblemHealth launched a Health Care Reform Hub offering everything a small business owner needs to know about SHOP and offers a Tax Calculator to help business owners determine the tax credits that their business might be eligible for.
