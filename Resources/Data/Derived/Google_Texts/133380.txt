LeVar Burton has partnered with Jimmy Kimmel to create a 21st century parody of “Reading Rainbow”: “Tweeting Rainbow.” As you watch Burton inspire kids by thumbing through his Twitter feed, teaching them about hashtags, it’s hard not to shudder at how close this is to reality. After you watch this, go pick up a book –you’ll feel a lot better (but don’t pick up one of these!).
