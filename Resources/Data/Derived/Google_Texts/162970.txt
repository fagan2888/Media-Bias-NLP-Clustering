The family of a Wichita woman allegedly shot and killed by her husband is left with questions unanswered.

26-year-old Diana Washington died Wednesday evening from several gunshot wounds.

"The first thing that went through my mind was is this a sick joke," said Washington's cousin Rachel Nye. "But unfortunately it wasn't."

Nye and her family are still in shock days after finding out Washington was killed at OJ Watson Park.

"We really don't understand what has happened and we probably won't understand until we go to court," said Nye.

Police say the victim's husband, Pierre Washington, called 911 Wednesday night, saying he just shot his wife and that her body was in a van outside a friend's home.

Nye says the family was blindsided by the murder. The couple had been high school sweethearts and together for 10 years.

"Every time I saw him he was soft spoken and he was kind to our family and I know he was easy to talk to," said Nye.

Washington's family tells KAKE News they had no idea of any domestic violence issues between the couple that recently broke up.

"Sometimes those things are kept behind doors because people are ashamed or worried or other things could be happening, but right now we're worried about the girls," said Nye.

Nye says Washington will be remembered for being fun and bright -- and a loving mother of two young daughters who will now be without their mother and father.

"Her smile," said Nye. "She had the most beautiful smile."

While this family never saw the signs, Nye says those struggling with domestic violence need to speak up.

"Don't be afraid to turn to your family because your family is what's going to be there for you," she said.
