Rick Scott ran for governor in 2010, the GOP establishment supported former Attorney General Bill McCollum.\n\nSo when Scott, a former health care executive, spent nearly $40 million of his own wealth to beat McCollum in the Republican primary, fences needed to be mended between the rookie politician and the party he now led.\n\nEnter Adam Hollingsworth.\n\nAt the time of the 2010 primary, Hollingsworth was making $189,000 a year as chief of staff to then-Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton. He took a leave of absence, recruited by both the Republican Party of Florida chairman and Scott campaign manager Susie Wiles, to help fix the relationship between Scott and the party\u2019s elite.\n\nHollingsworth became one of Scott\u2019s most trusted advisers, a position he used to influence the administration\u2019s rejection of billions in federal high-speed rail money, then later lobby for a rail project that would benefit his employer, emails, text messages and administration documents obtained by the Scripps/Tribune Capital Bureau show.\n\nHollingsworth, through his office, declined to comment.\n\nAfter the November 2010 election, Hollingsworth was brought on to serve as a transportation adviser to Scott\u2019s transition team.\n\nHis role was not ceremonial. As adviser, Hollingsworth penned a draft letter informing federal administrators Florida was rejecting $2.4 billion in federal money for a high-speed rail line between Orlando and Tampa.\n\n\u201cPlease find attached a draft letter for the governor to send U.S. DOT Secretary Ray LaHood on high-speed rail,\u201d Hollingsworth wrote in a Feb. 13, 2011, email to a handful of Scott advisers.\n\nHollingsworth\u2019s letter included links to a study authored by the Libertarian-leaning Reason Foundation that found cost overruns could cost state taxpayers $3 billion, a number later cited by Scott.\n\nAfter the state rejected the federal money, Hollingsworth became an executive at Parallel Infrastructure, a company owned by Florida East Coast Industries. That company also owns All Aboard Florida, now pushing a Miami-to-Orlando rail project.\n\nJulie Edwards, All Aboard Florida\u2019s chief marketing officer, said Hollingsworth working to reject the federal money didn\u2019t help All Aboard Florida.\n\n\u201cIt is completely different market, a completely different way to think about transportation,\u201d she said of the different route proposals.\n\nBecause it\u2019s a \u201csmall transportation world,\u201d employment conversations between Hollingsworth and Parallel Infrastructure likely were occurring while he was advising Scott, Edwards said.\n\nShe said no one should \u201cinfer\u201d those conversations included talk about the project.\n\nAfter accepting a job with Parallel Infrastructure, Hollingsworth\u2019s rail advice to Scott changed.\n\nAlmost immediately, he started lobbying the administration to support his employer\u2019s new project, which now is being helped by millions in state taxpayer dollars and is expected to generate more than $170 million in revenue annually.\n\nHollingsworth\u2019s close ties to Scott didn\u2019t end when Hollingsworth went to work for the rail company. In May 2012, he became the Naples governor\u2019s chief of staff, a job he holds today.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nBack in 2010 in his advisory role to Scott, Hollingsworth helped assemble the state Department of Transportation that later signed off on the All Aboard Florida project.\n\nHollingsworth vetted candidates for transportation secretary \u2014 including current Secretary Ananth Prasad \u2014 helped shape policy decisions and received internal assessments of the department shortly after Scott was elected.\n\n\u201cWe will have our DRAFT agency review document to you no later than midnight tonight,\u201d wrote Doug Callaway, president of Floridians for Better Transportation, an industry trade group, in a December 2010 email to Hollingsworth and another adviser.\n\nThat was two weeks before Scott was sworn into office.\n\nThe Florida Transportation Commission proposes a slate of three secretary candidates for the governor to choose, a process that involved Hollingsworth.\n\n\u201cThe three-name slate, from the commission, goes to the governor on Monday,\u201d he wrote in a Feb. 12, 2011, email to other Scott advisers. \u201cFrom there, I would recommend that: we complete a vet on the three \u2026 by Tuesday.\u201d\n\nThe Scott administration now says Hollingsworth, 45, had \u201cno knowledge of AAF when he worked on transition or when the draft letter was sent.\u201d When taking the position as Scott\u2019s chief of staff, Hollingsworth signed a \u201cfire wall\u201d letter agreeing not to \u201cparticipate in any meetings or decision related to\u201d companies tied to his former employer.\n\nThe administration produced the letter after being asked by the Scripps/Tribune Capital Bureau if Hollingsworth had undue influence over the process.\n\nAll Aboard Florida had been around for roughly three years when Hollingsworth signed on as a Scott transportation adviser in 2010.\n\nThe company incorporated with the state in 2007 and almost immediately began signing various right of way agreements with Florida East Coast Railway, according to internal company documents obtained by the Scripps/Tribune Capital Bureau.\n\nHollingsworth spent his roughly one year with the company before becoming Scott\u2019s top staffer helping pave the way for All Aboard Florida. He set up meetings between top administration officials, including Scott, and company executives, and helped secure early support for the project in that office.\n\nAll Aboard Florida\u2019s 256-mile rail service has been touted from the beginning as a completely privately financed project that will not cost the state a dime, which is the reason Scott said he supports the plan.\n\nAt this point, though, the project is seeking $1.5 billion in federal loans that could be key to refinancing its existing debt, and more than $230 million in state dollars already have been set aside for projects that either will directly or indirectly benefit All Aboard Florida\u2019s rail line.\n\nThe biggest portion of that is $213 million for a \u201cmulti-modal\u201d terminal at the Orlando International Airport. The new structure will serve as All Aboard Florida\u2019s terminal in that city. Scott administration officials say the money went to the airport, not All Aboard Florida.\n\nIn addition, internal company bond documents obtained by Scripps/Tribune show the project may seek $44 million in direct state-funded grants for upgrades to tie into a Miami rail system. It\u2019s something that was \u201cnews to us,\u201d Prasad said in an interview.\n\nAll Aboard Florida has the financial backing of Fortress Investment Group, a New York-based equity firm with a $26 billion investment portfolio.\n\nThat company owns the handful of companies developing the project, including Florida East Coast Railway. Three of that company\u2019s top executives are also Fortress corporate officers, including Wes Edens, the firm\u2019s founder.\n\nAs a company employee, Hollingsworth helped connect top company executives with the Scott administration.\n\n\u201cIf you have time prior to 10 a.m., perhaps Husein and I could give you an advance look at the deck and provide a fulsome review of the proposal,\u201d read a Jan. 5, 2012, text message from Hollingsworth to Carrie O\u2019Rourke, then a top Scott administration official.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nIt\u2019s a reference to Husein Cumber, an executive vice president with All Aboard\u2019s parent company.\n\nThe same Jan. 5 message shows Edens, who co-founded Fortress in 1997, had met Scott administration officials at \u201cthe gov\u2019s Christmas Party.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2012, a day after that text message exchange, Scott was briefed by staff and appeared to support the plan.\n\n\u201cMeeting went very well today,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in a text message to Prasad. \u201cGov wants us to get together ... and put a team in this to overview. He is interested. :)\u201d\n\n\u201cGr8,\u201d Prasad shot back less than a minute later.\n\nThe day after the Scott briefing, Hollingsworth and Greg Turberville, a lobbyist with Tallahassee-based Ballard Partners, held a meeting with Scott\u2019s then-Chief of Staff Steve MacNamara, according to administration calendars. Turberville\u2019s firm represented All Aboard Florida-related companies.\n\nMacNamara said the duo asked for state dollars, but he only offered possible \u201chelp with eminent domain issues,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nThat support from Scott and his top transportation official, who Hollingsworth helped select, came three months before All Aboard Florida was officially unveiled \u2014 and more than two years before the Scott administration publicly supported the plan.\n\nAsked by Scripps-Tribune in June why he waited so long to show public support despite documents showing his administration was supportive much earlier, Scott responded that he asked federal officials for an extended period of time for the public to weigh in on the project.\n\nAlthough Scott remained publicly quiet for years, Hollingsworth kept Scott\u2019s administration in the loop.\n\nLeading up to the March 2012 announcement of the All Aboard Florida project, Hollingsworth helped Scott\u2019s staff prior to a March 14 meeting with Edens.\n\n\u201cAs you know, Wes Edens is meeting with the governor Wednesday, March 14,\u201d he wrote in a March 2 text message to O\u2019Rourke. \u201cDo you have time today to discuss a pre-brief with the gov.?\u201d\n\nIn the days leading up to the March 22, 2012, project announcement, text messages show, Hollingsworth also worked with Wiles, by then a Ballard Partner employee tasked with doing public relations for the project, write the press release and coordinate with the state.\n\n\u201cI am sitting here with Susie working on next week\u2019s announcement,\u201d Hollingsworth wrote in a March 15 email to O\u2019Rourke. \u201cIs it likely that the gov\u2019s comms staff would answer any press calls or would those get kicked to FDOT?\u201d\n\nLess than a week later, after months of administration involvement, All Aboard Florida was unveiled as a \u201cfirst-of-its kind\u201d project free of government help.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 05 Jul 2014 21:06:19 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 When Gov.
