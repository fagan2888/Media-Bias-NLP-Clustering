He was 78.\n\nGeorge, who retired as Chicago archbishop in the fall of 2014, a few months before announcing his treatment for kidney cancer had failed, died late Friday morning, according to the Archdiocese of Chicago.\n\n\u201cLet us heed his example and be a little more brave, a little more steadfast and a lot more loving,\u201d Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich said during a news conference, describing his predecessor as \u201ca man of great courage.\u201d\n\nAppointed to Chicago in 1997 by Pope John Paul II, the Chicago native became a leading figure of his era in many of the most important events in the American church.\n\nAt the height of the abuse crisis in 2002, George led a group of U.S. bishops who persuaded resistant Vatican officials to more quickly oust guilty priests \u2014 a policy at the core of reforms meant to restore trust in church leaders. He also oversaw the contentious new English-language translation of the Roman Missal, one of the biggest changes in Catholic worship in generations.\n\nAnd in his three years as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, George spearheaded opposition to the Affordable Care Act, arguing that President Barack Obama\u2019s health insurance law would allow taxpayer money to fund abortion. The Chicago archdiocese\u2019s charitable arm helped sue the Obama administration in 2012, over the requirement that employers provide health insurance covering contraception.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe the bishops have been more politically active in recent years, but it is true that our political activity is more adversarial,\u201d George told the Jesuit magazine America in October 2014.\n\nGeorge grew up in a working class neighborhood on Chicago\u2019s northwest side, and a five-month bout with polio at age 13 left him with a lifelong limp. He was initially rejected from a high-school seminary because he was disabled, but he went on to become an intellectual leader within the church.\n\nHe earned two doctorates, spoke Italian, Spanish, French and other languages, and wrote several books. A member of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, he eventually helped lead the religious order as vicar general based in Rome.\n\nIn 1990, he was appointed bishop of Yakima, Washington, then archbishop of Portland, Oregon, before being assigned to Chicago.\n\nGeorge\u2019s appointment to the Archdiocese of Chicago \u2014 the nation\u2019s third-largest with 2.2 million parishioners \u2014 underscored the shift under John Paul toward drawing a more definitive line about what could be considered truly Catholic.\n\nThe first Chicago native to become the city\u2019s archbishop, George succeeded Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, a beloved figure of national standing who advocated a \u201cseamless garment\u201d of life giving equal weight to social justice teachings and opposition to abortion.\n\nBy contrast, George prioritized upholding doctrine and preserving tradition, leading disgruntled priests to initially dub him \u201cFrancis the Corrector.\u201d George declared liberal Catholicism an \u201cexhausted project,\u201d arguing it failed to pass on \u201cthe faith in its integrity\u201d on marriage, the priesthood and other issues.\n\n\u201cIt no longer gives life,\u201d George wrote in 2004, in the Catholic magazine Commonweal. He said fighting abortion should be the primary concern of all Catholics.\n\nThe pendulum seemed to swing back in September 2014, when Pope Francis was elected and said the church should be less focused on divisive social issues and more on mercy. George said he struggled to understand the new pope\u2019s approach, calling the pontiff\u2019s messages \u201ca bit jumbled at times.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s confusing for a lot of people including myself at times. For someone who appreciates clarity, I would like to get a few things clear so I can cooperate,\u201d George told The Chicago Tribune in October 2014, two months before he stepped down.\n\nAs cardinal, George could be startlingly blunt.\n\nWhen a proposed route had the Chicago Gay Pride Parade passing a parish around Sunday Mass, George warned the procession could \u201cmorph into the Ku Klux Klan, demonstrating in the streets against Catholicism.\u201d He later apologized.\n\nSeparately, when addressing what he considered increasing hostility toward Christianity, he said: \u201cI expect to die in bed, my successor will die in prison and his successor will die a martyr in the public square.\u201d He later said he was describing a worst-case scenario and believed the church would survive despite travails.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt anybody,\u201d George told the Tribune. \u201cBut if you say, \u2018Unless you agree with me I\u2019ll be hurt,\u2019 well, that\u2019s not a just demand.\u201d\n\nDespite his leadership in confronting clergy sex abuse, George faced a 2006 crisis over his own actions when the Rev. Daniel McCormack, a local priest, was left in a parish for several months despite abuse allegations. McCormack eventually pleaded guilty to molesting five children.\n\nGeorge apologized for not acting sooner. Thousands of documents released toward the end of George\u2019s tenure as part of a lawsuit settlement revealed he went against his advisers in one case to delay removing an accused priest, and tried to win early release from a Wisconsin prison for a priest convicted of molesting a child, though George later reversed his stand to the parole board.\n\nFuneral services will be Thursday at Chicago\u2019s Holy Name Cathedral, following visitation and prayer vigils that start Tuesday, the archdiocese said. George will be buried at his family\u2019s plot in suburban Chicago.\n\n__\n\nRachel Zoll reported from New York.
