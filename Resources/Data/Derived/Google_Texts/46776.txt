Last Friday an unmanned rocket carrying a robotic spacecraft lifted off from Virginia's eastern shore.

Normally such launches don't get much media attention unless they're out of the ordinary or something goes wrong during liftoff or when the rocket takes flight.

But last Friday's late night launch is gaining attention for another reason.

As you can see in a still photograph, captured one of NASA's robotic cameras, the power of the lift-off sent both the rocket and a frog skyward.

According to NASA, the photo and frog are real, however NASA admits, the condition and whereabouts of the four legged amphibian isn't known.
