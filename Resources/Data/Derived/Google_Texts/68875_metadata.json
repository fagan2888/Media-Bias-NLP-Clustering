Deval Patrick at $328 million, but which Baker said could run higher.\n\nHe said he\u2019s opposed to cutting unrestricted state aid to cities and towns \u2014 something Patrick proposed. Baker is also reluctant to dip into Massachusetts\u2019 rainy day fund \u2014 noting the state\u2019s economy has recovered enough to trigger an automatic income tax rate cut from 5.2 percent to 5.15 percent starting Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cThere is some irony to this,\u201d Baker said Thursday. \u201cWe have a tax revenue base that\u2019s growing fast enough to support an automatic reduction in the income tax yet we have a spending problem.\n\n\u201cWhen people talk about the rainy day fund, it\u2019s usually supposed to be because revenues have fallen off the cliff, not the other way around,\u201d he added.\n\nBaker \u2014 who served in the administrations of former Republican Govs. William Weld and Paul Cellucci \u2014 said two other priorities during his first 100 days include putting together a team of advisers and managers and overhauling the state\u2019s regulatory code.\n\nOn Friday, Baker visited the White House along with other newly elected governors to meet with President Barack Obama. Baker has expressed concerns about the federal government taking too heavy an approach on health care, education and other issues.\n\nDuring the campaign, Baker said he\u2019d seek a waiver from the federal Affordable Care Act. On Thursday, he said he wants to make sure the state retains the \u201celbow room\u201d it needs to chart its own health care course.\n\n\u201cI worry a lot about having them dictated by people who don\u2019t know much of anything about how health care works on the ground here in Massachusetts,\u201d Baker told the AP.\n\nBaker said he\u2019s taking a wait-and-see approach to the relaunch of the state\u2019s health care website, which appears to be going smoother than the disastrous rollout last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to hold the balloons until we\u2019ve had a chance to get on the ground and kick the tires on this stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nOn education, Baker says he\u2019d support legislation to expand the cap on charter schools in the state\u2019s lowest-performing school districts. But he said that\u2019s only a piece of the larger education puzzle.\n\nHigher performing schools located in urban areas should be encouraged to share some of their best practices with underperforming schools in their districts, he said, and there needs to be a greater appreciation for the challenges associated with teaching in urban areas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really just a believer in schools that work for kids, especially in underperforming school districts,\u201d he said.\n\nBaker said he was frustrated by the botched rollout of the voter-approved medical marijuana program, and said his goal is to get \u201cas clean a process as we possibly can in place with professionally capable operators.\u201d\n\nHe would oppose fully legalizing marijuana in Massachusetts \u2014 a question activists are vowing to put on the 2016 state ballot, he said. While Massachusetts could benefit from the experience of other states like Colorado that have legalized pot, he said he remains concerned about the consequences of taking such a step.\n\n\u201cI think the addiction community will be a lot more aggressively involved in a straight-out legalization effort than they were in the previous conversations,\u201d Baker said.\n\nBaker also weighed-in on the recent protests over a grand jury\u2019s decision not to charge a white New York City police officer in the videotaped chokehold death of an unarmed black man.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing public officials need to understand is that we all serve at the pleasure of the communities that we\u2019re in,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain trust issue that\u2019s associated with that that we need to recognize and appreciate.\u201d\n\nHe expressed interest in the use of body cameras on police officers, assuming privacy concerns can be addressed.\n\n\u201cIf there are folks who are up for demonstrating the model, it\u2019s probably worth pursuing,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the interview, Baker also noted he\u2019s been critical of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission.\n\nAsked if had confidence in commission chair Stephen Crosby or would seek a change in leadership at the panel, Baker would only say that he expected to share some of his concerns about the process upon taking office.\n\nHe said questions surrounding the Wynn Resorts casino proposal in Everett, which was recently awarded the eastern Massachusetts resort casino license, must be resolved in the next several months. Developers must show they can clean up the polluted site where the casino would be built and solve potentially serious traffic issues in nearby Sullivan Square, he said.\n\nBaker won the governor\u2019s race in November, defeating Democrat Martha Coakley and three independent candidates. He will take the oath of office in early January, replacing Patrick, a two-term Democrat.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
