But several members said their support was tentative, that they wanted to see further debate and some tweaks.\n\nState Rep. Dwight Dudley, D-St. Petersburg, said he had \"trepidation and concern\" over the enormous impact the bill could have, for good or ill. He added, \"I reluctantly will vote for it because I think in fairness we should have nurse practitioners doing more.\"\n\nAll credited their faith in the hard work and good intentions of state Rep. Cary Pigman, R-Sebring, an emergency room doctor who has spent months researching and crafting the bill.\n\n\"What it really comes down to, Rep. Pigman, is I trust you,\" said state Rep. Ross Spano, R-Riverview.\n\nThe bill would change the title of what are usually called nurse practitioners -- registered nurses who have post-college education, usually at least a master's degree -- to Advance Practice Registered Nurses, or APRNs (which a few lawmakers pronounced \"Aprons\"). They would gain some modest new powers, such as the ability to sign documents that now require a physician's signature, and the opportunity to go for the title \"Independent Advance Practice Registered Nurse\" after a certain amount of training and experience. They would no longer have to contract with and pay a \"supervising\" physician.\n\nThe bill would grant independent status to three categories of APRNs: certified registered nurse anesthetists, called CRNAs; certified nurse midwives, and certified nurse practitioners, who usually work in primary care.\n\nThe main stated aim of the bill is to increase access to primary care, particularly in rural areas. But Pigman said it would also remove some barriers to practice that add costs and complexity to the health-care system, and would redress years of unfairness.\n\nNurse practitioners have been practicing safely and competently for many years, Pigman said, but always under the contractual \"supervision\" of physicians. The requirement is so loose, however, that Pigman said he could officially \"supervise\" a nurse practitioner in Okeechobee while he was at the podium in Tallahassee, 350 miles away. And he would be paid for that long-distance \"supervision,\" he said.\n\n\"Nothing in this bill takes away from teamwork; in fact, it's what we do all the time,\" he said. \"What I'm getting to is the mandate to supervise.\" Pigman offered this analogy: If he sees a patient with a complex heart problem in the emergency room, he'll ask for a consult from a cardiologist. But that doesn't mean the cardiologist is \"supervising\" him, Pigman said, and he wouldn't put up with such an arrangement.\n\n\"That gets to the heart of what we're talking about,\" he said.\n\nDuring the three-hour hearing Tuesday, typical political party alignments fell away, as did some professional ones.\n\nPigman is pushing it forward with unmistakable passion at the same time that some of his fellow physicians -- at least the ones in organized medicine -- oppose it fervently.\n\nThe two committee members voting against the bill opposed it for different reasons.\n\nState Rep. Gayle Harrell, R-Stuart, offered a couple of unfriendly amendments, including one that would move licensure and regulation of the newly-empowered APRNs to the purview of the Florida Board of Medicine, rather than the Board of Nursing.\n\n\u201cThe most appropriate place is for those individuals to come under the Board of Medicine because they (would be) indeed practicing medicine,\u201d she said. The amendment failed.\n\nState Rep. Elaine Schwartz, D-Hollywood, voted against the bill as a protest. If the intent of the bill is to improve patients\u2019 access to primary care, she said, then the best way to do that would be to vote for Medicaid expansion for the poor.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government would provide Florida an estimated $51 billion over a decade, for health coverage for almost 1 million low-income uninsured adults.\n\nLast year Gov. Rick Scott and the Florida Senate voted to accept the funds \u2013 provided it could be used to buy private coverage for the uninsured instead of funding the traditional Medicaid program \u2013 but the House said no. There has been little optimism that House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, will change his mind.\n\nSchwartz said she was voting no because \u201cI want Medicaid expansion!\u201d She knocked on the table as she said each word, to ensure that other members on the committee (and others watching it on The Florida Channel) paid attention.\n\nOne aspect of Pigman's bill \u2013 allowing APRNs to prescribe certain controlled drugs, which Florida law now prohibits \u2013 drew warnings from Harrell and a speaker from the Florida Medical Association, Dr. Joshua Lenchus, chief of the Jackson Health System medical staff in Miami.\n\nLenchus rattled off a fusillade of statistics at the committee about the prescription-drug horrors of the past decade, suggesting it was unwise to increase the number of caregivers who can prescribe controlled drugs.\n\nRep. Harrell agreed, noting there will be a constitutional amendment on the ballot in November to allow prescription of marijuana for certain medical conditions. \u201cIf you think we had a problem with pill mills,\" she said, \"wait until we have pot mills on every corner and 18,000 more prescribers out there.\u201d\n\nSeveral members of the committee chided FMA for \u201ctrying to scare the public,\u201d as Rep. Dudley put it. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a winning issue for doctors.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Matt Hudson, R-Naples, countered that the state\u2019s three-year-old Prescription Drug Database has been doing a good job controlling the illegal sales of narcotics and other drugs with street value.\n\n\u201cThe pill-mill problem was not created by nurse practitioners,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cIt was because we had physicians writing prescriptions and acting as legal drug dealers.\u201d\n\nSome opponents of the bill were still in medical school or in residency.\n\n\"Medicine should be practiced by licensed physicians,\" said John Dudley, a second-year medical student at Florida State University who already has $120,000 in college-loan debt. \"I'd choose not to become a physician if I could do the same things as a nurse,\u201d he said, referring to Independent APRNs.\n\nRep. Hudson said he detected notes of \u201cturf protection\u201d in the arguments from physician groups. But physicians testified that their concern is patient safety.\n\nInternist Michael Zimmer of St. Petersburg, speaking on behalf of the American College of Physicians' Florida chapter, said the nurse practitioners in his office \"have tremendous clinical knowledge,\" but have to consult him for help with complex cases.\n\n\"Our patients have an expectation that they have access to a physician-led team,\" Zimmer said.\n\nBut Elizabeth McCormack, a nurse practitioner from Pensacola, said she goes \"places where physicians don't go,\" including assisted-living facilities and patients' home.\n\nBoth Pigman and Hudson repeatedly reminded the committee that other states, as well as the military services and the Veterans Administration Health System, already allow nurse practitioners to prescribe controlled drugs. Some allow independent practice.\n\nIf there were resulting hazards from this, Pigman said, \"It would be in the headlines. It would be studied. It would be published. It would be on the television news.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not likely that the other states are wrong and Florida is right, Hudson said. \u201cCould it be that we\u2019re stuck in the mud?\u201d\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
