Associated Press\n\nAs the Justice Department investigates the police shooting death of an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Mo., they\u2019ll be a relying on a sweeping \u2014 but tricky to enforce \u2014 civil rights statute.\n\nWhen federal prosecutors investigate a local police officer for using excessive force or other alleged misconduct, they typically look to Section 242 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code called \u201cDeprivation of Rights Under Color of Law.\u201d\n\nThe law, which dates back to the Reconstruction era, makes it a federal crime for a person acting under \u201ccolor of\u2026law\u201d to willfully deprive someone of a constitutional right. Depending on the circumstances, convicted offenders can receive up to a life sentence or the death penalty.\n\nHistorically, prosecutors have found it a lot easier to bring charges alleging violations of the statute than to make them stick. Report WSJ\u2019s Devlin Barrett and Ben Kesling:\n\n[F]ederal prosecutors face significant legal limitations when it comes to charging police officers, because, unlike local district attorneys, they can\u2019t file charges based on reckless acts, only over violations of civil rights. In such cases federal prosecutors must show an officer took actions with the intent to violate a victim\u2019s civil rights. Proving such criminal intent\u2014as opposed to proving the officer acted with disregard for life\u2014is a much higher burden.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder for the federal government to bring a criminal charge in a case like this, where a police officer used force in the course of trying to carry out their duties and then the question is, did they go too far,\u201d Alan Vinegrad, a former federal prosecutor, told WSJ.\n\nFew cases result in conviction because of the \u201clack of resources and the evidentiary requirement where the accused officer\u2019s specific intent to violate a federally protected right must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d said a 2000 report on police practices and civil rights in America by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.\n\nThe challenge for federal prosecutors was recently underscored by the Justice Department\u2019s post-Katrina civil rights prosecutions of five New Orleans Police Department officers in connection with the shooting death and burning of a 31-year-old man outside a strip mall in September 2005 days after the city was flooded.\n\nThree of the officers were acquitted, including one in a retrial after a federal appeals court threw out the original conviction. Prosecutors dropped their charges against another officer. Ultimately only one of the officers went to prison, Gregory McRae, who was sentenced last week to 17 years in prison for obstructing a federal investigation and burning the body of the man, Henry Glover.\n\nIn the Ferguson case, police have said Darren Wilson, the officer under investigation, shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, after Mr. Brown pushed him into his patrol car, where the two struggled over Mr. Wilson\u2019s gun. A lawyer for the Brown family and a witness who has given a series of media interviews dispute the police account and say he was gunned down in cold blood.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "As the Justice Department investigates the police shooting death of an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Mo., they'll be a relying on a sweeping -- but tricky to enforce -- civil rights statute.", "title": "Federal Police Misconduct Probe of Ferguson Cop Faces Likely Hurdles", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/08/19/federal-police-misconduct-probe-of-ferguson-cop-faces-likely-hurdles/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ED728_0818au_G_20140818121409.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Federal Police Misconduct Probe of Ferguson Cop Faces Likely Hurdles", "description": "As the Justice Department investigates the police shooting death of an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Mo., they'll be a relying on a sweeping -- but tricky to enforce -- civil rights statute.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Jacob Gershman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Law Blog Blog", "page.subsection": "Law Blog", "article.summary": "As the Justice Department investigates the police shooting death of an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Mo., they'll be a relying on a sweeping -- but tricky to enforce -- civil rights statute.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-08-19T19:23:17-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/08/19/federal-police-misconduct-probe-of-ferguson-cop-faces-likely-hurdles/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-LB-48916", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "As the Justice Department investigates the police shooting death of an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Mo., they'll be a relying on a sweeping -- but tricky to enforce -- civil rights statute.", "title": "Federal Police Misconduct Probe of Ferguson Cop Faces Likely Hurdles", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/08/19/federal-police-misconduct-probe-of-ferguson-cop-faces-likely-hurdles/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ED728_0818au_G_20140818121409.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Law Blog", "article.id": "BL-LB-48916", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-11-10T17:30:12-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a79\"", "article_summary": "In such cases federal prosecutors must show an officer took actions with the intent to violate a victim\u2019s civil rights.\nAssociated PressAs the Justice Department investigates the police shooting death of an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Mo., they\u2019ll be a relying on a sweeping \u2014 but tricky to enforce \u2014 civil rights statute.\nHistorically, prosecutors have found it a lot easier to bring charges alleging violations of the statute than to make them stick.\nThree of the officers were acquitted, including one in a retrial after a federal appeals court threw out the original conviction.\nDepending on the circumstances, convicted offenders can receive up to a life sentence or the death penalty."}
