Now, Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) is ready to take it one step further. Murray has introduced a bill called the Affordability Is Access Act that has the potential to completely revolutionize the way that women access contraception.\n\nBrought to the floor on Tuesday afternoon, Murry\u2019s legislation proposes making oral birth control available on an over-the-counter, non-prescriptive basis, and with absolute coverage through government and private insurance.\n\nRight now, women who want to obtain birth control pills need to make an appointment with a doctor to get a prescription for the medication. Then, they need to make a separate trip to the pharmacy to fill that prescription. The system has been criticized for being outdated and burdensome. The majority of other countries around the world already offer birth control pills over the counter.\n\n\u201cI believe strongly that women should be able to get the comprehensive health care they need, when they need it \u2014 without being charged extra, without asking permission, and without politicians interfering,\u201d said Murray in a press release released on Tuesday.\n\nWhen proposing the bill, Murray and supporters pointed out that the pill is equally safe, if not more so, than many other medications currently available on a prescription-free basis. Murray also emphasized that the FDA will be a key player in this shift, allowing for significant health and quality control oversight.\n\n\u201cWe know that over-the-counter birth control is safe,\u201d Dr. Nancy Stanwood, the board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health, said a press release applauding Murray for introducing the Affordability Is Access Act.\n\nThe push for OTC birth control has gained significant support from Republicans over the last year. Murray\u2019s bill follows last month\u2019s proposal from Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) to make oral birth control prescription-free and available through a pharmacy.\n\nHowever, Gardner\u2019s bill received some criticism for failing to mandate full insurance coverage for over the counter (OTC) birth control. Without an insurance guarantee, Democratic lawmakers and reproductive rights advocates worry that OTC birth control would actually be less affordable for the 47 million women who are able to access the pill cost-free under the Affordable Care Act. Murray and other reproductive rights advocates \u2014 including bill cosignatories Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) \u2014 see that as a step backwards for contraceptive availability.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like offering someone a single shoe,\u201d Murray said in reference to proposals to expand access to OTC birth control without ensuring insurance coverage. \u201cYou need a pair.\u201d\n\nIn general, Democrats and reproductive rights supporters have voiced skepticism over this fairly sudden shift in Republican contraceptive ideology. Health professionals and advocates have warned GOP politicians against endorsing the shift to over-the-counter pills as a sudden fix for birth control availability. Many advocates recommend further support for Obamacare and Medicaid, considering the key role they currently play in contraceptive availability, in tandem with backing OTC contraception.\n\n\u201cIf Cory Gardner and others were serious about expanding access to birth control, they wouldn\u2019t be trying to repeal the no-copay birth control benefit, reduce Title X funding for birth control, or cut women off from Planned Parenthood\u2019s preventive health services,\u201d said Dawn Laguens, the Executive Vice President for Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a press release last year.\n\nIn 2010, publicly funded family planning services including federally funded birth control programs helped women avoid 2.2 million unplanned pregnancies, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Match this information with the fact that 11.4 percent of women have identified an accessibility issue, such as scheduling or transportation, as preventing them from seeking timely reproductive health care, and it becomes clear why health advocates in both parties have rallied behind the OTC birth control movement.\n\n\u201cIn a nation where nearly half of all pregnancies are unplanned, far too many American women are facing an uphill battle in trying to control their fertility and plan their families,\u201d Nancy Northup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement this week. \u201cSenator Murray\u2019s bill is a common sense solution that would jumpstart the conversation around dramatically broadening over-the-counter access to contraceptives for all women, regardless of age or income.\u201d\n\nKatelyn Harrop is an intern with ThinkProgress under the Center for American Progress Action Fund.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Sen.
