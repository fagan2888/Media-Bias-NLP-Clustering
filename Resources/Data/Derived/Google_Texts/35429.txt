The so-called “GOP hottie” who caught the eye of countless viewers at Wednesday’s Republican presidential debate says he might have a future in politics.

Gregory Caruso, who sat behind CNN debate moderator Jake Tapper during the GOP showdown and inspired the #GOPhottie hashtag on Twitter, was asked by TMZ.com in a video posted Friday if he would pursue a political profession.

“I could see that down the road later in life,” Caruso replied, before adding, “but as of now I’m focused on my film career.”

The 24-year-old film director says while he can’t see himself strutting the catwalk as a model, he may “possibly” pursue acting.

Caruso also weighed in on which politician he considered the biggest looker: “I think [former President Reagan’s] the most handsome politician. Maybe the most handsome actor.”

For now, Caruso says he’s basking in the unexpected attention his presence at the debate received, exclaiming he’s “enjoying the ride.”
