(AP) - Hunter Knighton\u2019s first play didn\u2019t officially count, nor did Corn Elder\u2019s first touchdown.\n\nThey mattered plenty to Miami.\n\nBrad Kaaya passed for 173 yards and two touchdowns in less than three quarters, Elder took a punt return 72 yards for a score after having another nullified by an unusual call and Miami beat Bethune-Cookman 45-0 in a lightning-delayed game on Saturday night. It was Miami\u2019s first shutout under coach Al Golden; the Hurricanes\u2019 last was a 45-0 win over Florida A&M; on Sept. 2, 2010.\n\nBut the biggest victory of all might have been Knighton getting on the field. The reserve offensive lineman suffered a life-threatening heatstroke on Feb. 24, 2014, spent 12 days in a coma and lost 55 pounds, and made his long-awaited debut after many surmised he would never get the chance to play for Miami.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the final piece to his healing and to our healing,\u201d Carole Knighton, the lineman\u2019s mother, told The Associated Press just after the play while surrounded by friends, family and even some of the medical personnel who worked with her son after the heatstroke. \u201cIt is God-given, Hunter-driven and it is a miracle. He was saved for a reason.\u201d\n\nKnighton\u2019s first play came on a field goal try that was washed away by a penalty in the first quarter, as his mother sobbed tears of joy. He started getting regular offensive line snaps in the third quarter, when the Hurricanes were substituting liberally.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d said Knighton, who acknowledged having some pregame butterflies - especially since he hadn\u2019t played a game since 2012, after being redshirted as a freshman. \u201cIt\u2019s weird; I kind of forgot how that felt, being able to run around and play football again. \u2026 I\u2019m back and that\u2019s where I want to be.\u201d\n\nMiami won its ninth consecutive home opener, but didn\u2019t escape unscathed and lost two wide receivers in the first quarter. Braxton Berrios left with a knee injury that had the Hurricanes concerned, and Stacy Coley departed with an ankle injury. There was no immediate word on the severity of either injury and Berrios was taken to a hospital for further examination.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Golden said.\n\nTrue freshman Mark Walton had 85 yards on 10 carries and scored in his Miami debut. Joe Yearby and Trayone Gray added touchdown runs and Kaaya connected with Standish Dobard and Rashawn Scott for touchdown passes. Scott had 100 receiving yards on six catches.\n\nBethune-Cookman was held to 79 yards of offense, the fourth time since 1996 that Miami held an opponent under 100 yards. Miami had 379 yards.\n\n\u201cI think the first positive we take from this game is we that we did not quit,\u201d Bethune-Cookman coach Terry Sims said after his debut leading the Wildcats. \u201cWe kept playing. We did not care about the score, we kept playing hard and I love these guys for that.\u201d\n\nElder returned two punts for scores in the second quarter. Only one counted.\n\nHe had a punt return for a score erased early in the quarter after officials determined another Miami player waved his arms to indicate to the Wildcats there would be no play on the ball and it therefore could not be advanced. The game was then delayed more than an hour by lightning and the second half was shortened to 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt felt great,\u201d Elder said. \u201cYou always want to start off the season right.\u201d\n\nRayshawn Jenkins - who lost his entire 2014 season due to injury - and Artie Burns had interceptions for Miami, which makes the 45-mile trek north and visits Florida Atlantic (0-1) on Friday night.\n\n\u201cWas it perfect? No, it wasn\u2019t perfect,\u201d Golden said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to learn a lot as a team.\u201d\n\n___\n\nKnighton\u2019s mother reaction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-9J7W6dzsQ&feature;=youtu.be\n\nwww.collegefootball.ap.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hunter Knighton's first play didn't officially count, nor did Corn Elder's first touchdown.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hunter Knighton\u2019s first play didn\u2019t officially count, nor did Corn Elder\u2019s first touchdown.", "title": "Knighton makes debut, Miami rolls past Bethune 45-0", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/5/knighton-makes-debut-miami-rolls-past-bethune-45-0/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/f4f367e612bf3128810f6a706700038a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/f4f367e612bf3128810f6a706700038a.jpg", "description": "Hunter Knighton's first play didn't officially count, nor did Corn Elder's first touchdown.", "card": "summary", "title": "Knighton makes debut, Miami rolls past Bethune 45-0"}, "Author": "TIM REYNOLDS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Bethune-Cookman was held to 79 yards of offense, the fourth time since 1996 that Miami held an opponent under 100 yards.\nTrue freshman Mark Walton had 85 yards on 10 carries and scored in his Miami debut.\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla.
