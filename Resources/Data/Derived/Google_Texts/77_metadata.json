That number would be expected to be much closer to 100 percent, Rose says.\n\nThere are also signs that organizations could do more to prepare for the changes that are coming, according to the survey. Just 57 percent of respondents believe their organizations are being proactive in adapting to the changing environment, while only 47 percent believe their recruitment methods are effective.\n\nThere\u2019s a disconnect in that CEOs often say they recognize that talent management is important, but the application of resources to develop talent may lag, Rose says. \u201cThey\u2019re not investing in the technologies, talent or processes\u201d that are going to attract the best candidates, she says.\n\nIn particular, creating a brand that\u2019s attractive to both patients and employees is a challenge for the field, which tends to neglect the employee part of the equation. \u201cHealth care could be moving faster on that front,\u201d Rose says.\n\nThe survey results should draw attention given the role HR professional play. \u201cHealth care HR people are frequently the eyes and ears of the organization,\u2019 Rose says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Staffing may create a stumbling block for health care executives as the field attempts to transform how care is delivered, according to a survey of health care human resource executives.", "csrf-token": "jbgI3KrVMS4QEnuI8+FbcihzfGDwmYI0C/CLJ4hSnNM=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/Nurse4_190x127.jpg?1448315761", "description": "Staffing may create a stumbling block for health care executives as the field attempts to transform how care is delivered, according to a survey of health care human resource executives.", "card": "summary", "title": "The Role of Staff in Health Care's Transformation Needs More Attention"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/Nurse4_190x127.jpg?1448315761", "type": "Article", "description": "Staffing may create a stumbling block for health care executives as the field attempts to transform how care is delivered, according to a survey of health care human resource executives.", "title": "The Role of Staff in Health Care's Transformation Needs More Attention"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "executives,health,health care human resource,healthcare reform,staffing,talent,transformation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHealth care HR people are frequently the eyes and ears of the organization,\u2019 Rose says.\nStaffing may create a stumbling block for health care executives as the field attempts to transform how care is delivered, according to a survey of health care human resource executives.\n\u201cHealth care could be moving faster on that front,\u201d Rose says.\nThe survey results should draw attention given the role HR professional play.\nLess than one-fifth of health care HR executives indicated that from their perspective, health care workers always are demonstrating a commitment to patient satisfaction, according to the survey, which was conducted by the American Society for Human Resource Administration and the company HealthcareSource."}
