The tables are turning.\n\nRepublicans announced a plan on Wednesday, just two weeks before the Supreme Court will hear a new, major challenge to the health law. If the president loses in court, he will have to deal with this GOP blueprint, not dismiss it.\n\nThe plan kills the major features of the Affordable Care Act, including mandates on individuals and employers, numerous taxes and the IPAB rationing board.\n\nIn their place, it offers tax credits for low-income citizens, more consumer choice, regulatory relief for employers and medical-malpractice reform to drive costs down.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s pie in the sky. Obama would veto it tomorrow.\n\nBut in a crisis, \u201cthe politically impossible becomes politically inevitable,\u201d noted economist Milton Friedman. Whatever idea\u2019s ready to go becomes the course of action.\n\nOn March 4, the Supreme Court will hear a challenge to ObamaCare subsidies offered in 36 states where consumers use HealthCare.gov. The court will announce its ruling in June \u2014 and could give us Friedman\u2019s crisis.\n\nThe letter of the Affordable Care Act permits subsidies only in the 14 states that set up their own exchanges, not in the other 36.\n\nIf the president loses, 6.5 million people in those 36 states would have to pay the true cost of their \u201caffordable\u201d plans, in some cases quadruple. Only the sickest would keep paying, putting ObamaCare in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d with premiums soaring and enrollment crashing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell refused to say if the administration has a backup plan should the justices rule against it.\n\nThe same day, Republicans announced they do. Their \u201cblueprint\u201d \u2014 not yet a bill \u2014 is sponsored by powerhouse GOP Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Richard Burr of North Carolina and Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan.\n\nOther Republicans have ideas, but this blueprint has political heft and momentum.\n\nThe plan adopts some popular ObamaCare features: covering kids on parents\u2019 plans \u2019til age 26, outlawing lifetime limits, guaranteeing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions in almost all circumstances and subsidizing coverage via tax credits for citizens earning up to $35,000 a year and families up to about $58,000. That takes care of most who now qualify for ObamaCare subsidies.\n\nBut where ObamaCare dictates, the blueprint allows choices.\n\nObamaCare forces you to have a one-size-fits-all \u201cWashington knows best\u201d benefit package. It\u2019s like a law that the only car you can buy is a fully loaded sedan: no hatchbacks, no convertibles.\n\nThe Republican blueprint lets you decide whether to buy insurance and what kind \u2014 everything from a high deductible to a low-cost \u201cmini-med.\u201d\n\nObama didn\u2019t invent mandates. New York lawmakers piled them on for years, forcing consumers here to pay exorbitant premiums. The blueprint removes federal barriers to people buying or selling plans across state lines \u2014 a huge win for New Yorkers.\n\nEmployers would have more choices, too. ObamaCare forces them to provide expensive, mandated benefits.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office warns this will prompt many to stop offering insurance, hurting 9 million to 10 million people. Only Washington, DC, could design an \u201cemployer mandate\u201d that makes you lose your coverage at work.\n\nEnding the mandate on employers with 50 or more full-time workers also halts the incentive to trim the workforce to below 50 or shift workers to part-time.\n\nThe GOP blueprint allows you to deduct the cost of your coverage up to $12,000 for individuals and $30,000 for families. People with generous on-the-job plans may have to pay tax on part of their coverage for the first time.\n\nEven so, it\u2019s better than ObamaCare\u2019s 40 percent Cadillac tax on generous health benefits, scheduled to hit in 2018 and already roiling labor negotiations.\n\nThe plan funds Medicaid with block grants so states have flexibility to improve their programs.\n\nAnd in every state, anyone eligible for Medicaid can apply the cash value of their benefit toward private coverage instead. Like a school voucher. As Friedman said, \u201cfree to choose.\u201d\n\nObamaCare supporters shriek that millions will lose coverage if the court rules against the administration. In truth, more people will be harmed \u2014 including those 9 million to 10 million at risk of losing employer-provided coverage \u2014 if the law drags on as is.\n\nAnd the GOP alternative \u201cblueprint\u201d shows that the party in charge of Congress is preparing better options and will not leave those now covered by ObamaCare to fend for themselves.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "For five years, President Obama has ridiculed Republicans for not having \u201ca meaningful alternative\u201d to ObamaCare.
