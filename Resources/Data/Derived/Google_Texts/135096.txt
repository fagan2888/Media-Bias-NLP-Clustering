5-lawyer tech, media and telecom group exits Dow Lohnes for Sutherland Asbill

A five-lawyer group with a tech, media and telecommunications focus has leapt from Dow Lohnes to the Washington, D.C., office of Sutherland Asbill & Brennan.

It includes partners William “Bill” S. Dudzinsky Jr., Michael A. Hepburn and Paul R. Lang; counsel Meredith O’Leary; and senior attorney Andrea Gehman, their new firm announced this week in a press release.

“Sutherland has long advised leading cable and telecommunications companies on their tax and benefits matters, and these lawyers enhance our tax and benefits services while expanding our range of industry service across all facets of transactional work, employment law and litigation,” said W. Mark Smith, who heads the Sutherland employee benefits and executive compensation practice group. “It’s a meaningful expansion of service into an important and rapidly evolving sector.”

With other recent attorney additions to the firm, its tech, media and telecommunications practice group now has some 50 attorneys, managing partner Mark D. Wasserman notes in the release.

Four lawyers from the Atlanta office of Dow Lohnes also recently joined Sutherland Asbill, as a Daily Report article last month detailed.

They are Matt Block, a corporate practitioner, and litigator Jason McCarter, both partners; corporate associate J.D. Shipman; and litigation attorney Stephanie Philips.

A decision by a major Dow Lohnes client, Cox Enterprises, to spread its work among more law firms prompted that move, the Daily Report says.

“We’re helping a number of folks transition their practices elsewhere,” Peter Canfield of Dow Lohnes told the publication. “Matt and Jason and J.D. and Stephanie are all great lawyers. We’re glad they’re at Sutherland, and we wish them the best.”
