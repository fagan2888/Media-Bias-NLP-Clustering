What worries the public is a perceived potential for government intrusion, not specific evidence of federal excesses under the guise of counterterrorism, he said.\n\nThe surveillance program, disclosed by exiled former contractor Edward Snowden and major U.S. and British newspapers, \u201ccould be redesigned in ways that give you the same information when you need it without creating these potentials for abuse, and that's exactly what we should be doing . . . evaluate all these things in a very clear, specific way and moving forward on changes,\u201d Obama said.\n\n-- Obama steered clear of speculating about Snowden\u2019s legal fate, noting that the handling of felony charges against the leaker was a matter for the Justice Department and the courts, should Snowden\u2019s temporary asylum in Russia end. Asked if amnesty was an option, the president sidestepped the question. Obama said that although the public discussion of spy programs was \u201cneeded,\u201d he lamented the intelligence and diplomatic harm he blamed on Snowden\u2019s revelations.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is an important conversation that we needed to have,\u201d the president conceded. \u201cThe way in which these disclosures happened have been damaging to the United States and damaging to our intelligence capabilities. And I think that there was a way for us to have this conversation without that damage.\u201d\n\nBut changes in the way NSA gets to the data it gathers may result, Obama said, adding he would explain his decisions in January. \u201cIt is clear that whatever benefits the configuration of this particular program may have may be outweighed by the concerns that people have on its potential abuse,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd if that's the case, there may be another way of skinning the cat.\u201d\n\n-- On another front, the president said the management and rollout of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance exchanges amounted to the \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d of his bumpy year. \u201cObviously, we screwed it up,\u201d he said. But he defended the law and the rescue operation under way since October\u2019s rollout, disclosing that more than 1 million people selected coverage through federal and state exchanges that should take effect Jan. 1.\n\nIn 2014, the president said he will order unspecified changes to address problems he believes contributed to the fumbled implementation of his signature legislative achievement. Whether those changes will include firings or administrative overhauls -- tied to federal procurement of information technology, or lines of supervision, for example -- remained unclear. Obama and his aides have resisted firing any manager in charge of the ACA portfolio, and publicly defended Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n\n\u201cI'm going to be making appropriate adjustments once we get through this year and we've gotten through the initial surge of people who have been signing up,\u201d Obama said.\n\n-- He predicted Republicans in Congress would forgo the temptation to revisit brinksmanship over the nation\u2019s borrowing authority, which will hit a statutory cap some time next spring. If the GOP tries to exact concessions, he said, he will not negotiate. Though the 16-day government shutdown in the fall was debilitating for all concerned, Obama suggested it was so unpopular with the American public, it might have served a useful political purpose for 2014 and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere have been times where I've thought: Were there other ways that I could have prevented those three, four weeks that hampered the economy and hurt individuals, families who were not getting a paycheck during that time? Absolutely,\u201d he said in the White House briefing room.\n\n\u201cBut I also think that in some ways, given the pattern that we have been going through with House Republicans for a while, we might have needed just a little bit of a bracing sort of recognition that this is not what the American people think is acceptable.\u201d\n\nObama, mustering his optimism, said he wants 2014 to be \u201ca year of action,\u201d yet the policy proposals he discussed were holdovers, suggesting his Jan. 28 State of the Union address will sound familiar, albeit against a rosier backdrop of economic recovery.\n\nImmigration reform; energy savings; wired classrooms and infrastructure spending; a higher minimum wage; and extension of unemployment insurance for those who will exhaust benefits at the end of December were among the policies Obama mentioned Friday.\n\nHaving previously announced the pending arrival of counselor John Podesta and health care overseer Phil Schiliro next year in the West Wing, accompanied by a few staff shuffles and resignations, the president said more turnover is ahead.\n\n\u201cPeople get tired; people get worn out. Sometimes, you need fresh legs.\u201d\n\nHeading into his sixth year and dogged by critics and low poll numbers, Obama might just as well have been speaking about himself.\n\n\u201cThe end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see, what can you do better next year?\u201d he said. \u201cThat's how I intend to approach it. I am sure that I will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "What did we learn from President Obama\u2019s Friday news conference, the 99th of his presidency, besides the fact that he was really, really looking forward to his family\u2019s vacation in...", "title": "Obama Admits Mistakes But Remains Uncowed | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/12/21/obama_admits_mistakes_but_remains_uncowed_121031.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/221187_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "What did we learn from President Obama\u2019s Friday news conference, the 99th of his presidency, besides the fact that he was really, really looking forward to his family\u2019s vacation in...", "title": "Obama Admits Mistakes But Remains Uncowed | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TomBevanRCP", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Obama Admits Mistakes But Remains Uncowed | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "National Security Agency,Obamacare,Barack Obama,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "evaluate all these things in a very clear, specific way and moving forward on changes,\u201d Obama said.\nObama said that although the public discussion of spy programs was \u201cneeded,\u201d he lamented the intelligence and diplomatic harm he blamed on Snowden\u2019s revelations.\nSometimes, you need fresh legs.\u201dHeading into his sixth year and dogged by critics and low poll numbers, Obama might just as well have been speaking about himself.\nObama and his aides have resisted firing any manager in charge of the ACA portfolio, and publicly defended Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n\u201cThe way in which these disclosures happened have been damaging to the United States and damaging to our intelligence capabilities."}
