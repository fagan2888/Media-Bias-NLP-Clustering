Neal Dunn says his campaign is hitting the North Florida airwaves, the first 2nd Congressional District candidate to so.

The Panama City urological surgeon and GOP nomination-seeker touts his experience away from politics in the commercial and criticizes those within it in a 30-second spot entitled “Outsider.”

“Like you, I’m tired of the broken system in Washington – rising health care costs, growing debt, and more waste,” says Dunn in the ad, which features a carousel of photos of the candidate in his various uniforms from U.S. Army soldier to physician, to husband and father.

“I’ll fight to repeal Obamacare, stop the spending and cut waste,” Dunn intones.

Former Gov. Rick Scott administration lawyer Mary Thomas – who is challenging Dunn for the GOP nomination in CD 2, where the election will almost certainly be decided in the primary – said in a debate last month Dunn originally supported some aspects of the federal Affordable Care Act before coming out against it.

“You served as a registered lobbyist, and these are the documented facts. You advocated for Obamacare in Florida, and you said you did not support Obamacare’s immediate repeal,” inveighed Thomas in a Republican Veterans of Florida-sponsored forum.

Dunn responded that Thomas’ charges misrepresent his work with the Florida Medical Association, and added a barb of his own.

“I think it’s unfortunate that one of us, Ms. Thomas, has chosen to focus her campaign on a smear campaign of false and misleading attacks … that frankly fill the living rooms with venom,” said Dunn.

“At the end of the day we need solutions, not just positions,” said Dunn in his closing remarks, a thinly veiled dig at Thomas. “I’m not going up [to Congress] the make a grandstand. I want to work toward solutions.”
