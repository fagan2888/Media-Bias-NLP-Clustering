Senior Day.\n\nEmotions are running high as Virginia Tech gets ready to host North Carolina in the Hokies\u2019 final home game of the season.\n\nThe contest will not only be the last at Lane Stadium for 26 players, but will be the last time Beamer runs out onto the field for a home game as the coach at his alma mater. Beamer has 278 career victories, the most among active Division I coaches and the sixth-most in history. He announced earlier this year that he is retiring after what will be his 29th season.\n\nThe Hokies (5-5, 3-3 ACC) also need one more victory to extend their nation\u2019s-best bowl streak to 23 seasons.\n\n\u201cWe all know it\u2019s a huge game, not only for Frank but for us,\u201d senior defensive tackle Luther Maddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s my last time walking through the tunnel at Lane Stadium, so I know I\u2019m going to have some emotions running through my body. I\u2019m sure all the other seniors will also. I think we\u2019re going to play our butts off this game, not only for us but for coach Beamer and for this team to keep this bowl streak going. It\u2019ll be a huge game.\u201d\n\nThe No. 12 Tar Heels (9-1, 6-0 ACC) have their own agenda. They are riding a nine-game winning streak and need one more victory to secure their place in the ACC championship game against top-ranked Clemson on Dec. 5.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be emotional for a lot of those fans because he has done so many great things. He built Virginia Tech football,\u201d Tar Heels quarterback Marquise Williams said of Beamer. \u201cThey\u2019re going to come out amped up. The guys will come up wanting to get a win for him and send him off on good terms for his last home game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be excited, too, because we still have people that think we\u2019re irrelevant, people [who] think we shouldn\u2019t be where we are today. That\u2019s fine. We just have to go out and have fun with them, too.\u201d\n\nBeamer tried to downplay the magnitude of his 180th home game for himself, saying he would save those thoughts for another day. His son Shane Beamer, the Hokies\u2019 associate head coach and running backs coach, said managing emotions will be a challenge.\n\n\u201cI think you have to worry about it being too emotional for coaches, too, and make sure we do our job,\u201d said the younger Beamer, who was on the team that played for the 1999 national championship.\n\n\u201cBefore the game it will be emotional, and after the game it will be emotional, but during the game, you have a job to do, and that\u2019s what we preach to the players about is, \u2018Let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re not too amped up. Let\u2019s feed off the energy of the crowd and feed off the energy of each other and try to get bowl eligible.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe game isn\u2019t an all-or-nothing proposition for the Hokies, who can also secure bowl eligibility the following week by winning their traditional regular-season finale against Virginia. Besides wanting to see his father notch one more victory at Lane Stadium, Shane Beamer recalled being disappointed for the seniors after a 27-24 loss to Maryland in the Hokies\u2019 last home game two years ago.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for Saturday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need Lane Stadium to be the loudest it\u2019s ever been on Saturday.
