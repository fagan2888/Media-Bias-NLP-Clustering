The Securities and Exchange Commission voted 3-2 Wednesday for sweeping changes to institutional money-market funds.

The SEC’s final rules require money funds that cater to large institutional and corporate investors to give up their long-standing $1 fixed share price. After a two-year transition period, the funds will float in value like other mutual funds.

However, the SEC said it has worked with other government agencies to reduce the accounting impact. The change is “now possible because of key tax guidance that the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service have advised us they will release later today,” SEC Chair Mary Jo White said at an open meeting on Wednesday.

Guidance from tax authorities will eliminate “significant costs,’’ she added, and let investors in institutional prime money-market funds use a simpler accounting method to determine tax gains and losses on the fund. The Internal Revenue Service, for example, is expected simplify ‘’wash sale’’ rules that normally complicate rapid purchase-and-sale transactions in the same security.

Without guidance, investors in the funds would have to track individual transactions for tax reporting, which corporate treasurers have complained would impose an unbearable compliance cost.

Corporations, which are regular users of the $2.6 trillion money-market fund industry, will be eager to see if the guidance will make it easier to continue using the market.

“If it turns out that the [Internal Revenue Service] does not or cannot effectively address the issue, it will both undermine the goal of the SEC’s rule and have material implications of the cost-benefit analysis the SEC conducted,” David Hirschmann, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness said Wednesday.

Update: The Treasury Department‘s guidance is available here and the IRS has released guidance here.
