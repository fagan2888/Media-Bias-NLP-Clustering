For a very little guy, he’s got an awfully big name.

The official pictures of the christening of His Royal Highness Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge were released Saturday night — and show proud parents, Prince William and Kate Middleton, gazing lovingly at their googling offspring.

He’s dressed in a lace robe that’s a replica of the gown worn by every baby born to the British royal family since 1841.

The ceremony took place at Clarence House, a royal residence in the heart of London on Wednesday.

Kate said the ceremony “went very well,” adding, “It was a very emotional and a lovely day.’’
