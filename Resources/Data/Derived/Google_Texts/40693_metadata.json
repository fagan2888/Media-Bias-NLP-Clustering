Chris Christie: \u201cWhen you were younger, what was your favorite childhood snack?\u201d\n\nChristie replies, \u201cI wanted, you know, I just wanted regular potatoes. But guess what? So did other people. I wanted it the most, so I\u2019m like, \u2018I want it the most.'\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Rand Paul interjects \u2013 \u201cYou just froze a baby! You just froze a baby!\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not!\u201d Christie hollers back.\n\n\u201cGenital warts!\u201d Paul exclaims. \u201cYou touched a genital wart, and you can\u2019t touch it!\u201d\n\nThen Chris Wallace turns to GOP front-runner Donald Trump, who declares, \u201cWell, I have a pigeon \u2013 Lucas Don Velour. I always take it shopping because I want to and because it\u2019s got health.\u201d\n\nSuddenly Trump\u2019s stomach can be heard loudly rumbling, and the billionaire grunts and squeaks in apparent discomfort.\n\n\u201cWhatever, look \u2013 it\u2019s a thing the tuna melt does to me,\u201d he explains unapologetically.\n\nSen Ted. Cruz chimes in, using an exceptionally creepy voice: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say the S-word.\u201d He adds, \u201cWell, we could just go out and collect a dead swan. And then I, well, I will drink a sorority\u2019s goldfish.\u201d\n\nThe three debate moderators cringe as the moment becomes rather awkward.\n\nThen the show moves to Dr. Ben Carson, who speaks in his characteristically soft voice as he shuffles puzzle pieces around on his lectern. The neurosurgeon is utterly oblivious to the discussions taking place around him.\n\n\u201cNow this piece, I think it goes like that,\u201d he says under his breath. \u201cAnd then this one. No, this piece goes over here. It\u2019s part of the tree.\u201d\n\nBaier calls out: \u201cCarson!!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cAHHHH ahhh ahhh!\u201d Carson shrieks, startled by Bair.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this actually,\u201d Carson tells Baier, who says, \u201cWe can move on, and you\u2019re not missing any play time.\u201d\n\nCarson then whispers: \u201cAmerica.\u201d\n\nThe show turns to Kelly, who asks Jeb Bush: \u201cHow would you get a dead mouse on a crescent roll with some steak?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith some steak, I would fork it,\u201d Bush explains. \u201cHowever, if a pit bull is loose in your house, then you\u2019ll find me stiff on the bed \u2019cause I always throw up.\u201d\n\nThen each of the candidates is asked to take 13 seconds to make a closing statement in the form of a short song.\n\nHilarity ensues.\n\nChristie sings about ice cream, cookies and hitting a \u201cboy in a pink golf shirt with the pepper-spray tan\u201d until he \u201claid down on the concrete.\u201d\n\nCruz chirps about \u201crabies and bunnies\u201d and dancing in a \u201clittle paper hat.\u201d\n\nEven Trump can\u2019t help himself as he can be seen rocking out to Rubio\u2019s song about bald tigers and pig intestines.\n\nGov. Josh Kasich bursts into song about giving Britain cheese if it chooses to invade the U.S.\n\nTrump chants about mean reindeers and big birds in the jungle.\n\nBut he concludes with a warning: \u201cDon\u2019t go around the tuna.\u201d\n\nWalker shares a peculiar melody: \u201cWhy are dormant wives so adorable?\u201d\n\nFinally, it\u2019s Carson\u2019s turn.\n\nHe laughs sheepishly.\n\n\u201cNot ready,\u201d he sings reluctantly. \u201cOhh, here we go.\u201d\n\nCarson shares a peculiar melody about catching mice, which brings everyone in the crowd to their feet in a standing ovation.\n\nYouTube viewers went wild with comments about the video, posting the following on the site:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "(Warning: The following story and video contain jokes some readers may find offensive.)
