According to a press release posted today, the company will no longer make Original Kraft Macaroni & Cheese with artificial preservatives or synthetic colors by January 2016 \u2014 but it aims to keep the same iconic taste of the \u201cblue box\u201d mac \u2018n cheese.\n\nIn 2014, Kraft announced that its products sold in the U.S. would now have 6 grams of whole grains per serving, lowered sodium by 100mg per serving, and reduced saturated fat by 25 percent. This year, the focus is removing artificial flavors. On its website, in addition to new Star Wars-shaped mac \u2018n cheese, Kraft notes that all of its Macaroni & Cheese boxed shapes \u201care made with no artificial flavors, preservatives, or synthetic colors,\u201d adding that \u201cwe have switched to colors sourced from spices, reduced saturated fat by 25 percent, and have taken our first steps to include more whole grains in our pasta.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve met with families in their homes and watched them prepare Kraft Mac & Cheese in their kitchens,\u201d Triona Schmelter, vice president of marketing at Kraft, said in the press release. \u201cThey told us they want to feel good about the foods they eat and serve their families, including everything from improved nutrition to simpler ingredients. They also told us they won\u2019t compromise on the taste of their Mac & Cheese \u2014 and neither will we. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been working tirelessly to find the right recipe that our fans will love.\u201d\n\nInstead of using synthetic colors to make that vibrant yellow color everyone loves (but may also laugh at), Kraft instead will attempt to recreate it using natural spices like paprika, annatto, and turmeric. \u201cThese recipe changes are the latest steps in the Kraft Mac & Cheese journey to delight consumers with on-trend updates to meet consumers\u2019 changing lifestyles and needs,\u201d the press release states.\n\nKraft\u2019s attempts to provide healthier products are in line with other food companies and fast food restaurants who are aiming to improve their menus and reduce obesity in the country. For example, McDonald\u2019s has adjusted its menu to encourage people to drink less soda and eat fewer calories. And while Kraft\u2019s products are still questionable when it comes to nutritional value, they do contain a good amount of calcium.\n\n\u201cListening, extensive research, and continuous improvement have been part of the Kraft Mac & Cheese 75-year heritage,\u201d Schmelter said in the press release. \u201cFrom packaging like convenient Cups to products like Deluxe, Organic, and Whole Grain to light prep instructions, we\u2019ve innovated this iconic brand through the years to remain North America\u2019s favorite Mac & Cheese.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kraft, kraft mac & cheese, artificial preservatives", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The iconic yellow macaroni and cheese will no longer contain artificial preservatives and synthetic colors in 2016.", "title": "Kraft Mac & Cheese To Remove Artificial Preservatives, Synthetic Colors In 2016", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kraft-mac-cheese-remove-artificial-preservatives-replace-synthetic-colors-turmeric-329950", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/20/kraft-mac-n-cheese.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The iconic yellow macaroni and cheese will no longer contain artificial preservatives and synthetic colors in 2016.", "title": "Kraft Mac & Cheese To Remove Artificial Preservatives, Synthetic Colors In 2016", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kraft-mac-cheese-remove-artificial-preservatives-replace-synthetic-colors-turmeric-329950", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/20/kraft-mac-n-cheese.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/20/kraft-mac-n-cheese.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-20T12:18:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T12:52:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The iconic yellow macaroni and cheese will no longer contain artificial preservatives and synthetic colors in 2016."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16a4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cListening, extensive research, and continuous improvement have been part of the Kraft Mac & Cheese 75-year heritage,\u201d Schmelter said in the press release.\nThey also told us they won\u2019t compromise on the taste of their Mac & Cheese \u2014 and neither will we.\n\u201cThese recipe changes are the latest steps in the Kraft Mac & Cheese journey to delight consumers with on-trend updates to meet consumers\u2019 changing lifestyles and needs,\u201d the press release states.\nAccording to a press release posted today, the company will no longer make Original Kraft Macaroni & Cheese with artificial preservatives or synthetic colors by January 2016 \u2014 but it aims to keep the same iconic taste of the \u201cblue box\u201d mac \u2018n cheese.\n\u201cFrom packaging like convenient Cups to products like Deluxe, Organic, and Whole Grain to light prep instructions, we\u2019ve innovated this iconic brand through the years to remain North America\u2019s favorite Mac & Cheese.\u201d"}
