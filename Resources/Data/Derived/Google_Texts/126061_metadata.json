Following success with a private/public partnership with Tulare Local Healthcare District, Benzeevi outlined his plan to hopefully bring SIH back from the brink and invest HCCA funds in that possibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work and a lot of risk,\u201d he told the Board, hospital and county staff and another standing-room-only meeting at the Lone Pine hospital.\n\nBenzeevi was vague about what the agreement would cost the district, saying just that his company would participate in the eventual profits. The devil in those details will be contained in an agreement HCCA was slated to provide to Board members for discussion and decision at a meeting Saturday, Jan. 2.\n\nHCCA and Benzeevi were brought into the fray by District 26 Assemblyman Devon Mathis following a phone call for help from Supervisor Matt Kingsley.\n\nThe miracle of Tulare included retention of all employees and a reorganization that focused on keeping patients healthy, what he described as \u201cthe new healthcare paradigm\u201d required by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Tulare hospital\u2019s value increased by $12 million in one year and showed a profit within the first three months of HCCA management following years of losses up to $1 million a month.\n\nAt the end of a six-hour meeting, interrupted by an extended closed session to discuss possible litigation and personnel matters, Benzeevi went into more detail. \u201cWe (HCCA) run the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the public entity holds the assets. It\u2019s about doing it differently not a matter of doing it more efficiently or better.\u201d\n\nThe first goal would be to bring the Skilled Nursing Facility back in operation and find a doctor to re-open the Emergency Room. \u201cWe have a team on standby now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act makes it more beneficial to keep people healthy. We\u2019ll see what services it takes to keep this community healthy and we\u2019ll create those services.\u201d\n\n(This story was originally filed on Dec. 30)\n\n###\n\nFrom the Lone Pine Chamber of Commerce\n\nGood morning everyone,\n\nAs you know our Southern Inyo Healthcare District is in serious trouble. The sad part is we do not even know how much trouble, as our new three member board has not had time to find out. The State of California has given us until this coming Tuesday night to decide if we should suspend our District license or have the State of California revoke the license. In other words we are being asked to make a decision that will impact our hospital, our clinic and our economy without knowing all the ramifications of any decision.\n\nThe Lone Pine Chamber is asking you to please send an email to Scott Vivona NOW, and ask him to give us an extension of time before we have to give him our decision as to whether we need to suspend the license or let the State revoke the license.\n\nBelow is a sample email, we hope you will send out today, pleading, sniveling begging, anything you think might work is acceptable but we need more time to study the situation before any decision is made.\n\nDear Scott\n\nThe residents of the So. Inyo Healthcare District are asking you to please give our Healthcare District Board more time to consider what they need to do for our Healthcare district.\n\nThis board was brought on in an emergency situation where both the past full board and the CEO/CFO all resigned leaving us in a terrible mess. These three newly appointed board members are extremely community minded and knowledgeable and still need time to look at the complete situation before they make a decision that could make the situation worse just because they did not have all the information they needed.\n\nTo ask this new board to make a decision without knowing all the information is asking for disaster. Please consider this request as we really have no place else to go for help.\n\nThank you.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Sierra Wave: Eastern Sierra News", "description": "By Deb Murphy The last patient left Southern Inyo Hospital\u2019s Skilled Nursing Facility Wednesday and with it any ability of SIH to provide medical services.
