'I think it’s in danger of losing its clout and its power,' Hatch says of the foudnation. Hatch: Heritage risks 'losing its clout'

Sen. Orrin Hatch warned Thursday that the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation is slowly de-legitimizing itself.

“Right now, I think it’s in danger of losing its clout and its power around Washington, D.C.,” Hatch (R-Utah) told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd.

Hatch explained that the Heritage Foundation is among conservative organizations that were once dedicated to helping conservative intellectual ideas but are now “losing their reputation because of some of this radicalness.”

“There’s a real question in the minds of many Republicans now, and I’m not just speaking for myself, for a lot of people that [question is]: is Heritage going to go so political that it really doesn’t amount to anything anymore,” Hatch said.

Heritage Foundation spokesman Matthew Streit responded Thursday, insisting that Heritage is “dedicated to policy research of the utmost intellectual integrity.”

“In fact, everything Heritage policy experts have said about Obamacare is coming true. Americans are being undercut at every turn; whether through lost wages, cost increases, or lost health insurance,” Streit said. “The Heritage Foundation continues to seek policy solutions that will benefit all Americans, not political deals that would appease one political party or another.”
