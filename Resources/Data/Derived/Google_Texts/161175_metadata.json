He can become an unrestricted free agent next summer and will likely score a big contract if he does.\n\nBackground: Boychuk was drafted 61st overall by the Avs in 2002 and spent four years in the minors before playing four games for Colorado in 2007-08 \u2014 as a forward. The Avs traded him in 2008 to Boston for Matt Hendricks, and he spent another year in the minors before getting a chance on the Bruins blue line. He has been a regular player since, winning a Stanley Cup in 2011 with the Bruins.\n\nDater\u2019s take: It\u2019s too easy to second guess now, but the Avs would probably love to get a do-over on letting Boychuk go. So might the Bruins this year too, especially with captain and defensive stalwart Zdeno Chara out long-term with a knee injury. But the Bruins were caught in a salary-cap squeeze and got something for Boychuk while they still could. The star-studded Avs of yesteryear just never had much room for him while he was here. Maybe they can still get him back next summer \u2014 but it won\u2019t come cheap.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Islanders,Johnny Boychuk,NHL", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Johnny Boychuk, a former member of the Avalanche, was traded by the Boston Bruins before the season and has played very well for a New York team that got off to a good start.", "title": "Johnny Boychuk: Spotlight on the Islanders defenseman", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/10/25/johnny-boychuk-spotlight-islanders-defenseman/19877/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/10/Johnny-Boychuk.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Johnny Boychuk, a former member of the Avalanche, was traded by the Boston Bruins before the season and has played very well for a New York team that got off to a good start.", "title": "Johnny Boychuk: Spotlight on the Islanders defenseman", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/10/25/johnny-boychuk-spotlight-islanders-defenseman/19877/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/10/Johnny-Boychuk.jpg", "creator": "@adater", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Johnny Boychuk was traded by the Boston Bruins before the season and has played very well for a New York team that got off to a good start."}, "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Johnny Boychuk, defenseman, New York IslandersWhen: The Avalanche hosts the Islanders on Thursday night, one of its two meetings this season.\nHe can become an unrestricted free agent next summer and will likely score a big contract if he does.\nThe Avs traded him in 2008 to Boston for Matt Hendricks, and he spent another year in the minors before getting a chance on the Bruins blue line.\nBut the Bruins were caught in a salary-cap squeeze and got something for Boychuk while they still could.\nSo might the Bruins this year too, especially with captain and defensive stalwart Zdeno Chara out long-term with a knee injury."}
