In the vast majority of cases, patients are oblivious to the distinction between a wrong diagnosis and a medical problem whose signs, symptoms, risk factors and comorbidities lend to an uncertain diagnosis,\" he says. \"And most patients are clueless as to medical necessity for the majority of diagnostic tests and a significant portion of surgical cases.\"\n\nAlthough patient satisfaction's prominence in healthcare will increase in the future, Keckley writes it will not be due to factors like the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' penalties, but rather due to three key drivers:\n\nIncreased focus on digital health and social media: Patient satisfaction will hinge heavily on hospitals' ability to satisfy patients with a clear social media strategy, interactive, personalized websites and connectivity between electronic health records and personal health records, he states.\n\nInsurance coverage changes: In the post-Affordable Care Act landscape, employers will attempt to pass purchasing accountability on to employees. \"Data formally captured and reported by plans and hospitals and informally connected through social media will have a profound impact on how individuals access their providers and select their coverage,\" he writes.\n\nAnalytics correlating patient experience with cost and outcomes: Now that it's possible to analyze the effect of patient satisfaction efforts in large databases, consumers will know which treatment options correlate with which outcomes and their experience will become increasingly contingent on diagnostic accuracy and treatment options.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nStudy questions link between patient satisfaction and clinical quality\n\nSatisfied patients more likely to die, incur higher costs\n\nHospitals with unhappy patients still provide high-quality care\n\nHard outcomes data proves patient relationships matter\n\nQuality metrics represent growing slice of doc-compensation pie", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patient satisfaction is an increasingly important topic in healthcare, and three factors are driving that increased prominence, according to an article in Hospitals & Health Networks Daily.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Patient satisfaction is an increasingly important topic in healthcare, and three factors are driving that increased prominence, according to an article in Hospitals & Health Networks Daily.", "title": "3 reasons patient satisfaction is more important than ever", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/3-reasons-patient-satisfaction-more-important-ever/2014-07-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "doctor-patient relationship,HCAHPS,Hospitals & Health Networks Daily,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient satisfaction,Paul Keckley,social media", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4385\"", "article_summary": "Patient satisfaction is an increasingly important topic in healthcare, and three factors drive that increased prominence, Paul Keckley writes in an article for Hospitals & Health Networks Daily.\n\"What's striking is that patient satisfaction with hospitals is not strongly associated with accuracy in diagnosing a medical problem or appropriateness in the treatment recommendation that follows.\nTo learn more:- here's the articleRelated Articles:Study questions link between patient satisfaction and clinical qualitySatisfied patients more likely to die, incur higher costsHospitals with unhappy patients still provide high-quality careHard outcomes data proves patient relationships matterQuality metrics represent growing slice of doc-compensation pie\nAnalytics correlating patient experience with cost and outcomes: Now that it's possible to analyze the effect of patient satisfaction efforts in large databases, consumers will know which treatment options correlate with which outcomes and their experience will become increasingly contingent on diagnostic accuracy and treatment options.\n\"And most patients are clueless as to medical necessity for the majority of diagnostic tests and a significant portion of surgical cases.\""}
