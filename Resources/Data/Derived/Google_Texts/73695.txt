Among many other things, Barack Obama's presidency has been marked with constant memes, most of which have unwillingly come from the President, but some have been created by the resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue himself - just like the recent Buzzfeed video.

Only a few days before the Sunday February 16 deadline for enrollment in Obamacare, the President himself has released a video trying to get people to join the program, by doing one of the things that he does best: looking cool.

It seems that months ago, Buzzfeed asked the White House whether it'd be possible for them to create a microfilm of the President, and the video "Things Everyone Does But Doesn't Talk About" was the result, showing the President doing all kinds of embarrassing things - including using a selfie stick.

Enjoy!
