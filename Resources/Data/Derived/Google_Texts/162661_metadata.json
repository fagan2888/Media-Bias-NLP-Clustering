The initiative is now being offered at YMCAs across the country.\n\nThe model for the The Diabetes Prevention Program was developed by Dr. David Marrero, a researcher at the Indiana University School of Medicine.\n\nEligibility for Medicare expansion is a win he\u2019s been waiting for.\n\n\"We finally achieved what we set out to do more than thirteen years ago which was to create a policy change in how health care treats diabetes prevention,\" he says.\n\nMarrero and a colleague had the idea to test the program at the YMCA in Fishers and in Indianapolis back in 2008.\n\nA few years later, a study began at 17 YMCAs across the country with nearly $12 million dollars in funding from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt\u2019s now proven to be cost effective, spurring federal health officials to certify it for Medicare expansion.\n\nThe program includes weekly group sessions about lifestyle and behavior changes that promote healthy eating and exercise.\n\nIt\u2019s resulted in an average 5 percent body weight loss and an estimated savings of $2,650 for each enrollee.\n\nYMCA of Greater Indianapolis Associate Director of Health Partnership Programs Chelsy Winters says the potential move under the Medicare umbrella will increase the program's reach.\n\n\"What it likely will mean, that for Medicare beneficiaries who are pre-diabetic, a portion or all of this program will be covered as a benefit under their insurance coverage,\" she says.\n\nWinters says early research indicated the program was having a positive impact.\n\n\"The folks who went through the lifestyle education were 58 percent less likely to develop diabetes in the three years post study,\" she says.\n\nAbout 89 million Americans are pre-diabetic but only 10 percent are aware of their condition.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "A diabetes prevention program developed in Central Indiana is the first preventative care program eligible for Medicare expansion.
