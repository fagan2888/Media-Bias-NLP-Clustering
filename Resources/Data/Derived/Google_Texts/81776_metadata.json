This infographic from A-Z Solutions lays out the frightening facts about our food waste. Shocking! I learned a few new stats, including the fact that since 1974, our per capita waste has increased by 50%. Wow. And would you have guessed that meat is the most wasted food, making up 33% of the average American\u2019s food waste? I would\u2019ve thought fruits and veggies or dairy products. But no \u2014 it\u2019s meat, followed by seafood at 25%, vegetables at 20%, grains at 18%, diary products at 17%, and fruit at 15%. Very interesting indeed.\n\nThis is not the first time we\u2019ve written about a wicked good infographic from A-Z Solutions.
