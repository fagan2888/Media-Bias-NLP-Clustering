As my colleague Sarah Posner has noted here on RD, the root of Davis\u2019 claim is that \u201cthe Bible is of a higher authority than a ruling of the United States Supreme Court,\u201d and that, as a result, while Davis \u201cpurports to make a religious freedom claim,\u201d she and her lawyers are actually litigating \u201cthe very essence of authority.\u201d\n\nAs Catholic providers, the Little Sisters supposedly are basing their claim on the specific Catholic doctrinal prohibition against contraception use. But this claim only takes them so far. As I\u2019ve noted before, while Catholic teaching bans Catholics from using contraception, it\u2019s largely silent on the issue of Catholics cooperating with the provision of contraception, such as when a health plan they sponsor covers it. This is in contrast to abortion, where Catholic teaching is clear that Catholics cannot cooperate in the provision of abortion.\n\nThe upshot is that, traditionally, Catholic health plans could put one step between themselves and the provision of contraception\u2014such as having another insurer handle the administration of claims\u2014as a kind of doctrinal fig leaf to cover any moral culpability on their part while allowing women seamless access to contraception.\n\nBut this tacit agreement over the provision of contraception broke down in the face of the decision by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops to politicize the issue of contraceptive coverage in the Affordable Care Act as part of their \u201creligious liberty\u201d push to forestall legal approval of same-sex marriage. As a result, the bishops and Catholic litigants, like the Little Sisters, refused any accommodation on the grounds that even notification of their intent to recuse themselves from coverage was what triggered such coverage and therefore still amounted to cooperation.\n\nThis line of reasoning has been rejected by every single federal appeals court that has heard it to date, including the 10th Circuit, which rejected the Little Sisters\u2019 claim in July, and again last week when it refused to rehear the case. But a rare dissent to the latest decision not to hear the case illuminates the similarities between Davis\u2019 claims and the Little Sisters\u2019 claims:\n\nAll the plaintiffs in this case sincerely believe that they will be violating God\u2019s law if they execute the documents required by the government. And the penalty for refusal to execute the documents may be in the millions of dollars. How can it be any clearer that the law substantially burdens the plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise of religion?\n\nThe dissenting justices admit that the issue has \u201clittle to do with contraception,\u201d which would be the doctrinal basis of the nuns\u2019 objection. Instead, as with the litigating of authority mentioned earlier, it has to do with the nuns\u2019 right to place \u201cGod\u2019s law\u201d ahead of the federal appeals court\u2019s opinion that filling out paperwork isn\u2019t a religious liberty issue, but one of basic civil administration.\n\nIn other words, according to the dissent, the federal appeals court:\n\n\u2026does not doubt the sincerity of the plaintiffs\u2019 religious belief. But it does not accept their statements of what that belief is. It refuses to acknowledge that their religious belief is that execution of the documents is sinful. Rather, it reframes their belief. It generalizes the belief as being only opposition to facilitating the use and delivery of certain contraceptives to which they object.\n\nThe dissenting judges argue that \u201cit is not the job of the judiciary to tell people what their religious beliefs are.\u201d But it is the court\u2019s job to draw a line between what constitutes a religious belief and what is a derivative of that belief.\n\nLike Davis, the Little Sisters and the dissenting judges are arguing that an individual\u2019s interpretation of God\u2019s law should be given deference over the courts\u2019 authority to administer civil law simply because it is a religiously informed belief. That\u2019s a radical claim whether it comes from an Apostolic Christian court clerk or an order of Catholic nuns.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Religion Dispatches", "description": "At first blush, it doesn\u2019t seem that Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refuses to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and the Little Sisters of the Poor, the order of nuns who refuse to provide contraception coverage in their heath insurance plan, have much in common other than a bro", "title": "What Kim Davis and the Little Sisters of the Poor Have in Common", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2015-09-10T17:21:22+00:00", "url": "http://religiondispatches.org/what-kim-davis-and-the-little-sisters-of-the-poor-have-in-common/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ReligionDispatches", "section": "Sexuality/Gender", "published_time": "2015-09-10T17:21:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-10T17:21:22+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RDispatches", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf74\"", "article_summary": "In other words, according to the dissent, the federal appeals court:\u2026does not doubt the sincerity of the plaintiffs\u2019 religious belief.\nIt refuses to acknowledge that their religious belief is that execution of the documents is sinful.\nThis line of reasoning has been rejected by every single federal appeals court that has heard it to date, including the 10th Circuit, which rejected the Little Sisters\u2019 claim in July, and again last week when it refused to rehear the case.\nLike Davis, the Little Sisters and the dissenting judges are arguing that an individual\u2019s interpretation of God\u2019s law should be given deference over the courts\u2019 authority to administer civil law simply because it is a religiously informed belief.\nThe dissenting justices admit that the issue has \u201clittle to do with contraception,\u201d which would be the doctrinal basis of the nuns\u2019 objection."}
