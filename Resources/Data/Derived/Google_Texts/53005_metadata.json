Now, taking matters into their own hands, they\u2019ve come up with a solution.\n\nTwo leading pro-life organizations, the Charlotte Lozier Institute and the Family Research Council, teamed up to design a state-by-state map that clearly tells Americans whether the Obamacare plan they\u2019re considering covers elective abortions.\n\n>>> Click here to see the map.\n\nThe goal? To help individuals and families find abortion-free health insurance options that don\u2019t require them to pay what many pro-life critics of Obamacare call a \u201chidden\u201d or \u201csecret\u201d abortion fee.\n\n\u201cFederal funding for elective abortion was the most salient issue as the fate of the Affordable Care Act was hanging in early 2010, right up to the day of its passage,\u201d Charles Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, said in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\n>>> Commentary: How Obamacare Forces You to Subsidize Plans That Cover Elective Abortion\n\nAfter a Sept. 15 report by the Government Accountability Office confirmed what many pro-life individuals had warned\u2014that more than 1,000 Obamacare plans covered abortion while remaining eligible for tax subsidies\u2014pro-lifers called for more transparency.\n\nThe report also revealed that insurance companies were failing to collect from policyholders a required separate payment for abortion coverage, what critics call a \u201chidden\u201d or \u201csecret\u201d fee.\n\nRequiring enrollees to make two separate payments each month\u2014one of them exclusively for abortion coverage\u2014was the government\u2019s attempt to prevent tax dollars, as Obama promised, from directly funding abortion.\n\nWithout that separation, pro-lifers say, there\u2019s no guarantee that tax subsidies aren\u2019t going to coverage of elective abortion.\n\n>>> Commentary: Forcing Individuals and Taxpayers to Fund Elective Abortions\n\nAlthough the Government Accountability Office exposed these shortcomings in the 22-page report, the Obama administration has yet to address many of the problems.\n\nAs a result, when Obamacare\u2019s 2015 open enrollment period began Nov. 15, Americans couldn\u2019t easily discern in visiting online insurance marketplaces, called exchanges, which plans cover abortion.\n\nDonovan said:\n\nDespite repeated requests, the Obama administration and HHS leaders have not been forthcoming or enforced transparency for [insurance] carriers and state exchanges about which plans cover elective abortion. The issue clearly matters to millions of Americans directly and the strong majority who oppose tax-subsidized abortion.\n\nThe interactive map, titled \u201cAbortion in Obamacare,\u201d allows users to click on their state to read a detailed account of abortion coverage within their exchange options.\n\nAccording to the map, some states \u2014 including New Jersey, Rhode Island and Hawaii \u2014 still don\u2019t offer a single plan without abortion coverage. Meanwhile, 24 others, among them Florida and Pennsylvania, have laws strictly forbidding abortion from being covered.\n\nThe website is a helpful tool for Americans who don\u2019t want to buy insurance coverage for abortion, Donovan said, \u201cbut it is not a final solution to the problem.\u201d\n\n>>> Wondering what\u2019s happening in your state?
