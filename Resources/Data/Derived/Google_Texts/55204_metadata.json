Rand Paul (R-Ky.) took another shot Monday at New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), a potential opponent for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nSitting in the \"Center Seat\" on Fox News, Paul was asked whether he believed voters were ready for an outsider to serve as president.\n\nPaul said he considered himself \"new\" enough to be called an outsider. He said Americans would like to see a candidate who's held a real career, outside of politics. Paul served as an ophthalmologist before running for Senate in 2010.\n\n\"I don't know that a governor is necessarily an outsider,\" Paul added, referring to Christie. Christie, reelected as governor this month, was U.S. attorney for New Jersey before he was elected and earlier worked as a private lawyer and lobbyist.\n\nWhen asked whether he felt Christie was conservative, Paul said, \"depends on how you define that. If you have a very loose definition, probably.\"\n\nPaul explained that support for Obamacare and Medicaid expansion were, \"at best, moderate decisions.\"\n\n\"But I think we have room for moderates in our party,\" Paul said.\n\nPaul and Christie have engaged in a public feud, which has touched on national security, government spending and conservative values, as they position themselves as potential 2016 candidates.\n\n\"I didn't start this one and I don't plan on starting things by criticizing other Republicans,\" Paul said in July. \"But if they want to make me the target, they will get it back in spades.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Conservatives Pointing Fingers Conservatives Pointing Fingers\n\n1 of 35 Rep.
