(AP) - The old Sugar House has been through a lot of changes over the years.\n\nThat\u2019s the name \u201cold timers\u201d like Larry Whitehouse still use to describe the ethanol plant operated by Aventine Renewable Energy in Pekin, the site of a sugar processing plant that first went into operation in 1899.\n\nWhen sugar beets didn\u2019t work out in central Illinois, the plant converted to corn. \u201cThe corn milling plant was started in 1904. Its name was changed to Corn Products Co. in 1960 after merging with Best Foods,\u201d said Whitehouse, 75, who worked at the plant from 1957 until he retired in 1999.\n\nIn 1981, the plant went from producing corn starch and other corn products to ethanol, said Aventine CEO Mark Beemer. Aventine, which took over the facility in 2003, was the third ethanol producer at the site, following Pekin Energy and Williams Bio-Energy.\n\nChanges continue. Sacramento-based Pacific Energy recently purchased Aventine to become the fifth largest ethanol producer in the country.\n\nWhile Beemer isn\u2019t sure of his future once the transaction is completed later this year, he\u2019s confident that corn-based ethanol will continue to find a place in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cEthanol remains the cheapest energy molecule out there. It\u2019s the most economical source of octane available,\u201d said Beemer, referring to ethanol\u2019s place as an additive in most unleaded gasoline sold in this country.\n\nEthanol prices have declined along with gasoline in recent months. \u201cEthanol is now around $1.40 a gallon - the lowest it\u2019s been since 2005. We\u2019ve seen significant margin erosion,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a result, Aventine is reducing the grind rate at its plant in Aurora, Nebraska by 30 percent, said Beemer, who adds that there\u2019s a bright side to the drop in prices at the pump. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a 3 or 4 percent increase in gasoline use (by motorists). As more gas is burned, we\u2019ll blend more ethanol,\u201d he said.\n\nEthanol also remains a robust export for the United States with nearly 1 billion gallons expected to be sold overseas this year, said Beemer, noting that distillers grains, a byproduct of processing corn into ethanol, is prized as feed for livestock - and as an export.\n\n\u201cWith China\u2019s recent decision to buy distillers grains from the United States, the value of that product has gone up by 25 percent,\u201d he said.\n\nThe future of ethanol may be best reflected in the capital expenditures made at the Pekin plant where $30 million in upgrades have been made over the past two years.\n\n\u201cWe just put in two natural gas boilers, retiring 70-year-old coal boilers at a cost of $13.2 million. That will save 13,000 tons of sulfur dioxide from going into the air each year. That\u2019s a big improvement in air quality for the Pekin area,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the Pekin plant has evolved over the years, the number of employees has declined. Today 205 people work at the facility while Whitehouse recalled that 1,500 worked there when he started in 1957.\n\nWhen the plant was turning out corn products, the work was more labor-intensive than producing ethanol, said Beemer.\n\n___\n\nSource: Peoria Journal-Star, http://bit.ly/1EE7Ipt\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Journal Star, http://pjstar.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The old Sugar House has been through a lot of changes over the years.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The old Sugar House has been through a lot of changes over the years.", "title": "EXCHANGE: Pekin\u2019s \u2018Sugar House\u2019 now large ethanol producer", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/25/exchange-pekins-sugar-house-now-large-ethanol-prod/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/25/e7287fca054722096f0f6a7067000d24.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/25/e7287fca054722096f0f6a7067000d24.jpg", "description": "The old Sugar House has been through a lot of changes over the years.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "EXCHANGE: Pekin\u2019s \u2018Sugar House\u2019 now large ethanol pr"}, "Author": "STEVE TARGER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc11a\"", "article_summary": "Aventine, which took over the facility in 2003, was the third ethanol producer at the site, following Pekin Energy and Williams Bio-Energy.\nIn 1981, the plant went from producing corn starch and other corn products to ethanol, said Aventine CEO Mark Beemer.\nAs the Pekin plant has evolved over the years, the number of employees has declined.\nWhen the plant was turning out corn products, the work was more labor-intensive than producing ethanol, said Beemer.\nPEKIN, Ill.
