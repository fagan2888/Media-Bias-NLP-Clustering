Telemedicine \u201cis not going to be a replacement\u201d for traditional face-to-face physician-patient encounters, but will be \u201canother avenue and another channel\u201d for reaching patients, said Dr. Frank Dubeck, one of four co-chairpersons of the CPT Telehealth Services Workgroup, whose members met face to face for the first time last week in Philadelphia.The work group reports to the AMA's CPT Editorial Panel, which creates and curates the Common Procedural Terminology code system used for billing of physician services.Dubeck is also a member of the executive committee of the AMA's CPT Editorial Board, which oversees the CPT coding system.\n\nDubeck\n\nTelemedicine is here and is likely to grow with the addition of millions of recently insured patients under the Affordable Care Act, said Dubeck, an internist and chief medical officer for medical policy and clinical editing at Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, Rochester, N.Y.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sky's the limit,\u201d Dubeck said. \u201cWhat's happening with the advancement in technology (is) the current code set is not meeting the needs of provider, vendors and payers.\"\n\n\n\nAnother telehealth driver is the demand for healthcare services by self-funded employer groups.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey want their employees to be at work,\u201d Dubeck said, and telehealth visits help make that happen.
