The contract fee to Hasenstab was approved at an amount not to exceed $275,000.\n\n\"It's a new year, and we're ready to build,\" Bill Sheron, CEO, told the Joint Township Hospital District board Wednesday evening, when discussing the project.\n\nArmed with layout of the plans to the north, where the College Hills shopping plaza used to sit, plus a 3-D schematic of the new addition, Sheron explained the long-discussed building plans will provide ambulatory services.\n\nSee also - WCH board approves big purchases ]\n\n\n\n\n\n[Article continues below]\n\nThe addition will connect with the current hospital building and include things like imaging and radiology services, as well as some cancer services.\n\nSheron told township trustees initially the hospital planned for a much larger expansion, possibly expanding the hospital's emergency rooms, before the Affordable Care Act led to them scrapping those plans and returning to the drawing board.\n\nThe current layout plans do not cover the entire shopping plaza space, but will be built out with enough space to build further north if needed down the road.\n\nThe hospital acquired the land where the College Hills plaza was located at the end of 2009.\n\nSee also - Hospital continues to fine-tune funds for expansion ]\n\n\n\n\n\nSheron noted he still gets asked what happened to Hop Hing Chinese Restaurant, the last tenant in College Hills.\n\n\"We don't have Hop Hing, but we have Subway,\" Sheron said, of the newly opened Subway inside the hospital.\n\nSomething that was not included in the preliminary schematics was a road or some sort of boulevard connecting the hospital to Portage Road. This is something Sheron said he asked the city to consider as the area continues to be developed.\n\nThe hospital board Wednesday also approved resolutions to bid and award its elevator modernization project on the 1950s \"blue\" elevators, to purchase a new ultrasound system, purchase a new EEG system for the pulmonary/neurology department and purchase a new nerve monitoring system and operating table.\n\nReporter Steve Huszai can be reached at 330-287-1645 or shuszai@the-daily-record.com.
