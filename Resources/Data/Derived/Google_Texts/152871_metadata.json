But there\u2019s still time\u2014and here are some candidates who might slip.\n\nI have to give the Republicans credit for one thing in this election cycle. They\u2019ve been able to keep their crazies quiet. But the big question is: Will some GOP crazy talk seep out between now November 4? In the words of Sarah Palin, I\u2019d have to say, \u201cYou betcha.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve recently seen some glimmers of Republican lunacy. Just last week the Arizona State Republican Party\u2019s vice-chair, Russell Pearce, offered this gem: \u201cYou put me in charge of Medicaid, the first thing I\u2019d do is get Norplant, birth-control implants, or tubal ligations.\u201d Translation: forced sterilization of poor women to make sure they don\u2019t have more babies. Pearce resigned on Sunday.\n\nThat\u2019s an awful remark. But that wouldn\u2019t even get him to the GOP final four of crazy when you compare it with the crap we\u2019ve heard come of the mouths of Republican candidates in recent years.\n\nWho can forget in 2012 the double whammy of GOP Senate candidates comments about rape? First, there was Rep. Todd Akin who told us when there\u2019s a \u201clegitimate rape\u201d of a woman, her body somehow is able to magically block the unwanted pregnancy.\n\nThen came Indiana\u2019s Senate nominee, Richard Mourdock, who told us that pregnancy from rape is in essence a good thing because it\u2019s \u201csomething God intended.\u201d Consequently he, like Akin, believed that women who were raped should be legally required to carry the rapist\u2019s child to term.\n\nAnd in 2010, there was Sharron Angle, who lost a possibly winnable Senate race against Harry Reid in Nevada with comments like people might need to look toward \u201cSecond Amendment remedies\u201d to turn this country around and \u201cthe first thing we need to do is take Harry Reid out.\u201d It\u2019s not often\u2014in America at least- we see politicians suggest that maybe their political opponent should be shot.\n\nNow some might ask: Maybe we aren\u2019t hearing those types of remarks because the Republican Party no longer has right-wing crazies? (I\u2019ll pause so you can finish laughing.) True, some \u201cwacko birds,\u201d to quote John McCain, lost in the primaries this year, but still the GOP still is chock full o\u2019 nuts.\n\nAnd I think we are well positioned to see some of these candidates take a journey on the crazy train in the closing weeks of this election cycle. Why? Three reasons. First, the debates are coming up, and as we saw in 2012 with Mourdock, the more these people talk in an unscripted forum, the more likely the guano will ooze out.\n\nSecond, in the tighter races, the candidates are feeling the heat. Consequently, they may make an unforced error or try to offer some red meat to the far right hoping it brings their base out in what\u2019s expected to be a low-turnout election.\n\nFinally, there are some male Republican candidates for Senate, like Colorado\u2019s Corey Gardner and North Carolina\u2019s Thom Tillis, who are playing with dynamite. By that I mean they\u2019ve decided to talk birth control thinking it can help them, but one slip up on this issue, and cue the \u201cRepublican war on women\u201d headlines.\n\nAny of these scenarios could be trouble for the GOP. And not just for the candidate who made the comment, but it could put Republicans on the defensive nationwide. So in the vein of March Madness, here are my picks for the Final Four of the 2014 GOP championship of crazy.\n\n1. Jody Hice\u2014Choosing Hice is like picking Duke or UConn in the NCAA basketball tournament. Hice, the GOP nominee in Georgia\u2019s conservative 10th congressional district, has already given us a buffet of cuckoo. He has made horribly anti-gay and anti-Muslim comments, plus he thinks women should only run for political office if their husbands consent. And as Stephen Colbert noted two weeks ago, Hice recently confused a quote made by John Quincy Adams with one made by Dolly Parton.\n\n2. Rep. Joni Ernst\u2014The GOP Senate nominee in the battleground state of Iowa has the potential to serve up a prime cut of crazy. During the primary, she stated that U.S. laws \u201ccome from God,\u201d and judges must be aware of that when deciding cases. She has called Obama a \u201cdictator,\u201d suggested impeaching him, and advocated that states be able to nullify federal laws they don\u2019t agree with. Plus she gave us a Palinesque commercial where she rode a Harley Davidson while shooting a gun, promising voters that \u201conce she sets her sights on Obamacare, Joni\u2019s gonna unload.\u201d\n\n3. Thom Tillis\u2014Although the Republican Senate nominee in the Tar Heel State is a veteran politician, he still might just deliver up a whopper. In 2011, Tillis did give us a comment that conjures up the ghost of Mitt Romney\u2019s 47 percent remark when he told a crowd: \u201cwhat we have to do is find a way to divide and conquer the people who are on assistance.\u201d And just a few months ago, Tillis offered us this beaut: Unlike blacks and Hispanics, the \u201ctraditional population\u201d in our country isn\u2019t growing.\n\n4. Sam Brownback\u2014The Kansas Governor might be the sleeper in this race to crazy. He\u2019s in a tight reelection campaign and he\u2019s very right wing. In fact, during a TV interview in 2012, he told a female caller that if she didn\u2019t like the fact that her boss didn\u2019t want to cover her birth control because of his religious beliefs, she should \u201cgo work somewhere else.\u201d\n\nThose are my top four. Sure, I could\u2019ve picked others. There are perennial wingnut powerhouses like Iowa Rep. Steve King and Texas\u2019 resident wacko Rep. Louie Gohmert, but I\u2019m feeling pretty good with my choices.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "TheDeansreport"}, "keywords": "todd akin, Republican Party, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201409201045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "No Todd Akins or Richard Mourdocks so far this year.
