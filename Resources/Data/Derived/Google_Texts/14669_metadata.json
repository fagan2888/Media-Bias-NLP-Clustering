An Internet connection, a tax return form and a stolen identity are enough to fuel a multi-billion-dollar criminal enterprise that has proven too pervasive to stop. Thanks in part to technological simplicity and controls that struggle to keep pace with the crime, thieves are pocketing billions of dollars in stolen federal tax refunds. Over the last year, the IRS paid out $4 billion in bogus tax refunds to fraudsters using someone else\u0092s personal information. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)\n\nTERRE HAUTE, Ind. (WTHI) \u2013 A local tax expert says the affordable care act will change, or should change, how you file your taxes in 2015. It will also delay when you file and get your refund.\n\nWhen it comes to the Affordable Care Act, it will affect each and every one of us come tax time. In essence, the affordable care act is an unfunded mandate. It\u2019s the result of an ongoing battle between the White House and Congress.\n\n\u201cCongress has many times tried to repeal this, and so one of the things they\u2019ve done is they have not funded it,\u201d said Andy Stadler, who owns and operates Stadler Tax Service.\n\nStadler says we\u2019re in for a rough tax season. The IRS requested a budget to help implement the Affordable Care Act. Instead, Congress cut the IRS budget by $341 million.\n\nIf you normally call the IRS for advice or guidance, the IRS Commissioner says his agents will only be able to get to 53% of all calls they will receive. So you can expect long wait times.\n\n\u201cExpect a very long wait time, and you\u2019ve got a 50% chance of your phone call even being answered,\u201d said Stadler.\n\nThis puts more pressure on tax preparers.\n\nStadler says Affordable Care Act is $800 billion in tax increases, complete with new tax forms. This will complicate the tax preparation process for everyone, but especially for those who bought health insurance on the marketplace.\n\n\u201cThey in particular will have a very difficult time in filling out the forms, even understanding how to fill out the forms. It will be quite complicated,\u201d said Stadler.\n\nStadler says be careful when choosing a tax preparer. Be sure to hire an enrolled agent or a certified public accountant. Both have experience in tax laws, and both have either federal or state certifications in tax preparation.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Leading the Way in Terre Haute and the Wabash Valley with the most accurate and reliable news, weather, and sports coverage, along with the latest breaking news and severe weather coverage.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488538858", "og": {"site_name": "WTHITV.com", "description": "A local tax expert says the affordable care act will change, or should change, how you file your taxes in 2015.\u00a0 It will also delay when you file and get your refund.", "title": "Expect rough 2015 tax season", "url": "http://wthitv.com/2014/12/08/expect-rough-2015-tax-season/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwthi.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/tax-refund-fraud_arno.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "Twitter": {"description": "A local tax expert says the affordable care act will change, or should change, how you file your taxes in 2015.\u00a0 It will also delay when you\u2026", "Site": "@WTHITV", "Card": "Summary_large_image", "Title": "Expect rough 2015 tax season"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "The Wabash Valley's News, Weather and Sports Leader", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wthi", "fb": {"pages": 65409576342}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wthitv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/e396a450a3f32b43fa03fd4ba702dccf?s=16", "application-name": "WTHITV.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WTHITV", "published_time": "2014-12-08T22:23:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-08T22:23:24+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "5iOjTv9548kzHLo52jADaRfomdhZUDVLeei2c-gzjdI", "twitter": {"description": "A local tax expert says the affordable care act will change, or should change, how you file your taxes in 2015.\u00a0 It will also delay when you file and get your refund.", "title": "Expect rough 2015 tax season", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwthi.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/tax-refund-fraud_arno.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wthitv", "site": "wthitv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A local tax expert says the affordable care act will change, or should change, how you file your taxes in 2015.\u00a0 It will also delay when you\u2026"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06cb\"", "article_summary": "Stadler says Affordable Care Act is $800 billion in tax increases, complete with new tax forms.\n(WTHI) \u2013 A local tax expert says the affordable care act will change, or should change, how you file your taxes in 2015.\nWhen it comes to the Affordable Care Act, it will affect each and every one of us come tax time.\nIn essence, the affordable care act is an unfunded mandate.\n\u201cCongress has many times tried to repeal this, and so one of the things they\u2019ve done is they have not funded it,\u201d said Andy Stadler, who owns and operates Stadler Tax Service."}
