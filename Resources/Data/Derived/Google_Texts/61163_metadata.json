It allows two-way communication between healthcare providers and individuals at any location. Examples are patients located in rural areas or individuals who cannot\u2014or have difficulty in\u2014traveling to a hospital or clinic. In an article published on February 3 in Health Affairs, three healthcare experts highlighted the value of personal health technologies, to both providers and patients.\n\nThe article, Connected Health: A Review of Technologies and Strategies to Improve Patient Care With Telemedicine and Telehealth, was authored by Dr. Molly Joel Coye, chief innovation officer, UCLA Health System, Dr. Joseph C. Kvedar, director, Center for Connected Health, Partners HealthCare; and Wendy Everett, president, Network for Excellence in Health Innovation (NEHI). The authors note that the implementation of Obamacare is causing millions of additional Americans to access the already overloaded healthcare system. They explain that the application of telemedicine will ease the strain by making healthcare delivery more efficient and cost-effective.\n\nDr. Kvedar explained, \u201cThe widespread adoption of connected health clearly has the potential to extend care across populations of both acute and chronically ill patients, by electronically connecting patients and healthcare providers and helping keep patients healthy at home. Connected health programs facilitate remote diagnosis and treatment, continuous monitoring and real-time adjustment of therapies and support for patient self-care.\u201d Dr. Coye added, \u201cOur healthcare system has not solved the coming mismatch between our supply of providers and growing demand for care from consumers and patients, and this problem will only be more pronounced with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Connected health and asynchronous provider-to-patient communication can create a model of care that improves access and quality of care while decreasing costs and more efficiently utilizing our limited healthcare resources.\u201d\n\nThe authors cautioned that three essential criteria must be met in order for telemedicine to succeed: (1) assurance that this new model of care delivery does not sacrifice the quality of care; (2) provider financial incentives must be set at a level that will produce desired outcomes; and (3) health policy research must be conducted to evaluate the quality and cost impacts of future connected health services.\n\nThe article concludes with a call to action that urges government agencies, academia, patient advocacy groups, and private sector organizations to rapidly test, evaluate, deploy and pay for new care models that integrate connected health technologies and programs. Dr. Everett noted, \u201cTelemedicine has, over the past four decades, become an increasingly cost-effective approach to care delivery. A golden opportunity exists today, to create a truly innovative, efficient delivery system within the structure of national health reform. Physician and nurse champions must take the lead in ensuring that providers embrace these emerging models of care management.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Telemedicine is a rapidly expanding area of healthcare delivery that involves the use of telecommunication and information technologies to provide clinical heal", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/three-healthcare-experts-tout-benefits-of-telemedicine", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/cd/22/cd2267e5b31e28e096a734509194ab24.jpg?itok=6YZ740Xa", "type": "article", "title": "Three healthcare experts tout benefits of telemedicine"}, "twitter": {"description": "Telemedicine is a rapidly expanding area of healthcare delivery that involves the use of telecommunication and information technologies to provide clinical healthcare at a distance.", "creator": "@R Wulffson MD", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/cd/22/cd2267e5b31e28e096a734509194ab24.jpg?itok=6YZ740Xa", "title": "Three healthcare experts tout benefits of telemedicine", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2014-02-03T16:29:21-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Health News, Telemedicine, Obamacare, cost-effective, efficient, connected health", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-03T16:29"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Telemedicine is a rapidly expanding area of healthcare delivery that involves the use of telecommunication and information technologies to provide clinical healthcare at a distance.\nThey explain that the application of telemedicine will ease the strain by making healthcare delivery more efficient and cost-effective.\nThe authors note that the implementation of Obamacare is causing millions of additional Americans to access the already overloaded healthcare system.\nIt allows two-way communication between healthcare providers and individuals at any location.\nIn an article published on February 3 in Health Affairs, three healthcare experts highlighted the value of personal health technologies, to both providers and patients."}
