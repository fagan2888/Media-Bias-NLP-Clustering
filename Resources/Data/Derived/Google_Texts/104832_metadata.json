He landed on his hand \u2014 that Beal mentioned has been \u201ckilling\u201d Wall all season \u2014 and stayed down. After a timeout, Wall went to the Wizards\u2019 bench, had his left wrist taped and stayed in the game.\n\n\u201cMy wrist will be all right,\u201d Wall said. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, I\u2019ll play through anything.\u201d\n\nBeal landed on the foot of Atlanta center Al Horford after shooting a jumper with 8:08 to play in the fourth quarter. He rolled his right ankle and, after walking tenderly toward the bench, went to the lockerroom for treatment. Beal re-entered the game with 3:50 to play. He wasn\u2019t moving all that well, so coach Randy Wittman took him out before the Wizards\u2019 closed their 104-98 Game 1 win.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably the worst I ever turned it, honestly,\u201d Beal said. \u201cOff the rip, you always think of the worst because you\u2019re in so much pain. I knew after I was able to walk a little bit to the bench, I knew I was going to be able to come back. It was just a matter of me re-taping it and being mentally tough. I can\u2019t let my team down. Even if I\u2019m not a threat, I can still be a decoy. It\u2019s something I can bring to the table. You have to have the heart, the will and mentality that you\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to win.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "At separate times Sunday, Wall and Beal were on the Philips Arena floor in enough pain that the game had to be stopped.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "At separate times Sunday, Wall and Beal were on the Philips Arena floor in enough pain that the game had to be stopped.", "title": "Bradley Beal, John Wall say they will be all right", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/3/bradley-beal-john-wall-say-they-will-be-all-right/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/03/Wizards_Hawks_basketball_.JPEG-00746.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/03/Wizards_Hawks_basketball_.JPEG-00746.jpg", "description": "At separate times Sunday, Wall and Beal were on the Philips Arena floor in enough pain that the game had to be stopped.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Bradley Beal, John Wall say they will be all right"}, "Author": "Todd Dybas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Bradley Beal, John Wall"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f40\"", "article_summary": "After a timeout, Wall went to the Wizards\u2019 bench, had his left wrist taped and stayed in the game.\nHe landed on his hand \u2014 that Beal mentioned has been \u201ckilling\u201d Wall all season \u2014 and stayed down.\nATLANTA \u2014 At separate times Sunday, John Wall and Bradley Beal were on the Philips Arena floor in enough pain that Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal against the Atlanta Hawks had to be stopped.\nWall drove on the break in the second quarter, missed a scoop shot with his left hand and fell to the floor.\n\u201cMy wrist will be all right,\u201d Wall said."}
