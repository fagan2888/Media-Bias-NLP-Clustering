(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nOrganizing for Action, the political group set up to push President Obama's political agenda, is looking to expand its roster.\n\nOFA is launching what it calls a \"Spring Fellowship program,\" assigning more than 60 veteran organizers to train more than 1,400 new volunteers to promote items such as an immigration bill and Obama's health care law.\n\n\"It's about making sure that voices on our side are heard, and people are held accountable,\" said Jon Carson, executive director of OFA.\n\nThe trainers -- which include OFA alumni, long-time volunteers, and former fellows -- will be located in 22 states. They will train fellows who hail from at least 29 states (plus Washington, D.C.), and range from college students to adults making their first foray into politics.\n\nThe program, which includes data and digital training, runs from Feb. 8 to April 15.\n\nNew volunteers will be taught a variety of grassroots organizing activities, including outreach to potential supporters via local media outlets and social media tools, such as Twitter. OFA seeks to use many of techniques that helped fuel the Obama presidential campaigns of 2008 and 2012.\n\n\"We consider ourselves the best organizers out there,\" Carson said.\n\nThe fellows will presumably join the nationwide OFA organization that is pushing Obama agenda items that include immigration, climate change, jobs programs and continuing efforts to put the new health care law into place.\n\nCarson said, \"the number one push will absolutely be the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nRepublicans have criticized Obama over the health care law, citing website problems and canceled policies.\n\nCarson said OFA volunteers -- including those being trained this spring -- will talk about health care success stories, and help people sign up for coverage with one of new exchanges created under the law.\n\nThe political battle over health care \"has gone from a theoretical debate to the real deal,\" Carson said.\n\nOn immigration, OFA has targeted 34 specific congressional districts in which U.S. House members hold key votes to what Obama calls \"comprehensive immigration reform.\"\n\nHealth care and immigration are likely to be key issues in the November congressional elections, but OFA cannot legally participate in them.\n\nSaid Carson: \"We are an issue advocacy organization.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1dUQ9iG", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Organizing for Action, the political group formed from the remnants of President Obama's campaigns, is looking to expand its roster.
