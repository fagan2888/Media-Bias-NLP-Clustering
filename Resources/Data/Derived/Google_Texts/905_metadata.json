He also established deportation protections for certain undocumented parents of already protected children.\n\nTwenty-six states filed a lawsuit against the 2014 executive action in a Texas federal court, leading U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen to issue an order placing the programs on hold.\n\nThe senators argued that the leaked DHS document appeared to show that agency officials \u201cactively engaged in attempting to skirt\u201d Hanen\u2019s injunction, constituting \u201cyet another illegal \u2018executive action.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe authors of the memo openly acknowledge, and offer as a reason to support the proposal, that granting employment authorization to illegal immigrants under the proposed scheme would accomplish, by different means, the de facto legalization of the population intended to be legalized by the enjoined DAPA program,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe committee gave Johnson until Nov. 12 to respond.\n\n\u201cWe want assurances that the administration will refrain from moving forward with any such proposal that harms the integrity of our legal immigration system and violates the law,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe letter was signed by Grassley along with Republican Sens. David Vitter of Louisiana, Orrin Hatch of Utah, John Cornyn of Texas, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mike Lee of Utah, David Perdue of Georgia, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, and Ted Cruz of Texas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Republicans are demanding answers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senate Republicans are demanding answers.", "title": "Leaked DHS Memo Reveals Attempt to Skirt Immigration Law", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151109_DHSImmigration_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-11T13:51:01+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MkRJML"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senate Republicans are demanding answers.", "title": "Leaked DHS Memo Reveals Attempt to Skirt Immigration Law", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151109_DHSImmigration_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-11-10T18:32:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-11T13:51:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, Department of Homeland Security, Barack Obama, immigration, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals"}, "article_summary": "In 2014, Obama issued an executive order extending the work permits to three years.\nTwenty-six states filed a lawsuit against the 2014 executive action in a Texas federal court, leading U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen to issue an order placing the programs on hold.\nSenate Republicans are asking the Department of Homeland Security to explain a leaked agency memo reportedly revealing that federal officials are planning to evade a federal court order barring pieces of President Barack Obama\u2019s executive immigration actions.\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, led eight others on the committee in a letter sent to DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson last week demanding he clarify the document.\nThe executive program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), initially granted temporary two-year legal status to immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and attended school in the country."}
