The modest improvement means the industry must encourage more advocacy, research and education in acute and chronic pain management.\n\nHowever, the survey results are inherently subjective and are a government attempt to cut costs, according to John Dombrowski, M.D., medical director of the Anesthesiologist Assistant Program and clinical assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University. He said the survey does provide anesthesiologists valuable information to improve their work, but researchers must examine factors like blood pressure and heart rate when assessing pain to get a more accurate picture of the symptoms patients actually experience.\n\nHospitals across the country try various techniques to manage patient pain. At Chronic Pain Rehabilitation at James A. Haley Veteran's Hospital in Tampa, Florida, staff treat a patient pain by using therapy to improve patient function, eliminating opioids during the patient's stay and using various questionnaires to assess pain and pain management success, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPain control tied to patient satisfaction\n\n3 ways to manage patient pain\n\nNurse mindfulness can decrease patient pain, stress during procedures\n\nCosgrove: Patient experience key to healthcare quality", "article_metadata": {"description": "With postsurgical pain evaluations correlating with overall\u00a0patient satisfaction\u00a0scores during hospital stays,\u00a0pain management\u00a0at hospitals is improving, but not at the rate industry experts would like.\u00a0There is an increase in\u00a0patient satisfaction\u00a0with pain care in government-owned, for-profit and nonprofit hospit", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "With postsurgical pain evaluations correlating with overall\u00a0patient satisfaction\u00a0scores during hospital stays,\u00a0pain management\u00a0at hospitals is improving, but not at the rate industry experts would like.\u00a0There is an increase in\u00a0patient satisfaction\u00a0with pain care in government-owned, for-profit and nonprofit hospit", "title": "Pain management scores rise moderately, leave room for improvement", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/pain-management-scores-rise-moderately-leave-room-improvement/2014-09-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Pain Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient satisfaction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb134\"", "article_summary": "With post-surgical pain evaluations tracking closely with overall patient satisfaction scores during hospital stays, pain management at hospitals is improving, but not at the rate industry experts would like.\nTo learn more:- here's the articleRelated Articles:Pain control tied to patient satisfaction3 ways to manage patient painNurse mindfulness can decrease patient pain, stress during proceduresCosgrove: Patient experience key to healthcare quality\nHospitals across the country try various techniques to manage patient pain.\nThe modest improvement means the industry must encourage more advocacy, research and education in acute and chronic pain management.\nAt Chronic Pain Rehabilitation at James A.
