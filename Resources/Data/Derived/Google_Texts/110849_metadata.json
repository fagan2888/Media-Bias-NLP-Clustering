footing while \u201cattempting to match budgets to aspirations\u201d, a serving admiral has warned.\n\nVice Admiral Simon Lister, the former Commodore of Devonport Naval Base, laid bare the problems facing the senior service given the \u201cstate of flux created by the Strategic Defence and Security Review\u201d.\n\n\u201cOverall material readiness, especially in the surface flotilla, continues to decline despite the endeavours of hard pressed teams in the front line,\u201d he wrote in an article for in-house magazine The Naval Engineer.\n\n\u201cFrom the submarine perspective the numbers of force elements at readiness have been driven low by the late delivery of Astute and platform ageing.\n\n\u201cOperator technical knowledge in some capabilities is insufficient to exploit performance and on occasion actively reduces availability, and thus capability.\n\n\u201cOur maintainers\u2019 ability to assure available systems has been reduced by support solutions that are excessively reliant on industry and, in parallel, by reductions in career and targeted employment training.\u201d\n\nOne example, Vice Admiral Lister said, was the \u201clack of operators\u201d trained to use Type 23 Frigate\u2019s towed sonar \u2013 a device used to find submarines.\n\nBut the Chief Naval Engineer Officer said there were \u201cmany examples of excellence\u201d including the 333-day deployment \u2013 the longest-ever by a British nuclear vessel \u2013 by Devonport-based hunter-killed submarine HMS Trenchant in 2012-13.\n\nHe added: \u201cNevertheless, the price of unrelenting operational tempo and high utilisation is reduced contingency and unsustainable pressure on engineers in the frontline as every slim opportunity for maintenance is squeezed out of busy programmes.\u201d\n\nThe Vice Admiral, who joined the Navy in 1978, has been charged with developing future Naval engineering strategy.\n\nWhile there was an \u201cexciting equipment programme\u201d ahead, he said, with new aircraft carriers, destroyers and submarines in development, \u201cpeople should be considered as our centre of gravity\u201d.\n\nBut, he said: \u201cThe state of flux created by the Strategic Defence and Security Review, reductions and broader restructuring across branches has created pinch points, increased churn and outflow, especially in key senior rate cadres in the engineer and warfare branches.\n\n\u201cThis, coupled with reduced training investment and increasing transfer of engineering responsibility to industry, has reduced confidence, whilst increased tempo has reduced capacity for risk.\u201d\n\nHe concluded: \u201cWe have high calibre, motivated and skilled people but the way in which we have driven for affordability has generated incoherence between the equipment programme, the support solution and our personnel and training programmes.\n\n\u201cThis is, to some extent, inevitable given the lag that exists between the imperative of strategic choices made attempting to match budgets to aspirations and the ability to achieve affordable and sustainable change.\n\n\u201cBut the impact is a frontline struggling to sustain the materiel corrreadiness required by our tasking and commitment.\n\n\u201cOur current position is unsustainable in the context of the Future Navy Vision, threatens our reputation for excellence, and requires us to act, now.\u201d\n\nA Royal Navy spokesman said: \u201cThe admiral is merely pointing out the obvious facts that given the shortage of engineers across the maritime industry, and a growing economy, it is a challenge to recruit and retain these skilled personnel.\n\n\u201cWe are offering financial incentives and excellent training and development opportunities to ensure we can compete with the private sector.\n\n\u201cIt is inevitable that there may be some temporary gaps across the fleet but we continually monitor the situation to ensure there is no operational impact.\u201d",
