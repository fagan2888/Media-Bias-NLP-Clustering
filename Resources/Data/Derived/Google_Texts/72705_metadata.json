It made me wish I\u2019d brought my yoga mat along to the RedLine gallery.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s frivolous. In fact, it\u2019s feminist, serious, skilled and, at times, very good. The show features work from members of Front Range Women in the Visual Arts, a group that banded together in 1974 to pop the balls of sexism that surrounded museums, galleries and academia back in the day. The movement was largely successful, and this show serves as a celebration.\n\nAnd so it indulges in gal power, starting with the gallery\u2019s entry wall, painted the prettiest, pastel pink curator William Biety could have dreamed up. That serves as an unapologetic warning to the visual references that follow.\n\nAnd they do. From babydolls, ponies and panties to quilting, meditating and makeup, and on to the doubled-edged imagery of Diet Cokes, flabby skin and food prep.\n\nThis isn\u2019t art about those things, necessarily, but it taps such symbols to make its points. Cumulatively, it\u2019s the rare exhibit that lets women be womanly, cliches and all.\n\nThe power of this excess is that it makes you look hard at the work, to see beyond those cliches. In doing so, Barbara Takenaga\u2019s large-scale paintings go from giant tie-dyes replicated on linen to rich, acrylic abstractions. You look past the animal prints that catch your eye on Barbara Baer\u2019s three-dimensional floor works and grow to respect their references to Alexander Calder and Joan Mir\u00f3.\n\nYou swallow the icky feeling that Margaretta Gilboy\u2019s oil of a couple kissing is about relationships and see it as deft, timeless and painterly; and you come to understand Virginia Maitland\u2019s floating acrylic color blocks not as soft and fluffy tissue paper, but as serious explorations of form and shape.\n\nIt\u2019s important to say that not all of this looking reaps the same rewards. As with every group show, the quality of individual pieces varies and the overall level isn\u2019t what you see at every RedLine display, but it feels important at every turn.\n\nCompanion show\n\nFemale artists actually get a better showcase at a corresponding exhibit being staged by the Sandra Phillips Gallery in the Golden Triangle. Phillips, a trailblazer herself in Denver\u2019s commercial art scene, jumped at the chance to highlight some of her female artists as a complement to RedLine. Her small group offerings prove just how far women have come.\n\nPhillips has exceptional paintings by Maitland, including a multicolored diptych titled \u201cBright Red\u201d that drapes together blues and blacks with one streak of crimson slivered down its middle.\n\nOther highlights include Virginia Folkestad\u2019s 3-D constructions of mesh and thread that resemble flowers, Ania Gola-Kumor\u2019s small, mixed-media collages and Irene Delka McCray\u2019s swirling, surreal scenes in oil.\n\nThis work has its feminine traits, too. It\u2019s full of creamy lines and craft-making allusions. But here\u2019s the thing: It sells for serious money and brings home the fact that women don\u2019t have to mimic the work of men to have careers.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always that way. Four decades ago, when Front Range Women in the Visual Arts formed, women couldn\u2019t get a break from curators or colleges. The group\u2019s strategy was to be visible and mentor each other and the generations that followed. Their radicalism amounted to putting on shows.\n\nPeople still argue about the role of women in art, but female artists now have solid places on the schedules of the Denver Art Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver and other institutions, on the faculties of the region\u2019s art schools, in local galleries (though, room for improvement remains there).\n\nThey can succeed by making whatever kind of art they want: huge constructions of steel and concrete or delicate paintings set in kitchens. They can reference blood or butterflies.\n\nAt the risk of offending men, let me say that testosterone can be a barrier to rendering such intimacy. I see a lot of art by men, and it steers suspiciously clear of the human figure while professing to examine humanity. It leans toward social commentary and away from self-exploration. It can be distant, rely too heavily on technology and need too much explanation. Sorry, dudes.\n\nOf course, women fall short, too. But failing means there is a chance to succeed in the first place, and that opportunity wasn\u2019t always there. Some women, somewhere along the line, had to claim it. These chicks at RedLine were the ones who did.\n\nRay Mark Rinaldi: 303-954-1540, rrinaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/rayrinaldi\n\n\u201cMOVERS AND SHAPERS: COLORADO CONTEMPORARY WOMEN\u201d A group show at the Sandra Phillips Gallery featuring Virginia Folkestad, Ania Gola-Kumo, Virginia Maitland, Irene Delka McCray, Carley Warren.
