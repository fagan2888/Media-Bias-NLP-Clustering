Many are Democrats. But it is the members of the Christian right \u2014 evangelicals and Catholics, especially \u2014 who are treated every four years to the sneers of lefties, academics, proud atheists (allow me to quote myself: \u201cThere\u2019s no dogma like no dogma\u201d) and certain but not all media.\n\nRoger Ailes\u2019s Fox News has succeeded in no small part because he doesn\u2019t treat Christians as though they\u2019re Darwin\u2019s missing link.\n\nFortunately for Western civilization, Christianity has survived worse insults. Lately, conservative Christians in the country that codified freedom of religion have been placed on the defensive. Often viewed as obstructionists to progress, a secular world wonders: What\u2019s wrong with those people? Why can\u2019t they just get with the program?\n\nWhy can\u2019t the Little Sisters of the Poor suck it up and sign off on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s demand that their insurance policy include contraception funding? Ditto Hobby Lobby, the family-owned craft business that prevailed in its Supreme Court fight to not fund insurance covering contraception that destroys embryos.\n\nHobby Lobby detractors argued that the company was trying to impose its religious beliefs on others. In fact, the family was resisting the government\u2019s insistence that they render those beliefs unto Caesar. (The Supreme Court granted the Little Sisters an injunction pending their appeal in the 10th Circuit that protects them from enforcement.)\n\nThese issues, I\u2019ll admit, can seem arcane and are tiresome at times. But I\u2019m convinced, as Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr agreed during a debate last year on these two cases, that the state should always go to extra lengths to protect religious liberty whenever possible.\n\nIf only more Democrats and Republicans were as agreeable.\n\nRecent history and more recent comments by the likeliest presidential candidates make it clear, however, that Democrats and Republicans will take very different approaches in future state/religion entanglements.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton becomes president, she has more or less promised that the state\u2019s interests will crush the individual\u2019s as necessary to advance women\u2019s rights. Giving a fiery speech last month at Tina Brown\u2019s \u201cWomen in the World Summit,\u201d Clinton plainly said: \u201cDeep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed\u201d so that women can have unfettered access to \u201creproductive health care and safe childbirth.\u201d\n\nOne would like to imagine that Clinton was speaking only about primitive cultures where children are forced into marriage and childbearing, or where genital cutting is common. But we know that she also meant religious conservatives closer to home whose beliefs get in the way. She explicitly criticized Hobby Lobby for not paying for its employees\u2019 contraception.\n\nBy contrast, Jeb Bush, who will become the GOP nominee if Republicans are smart, assumed a much different tone and direction in his recent commencement address at Liberty University.\n\n\u201cHow strange, in our own time, to hear Christianity spoken of as some sort of backward and oppressive force,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a depressing fact that when some people think of Christianity and of Judeo-Christian values, they think of something static, narrow and outdated. . . . I cannot think of any more subversive moral idea ever loosed on the world than \u2018the last shall be first, and the first last.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe also spoke of what our world would have been like without the \u201cunalloyed compassion, such genuine love, such thorough altruism,\u201d as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. described Christianity.\n\nIt would be defined, Bush said, by \u201cpower without restraint, conflict without reconciliation, oppression without deliverance, corruption without reformation, tragedy without renewal.\u201d\n\nIn a culture more attuned to the grits-\u2019n\u2019-gravy style of a Mike Huckabee, it is rare to hear Christianity discussed in such elevated terms. Indeed, Huckabee can be expected to go after Bush as a blue-blooded elite who can\u2019t relate to everyday Americans. Well, yee-haw, one can hardly wait. But I suspect that even conservative Southern Christians, who can absorb more than one-syllable words, might appreciate hearing their beliefs so eloquently described as by Bush.\n\nTo be fair, Clinton likely would have reframed her comments \u2014 and maybe even her beliefs and accent \u2014 had she been speaking to a Christian audience. But her spoken words can\u2019t be deleted and her thinking is clear: Religious beliefs have to be changed.\n\nOr else what, pray tell?\n\nRead more from Kathleen Parker\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "All too often, conservative believers are the target of ridicule.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "All too often, conservative believers are the target of ridicule.", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s eloquent defense of Christianity", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/religious-entanglements/2015/05/12/0169ec30-f8e4-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/05/12/Editorial-Opinion/Images/2015-05-09T163707Z_01_TOR424_RTRIDSP_3_USA-ELECTION-BUSH.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kathleenparker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/religious-entanglements/2015/05/12/0169ec30-f8e4-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Kathleen Parker, kathleen parker column, kathleen parker washington post, religious freedom, conservative christians, hillary clinton religions, jeb bush religion, jeb bush liberty university,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker"}, "eomportal-uuid": "0169ec30-f8e4-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Kathleen Parker, kathleen parker column, kathleen parker washington post, religious freedom, conservative christians, hillary clinton religions, jeb bush religion, jeb bush liberty university,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd325e\"", "article_summary": "But her spoken words can\u2019t be deleted and her thinking is clear: Religious beliefs have to be changed.\nHobby Lobby detractors argued that the company was trying to impose its religious beliefs on others.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a depressing fact that when some people think of Christianity and of Judeo-Christian values, they think of something static, narrow and outdated.\n\u201cHow strange, in our own time, to hear Christianity spoken of as some sort of backward and oppressive force,\u201d he said.\nRoger Ailes\u2019s Fox News has succeeded in no small part because he doesn\u2019t treat Christians as though they\u2019re Darwin\u2019s missing link."}
