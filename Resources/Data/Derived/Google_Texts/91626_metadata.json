I\u2019m not going to give up hope.\u201d\n\nJohn Erickson, spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Homeland Security said $1.5 million is in jeopardy of being lost completely, because applications for the projects are due April 1.\n\n\u201cIf Indiana continues to be ineligible as the deadline passes, the state will lose access to these funds completely,\u201d said Erickson.\n\nOther projects include a $1.1 million project in Fort Wayne, which would have allowed for the acquisition of 18 homes currently located in flood-prone areas.\n\nBradie Shrum Elementary School in Salem was in the process of being awarded $2.2 million in hazard mitigation funds which would be used to build a tornado safe room for the school, which would provide safe shelter to 900 students during extreme weather events.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re very concerned about the suspension of the hazard mitigation money from FEMA, and we\u2019re looking at the immediate and long term impacts,\u201d said Erickson.\n\nA FEMA spokesperson told Kenney that, to their knowledge, FEMA has never suspended state hazard mitigation funding due to a lack of compliance with a grant agreement.\n\nIndiana will also not be eligible for future hazard mitigation funding, potentially resulting in millions more dollars lost, officials said.\n\nIn January, the State Senate passed an emergency bill allowing IDHS to intervene to issue a cease-and-desist letter on the project.\n\nREAD MORE | Emergency Kokomo stadium bill passes Indiana State Senate\n\nThat bill remains in the House, which is frustrating to the bill\u2019s author Sen. Jim Buck (R-Kokomo).\n\n\"Had we had this legislation, we may have been able to prevent an excess of money being denied for the rest of the state, as well as taxpayer money on a stadium in Kokomo that may never come into compliance,\" said Buck Friday. \u201cI am quite saddened by this turn of events. And I was disappointed to see the House handle this in such a cavalier manner.\u201d\n\nRep. Sean Eberhart, chair of the House Natural Resources Committee which heard and then held the bill on February 9, did not return Kenney\u2019s request for comment on FEMA\u2019s decision to pull funding.\n\nThe city of Kokomo filed a lawsuit at the end of January in an effort to continue construction on the Kokomo Municipal Stadium.\n\nREAD MORE | Kokomo files suit to build stadium\n\nRandy McKay, operations manager for the city of Kokomo, issued a response Friday regarding FEMA\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe firmly dispute FEMA\u2019s assertions that the eight parcels in question are not in compliance,\u201d said McKay in a statement. \u201cWe believe that the redesign plans are fully compliant with the deed restrictions placed on the parcels; that is why we filed suit against IDHS on January 26.\n\nFEMA has not provided the City of Kokomo with any actionable, specific instructions for how to align the design with their demands.\u201d\n\nMcKay said they have offered several alternative designs yet FEMA has provided no guidance or explanation for their position.\n\n\u201cWe are in continued talks with IDHS regarding this issue and our related lawsuit,\u201d said McKay in a statement to RTV6. \u201cWe know the state understands the overreach of the federal government; Governor Pence and his departments have actively fought, or filed suit against, federal government overreach on the Affordable Care Act, Immigration Reform, Education Policy and other issues. IDHS has indicated a willingness to concur and support Kokomo\u2019s position in recent discussions.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Governor Mike Pence referred questions about FEMA\u2019s decision to IDHS.\n\nBuck told Kenney it\u2019s possible a court could order the city of Kokomo to tear down the stadium or parts of it, thus resulting in a huge", "article_metadata": {"isPremium": "false", "description": "Approximately 20 communities throughout Indiana will be impacted by FEMA\u2019s decision to withhold all hazard mitigation grants and assistance to the state of Indiana, Call 6 Investigator Kara Kenney...", "author": "Kara Kenney, Jordan Fischer", "og": {"site_name": "RTV6", "description": "Approximately 20 communities throughout Indiana will be impacted by FEMA\u2019s decision to withhold all hazard mitigation grants and assistance to the state of Indiana, Call 6 Investigator Kara Kenney learned Friday.", "title": "Twenty Indiana counties impacted by FEMA grant decision", "url": "http://www.theindychannel.com/news/call-6-investigators/twenty-indiana-counties-impacted-by-fema-grant-decision", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.theindychannel.com/photo/2015/02/27/351_1425081467417_14122052_ver1.0_640_480.JPG", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 530250039, "iphone": 530172614}}, "site": "@rtv6", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "Kara Kenney, Jordan Fischer"}, "msvalidate.01": "F33258882556C3E953931ECED98AF6A1", "robots": "Index, Follow", "keywords": "Kokomo,FEMA,flood plain,stadium,funding,Call 6 Investigators,News,Local News,Tablet Showcase,Mobile Showcase,Homepage Showcase", "fb": {"app_id": 1575767939378722}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.theindychannel.com,recp.mkt32.net", "shortHeadline": "Twenty counties impacted by FEMA grant decision", "isStory": "true", "google-site-verification": "j4wSC7_v2_B4sjvx7H6TGe4EpCvggzT8pxX7bS0HuNE", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WRTV6", "published_time": "2015-02-28T02:13:15+0000", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/", "section": "Call 6 Investigators", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T02:13:15+0000", "tag": "kokomo, stadium, funding, fema, flood plain"}, "hasVideo": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2b1\"", "article_summary": "In Grant County, Emergency Management had planned to use FEMA hazard mitigation dollars to fund an access road for a trailer park that frequently floods.\n- Approximately 20 communities throughout Indiana will be impacted by FEMA\u2019s decision to withhold all hazard mitigation grants and assistance to the state of Indiana, Call 6 Investigator Kara Kenney learned Friday.\nThe city previously accepted federal dollars through the Hazard Mitigation Grant program and, as part of its requirements, must keep the space open.\nA FEMA spokesperson told Kenney that, to their knowledge, FEMA has never suspended state hazard mitigation funding due to a lack of compliance with a grant agreement.\nIndiana will also not be eligible for future hazard mitigation funding, potentially resulting in millions more dollars lost, officials said."}
