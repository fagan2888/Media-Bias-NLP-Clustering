Two health-care stocks took divergent paths in early trading Tuesday with Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc. continuing to careen down after a dizzying skyward ride, and Intuitive Surgical Inc. catching the lift up on better-than-expected sales numbers.

Intercept /quotes/zigman/12230574/delayed /quotes/nls/icpt ICPT plunged another 16% in recent action to $307.44, a loss of $56.92 per share. The stock of the little-known developer of a liver treatment that has yet to hit the market shot up to nearly $500 a share late last week after the company halted testing on the drug early because it already had met trial goals.

But warnings from the National Institutes of Health over the weekend said that those who used the drug, known as obeticholic acid, experienced “disproportionate lipid abnormalities.” That sent Intercept shares into a free fall Monday, which continued into Tuesday.

Meanwhile, a stock that knows a thing or two about dizzying heights, Intuitive Surgical /quotes/zigman/90651/delayed /quotes/nls/isrg ISRG , was up more than 10% to $433.96 after the company said its full-year sales should come in better than expected.

Questions that came up throughout the year about the viability of Intuitive’s robotic surgery systems, coupled with dropping sales and earnings, left investors thinking that 2013 would be a disastrous year. Sales expectations had been lowered throughout 2013, shares plunged to below $360 after touching the $580 level and the last revenue estimate from FactSet came in at $2.24 billion.

But Intuitive said it expected full-year sales of $2.26 billion, unexpected since fourth-quarter sales of its da Vinci surgical systems fell 23% during the fourth quarter and 11% for the year. Yet procedures calling for use of da Vincis climbed 16% to 523,000, thus increasing the company’s service revenue. Intuitive also saw an increase in sales for instruments and accessories that helped offset the downturn in da Vinci sales.
