(That last one \u2014 believe it or not \u2014 is for real.) In the beginning, they were just triangular corn chips with a little salt.\n\nWhat turned Doritos into a $5 billion global brand wasn\u2019t variety or clever marketing. It was desire \u2014 the kind of laboratory-developed, biological desire that makes you want to eat another and another and another. \u201cWithout that synthetic flavoring, I don\u2019t think people would eat much junk food at all,\u201d says Toronto food writer Mark Shatzker.\n\nIn his new book, \u201cThe Dorito Effect: The Surprising New Truth About Food and Flavor,\u201d Schatzker takes the fat, sugar and glut of calories that are causing obesity and goes a step further. The problem, Schatzker says, isn\u2019t the what; it\u2019s the why. We eat the bad stuff \u2014 the McDonald\u2019s fries, the Krispy Kreme donuts, the Spicy Sweet Chili Doritos \u2014 because it\u2019s chemically engineered to taste really, really good.\n\nSalon caught up with Schatzker earlier this week to talk about why bad food tastes so good, why good food tastes so bad, and what he suggests to fix what\u2019s wrong with what we eat.\n\nThere have been a lot of books and documentaries about food policy in the last few years. Are those things soaking into popular thought when you see McDonald\u2019s switching to non-antibiotic chicken?\n\nIt\u2019s definitely sinking in. Consumers are getting more and more frightened of food, and the people who sell food \u2014 some of them, at least \u2014 are trying to stay ahead of that curve or do what they can to appear that way.\n\nAccurate or otherwise, is there a perception that fast-casual dining \u2014 places like Chipotle \u2014 are healthier than fast food?\n\nI think there is that perception. I would underline perception.\n\nIs doesn\u2019t bear out?\n\nNot in every case. I don\u2019t want to say they\u2019re all bad. We love to beat up on McDonald\u2019s, but a lot of restaurants in the fast-casual space imitate the McDonald\u2019s model precisely. They manufacture food off-premises, heat it \u2014 they call it re-thermalizing \u2014 on-premises, and give it the sheen of having come out of a kitchen. In many cases, it would be better to describe that food as assembled rather than cooked.\n\nThe defense McDonald\u2019s had offered before with healthier food like apple slices was: \u201cHey, we tried. People don\u2019t want apples. They want Big Macs.\u201d Is the non-antibiotic chicken different than that?\n\nI\u2019m not pro antibiotic use in chicken, but non-antibiotic chicken doesn\u2019t suddenly fix what\u2019s wrong with chicken.\n\nIt\u2019s a step, right? It\u2019s moving in the right direction.\n\nIt is a step. I\u2019m encouraged to see that consumers can flex their muscles. That\u2019s a good point. A lot of people want to point out the hypocrisy that the restaurants aren\u2019t doing enough, but at least they are taking steps.\n\nI saw in the news this week that Target is going to start devoting less shelf space to packaged foods and more to healthy foods. Are you seeing that in other retailers?\n\nWhole Foods is the clearest example of that. For them, it\u2019s the whole ethos behind the company. Some of these big retailers are getting very interested in offering solutions instead of being part of the problem.\n\nThe basic premise of your book, as I read it, has two parts: The good stuff now tastes worse, and the bad stuff now tastes better. Start with the first part: You\u2019re saying meat and produce tasted better 30 or 40 years ago than they do now?\n\nThere\u2019s been a drip-by-drip loss of flavor and nutrition in the food we grow. We keep telling ourselves to eat more foods at the same time as we\u2019re making those foods taste ever blander. It\u2019s not really that much of a surprise that people don\u2019t want to eat them.\n\nWe certainly know about homogenization and commercial growing methods, but how you know the taste is worse than 40 years ago?\n\nIf you go to a farmer\u2019s market and taste heirloom produce, it\u2019s evident in a side-by-side comparison. Also, the scientific research on nutritional dilution is quite comprehensive. This is not a theory or something that home gardeners believe. It\u2019s been measured. Flavor dilution goes hand in hand with nutritional dilution. There\u2019s an association between the two. The harder we push output \u2014 quantity \u2014 the more we beat up on nutrition and flavor.\n\nThe second part, and what a good bit of the book is about, is that food companies have engineered food to taste better. Doritos and fast food, I get. Are there some subtler examples that would surprise people?\n\nIt\u2019s in a bewildering array of products \u2014 soy milk, butter, yogurt. When food is bland on its own, we enhance it chemically and add a ton of calories to it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon talks to author Mark Schatzker about why the worse our food tastes, the more we eat", "title": "\u201cWe look like our livestock now\u201d: The author of \u201cThe Dorito Effect\u201d on the chemically-enhanced junk food we can\u2019t put down", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon talks to author Mark Schatzker about why the worse our food tastes, the more we eat", "title": "\u201cWe look like our livestock now\u201d: The author of \u201cThe Dorito Effect\u201d on the chemically-enhanced junk food we can\u2019t put down", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/06/we_look_like_our_livestock_now_the_author_of_the_dorito_effect_on_the_chemically_enhanced_junk_food_we_cant_put_down/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/doritos.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon talks to author Mark Schatzker about why the worse our food tastes, the more we eat", "title": "\u201cWe look like our livestock now\u201d: The author of \u201cThe Dorito Effect\u201d on the chemically-enhanced junk food we can\u2019t put down", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/doritos.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Porch", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Eating, Editor's Picks, Food, junk food", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd240e\"", "article_summary": "Salon caught up with Schatzker earlier this week to talk about why bad food tastes so good, why good food tastes so bad, and what he suggests to fix what\u2019s wrong with what we eat.\n\u201cWithout that synthetic flavoring, I don\u2019t think people would eat much junk food at all,\u201d says Toronto food writer Mark Shatzker.\nWe keep telling ourselves to eat more foods at the same time as we\u2019re making those foods taste ever blander.\nThe second part, and what a good bit of the book is about, is that food companies have engineered food to taste better.\nTopics: Books, Eating, Editor's Picks, Food, junk food, Entertainment NewsWhen Doritos first hit store shelves in 1964, they weren\u2019t Cool Ranch Doritos or Jumpin\u2019 Jack Monterey Cheese Doritos or Jacked Ranch Dipped Hot Wings Doritos."}
