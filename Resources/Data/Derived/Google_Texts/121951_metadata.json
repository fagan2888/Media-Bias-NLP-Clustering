The state will be challenged to restore fiscal accountability after years of reliance on one-time resources while also prioritizing education, expanding Medicaid and public safety initiatives, S&P said.\n\nIn Oklahoma, contracting production and employment in the energy sector are rippling through the economy, S&P said.\n\nOn Wednesday Governor Mary Fallin signed four criminal justice reform bills into law designed to reduce incarceration rates and cut the bloated system's costs.\n\nFallin's budget proposal largely addresses the state's projected budget gap through a mix of cuts and increases for key priorities like education, corrections and human services, S&P said.\n\nNorth Dakota, which saw its economy surge amid a boom in oil and gas produced by fracking in the years prior to the price collapse in 2014, is expected to have an $829.3 million shortfall for fiscal 2017. That is approximately 18 percent of its ongoing expenditures.\n\nWhen Governor Jack Dalrymple presented his 2015-2017 budget address in December 2014, key priorities were tax relief, support for the oil-rich Bakken shale region, and investments in education, outdoor recreation, environmental production, and infrastructure improvements, S&P said.\n\n(Reporting by Rory Carroll;
