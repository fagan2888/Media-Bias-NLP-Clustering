Lawrence ruled late Tuesday that Indiana and 39 school districts can largely move forward with a case challenging the Affordable Care Act and associated rules set by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe IRS had asked Lawrence to dismiss the case.\n\nThe case questions whether Hoosiers should qualify for federal tax breaks that are being used as subsidies to help Americans afford insurance. At issue are the health exchanges \u2013 essentially online marketplaces \u2013 where citizens who don\u2019t have insurance through their workplaces can shop for coverage.\n\nThe suit says the Affordable Care Act \u2013 known as Obamacare \u2013 only authorized the tax breaks for people who purchase insurance through state-based exchanges, which Indiana doesn\u2019t have. But the Internal Revenue Service has since expanded the rules for federal subsidies so they are available to all qualified Americans who purchase insurance through an exchange, whether it\u2019s run through the state or federal government, the suit says.\n\nAlso, the suit questions whether federal officials can impose an employer health insurance mandate and a tax penalty on state and local governments, which don\u2019t pay taxes.\n\nLawrence ruled that the state could move forward with its argument about the subsidies. And it said the school districts could make arguments about the tax issues during a later phase of the case \u2013 but that the state could not.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased the state and 39 school districts will have our day in court to explain why the IRS greatly overstepped its bounds,\u201d Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a statement. \u201cUltimately our aim is for the court to remove the threat of multimillion-dollar IRS penalties against the state of Indiana and its school corporations that government as employers otherwise could face.\u201d\n\nIf the state wins the argument that the IRS had no authority to expand the subsidies to states without their own exchanges, Hoosiers could have to pay significantly more for health insurance. But it could save businesses and governments money.\n\nThat\u2019s because the Obamacare law requires companies to pay penalties if they fail to provide minimum health coverage to employees \u2013 and at least one of those employees signs up through an exchange and receives the federal subsidy.\n\nUnder the law as written, no Indiana company could be subject to the penalty because the state doesn\u2019t have an exchange and therefore employees couldn\u2019t qualify for a subsidy, according to the lawsuit.\n\nFederal appeals courts have handed down conflicting rulings on the question about whether the IRS could authorize the subsidies.\n\nA three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals said no, ruling that the Affordable Care Act limits the subsidies only to residents of places with state-run exchanges.\n\nBut the 4th District Court of Appeals found the opposite. In its ruling, that court said the language of the federal law is \u201cambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations\u201d that would allow for the subsidies.\n\nLesley Weidenbener is the executive director of TheStatehouseFile.com, a news service powered by Franklin College journalism students and faculty.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "A federal judge has set oral arguments for Oct. 9 in a case where the state of Indiana and several school districts are challenging the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Federal judge to hear State vs. Obamacare | News | NUVO News | Indianapolis, IN", "og": {"site_name": "NUVO", "description": "A federal judge has set oral arguments for Oct. 9 in a case where the state of Indiana and several school districts are challenging the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Federal judge to hear State vs. Obamacare", "url": "http://www.nuvo.net/indianapolis/federal-judge-to-hear-state-vs-obamacare/Content?oid=2899315", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://media1.fdncms.com/nuvo/imager/birch-bayh-federal-building-and-us-courtho/u/slideshow/2899316/courthouse-outside.jpg", "height": 402}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media1.fdncms.com/nuvo/imager/birch-bayh-federal-building-and-us-courtho/u/slideshow/2899316/courthouse-outside.jpg"}, "description": "A federal judge has set oral arguments for Oct. 9 in a case where the state of Indiana and several school districts are challenging the Affordable Care Act.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Federal judge to hear State vs. Obamacare"}, "oid": 2899315, "fb": {"app_id": 207070172674679}, "keywords": "Obamacare, U.S. District Court, Greg Zoeller, Birch Bayh Federal Building, Current Events column, News, Indianapolis, Indiana, Indy, independent, updates, events, news, Indianapolis, Indy, current events, social justice, environment, politics, local, business, NUVO, news, Indianapolis, Indiana. newsweekly, alt-weekly, altweekly, Hoosier, music, sports, arts, entertainment, local food", "thumbnail": "http://media1.fdncms.com/nuvo/imager/birch-bayh-federal-building-and-us-courtho/u/slideshow/2899316/courthouse-outside.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "obamacare, us district court, greg zoeller, birch bayh federal building, current events column, news, indianapolis, indiana, indy, independent"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeaf7\"", "article_summary": "CourthouseA federal judge has set oral arguments for Oct. 9 in a case that could strip Hoosiers of their ability to get federal subsidies for health insurance.\nThe case questions whether Hoosiers should qualify for federal tax breaks that are being used as subsidies to help Americans afford insurance.\nAlso, the suit questions whether federal officials can impose an employer health insurance mandate and a tax penalty on state and local governments, which don\u2019t pay taxes.\nBut the Internal Revenue Service has since expanded the rules for federal subsidies so they are available to all qualified Americans who purchase insurance through an exchange, whether it\u2019s run through the state or federal government, the suit says.\nFederal appeals courts have handed down conflicting rulings on the question about whether the IRS could authorize the subsidies."}
