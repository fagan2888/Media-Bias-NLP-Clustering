Perez joined Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker at a Jersey City community center on Monday, where they were joined by seven low-wage workers as part of an Obama administration push to increase the federal minimum wage.\n\nPerez said Obama, who has called on Congress to hike the minimum wage to $10.10, would in a few weeks sign an executive order mandating that federal contractors pay their workers that hourly rate instead of the $7.25 current minimum wage.\n\n\u201cThe executive order is a start, but it\u2019s not a finish,\u201d Perez said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s meant to really make sure we practice what we preach \u2026 we\u2019re demonstrating you can do it.\u201d\n\nThe executive order would cover dishwashers, janitors and other low-wage federal contractors.\n\nMarc Freedman, executive director of labor policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is opposed to a wage hike, told The Jersey Journal that it would affect small businesses that are already struggling to figure out how they will be impacted by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIncreasing their labor costs will be yet another burden that will impede their ability to hire more people or keep providing the same level of hours they are currently providing,\u201d Freedman said. But for Booker, a Democrat, raising the minimum wage would allow the United States to \u201cbe the kind of nation we say we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know we have families that work full time but still find themselves below the poverty line,\u201d he said.\n\nConsuelo Evans, 57, of Jersey City, was one of the low-wage workers who appeared on Monday\u2019s panel. Evans said she makes about $20,000 total at two jobs in the healthcare industry.\n\nThat\u2019s enough to pay her rent and a few bills but not enough for her to obtain medical insurance, she said.\n\n\u201cAfter I pay expenses, I have $80 left,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt\u2019s really devastating.\u201d\n\nPerez also praised Jersey City for being the first in New Jersey to mandate that most private businesses provide paid sick leave to their workers.\n\n\u201cJersey City\u2019s ahead of the country in that regard,\u201d he said, adding that the issue will be \u201cfront and center\u201d at a working families summit Obama will attend later this year.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Terrence T.
