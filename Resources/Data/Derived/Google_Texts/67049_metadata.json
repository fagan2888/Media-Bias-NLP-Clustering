Phone and voicemail messages left for Gruchacz, Williams, and the other freeholders were not returned, and an attempt to reach Eskilson was unsuccessful.\n\nNovrit alleges in her complaint that she has been the target of retaliation by Gruchacz ever since she sent a letter on Jan. 13 to Newton Medical Center urging that a female patient not be released to the care of her husband, who was said in the letter to be incapable of providing that care. Her complaint alleges that ever since then, Novrit has been treated by Gruchacz \"with disdain\" and been the victim of a hostile work environment.\n\nGruchacz \u2014 who was then the administrator of the county\u2019s Department of Human Services, within which the Division of Social Services is housed \u2014 allegedly \"became incensed\" upon learning of what Novrit had done, \"accused (her) of sending out confidential information,\" told her the hospital was \"ballistic,\" and ended by hanging up the phone on her.\n\nAt the time, according to the complaint, Gruchacz was intent on building a relationship with Newton Medical Center, with which the county had partnered three years earlier on a transitional care program for which the hospital had provided seed money.\n\nThe program, which was established under Gruchacz and which mirrors incentives provided to hospitals under the Affordable Care Act, uses county staff to provide support services to Medicare patients following their release from the hospital so as to reduce their readmission rates.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Gruchacz, after being promoted to the county administrator\u2019s position in June, acted with the support of the three freeholder defendants to appoint \"a less qualified individual with less experience\" than Novrit to Gruchacz\u2019s former position as human services director.\n\nThough not identified by name in the lawsuit, Sarah Balzano \u2014 who coordinated the transitional care program under Gruchacz \u2014 was approved by the three freeholders at their July 22 meeting to succeed Gruchacz as the county\u2019s new human services director \u2014 an appointment that the complaint, without providing details, alleges was influenced in part by John Eskilson.\n\nThe complaint states that because of Novrit\u2019s advocacy on behalf of the female patient at Newton Medical Center, who would have faced \"an unsafe condition\" as a result of being released to her husband, Novrit has suffered \"a hostile work environment\" and \"adverse employment decisions\" in violation of the Conscientious Employee Protection Act \u2014 also known as the whistleblower law \u2014 \"by being deprived of the promotion to first, County Administrator and then, to Administrator of the Department of Human Services.\"\n\nThe three freeholder defendants, it is further alleged, all chose Gruchacz as county administrator over Novrit based partly on considerations stemming from their support for a February settlement calling for the infusion of another $6.7 million into the county\u2019s $28 million solar initiative.\n\n\"There has been widespread criticism of the three Freeholders who supported the (solar) settlement,\" the complaint states. \"Defendant Gruchacz was selected by the three Freeholder Defendants because of his commitment to keeping the settlement in place and his commitment to protect the three Freeholder Defendants from ramifications of having entered into the solar project settlement.\"\n\nThe complaint states that in the interim period between January and the end of June, the hostile work conditions encountered by Novrit were controlled and mitigated to some degree by the intervention of former County Counsel Dennis McConnell, who retired July 1.\n\nSince then, it is alleged, the hostile work conditions have returned with the acquiescence of newly appointed County Counsel John Williams, who is said to have \"consulted with ... Gruchacz and carried forward Gruchacz\u2019s hostile work environment\" against Novrit.\n\nThe complaint specifically references a meeting Novrit held with Williams on or about July 20, where he allegedly told her he was unfamiliar with what had taken place previously but said he would look into the matter.\n\nSubsequently, on July 22, Williams allegedly called Novrit to his office where he \"berated her\" and \"told her she was suffering from anxiety,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nIt is alleged that at that meeting, Williams also \"criticized (Novrit) for \u2018shoving her resume in his face\u2019 and further stated, \u2018I thought there was something about you.\u2019\"\n\nNovrit, who has headed the county\u2019s Division of Social Services since 2007, is seeking unspecified damages and demanding a trial by jury.\n\nShe is being represented in her lawsuit by Sparta-based attorney George Daggett.\n\nNovrit declined to comment for this story and has advised that all inquiries should be directed to Daggett, who also declined further comment.\n\nA trial date has not been set.\n\nEric Obernauer can also be contacted on Twitter: @EricObernNJH or by phone at 973-383-1213.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEWTON \u2014 The director of social services for Sussex County, in a newly filed lawsuit, has accused County Administrator Stephen Gruchacz of retaliating against her for advocating on behalf of a sickly patient at Newton Medical Center earlier this year against Gruchacz\u2019s wishes.", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey Herald", "description": "NEWTON \u2014 The director of social services for Sussex County, in a newly filed lawsuit, has accused County Administrator Stephen Gruchacz of retaliating against her for advocating on behalf of a sickly patient at Newton Medical Center earlier this year against Gruchacz\u2019s wishes.", "title": "Social services director sues county officials, alleges retaliation, solar cover-up", "url": "http://www.njherald.com/story/29742896/social-services-director-sues-county-officials-alleges-retaliation-solar-cover-up", "image": "http://www.njherald.com/img/NH200x200social.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.njherald.com/img/NH200x200social.jpg", "description": "NEWTON \u2014 The director of social services for Sussex County, in a newly filed lawsuit, has accused County Administrator Stephen Gruchacz of retaliating against her for advocating on behalf of a sickly patient at Newton Medical Center earlier this year against Gruchacz\u2019s wishes.", "card": "summary", "title": "Social services director sues county officials, alleges retaliation, solar cover-up"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1505744343029908}, "__sync_contentCategory": "Metered", "keywords": "Social services director sues county officials, alleges retaliation, solar cover-up, News,, News,", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": 20150808224122, "modified_time": 201508112241}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Phone and voicemail messages left for Gruchacz, Williams, and the other freeholders were not returned, and an attempt to reach Eskilson was unsuccessful.\nThe three freeholders and Gruchacz are all named in the lawsuit as defendants, as are County Counsel John Williams and former County Administrator John Eskilson.\nHer complaint alleges that ever since then, Novrit has been treated by Gruchacz \"with disdain\" and been the victim of a hostile work environment.\n\"There has been widespread criticism of the three Freeholders who supported the (solar) settlement,\" the complaint states.\nNovrit declined to comment for this story and has advised that all inquiries should be directed to Daggett, who also declined further comment."}
