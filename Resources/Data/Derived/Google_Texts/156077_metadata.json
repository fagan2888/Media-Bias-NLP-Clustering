(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\n4125102\n\nConnect for Health Colorado, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange under Obamacare, is lowering its own expectations of how many people will enroll in the program.\n\nThis has lead its CEO to ask for a fee hike to prevent what she described as dramatic budget cuts.\n\nOptimistic projections originally had as many as 204,000 people enrolling through Connect for Health Colorado by the end of March. But as noted by the website Health News Colorado, only about 90,000 have signed up so far.\n\nThe organization now expects a mere 152,000 to enroll through early next year \u2014 far too few to fund its $26 million annual budget.\n\nWithout increasing fees on those who buy health insurance through the website to make up for the shortfall, CEO Patty Fontneau told the board of directors it would be difficult to make it self-sustaining.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure the board understands how dramatic our expense cuts are going to be to hit $26 million [in annual operating costs],\u201d Health News Colorado quoted Fontneau as saying.\n\nShe requested that the user fee of 1.4 percent be increased to 1.7 percent, which she said would raise an additional $2 million.\n\nThe exchange has already cost $177 million in federal money to get up and running. It\u2019s required to be self-sufficient by next year.\n\nBoard members shot down the request, telling Fontneau the solution wasn\u2019t to make health insurance more expensive, but to cut costs.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just say, \u2018Let\u2019s raise the administrative fees because that covers our backside,\u2019\u201d said board member Dr. Mike Fallon. \u201cI know that\u2019s the easy way out. But it\u2019s more fiscally responsible to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to downsize if need be.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdding to the pressure is President Obama\u2019s announcement last week extending the deadline for some plans to roll over to Affordable Care Act compliance until 2016. Fontneau worries that will continue to depress the number of people willing to sign up for health care through the exchange.\n\n\u201cWe were absolutely hit by many plans offering early renewals to their customers,\u201d Health News Colorado quoted Fontneau as saying. \u201cWe were anticipating picking up those individuals and families at the end of this year.\u201d\n\nAll but one of the board members voted to reject the fee hike.\n\nFontneau raised hackles last year by requesting a pay raise and a bonus, even as the Colorado exchange failed to meet even its worst-case scenario goals by December. She eventually withdrew the request.\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
