Since he took office, there have been more than a dozen mass shootings in America.\n\nHe and Vice President Joe Biden made a concerted push for broad gun control reforms after the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting of young children that shocked the country, but they were unsuccessful.\n\nObama has blamed the National Rifle Association (NRA) for that failure, which he has called one of the biggest frustrations of his time in office.\n\nDemocratic and Republican lawmakers alike offered thoughts and prayers for the victims and family members of the Oregon massacre on Thursday, but a visibly upset Obama said that was not sufficient.\n\n\"We've become numb to this,\" he said.\n\nNodding to the arguments that such shootings are often committed by the mentally ill, Obama said it was clear that anyone who commits such crimes had a \"sickness in their minds.\"\n\n\"But we are not the only country on Earth who has people with mental illnesses who want to do harm to other people,\" he said. \"We are the only advanced country on Earth who sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.\"\n\nThe president referenced shootings in Australia and Britain that led to reforms that largely stopped such massacres there.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution guarantees Americans the right to bear arms, a cherished freedom that has great resonance with many voters. Obama, however, said it did not make sense to argue that the Constitution prevented sensible reforms.\n\nAfter the Newtown massacre the president proposed more background checks for gun sales and pushed to ban more types of military-style assault weapons, but he failed to convince enough lawmakers to support the restrictions.\n\nObama exhorted gun owners to question whether the gun lobby represented their views. He did not mention the NRA by name, but his comments were clearly directed at that group, which has broad political influence in Washington.\n\n\u201cThink about whether your views are properly being represented by the organization that suggests it is speaking for you,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for the NRA declined comment, saying it was the group's policy \"not to comment until all the facts are known.\"\n\nObama spoke mainly without notes, anticipating the arguments gun advocates would brandish in the wake of the shooting. He said he knew his opponents would criticize him for politicizing a tragedy.\n\n\u201cThis is something we should politicize,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives.\"\n\nObama said he would continue to press for reform every time such a shooting takes place until he leaves office in 2017. But the White House has made clear that it was unlikely to attempt another broad push on gun control through the Republican-led Congress.\n\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday angrily said America had mad", "title": "After shooting, angry Obama blasts U.S. gun politics", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/01/Obama-says-US-gun-laws-must-be-changed-gun-owners-must-speak", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-shootings-oregon_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/01/Obama-says-US-gun-laws-must-be-changed-gun-owners-must-speak", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-shootings-oregon_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday angrily said America had mad", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce99f\"", "article_summary": "Since he took office, there have been more than a dozen mass shootings in America.\nObama exhorted gun owners to question whether the gun lobby represented their views.\n\"We are the only advanced country on Earth who sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.\"\nBut the White House has made clear that it was unlikely to attempt another broad push on gun control through the Republican-led Congress.\nObama spoke mainly without notes, anticipating the arguments gun advocates would brandish in the wake of the shooting."}
