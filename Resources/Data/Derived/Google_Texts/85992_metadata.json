It took me like five swipes,\" she said. \"Fix the turnstiles.\"\n\n\"We'll get right on it,\" de Blasio said. \"Absolutely.\"\n\nNeither mentioned that the only reason Clinton was in the subway was because Bernie Sanders, her rival for the Democratic nomination, mistakenly said in a Daily News interview that he used a token to ride a subway last year. Tokens were discontinued in 2003.\n\n\n\n\"Well, you are my second-favorite guy named Bill,\" Clinton told the mayor.\n\n\n\n\"Thank you very much. I got your back,\" he said.\n\nThen Odom spoke up: \"Do not forget to vote in the New York State primary.\"\n\n\"Thanks so much,\" Clinton said. \"But please can somebody get me tickets to 'Hamilton'?\"\n\nSanders already has bested her on the \"Hamilton\" front. He took his wife, Jane, to see the musical on Friday night.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Bernie Sanders won Wyoming but still split the delegates with Hillary Clinton", "Description": "Ted Cruz amassed more delegates over the weekend in his quest for the Republican presidential nomination.
