That might be because the neighborhood is a microcosm of the nation: diverse, young and brimming with optimism.\n\nLed by a contingent from the Colorado National Guard, the parade included about 700 participants and about 5,000 spectators. Even after years of growth, the parade maintains its neighborhood feel.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s ours,\u201d said Pat Comeaux, 61, who has lived in Park Hill for 14 years and was joined at the parade by her 11-year-old beagle, Parker. \u201cIt\u2019s just a wonderful community that\u2019s very diverse, and I think because of our diversity we\u2019re always trying to meet and greet our neighbors.\u201d\n\nQuentin Burrell, 46, was at the parade with his wife and two children, back in the neighborhood in which he was raised, and where his mother still lives.\n\n\u201cIt makes it seem like it\u2019s a small town parade in a big city,\u201d he said, as his children sat on the curb, blowing bubbles into the summer breeze.\n\nThe parade included all the mainstays, from candidates for office and vintage automobiles to candy flung from the back of trucks for gleeful children. It also had local flair, like the karate group from Tiger Kim\u2019s Academy who chopped wooden boards with their hands and feet.\n\n\u201cJust showing what we can do and passing the boards out to the people is really cool,\u201d said Petros Petrides, 11, of Denver. For him and his brother Angelo, 9, putting on a show for a patriotic crowd is good practice \u2014 they hope to go to the Olympics someday, they said.\n\nThe candy-tossing damsels of Miss Colorado\u2019s Miss American Coed Pageants were among the most popular participants.\n\n\u201cAll the kids get excited to see the queens,\u201d said Aubrey Kerr, 19, who said it was her first parade. That she had a 5-ound bag of candy with her doubtless contributed to the warm welcome.\n\nMatthew Nussbaum: 303-954-1666, mnussbaum@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/MatthewNussbaum", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver\u2019s Park Hill Independence Day parade draws big crowds", "title": "Denver\u2019s Park Hill Independence Day parade draws big crowds", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/04/denvers-park-hill-independence-day-parade-draws-big-crowds/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150704_042050_park-hill-parade.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150704_042050_park-hill-parade.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-04T16:14:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T14:57:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Led by a contingent from the Colorado National Guard, the parade included about 700 participants and about 5,000 spectators.\nThe Park Hill Fourth of July Parade, held for the sixth time Saturday, is fast becoming a local institution.\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s ours,\u201d said Pat Comeaux, 61, who has lived in Park Hill for 14 years and was joined at the parade by her 11-year-old beagle, Parker.\nThe parade included all the mainstays, from candidates for office and vintage automobiles to candy flung from the back of trucks for gleeful children.\nThe candy-tossing damsels of Miss Colorado\u2019s Miss American Coed Pageants were among the most popular participants."}
