It's the latest in a long-line of snappy - but deadly - political abbreviations, writes Taylor Kate Brown.\n\nTaxes on large inheritances were not an issue for many Americans until a Republican pollster tied the policy to the most human experience of them all - death. \"The 'death tax' doesn't tax death,\" says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. \"But we're all going to die - even though the estate tax doesn't apply to many people.\"\n\nEven so, \"death tax\" (or \"estate tax\" depending how you feel about it) is a prime American example of linguistic framing. By describing policies using pre-existing negative associations, Dr Jamieson says, voters are more likely to oppose it than they would otherwise.\n\nIn 1995, proponents of a ban on a medical procedure known as intact dilation and extraction pulled off a rhetorical coup by dubbing it \"partial-birth abortion\". Opponents of the ban argued \"partial birth\" wasn't medically accurate, but it was hard to explain why it didn't fit the description of the procedure in everyday language - despite being politically charged. \"Anytime you have ordinary language competing with technical language, ordinary language will win out,\" Dr Jamieson says.\n\nThere was Republican President George W Bush's \"personal savings accounts\" versus Democrats' \"privatisation of Social Security\" (the Democrats won that one). And the \"assault weapons ban\" which banned only some firearms that weren't already banned. Or in the UK, the oft-discussed \"bedroom tax\" or \"spare room subsidy\". Such framing is rarely done to convince opposing ideologues. Campaigns or parties find an issue they dislike and use framing to rile up opposition.\n\nImage caption \"Personal savings accounts\" versus \"privatisation\"\n\nImage caption Palin's \"death panels\" caused a stir\n\nBrendan Nyhan of Dartmouth College says Sarah Palin's Facebook post on an end-of-life provision of President Barack Obama's healthcare law - or in Ms Palin's parlance, \"death panels\" - has \"crystallised the opposition to the Affordable Care Act and affected the debate\". It co-ordinates the message among allies, he says.\n\nMichael Bronstein, a Democratic strategist, agrees. He has a warning for candidates hit by this kind of messaging. \"Don't ever speak those words\". By even saying them, even in jest, \"you've adopted that position\".\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#bb1919", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1", "description": "The art of crafting political poison to torpedo the opponent's message.", "application-name": "BBC News", "og": {"site_name": "BBC News", "description": "The art of crafting political poison to torpedo the opponent's message.", "title": "The art of the deadly political abbreviation - BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/78967000/jpg/_78967395_71157058.jpg", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-29959647", "article": {"section": "Magazine Monitor", "author": "BBC News"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.bbc.com", "description": "The art of crafting political poison to torpedo the opponent's message.", "creator": "@BBCWorld", "image": {"src": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/560/media/images/78967000/jpg/_78967395_71157058.jpg", "alt": "A member of College Republicans National Committee dresses as Grim Reaper as he marches on Capitol Hill to call on the Senate to eliminate the death tax June 8, 2006 in Washington, DC"}, "title": "The art of the deadly political abbreviation - BBC News", "site": "@BBCWorld", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "BBC News", "x-country": "us", "x-audience": "US", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "fb": {"admins": 100004154058350}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static.bbci.co.uk/news/1.127.053/windows-eight-icon-144x144.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "US", "theme-color": "#bb1919"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9bf2\"", "article_summary": "\"The 'death tax' doesn't tax death,\" says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center.\nEven so, \"death tax\" (or \"estate tax\" depending how you feel about it) is a prime American example of linguistic framing.\nIt's the latest in a long-line of snappy - but deadly - political abbreviations, writes Taylor Kate Brown.\n\"Anytime you have ordinary language competing with technical language, ordinary language will win out,\" Dr Jamieson says.\nThere was Republican President George W Bush's \"personal savings accounts\" versus Democrats' \"privatisation of Social Security\" (the Democrats won that one)."}
