OK, they weren't the real Marvel heroes, but the Hollywood Boulevard impersonators. What's the difference, you ask? Well, the Hollywood Boulevard Spider-Man wears red Chuck Taylors and has a blue toy gun tucked into his waistband. You never saw Tobey Maguire or Andrew Lincoln packing heat.\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood Backlot moments\n\nIt looked like a totally lopsided competition at first, but little Mia quickly smoked her competition, answering such questions as \"What is Captain America's shield made of?\" and \"Name a member of Spider-Man's enemy group, the Sinister Six.\" What made it even more impressive is that not even Hollywood Boulevard Spider-Man could name a member of the Sinister Six.\n\nFinal tally: Mia Grace: 9. Marvel heroes: 0.\n\nMia's prize? Her very own Captain America shield emblazoned with the words \"Captain Mia.\" She also got a trip to Disneyland (she's a kid, after all).\n\nALSO:\n\nGeorge Will joins Fox News as contributor\n\nJimmy Kimmel: Do you prefer Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act?\n\nGovernment shutdown: Does no FCC mean nudity, f-bombs on networks?\n\n\n\n\n\nPHOTOS, VIDEOS & MORE: PHOTOS: TV shows and their spinoffs Overrated/Underrated 2014 PHOTOS: 101 best-written TV shows of all time", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Jimmy Kimmel quizzes a 4-year-old Marvel expert", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Fresh off his \"Obamacare vs. Affordable Care Act\" triumph earlier in the week, Jimmy Kimmel went considerably softer and cuddlier Tuesday night with his interview with 4-year-old Marvel superheroes expert Mia Grace.", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel quizzes a 4-year-old Marvel expert", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-late-night-jimmy-kimmel-marvel-20131002-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-524c59dc/turbine/la-et-st-late-night-jimmy-kimmel-marvel-20131002", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "jimmy kimmel, marvel, mia grace", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/77635465", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2013-10-02", "Description": "Jimmy Kimmel interviews 4-year-old Marvel superheroes expert Mia Grace.
