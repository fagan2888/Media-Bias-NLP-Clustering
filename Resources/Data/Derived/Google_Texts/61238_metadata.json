It's titled \"All You Need to Know..is that Ezra Klein's Vox is nothing special.\" Taranto argues that \"explanatory journalism\" has been around for decades -- a category of the Pulitzer Prize since 1985 -- and this is just the latest way liberals have packaged their editorializing.

Many of them work for more conventional outlets, including Klein's former employer, The Washington Post.\n\nA few years ago the Associated Press introducted \"accountability journalism,\" which turned out to be a fancy term for opinion masquerading as straight news (see Presswatch, TAS, September 2007). \"Fact checking\" used to mean reportorial due diligence, butr now refers to opinion pieces with a pretense of objective authority (see Presswatch, TAS, December 2008/January 2009). \"Explanatory journalism\" looks to be more of the same -- a new package containing the same old liberal product.\n\nPS: You may also want to check out the June issue for a debate between two Team MRC veterans -- former CNSNews reporter Matt Cover and former NewsBusters contributing editor Lachlan Markay.
