As the city calmed down, she pointed to issues that have plagued Charm City for years, such as violence, drug abuse and poverty, as problems public health can play a role in solving.\n\n\"We have to make the case that actually, everything comes back to health,\" Wen told NPR in May. \"My hope is that we can really make Baltimore into a model for the rest of the country to follow when it comes to treating the core roots of our problems.\"\n\nWen described the frustration of treating health problems \"at the very end,\" treating victims of gun violence or drug overdoses in the hospital repeatedly rather than addressing the factors that land them there. In heavily-populated states such as California, this cycle comes with a huge price tag for hospitals, due to both chronic admissions and the victims' tendency to be uninsured, FierceHealthFinance previously reported. Baltimore's low-income areas also suffer from massive unemployment, which is the top socioeconomic determinant of readmissions.\n\nAmid both a surge in Baltimore homicides and a dramatic increase in opioid abuse nationwide, Wen is urging the city's public health officials to seize the opportunity to develop innovative solutions, especially with the city in the spotlight. Hospitals and other providers are often community anchors, Wen wrote in May, and can drive employment and investment in depressed areas, FierceHealthcare previously reported. Furthermore, she wrote, recent hospital payment reforms in Maryland put hospitals in an ideal position to cut disparities.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the first article\n\n- read the second article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHow Baltimore hospitals can reduce disparities\n\nCA hospitals have huge tab for treating gunfire victims\n\nOpioid ODs caused 100k ER visits in 2010\n\nEmployment status top socioeconomic factor in readmissions\n\nHow healthcare leaders can make it clear that black lives matter", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the dust settles from unrest in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray, the city's health commissioner believes improved public health may help improve its social and economic problems.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As the dust settles from unrest in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray, the city's health commissioner believes improved public health may help improve its social and economic problems.", "title": "Why health infrastructure is key to improving Baltimore's socioeconomic problems", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/why-health-infrastructure-key-improving-baltimores-socioeconomic-problems/2015-08-10", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Baltimore,Care Delivery,Health Disparities,Hospital Shootings,income inequality,low-income patients,Patient Care & Outcomes,poverty,public health,sociodemographic factors", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc965f\"", "article_summary": "\"We have to make the case that actually, everything comes back to health,\" Wen told NPR in May.\nAs the dust settles from unrest in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray, the city's health commissioner believes improved public health may help improve its social and economic problems, according to National Public Radio.\nAs the city calmed down, she pointed to issues that have plagued Charm City for years, such as violence, drug abuse and poverty, as problems public health can play a role in solving.\nWen described the frustration of treating health problems \"at the very end,\" treating victims of gun violence or drug overdoses in the hospital repeatedly rather than addressing the factors that land them there.\nBaltimore's low-income areas also suffer from massive unemployment, which is the top socioeconomic determinant of readmissions."}
