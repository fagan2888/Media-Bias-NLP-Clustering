Fifty-seven percent of Hispanics in the state of Colorado disapprove of Obamacare, according to a poll released Tuesday by the Democratic-leaning firm Public Policy Polling.

Hispanic disapproval of President Obama’s health care reform law topped white disapproval by five points. Only 36 percent of Hispanics in the state approve of Obamacare.

Obama took 75 percent of the Hispanic vote in Colorado in the 2012 election, prior to the Obamacare rollout, according to exit polls.

Across all races, Obama logged a 43 percent approval rating in the Colorado poll compared to a 53 percent disapproval rating.

51 percent of Coloradans disapprove of Obamacare while only 39 percent approve. Likewise, a 42 percent plurality characterized Obamacare implementation so far as “very unsuccessful.”

The margin of error for the poll is 4.1 percent.
