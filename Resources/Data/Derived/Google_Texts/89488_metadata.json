The red tape and recordkeeping, he and his staff claim, would make financial planning for retirement too expensive for the middle class and push out small business owners, InvestmentNews writes.\n\nIndeed, a recent survey of financial advisors by Fidelity found that 73% are worried the rule will hurt their business, although more than half said they\u2019ll wait for the rule to come out before making any substantial changes to their businesses, according to a press release from the company.\n\nBut while Ryan would likely go after the rule as part of his platform to reduce regulatory burdens in general, InvestmentNews writes that the Speaker receives a substantial amount of his contributions from the industries the rule will regulate.\n\nOf the $4.6 million Ryan has raised for his personal campaign, the securities and investment industry contributed $419,812 while the insurance industry gave him $212,725, according to Center for Responsive Politics data cited by InvestmentNews.\n\nAnd the financial and insurance sectors are the first and third largest contributors in Ryan\u2019s $1.6 million political action committee, the publication writes.", "article_metadata": {"WT.z_pageid": 2, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1097851332, app-argument=mm-financialadvisoriq://c/1314673/147503/paul_ryan_throws_weight_into_debate?referrer_module=smartBanner", "mm": {"media_code": "faiq"}, "DCSext.user_title": "not set", "DCSext.user_email": "not set", "site_id": 13, "og": {"site_name": "Financial Advisor IQ", "description": "The House Speaker\u2019s blog calls rule \u201cObamacare for financial planning.\u201d", "title": "Paul Ryan Throws His Weight Into the DOL Debate", "url": {"email_verification": "https://financialadvisoriq.com/user/trial/send-verification-email/:memberId", "home": "https://financialadvisoriq.com", "signup": "https://financialadvisoriq.com/user/trial", "pwreset": "https://financialadvisoriq.com/user/password"}, "image": "http://financialadvisoriq.com/images/linkedin-logo.gif", "singup_text": "Sign Up", "logo": "https://financialadvisoriq.com/images/sso-logo.png", "type": "article"}, "DCS.dcsaut": "User ID: not set not set not set", "server": "ec2web-1", "DCSext.user_dept": "not set", "WT.co_d": "not set not set", "version": "35.840.8", "DCSext.user_name": "not set not set", "DCSext.serv_type": "Unregistered", "DCSext.user_id": "not set", "DCSext.user_role": "not set", "WT.site": "FinancialAdvisorIQ", "DCSext.cn": "not set", "viewport": "width=990, user-scalable=yes", "WT.sv": "not set"}, "article_summary": "March 15, 2016Critics of the Department of Labor\u2019s fiduciary rule, expected to come out within weeks, have a new leader, InvestmentNews writes.\nFrom Feb. 22 to March 7, his staff or Ryan himself have spoken or written about the rule five times, InvestmentNews says.\nIn one blog post, a staffer called the Barack Obama-supported rule \u201cObamacare for financial planning,\u201d according to the publication.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has become a major force in the opposition to the rule designed to force brokers handling retirement accounts to hold client interests first, according to the publication.\nAnd the financial and insurance sectors are the first and third largest contributors in Ryan\u2019s $1.6 million political action committee, the publication writes."}
