And Alderman Coleen Burrus, 9th Ward, said she was prepared to vote against the contract award on that issue.\n\nA similar suit by Hobby Lobby led to a Supreme Court decision on a 5-4 vote last year that family-owned companies could refuse to provide such coverage if the owners claimed to provide the coverage would violate their religious beliefs.\n\nOzinga operates the only concrete plant in Evanston and has frequently received city contracts under provisions of city contracting rules that provide a preference for local vendors.\n\nThe zoning variation request for the new concrete plant is scheduled to be reviewed by the city's Design and Project Review Committee Wednesday afternoon and then will be heard by the Zoning Board of Appeals.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Ozinga Ready Mix, a concrete firm that's come under fire from some Evanston aldermen for suing to challenge provisions of the affordable care act, is seeking city approval to expand its Evanston plant.", "description": "Ozinga Ready Mix, a concrete firm that's come under fire from some Evanston aldermen for suing to challenge provisions of the affordable care act, is seeking city approval to expand its Evanston plant.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"site_name": "Evanston Now", "description": "Ozinga Ready Mix, a concrete firm that's come under fire from some Evanston aldermen for suing to challenge provisions of the affordable care act, is seeking city approval to expand its Evanston plant.", "title": "Concrete firm seeks taller plant on Oakton", "url": "http://evanstonnow.com/story/government/bill-smith/2015-08-03/71621/concrete-firm-seeks-taller-plant-on-oakton", "image": "http://evanstonnow.com/files/ozinga-2525-oakton-google-earth.png", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.date": "2015-08-03T09:50-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://evanstonnow.com/story/government/bill-smith/2015-08-03/71621/concrete-firm-seeks-taller-plant-on-oakton", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "dcterms.creator": "Bill Smith", "MobileOptimized": "width", "dcterms.language": "en-US", "dcterms.type": "Text", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "dcterms.title": "Concrete firm seeks taller plant on Oakton"}, "article_summary": "But he says the new building will have to be 68-feet tall, eight feet taller than permitted under the city's zoning for the site.\nOzinga Ready Mix, a concrete firm that's come under fire from some Evanston aldermen for suing to challenge provisions of the affordable care act, is seeking city approval to expand its Evanston plant.\nOzinga operates the only concrete plant in Evanston and has frequently received city contracts under provisions of city contracting rules that provide a preference for local vendors.\nThe zoning variation request for the new concrete plant is scheduled to be reviewed by the city's Design and Project Review Committee Wednesday afternoon and then will be heard by the Zoning Board of Appeals.\nAnd Alderman Coleen Burrus, 9th Ward, said she was prepared to vote against the contract award on that issue."}
