Can he recover? Spring 2014 will let us know\u2026 Christie: All the 2016 speculation isn\u2019t helping Obama\u2026 Extraordinary: Senate GOP filibusters against Obama\u2019s judicial picks have reached a new level of DC obstruction\u2026 And here\u2019s Alan Simpson on Liz Cheney: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like she\u2019ll do anything to win this race.\u201d\n\nA Wall Street sign is pictured outside the New York Stock Exchange in New York, October 28, 2013.\n\n*** Wall Street vs. Main Street: As yesterday proved, it\u2019s been the best of times for Wall Street. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared -- for the first time ever -- above 16,000 before falling back down below that mark. But while Wall Street is rolling, the same isn\u2019t necessarily true for Main Street or any other street. The unemployment rate stands at a high 7.3%; 46.5 million Americans are living at or below the poverty line; and long-term unemployment is up 213% since 2007, as the New York Times has noted. On top of it all, the 1% of U.S. earners made up 19.3% of all household income in 2012. As we\u2019ve written before, it\u2019s the Great American Disconnect: The folks at the top, especially those who work in finance are doing great; the folks who aren\u2019t at the top aren\u2019t doing as well. And make no mistake, this will have an impact on American politics -- in 2014, 2016, and possibly beyond. That was the essential point that Noam Scheiber made in his piece on Elizabeth Warren possibly challenging Hillary in 2016. It\u2019s not that Warren could really beat Clinton (or might even run against her); rather, it\u2019s hard to be a Democrat these days running as Wall Street\u2019s best friend.\n\n*** JPMorgan Chase agrees to $13 billion settlement: Given this Great Disconnect, this news is noteworthy: \u201cJPMorgan Chase and the Department of Justice are near final agreement on a record $13 billion settlement over problem mortgage securities, and could publicly announce the deal as early as Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the negotiations,\u201d USA Today writes. \u201cThe nation's largest bank late last week agreed to take responsibility for problems with mortgage securities marketed by Washington Mutual, the failed bank JPMorgan acquired in 2008 during the financial crisis, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.\u201d How much of this money will make it to Main Street? That\u2019s going to be the challenge for the federal government; is this settlement used to help those impacted the most?\n\n*** Can Obama recover? Another day, another poll -- this time from the Washington Post/ABC -- showing President Obama hitting all-time low in approval, at 42%. (Of course, it\u2019s worth noting that our NBC/WSJ poll released in late October showed the president reaching 42%, so this has been going on for the past three weeks.) As NBC/WSJ co-pollster Bill McInturff (R) has emailed clients, history shows that it\u2019s difficult for presidents to recover from nosedives like this. And if that\u2019s true, Obama will be a liability in 2014, period. But it will be important to see where Obama\u2019s approval rating is come Spring 2014, assuming the health-care website gets fixed and the Affordable Care Act rollout becomes a distant memory. Barring something unforeseen, these next two months are perhaps the president\u2019s last shot at getting right before the midterms. He needs a working webssite and a State of the Union that somehow instills some hope that he\u2019s up to the job as a leader. How the public responds will tell us if Obama will be able to recover in time for the midterms.\n\n*** Christie: 2016 speculation isn\u2019t helping Obama: We found this comment from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at yesterday\u2019s Wall Street Journal CEO Council to be particularly interesting given Obama\u2019s declining numbers: All the 2016 speculation \u2013 this early \u2013 isn\u2019t helping the president. \"We're three years away from the presidential election. In this sense, I feel bad for President Obama,\" Christie said, per the Wall Street Journal. \"He just won a year ago, and everybody's like, 'Who's next?' There is work to be done in this country. As we shove him out the door, we minimize his ability to be an effective executive. We shouldn't do that.\" While we haven\u2019t had enough examples to make this observation statistically relevant, it\u2019s hard not to wonder if the interest in 2016 from readers/viewers/editors/reporters is somehow correlated with the president\u2019s job rating slide. Obama today speaks at the same Wall Street Journal CEO Council meeting at 3:15 pm ET in DC.\n\n*** Extraordinary: Folks, we\u2019ve moved beyond the Miguel Estrada and Janice Rogers Brown judicial battles during the Bush years, when Senate Democrats filibustered those nominations due to concerns about ideology and qualifications. Now Senate Republicans are filibustering Obama\u2019s judicial picks not based on concerns about ideology or qualifications -- but rather Obama\u2019s ability to make ANY pick to fill the D.C. Circuit. Their arguments have varied from either: \u201cThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s caseload is small,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s important not to change the court\u2019s ideological balance,\u201d or \u201cWe need to focus on Obamacare instead!\u201d Per NBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt, Senate Republicans yesterday blocked a fourth nominee to the key court -- Robert Wilkins -- on a 53-38 vote; he needed 60 votes to advance. In the past, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has said that he\u2019d resort to filibusters if \u201cextraordinary conditions\u201d exist. But the only thing that\u2019s extraordinary here is the level of obstruction Senate Republicans are waging against up-or-down votes. The pressure on Harry Reid by some base Democrats to change the rules is ramping up again. And it seems like Republicans are daring them to do it. Of course, Republicans also believe the public doesn\u2019t care and won\u2019t punish them for this, especially now given the president\u2019s current approval rating.\n\n*** Alan Simpson on Liz Cheney:\u201cIt\u2019s almost like she\u2019ll do anything to win this race\u201d: Finally, the Liz Cheney vs. Mary Cheney spat is not going away anytime soon. Don\u2019t miss what former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-WY) told one us: \u201cYou\u2019re not even destroying friendships -- you\u2019re destroying family relationships just because of this race,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for all of us who know the Cheneys to see the things she\u2019s doing to win this race. It\u2019s almost like she\u2019ll do anything to win this race, because I cannot ever believe that there would be a breach between she and Mary.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt this story has created drama, but ask yourself: Are Wyoming voters interested in drama? Overall, this entire episode feels like a big net-negative for Liz\u2019s campaign.\n\nhttp://is.gd/ccxyrR%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\">Click here to sign up for First Read emails.\n\nText FIRST to 622639, to sign up for First Read alerts to your mobile phone.\n\nCheck us out on http://is.gd/TzuR1b%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\">Facebook and also on http://is.gd/hkhSDT%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\">Twitter.
