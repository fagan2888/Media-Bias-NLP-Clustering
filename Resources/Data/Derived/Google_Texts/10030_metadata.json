There\u2019s about to be a new conservative group in town.\n\nJust two months after the 172-member organization elected Rep. Bill Flores of Texas as its new chairman, a group of nine lawmakers decided to split from the RSC and form its own conservative caucus.\n\nThe group doesn\u2019t yet have a name, but it will be led by former RSC Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio and Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador of Idaho. The other seven founding members are Reps. Justin Amash of Michigan, Ron DeSantis of Florida, John Fleming of Louisiana, Scott Garrett of New Jersey, Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Matt Salmon of Arizona.\n\nMore than three dozen lawmakers have an interest in joining.\n\nFlores beat out Mulvaney and Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert for the RSC chairmanship. Flores\u2019 election, though, sparked concerns that he would side with House leadership on policy issues and debates.\n\nDespite the formation of a new conservative group, Flores remains confident that the RSC is remaining true to its core conservative values.\n\n\u201cI am committed to working with all House conservatives, and all Republican Study Committee members, who believe in limited government and advancing liberty,\u201d he said in a statement to The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cI am committed to working with all House conservatives, and all Republican Study Committee members, who believe in limited government and advancing liberty,\u201d says @RepBillFlores\n\n\u201cOver the next Congress, there will be healthy debates about how to best achieve those goals, and the Republican Study Committee will play a critical role in fostering those debates to develop conservative solutions that address our nation\u2019s most pressing issues,\u201d Flores continued.\n\nA Republican congressional aide told The Daily Signal the new group is not intended to be anti-RSC. Instead, the organization\u2019s founding members are looking to create a caucus of conservative lawmakers to draft and push conservative legislation.\n\nIn recent years, the RSC\u2019s conservative members have voiced concerns that the group drifted from the conservative roots it was founded on in 1973. Additionally, membership has swelled to more than 170 lawmakers\u2014more than half of all Republican lawmakers.\n\nRSC members pay $2,500 in dues to join and $5,000 in subsequent years.\n\nBy contrast, membership in the new group will be by invitation only in an effort to maintain the integrity of the organization, the Republican congressional aide said. Lawmakers invited will be required to pay dues, allowing members to hire three to four staff members.\n\nThe group also plans to hold a retreat.\n\nDiscussions about the possible formation of a new conservative group began around Flores\u2019 election to the chairmanship, a second GOP staffer told The Daily Signal in an interview. However, his election didn\u2019t serve as the trigger for its creation.\n\n\u201c[Lawmakers were] trying to look at something that would get back to the original intent of what the RSC had in mind: a conservative check on leadership\u2019s agenda and a positive conservative agenda to put in place,\u201d the second staffer said.\n\nSince then, the organization\u2019s founding members have met several times and have had discussions with former RSC members who understood the original intent of the conservative group.\n\n\u201cThe notion is that conservatives need to be at the table in the discussion,\u201d the second GOP staffer said. \u201cThey need to have that check-valid role so when leadership sets the agenda, a group can say they endorse it or offer an alternative that reflects the true nature of the group.\u201d\n\nReports suggest that members met with conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas over pizza on Tuesday night to discuss the new group. However, Cruz\u2019s office told The Daily Signal the senator frequently holds gatherings to discuss issues that are important to conservatives.\n\n\u201cThe notion is that conservatives need to be at the table in the discussion,\u201d the second GOP staffer said. \u201cThey need to have that check-valid role so when leadership sets the agenda, a group can say they endorse it or offer an alternative that reflects the true nature of the group.\u201d\n\nLawmakers joining the new group can remain members of the RSC, and not all plan to relinquish their membership, the first Republican congressional aide said.\n\nIn addition to taking issue with the direction of the RSC, the aide said the committee is no longer an asset for policy analysis.\n\nHowever, an RSC aide told The Daily Signal the committee provides an analysis of every bill and offers a bevy of resources for members. Additionally, the RSC aide said, the analysis often runs contrary to the positions of House leadership and the Appropriations Committee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on our positive agenda at the RSC, and I think the RSC has done a lot to advance a conservative agenda in the House over the last several years,\u201d the RSC aide said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue doing that.\u201d\n\nThe RSC aide said the committee proposed strong reforms to the budget over the last two years that were later picked up by leadership and the Republican conference. Additionally, the RSC proposed a health care reform package that repealed Obamacare and implemented a number of patient-centered reforms. The RSC aide said House leadership disagreed with the legislation, but it ultimately garnered 133 cosponsors.\n\n\u201cIt was fiscally responsible and true to our principles,\u201d the RSC aide said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t waiting for a green light to do that. Members wanted to do that. \u2026 That sort of product is key to our core principles.\u201d\n\nRep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., and others founded the RSC in 1973 to promote and advocate for conservative policies. Ed Feulner, former president of The Heritage Foundation, served as its first executive director.\n\nIn an op-ed for The Daily Caller in 2011, Feulner contended that the RSC doesn\u2019t exist to facilitate compromise between Republicans. Instead, he said the group serves to promote conservative principles and fulfill \u201cthe mission that brought [lawmakers] to Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince its founding, the RSC has never relished bucking party leadership, but it has never shied away from it either,\u201d Feulner wrote. \u201cAs one member noted in the earliest days, \u2018We exist to bring pressure from the right on the leadership. If we don\u2019t do that, the only pressure will be from the left, and policies will inevitably move in that direction.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Move over Republican Study Committee.
