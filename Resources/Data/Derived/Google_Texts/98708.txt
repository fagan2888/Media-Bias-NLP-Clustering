Twelve-year-old Michaela Hallamore suffers from scoliosis, a painful condition resulting from curvature of the spine.

A young girl from the African country of Zimbabwe is in Oklahoma City preparing for a delicate surgery on her spine.

Twelve-year-old Michaela Hallamore suffers from scoliosis, a painful condition resulting from curvature of the spine.



Local Radiologist Byron Christie heard about the girl when he was on a safari in Zimbabwe a few years ago. Christie says several local medical professionals have donated money and services to ensure the surgery this Friday is a success.

"People have stepped up to a tremendous degree," he said.

Michaela says she is "nervous" about the surgery, but she has fallen in love with the food here in Oklahoma, and the snow. She and her family flew into OKC a few weeks ago, and are staying with Dr. Christie's family.

Christie says the surgery should alleviate pain, and ensure her spine grows the right way. She will have to wear a brace for six months.

Her parents say they have been heartened by all the generosity shown by Oklahomans who have stepped up to help.
