Even with Obamacare, there are still many women with no health insurance in Florida -- women who will mostly likely skip a screening mammogram so they can spend the money on something frivolous.

Like food and rent.

So through a partnership between the faith-based nonprofit Shepherd's Hope and the for-profit Sand Lake Imaging, women who undergo a screening mammogram at either of Sand Lake's two locations can -- at no charge to them -- donate the procedure to a woman in need.

But to do that, they must switch to Sand Lake Imaging and be screened during the month of October. Then the second screening mammogram will go to an uninsured Shepherd's Hope patient.

"Screening mammography has been instrumental in decreasing the death rate from breast cancer by 30 percent since 1990," said Dr. Robert Posniak, who works at Sand Lake. "Participating in the 'Get a Mammogram, Give a Mammogram' program can save someone's life."

Marni Stalhman, CEO & President of Shepherdâ€™s Hope, said a similar campaign last year resulted in over 100 free mobile mammograms-- a few of which detected cancer.
