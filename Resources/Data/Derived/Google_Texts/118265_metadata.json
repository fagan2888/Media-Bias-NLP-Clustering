That\u2019s why the Federal Air Marshal Service is a critical last line of defense, transportation security officials say.\n\nOne leading congressional critic, however, argues that the Federal Air Marshal Service is an outdated and inefficient law enforcement program that needs to be grounded.\n\nRep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., told The Daily Signal that any security benefits fail to justify the cost, currently about $820 million a year.\n\n\u201cI think the air marshal program is the most needless, wasteful program within the entire government,\u201d Duncan said.\n\nBut in an exclusive interview with The Daily Signal, Roderick Allison, director of the service, argued that air marshals make up \u201ca very rapid, very quick deployable force to combat aviation threats.\u201d\n\nThe agents, Allison said, provide a service \u201cthat no one else can.\u201d\n\nRelaunched after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Federal Air Marshal Service places armed, undercover officers onboard domestic and international flights. Details of the program within the Transportation Security Administration remain classified, although the number of agents ballooned from 33 before 9/11 to more than 4,000 today.\n\nDuncan pointed to other increased security measures\u2014stricter passenger screening and reinforced cockpit doors among them\u2014and concludes the air marshal program \u201cis just one agency you don\u2019t need at all.\u201d\n\nLocked doors are the best onboard security measure, said Duncan, a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Despite the 9/11 attacks and thwarted terrorist plots involving airlines, he said, threats to aviation have been overplayed.\n\n\u201cThere are so many other more attractive targets for terrorists,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cWe need to take this money and spend it [in] ways that could provide more security than the air marshal program is doing.\u201d\n\nSkepticism of the air marshal program has grown. In a comprehensive review of the Department of Homeland Security released before his retirement in January, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., wrote of the Federal Air Marshal Service: \u201cIt is unclear to what extent the program is reducing risk to aviation security.\u201d\n\nAir marshals also have caught flak over personal misconduct. In March, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigated allegations of manipulated flight schedules and other ongoing illicit behavior.\n\nLast year, the service\u2019s director, Robert Bray, resigned after allegations surfaced that he used his position to purchase illegal firearms for personal use.\n\nIn the interview with The Daily Signal, Allison, his successor, insisted the program is again on the right flight path after a hearing before the oversight committee.\n\nAllison, an Army veteran who joined the air marshals in 1998, said the nation faces \u201cvery active threats to aviation security.\u201d Even with improved airport security, air marshals are needed to meet threats that \u201care more prevalent today than before 9/11,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough he declined to say how many arrests air marshals have made since 2011, Allison said his agency employs a \u201cconcept of operations\u201d to determine when and where its armed, plainclothes agents fly.\n\nThe director invited oversight, saying it\u2019s \u201ca fair question to ask, whether this program is worth it.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a 2006 terrorist plot to destroy airlines as they flew from Great Britain to the U.S. as one example of the need for air marshals.\n\nAfter the British government thwarted the attack, Duncan said, the agency scrambled marshals to provide security \u201con a high percentage of aircraft leaving England\u201d that day. He added:\n\n\u201cDo we add value? The answer is unequivocally yes. We want our adversaries to know there are [air marshals] on these aircraft. And we want the public to know, there are [marshals] on these aircraft.\u201d\n\nAsked whether locked cockpit doors would meet security needs, as Duncan and other lawmakers propose, Allison said reinforced doors do provide an additional \u201clayer of defense\u201d against hijackers.\n\n\u201cIs that sufficient? Probably not.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congressional critics argue that the air marshal program should end.
