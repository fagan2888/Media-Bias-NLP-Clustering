Organizers say large crowds gathered Thanksgiving week in Wrightsville Beach for the 11th season opening of Enchanted Airlie and the 32nd Annual North Carolina Holiday Flotilla.

WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, NC (WWAY) — The annual NC Holiday Flotilla turned into a wedding proposal for one couple this weekend.

Saturday’s holiday flotilla followed a 4-mile route, with 50,000 visitors, and passed the judges’ viewing stand at Blockade Runner Beach Resort. Twenty-three yachts, sailboats and motorboats, each competed for cash, prizes, and bragging rights.

Organizers say, in a first for the North Carolina Holiday Flotilla, Captain Mike Hamby of Wilmington used his holiday decorated boat as a surprise wedding proposal. When passing his girlfriend on the parade route, Hamby flipped a switch lighting up the words: “Sharon, will you marry me?”

Sharon Edelstein of Wilmington accepted the surprise proposal via cell phone with Hamby illuminating her answer on the side of his boat.
