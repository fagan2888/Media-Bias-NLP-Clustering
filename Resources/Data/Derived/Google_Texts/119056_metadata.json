He asked his colleagues to \u201ctake a long, hard look this morning, maybe in the mirror, and ask themselves, 'Where do I stand?'\" after Wednesday\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people. \u201cWe as the legislative body of this country do nothing. So I have a question for every member of this body: How can we live with ourselves for failing to do the things we know that will reduce gun violence?\u201d Reid said. \u201cWill it get rid of all of it? Of course not. But will it reduce it? Yes. We're complicit through our inaction, and if we continue to fail to act, we'll be complicit today and every day into the future,\" he added. We'll keep ending up right where we are, mourning innocent victims in San Bernardino, California, or Charleston or Newtown. When the victims turn to us for help, we'll have nothing to show but empty hands and a few empty gestures. It's despicable.\u201d\n\nReid also had some choice words for the National Rifle Association, who have long obstructed efforts to pass gun control laws, such as mandating background checks and closing loopholes that make it easier for people to obtain guns. The NRA also donates to lawmakers who support gun rights. \"Now, there was a time in my legislative career that I tried to work with the National Rifle Association. But the NRA today is a far cry from a sportsman's organization that I once supported. The NRA once called mandates for background checks reasonable,\" Reid said. \"I'm not making this up. Now they are transformed in a quasi-militant wing of the Republican party.\" Calling gun violence \"an epidemic\" and listing off a few of the numerous mass shootings over the last several years, Reid chided lawmakers who are reluctant to take up such measures because of their ties to the NRA, asking them to think of their constituents instead. \u201cI know the thought of upsetting the National Rifle Association scares everybody, especially my Republican colleagues,\u201d Reid said. \u201cBut you know what scares the American people? Gun violence. These mass shootings at holiday parties frighten the American people. Is that the only reason they're frightened? Of course not. They're afraid to go to a movie theater, go to a concert.\u201d\n\nMark Wilson via Getty Images Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) called on his colleagues to stand up for gun control legislation.\n\nReid\u2019s speech came at the beginning of Thursday\u2019s Senate session devoted to a GOP bill, once again attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act -- a proposal he called \u201cinsanity.\u201d \u201cEinstein said that the definition of insanity is when someone does the same thing over and over again knowing they're going to get the same result. So we're wasting our time here today. Everyone knows the result,\u201d he said. During the debate over the bill, Reid is to introduce an amendment that would prevent people convicted of harassing women at abortion clinics from obtaining guns, in response to last week\u2019s mass shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado. \u201cWe have the opportunity to cast a vote here today, and we will shortly, because we're focused on doing something. People on this side of the aisle are focused on doing something to stop this gun violence, and we're going to force amendments to that end today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will try to do something, anything.\u201d Watch Reid\u2019s remarks above.
