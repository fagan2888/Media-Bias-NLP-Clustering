The books \u2014 which began with \u201cThe Magicians,\u201d in 2009, and just wrapped up this month with \u201cThe Magician\u2019s Land\u201d \u2014 are massively absorbing, very funny, occasionally heartbreaking. They\u2019re just pulpy and juvenile enough to make for a great weekend diversion, but just smart and literary enough that you don\u2019t feel cheap afterward. The Magicians trilogy has wit, style, soul and \u2014 thanks in part to Lev Grossman\u2019s position as the book critic for Time \u2014 an encyclopedic knowledge of the conventions and flaws of the fantasy genre, which this book frequently mocks, and subverts whenever possible.\n\nWhich is why, unfortunately, the reader\u2019s attention is inevitably drawn to the one irritating fantasy clich\u00e9 that the Magicians trilogy doesn\u2019t avoid. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s an epic Hero\u2019s Quest narrative centered entirely around a white, straight guy. It\u2019s the absence of a female lead who can make it through even one entire installment of the trilogy without being killed, raped or otherwise horrifically traumatized to fuel that guy\u2019s arc.\n\nThe trilogy centers around young Quentin Coldwater \u2014 a social reject, a puzzle-solver, smarter than average; your usual ready-made avatar for the nerdy, socially disenfranchised white men presumed to be buying fantasy books \u2014 who discovers that magic is real when he is invited to an exclusive private college for magicians. (Harry Potter references are dropped every few pages, to let the reader know that it\u2019s an intentional resemblance.) Soon enough, Quentin has learned that Fillory, the extremely Narnia-esque fantasyland of his favorite children\u2019s books, is real too, and he\u2019s off to save it from certain peril. In between all this, we get your usual coming-of-age parable. Which is actually the redeeming feature of the series: Rather than aiming for the 12-to-18 YA market, this series is about the ages between 18 and 30. And unlike Harry Potter, Quentin doesn\u2019t learn that he\u2019s inherently special and destined for greatness: He learns, slowly and painfully, that he\u2019s not. He drinks too much, tanks relationships, takes unfulfilling jobs, gives up on his childhood dreams, and, Grossman is brave enough to suggest, becomes a better person by giving them up. In a culture obsessed with youth and wish-fulfillment, these are books about the heroism of acting your age.\n\nStill: This subversive streak might resonate more, were it not channeled through a traditional white, straight, male lead. I\u2019m not the first to point out that Grossman\u2019s story seems conflicted about who its protagonist is \u2014 in Slate, Choire Sicha recently wrote about why Julia is the trilogy\u2019s real heroine. But it\u2019s frustrating that genre epics, especially the ones that tap the Joseph Campbell \u201chero\u2019s quest\u201d formula, have always belonged to these \u201cEveryman\u201d characters: Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, Frodo and Bilbo Baggins, etc. We still see white, straight and male as the default setting for human experience; stories about them can be marketed as \u201cuniversal,\u201d whereas everything else is assumed to cater to an interest group. (Remember Joanne Rowling, not only bowing to the convention of the male hero, but degendering her name into \u201cJ.K.\u201d so as not to scare off boys.) It doesn\u2019t help that Quentin is far from the most likable of everymen; when Q.C. starts whining, he can give even the legendarily wimpy Luke Skywalker a run for his money. This has given Grossman\u2019s books a bad case of what a friend calls \u201cHermione syndrome\u201d: Quentin is frequently eclipsed by side characters who are vastly more interesting and sympathetic than he is. Most of them are women. And most of them are not long for this world.\n\nI have fallen in love with each female lead Grossman introduced, only to see them invariably fed into a narrative meat-grinder to teach Quentin a lesson. Consider Quentin\u2019s first girlfriend Alice, from \u201cThe Magicians\u201d: She\u2019s the most obvious Hermione analogue of the lot, a withdrawn and socially awkward girl who studies harder than anyone else in class, in part to live out the potential of her magician brother, who was killed in a tragic accident. She\u2019s smart, hardworking, intensely ethical, in love with learning; she\u2019s also dead by the end of the first book. In \u201cThe Magician King,\u201d we get Julia, Quentin\u2019s high-school crush, who is (if possible) even more wonderful than Alice: She was rejected from Brakebills, the magic academy, and had a nervous breakdown before resolving to teach herself magic by any means necessary. In non-mythical terms, while Quentin was attending the Ivy League schools and scoring internships, Julia was stripping to pay for night classes at a community college. Julia, like Alice, is brilliant; she\u2019s also tough, worldly and intensely, vocally critical of Quentin\u2019s immense privilege. Whenever Quentin gears up for another Skywalkerian whine \u2014 this time enriched by mentions of his dead girlfriend Alice \u2014 Julia is there to remind him there are people who\u2019d kill for his life. For her service, Julia is granted a lengthy, exceptionally graphic rape scene at the hands of an anthropomorphic fox-god, then shunted off to another dimension.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lev Grossman creates amazing, complicated women -- then gruesomely dispatches with each one", "author": "Sady Doyle", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Lev Grossman creates amazing, complicated women -- then gruesomely dispatches with each one", "title": "Why does the Magicians trilogy keep raping and killing off its best characters?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/24/why_does_the_magicians_trilogy_keep_raping_and_killing_off_its_best_characters/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/the_magicians.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lev Grossman creates amazing, complicated women -- then gruesomely dispatches with each one", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/the_magicians.jpg", "title": "Why does the Magicians trilogy keep raping and killing off its best characters?", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why does the Magicians trilogy keep raping and killing off its best characters?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Lev Grossman, magicians, The Magician's Land", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf05f\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Books, Lev Grossman, magicians, The Magician's Land, Entertainment NewsThere is much to love about Lev Grossman\u2019s Magicians trilogy.\nWhich is why, unfortunately, the reader\u2019s attention is inevitably drawn to the one irritating fantasy clich\u00e9 that the Magicians trilogy doesn\u2019t avoid.\nIt\u2019s not just that it\u2019s an epic Hero\u2019s Quest narrative centered entirely around a white, straight guy.\nStill: This subversive streak might resonate more, were it not channeled through a traditional white, straight, male lead.\nThe books \u2014 which began with \u201cThe Magicians,\u201d in 2009, and just wrapped up this month with \u201cThe Magician\u2019s Land\u201d \u2014 are massively absorbing, very funny, occasionally heartbreaking."}
