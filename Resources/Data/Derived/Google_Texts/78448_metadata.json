Those customers collectively earned $1.46 million in incentive payments and generated almost $12 million in gross savings for their plans, according to Vitals.\n\nThe most popular procedures in terms of number of cases, were lab/blood work, with an average incentive paid of $25, followed closely by mammograms, with an average incentive of $38.40, and then MRIs, with an average incentive of $141.45.\n\nColonoscopies, with an average incentive of $160, and CAT scans, with an average $141 incentive, were the other leading procedures.\n\nVitals said that overall shopping rates among covered patients increased by 30 percent in 2015.

That's $1,170 in savings per case.\n\nRemicade therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, which saw just 232 cases used under the SmartShopper program, was the second-leading procedure in terms of cumulative savings for the plans. Health plans saved more than $1.7 million on Remicade therapy, or $7,412 per case, by offering average incentives of just $434 per case, according to Vitals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sometimes you can to spend a little to save a lot.
