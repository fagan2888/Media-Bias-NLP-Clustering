The cycle station will be out of action indefinitely.\n\nThe accident happened near the corner of Welton and 27th streets at about 5 a.m. Eight bicycles and an eight-dock station were destroyed, a loss worth about $40,000, according to a news release by Denver B-cycle executive director Nick Bohnenkamp.\n\nDenver Police are investigating the cause of the accident, Bohnenkamp said.\n\nDenver B-cycle will work with the adjacent property owners and the city to restore service to the location as soon as possible, Bohnenkamp said.\n\nB-cycle users are encouraged to access nearby B-station locations including 370 Park Ave. West, 3310 Arapahoe St., 2751 Larimer St., and 2501 Lawrence St.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful that nobody was checking out or returning a bicycle at the time or this could have been much worse,\u201d Bohnenkamp said in a statement.\n\nDenver B-cycle is presented by Founding Funder Kaiser Permanente in association with a variety of community sponsors. Denver B-cycle is owned and operated by Denver Bike Sharing, a charitable, non-profit organization.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell, denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Car slams into Denver B-cycle location, destroys station", "title": "Car slams into Denver B-cycle location, destroys station", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/03/car-slams-into-denver-b-cycle-location-destroys-station/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150103_035502_bcycle-station-hit-1.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150103_035502_bcycle-station-hit-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-03T14:34:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:33:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf408\"", "article_summary": "A person was injured when a car smashed into a B-cycle station in the Five Points neighborhood early Saturday morning, authorities say.\nDenver B-cycle is owned and operated by Denver Bike Sharing, a charitable, non-profit organization.\nDenver B-cycle is presented by Founding Funder Kaiser Permanente in association with a variety of community sponsors.\nDenver B-cycle will work with the adjacent property owners and the city to restore service to the location as soon as possible, Bohnenkamp said.\nEight bicycles and an eight-dock station were destroyed, a loss worth about $40,000, according to a news release by Denver B-cycle executive director Nick Bohnenkamp."}
