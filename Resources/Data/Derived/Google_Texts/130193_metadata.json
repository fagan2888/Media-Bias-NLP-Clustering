(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) both say the government won\u2019t shut down. But with fewer than five working days before the fiscal year ends, neither has explained how they intend to stop that from happening.\n\nInstead, Republicans have made precious little progress in managing a political revolt within their own party that threatens both Boehner\u2019s leadership and the GOP\u2019s ability to keep the government open.\n\nCongressional staff and lawmakers speculate that the only way to avoid a shutdown will be for the House to vote in the final hours of Sept. 30, the deadline for a spending deal.\n\n[Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post\u2019s new political tipsheet]\n\nThe fight that started in July over the fate of Planned Parenthood has merged with growing frustration among a pocket of loud conservatives over Boehner\u2019s speakership and the presidential ambitions of several senators.\n\nBoehner and McConnell aides are working closely together to craft a solution, and the Appropriations committees have done the technical work necessary to provide a short-term bill. The leaders agree on the need for a short-term, stopgap bill and Democrats say they are ready to talk.\n\nSo, it seems like the solution should be simple. But, as with everything else in Congress, things are not that easy. Here are five obstacles standing in the way of the government staying open:\n\n\n\nPope Francis\u2019 cap flies off his head as he deplanes in Havana, Cuba, Saturday, Sept. 19, 2015.

It typically takes about two days for the House, and about the same time for the Senate, to pass a bill. But, with the papal visit and observance of Jewish holidays, Congress is scheduled to be in session for fewer than five full days before Oct. 1, the day a shutdown would take effect.\n\nThe next several days are expected to be filled with more closed-door sessions and staff meetings as leaders try to finalize a plan for a short-term continuing resolution or CR.\n\nThe Senate begins debate on a 20-week abortion ban tomorrow; it will hold a procedural vote on the measure Tuesday. Democrats are expected to block it, stopping the bill from reaching a final vote. Republicans may still try for a second procedural vote on abortion or move on to the spending debate. On Wednesday, both chambers are out of session to observe Yom Kippur.\n\nOn Thursday, Sept. 24, both chambers will convene for a speech by Pope Francis, who is scheduled to depart the Capitol at 11 a.m. Congress could resume work in the afternoon.\n\nFriday is expected to be a working day. The House is planning to finish work on a bill to speed up environmental reviews for development projects.\n\nFrom there, the schedule is wide open. Both the House and the Senate are scheduled to be in session on Sept. 28, 29 and 30, which is a good thing.\n\n\n\nU.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) (R) greets businessman Donald Trump onstage as they address a Tea Party rally against the Iran nuclear deal at the U.S. Capitol in Washington September 9, 2015.

With the Senate\u2019s complex procedures, all it takes is an objection from one senator to brings things to a standstill.\n\nAnd three of the four Republican senators running for president have taken a hard line on Planned Parenthood. Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Ted Cruz, (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) could each capitalize on the shutdown fervor to get a boost in the polls.\n\nPaul and Cruz have already demonstrated that a political show on the Senate floor is a great way to raise cash and get attention from voters. Neither has explicitly weighed in on blocking a spending bill, but Cruz stoked fears that he might do just that during a Fox News appearance last week.\n\nCruz was one of the early leaders of the movement to defund Planned Parenthood and has made the effort a key part of recent campaign speeches. He was also a big player in the 2013 shutdown fight after giving a 21-hour anti-Obamacare speech on the Senate floor.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou look at Republican leadership in Congress and their first step is always, always, always to surrender,\u201d Cruz said during a Thursday interview with Sean Hannity. \u201c[Voters are] looking for leaders who don\u2019t just talk about it but have a record of standing up to Washington, standing up to both Democrats and members of our own party and Republican leadership as well.\u201d\n\nA Cruz spokesman did not respond to requests for more information on the senator\u2019s specific plans regarding a spending bill.\n\nConservatives like Rep.

Conservatives don\u2019t trust leadership. When Republicans took control of the Senate in January, Boehner and McConnell promised they would overhaul the way Washington does business.\n\nThey pledged to defund Obamacare, cut spending to sequester levels and to move each of the 12 appropriations bills. They said that process would allow them to roll back a long list of White House policies, including environmental regulations and executive actions to loosen immigration controls.\n\nSo far, none of that has happened \u2014 and their members are frustrated.\n\n\u201cI listened to Mitch McConnell\u2019s election night speech and he said I\u2019m going to change Washington,\u201d said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.). a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it and we don\u2019t see any difference.\u201d\n\nHuelskamp was one of several conservatives who originally voted against the deep-cutting GOP budget earlier this year. Leadership convinced him to support their strategy by promising to use a procedure known as budget reconciliation to defund the Affordable Care Act. That maneuver would allow a simple majority in both the House and the Senate to slash funding for the president\u2019s signature domestic achievement.\n\nSo far, there\u2019s been no follow-through, and Huelskamp said he doesn\u2019t trust leadership will make good on any other vows.\n\nHe is one of 31 conservatives who signed a letter promising to oppose any spending bill that doesn\u2019t defund Planned Parenthood, even if that means shutting down the government. Hoping to channel conservatives\u2019 anger in another direction, House leaders responded by launching three separate investigations into Planned Parenthood, and backing bills defunding the group and adding restrictions for abortion providers.\n\nThe House voted last week to suspend funding for Planned Parenthood for a year and to require medical personnel to provide life-saving care for babies born during failed abortions.\n\n[House votes to defund Planned Parenthood, but will that avert a shutdown?]\n\nHouse Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), who used to head the conservative Republican Study Committee, also floated a plan to defund Planned Parenthood through the same reconciliation process leaders said they would use to defund Obamacare.\n\nBut conservatives aren\u2019t buying it. Most happily voted for the bills last week, but they\u2019ll continue to pursue the spending bill strategy.\n\n\u201cI applaud our leaders for this vote, but now is not the time to rest,\u201d said Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.). \u201cWe must ensure that any funding bill we pass now contains absolutely no funding for such a barbaric organization.\u201d\n\n\n\nRep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) resigned from the conservative Freedom Caucus lats week, but he\u2019s still no sure thing to support a short-term government funding bill.(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)\n\n4. The fight is no longer just about Planned Parenthood.\n\nRepublicans believe the spending debate is their last chance to guarantee a policy victory this year. Even if Boehner can satisfy the defund crowd, he will still be playing a game of whack-a-mole trying to figure out what, if any, short-term spending bill can garner a GOP majority.\n\nFor example, House leaders celebrated a tiny victory last week when Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) quit the Freedom Caucus over their hardline position on Planned Parenthood. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019s going to support a short-term CR.\n\nMcClintock hasn\u2019t decided how he\u2019ll vote yet, but he is seeking a House vote on each of the Appropriations-sanctioned spending bills. He then wants the Senate to act on the bills, ultimately convening a conference to settle any differences.\n\n\u201cThe only justification for a short-term CR would be to complete that work,\u201d he said.\n\nBut GOP leaders have already said they want to pass a short-term spending bill to allow time for negotiations with Democrats on a larger spending deal, which would lift the budget caps and increase spending. If conservatives support that plan, some feel like they would be violating every promise leaders made about cutting spending and following regular order.\n\nRepublican Study Committee chairman Bill Flores (R-Texas) wants to see the House vote on a wish-list style bill that that cuts spending to the sequester caps, chips away at President Obama\u2019s priorities and seeks to block the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cThis is really the only type of aspirational appropriations plan,\u201d Flores said.\n\n\n\nSome Republicans simply want to provoke President Obama into using the veto pen. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\n5. Republicans hate Obama\u2019s policies and want to force a veto. Republicans also know that even if they succeed in blocking funds for Planned Parenthood via a spending bill, the whole plan will end with a veto from President Obama. Frustrated conservatives want to force him to use it.\n\nObama\u2019s veto power means that if Democrats can stay unified, they have the upper hand in every budget negotiation.\n\nThe White House has threatened to veto any spending bill that cuts spending to the sequester level caps.\n\nRepublicans realize that and they want to force Obama to make good on those threats.\n\n\u201cThe American people need to know where [Obama] stands on things,\u201d Flores said. \u201cRight now he\u2019s been hiding behind [Senate Minority Leader] Harry Reid.\u201d\n\nCongress must pass a budget before Sept. 30, or it faces partially shutting down the government for the second time in two years. Here's how we got to another potential shutdown. (Jayne W.
