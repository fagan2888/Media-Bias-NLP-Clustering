Ted Cruz, the White House\u2019s decision to rename Mt. McKinley in Alaska is just another example of President Barack Obama trampling over the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIt is the latest manifestation of the megalomaniacal, imperial presidency that we have seen for six and a half years,\u201d Cruz told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Monday. \u201cThis administration has been the most lawless administration we have ever seen. And this president routinely disregards the law, disregards the Constitution, disregards the Congress.\u201d\n\nObama announced Sunday that Interior Secretary Sally Jewell would rename Mt. McKinley \u2018Denali\u2019 using her executive authority. The move restores Alaskan Native name to the nation\u2019s tallest mountain, which was called Denali long before it was officially renamed for President William McKinley in 1917.\n\nThe Interior Department said Jewell has the authority to do so under a 1947 law passed by Congress that allows her to standardize U.S. geographical names for federal usage.\n\nMembers of Congress from Alaska and Ohio\u2013McKinley\u2019s home state\u2013have squabbled for decades over Denali\u2019s name. Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska applauded the decision, while Ohioans\u2013including House Speaker John Boehner\u2013panned the president.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to change the name of a mountain, the way to do so is to go to Congress,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cBut he can\u2019t be bothered with Constitutional niceties like actually passing legislation.\u201d\n\nCruz added that Obama had become the president Richard Nixon \u201calways wished he could be.\u201d The senator also compared Obama to Nixon in July during a hearing he chaired about IRS targeting of political non-profits.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wOS90ZWQtY3J1ei1tY2tpbmxleS1yZW5hbWluZy1pcy1sYXRlc3QtYWN0LW9mLW9iYW1hcy1tZWdhbG9tYW5pYWNhbC1pbXBlcmlhbC1wcmVzaWRlbmN5Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Sylvan Lane", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "Updated at 4:45\u00a0p.m. with legal context WASHINGTON--For Sen.
