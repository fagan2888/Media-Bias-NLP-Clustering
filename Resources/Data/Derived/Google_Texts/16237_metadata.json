What he actually says is immaterial.\n\nChris Christie (New Jersey governor): A\n\nChristie was ready. He didn\u2019t waffle. His answer on Social Security was the best of any candidate on any question. He was also strong on domestic surveillance. Expect to see Christie have the biggest bounce from the debate. Moderators let him off the hook by not bringing up ethical issues.\n\nScott Walker (Wisconsin governor): B\n\nWalker did his, \u201cI\u2019m just a dull, God-fearin\u2019 regular guy from Wisconsin\u201d schtick. We\u2019ll see what Walker is made of when the field thins, but for now, he\u2019s running on union-busting and a 4.6 unemployment rate in Wisconsin, which is good enough.\n\nTed Cruz (Texas senator): B\n\nCruz will likely thrive in the debates. He doesn\u2019t get into specifics, and can go toe-to-toe with the best Baptist preacher. Expect social conservatives to flock to him, especially in Iowa. Cruz has a very limited appeal, his supporters are rabid and may get him to the top three in Iowa but after that\u2026\n\nJohn Kasich (Ohio governor): B-minus\n\nKasich had a couple of great responses, the best being about accepting Obamacare in Ohio. He also told his story well, even if it did sound over-rehearsed. But he loses points for pandering to the home crowd. (The debate was in Cleveland.)\n\nMarco Rubio (Florida senator): B-minus\n\nRubio is like a scratch golfer playing against guys on the PGA Tour. He looks like he can run with the big boys, but after a while his lack of experience shows up. He has some ideas worth hearing and one can see how in a general election he might appeal to some more conservative Democrats. He did well on education and immigration, but social issues will be his downfall.\n\nBen Carson (retired neurosurgeon): C\n\nCarson vanished for a while, which was easy considering the rather sizable egos on stage. He didn\u2019t really embarrass himself (any more than normal) but he also showed that he basically has no idea how foreign policy or government works. Carson will be able to trade on his accomplishments as a physician for only so long.\n\nJeb Bush (former Florida governor): C-minus\n\n\n\nBush looked like a candidate who hasn\u2019t run for office in 12 years, which is what he is. He even botched his closing statement, which one would assume he had prepared for. He stumbled repeatedly and looked like he wasn\u2019t sure what he actually believed. If he hadn\u2019t raised more than $100 million he would be in crisis, but all that money will allow him time to get his footing.\n\nMike Huckabee (former Arkansas governor): D\n\nHuckabee did not offer an actual solution to one of the problems he was presented with. The very definition of \u201call hat and no cattle.\u201d\n\nRand Paul (Kentucky senator): F\n\nPaul got tuned up by both Trump and Christie. His campaign was already a disappointment but the debate exposed Paul\u2019s thin platform and even thinner resume. The F here is also for Fading Fast.\n\nModerators (Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace): D\n\nThey started off very strong with questions about candidates past statements and contradictions. But when things got issue-specific they flatlined. No questions about either climate change or gun violence and only one about #BlackLivesMatter is inexcusable.\n\nFollow BNR on Twitter\n\nALSO READ:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Which GOP candidates made the grade and which contenders flunked out of the race?", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "Which GOP candidates made the grade and which contenders flunked out of the race?", "title": "GOP Debate Report Card: Trump, Christie Soar = A Win for Democrats", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/trump-31.png", "updated_time": "2015-08-07T10:11:10-04:00", "url": "https://bluenationreview.com/gop-debate-report-card-trump-christie-soar-a-win-for-democrats/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "Which GOP candidates made the grade and which contenders flunked out of the race?", "title": "GOP Debate Report Card: Trump, Christie Soar = A Win for Democrats", "image": {"src": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/trump-31.png"}, "creator": "@ShawnDrurySC", "site": "@bluenationrev", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Blue Nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview", "section": "Uncategorized", "tag": "Ben Carson,chris christie,Donald Trump,Fox News,GOP Debate,Jeb Bush,John Kasich,Marco Rubio,Mike Huckabee,Rand paul,Scott Walker,ted cruz", "published_time": "2015-08-07T09:25:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-07T10:11:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca31f\"", "article_summary": "Scott Walker (Wisconsin governor): BWalker did his, \u201cI\u2019m just a dull, God-fearin\u2019 regular guy from Wisconsin\u201d schtick.\nDonald Trump (businessman/blowhard): AThe fact that he was on the stage is a win for Democrats.\nThe very definition of \u201call hat and no cattle.\u201dRand Paul (Kentucky senator): FPaul got tuned up by both Trump and Christie.\nExpect to see Christie have the biggest bounce from the debate.\nChris Christie (New Jersey governor): AChristie was ready."}
