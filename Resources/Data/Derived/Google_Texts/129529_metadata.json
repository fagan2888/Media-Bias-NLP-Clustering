In case you don\u2019t know, this is a big deal: On Wednesday, Gohmert admitted that 10-12 Republicans meet weekly to plot against Obamacare.\n\nGohmert, who seems to have an Aaron Burr-like hard-on for Barack Obama (Burr just hated Thomas Jefferson), is convinced that Obama is using his powers to attack his opponents (as opposed to the Republicans using their power to attack their opponents, which is essentially a 24/7 job for Republicans).\n\nThe Texas Republican took to the House floor to read a Wall Street Journal editorial about the IRS and concluded, \u201cIt certainly appears that the IRS was weaponized for the political purpose of one party, which would, of course, be one of the worst nightmares for the Founders of this country.\u201d\n\nWeaponized\u2026Like Republicans have weaponized the House of Representatives to attack women, children, minorities, voters, the elderly, and others? That kind of weaponized?\n\nAnd then there is the little issue that the Founders did not much like the idea of any political parties at all. But having invented a premise, Gohmert, in true Beckian style, warmed to his conspiracy theories and went flat-out, full-bore stupid on America.\n\nWatch courtesy of the National Journal:\n\nWhen one party in power in the executive branch can weaponize its federal agencies against its political opponents, unless it is stopped, this little experiment in democracy will come to an end.\n\nOther than the fake IRS scandal, Gohmert also wants \u201ctruth\u201d about other invented Republican scandals, the so-called Fast and Furious scandal and Benghazi, which is not about Benghazi at all but about stopping Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cThey deserve the truth [about Benghazi] to come out,\u201d he said, melodramatically displaying giant posters of the Benghazi victims.\n\nAnd not stopping there, he brought up a scandal invented by Breitbart.com, that home of invented scandals, a claim that the Obama administration violated international law by shipping weapons \u201cinto or out of Libya.\u201d\n\nIf individuals within this administration then violated the international law that they pushed to create, then they probably need to be careful when they\u2019re traveling in years after they leave the White House or the administration efforts, because, who knows, might get an indictment somewhere in one of these international tribunals saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve violated the U.N. law you passed!\u201d You got guns into or out of Libya. You violated the law.\u201d People in this country need to understand that participating in the making of laws, and the participating in the violation of laws have consequences.\n\nOh dear.\n\nSo how this works is that, 1) the Republicans invent a scandal, then, 2) insist the White House tell them the truth about something that never happened and, 3) if they refuse (which they will, because what can you say about something that never happened?), they will defund the executive branch and put the president out of business.\n\nI think Republicans have warmed a little too much to the whole torture myth, that if you apply enough pressure people will tell you the truth. What they tell you is what you want to hear, so that you stop torturing them.\n\nGohmert has a lot to learn about Barack Obama. It is a complete mismatch: a small-minded bigot confronted with an opponent far out of his league intellectually.\n\nWell, Gohmert won\u2019t be the first Texas Republican to have this problem:\n\nGohmert may well by, as Hunter at The Daily Kos opined, \u201cthe dimmest bulb in a collection of dim bulbs\u201d but the question is, is he dim because he actually believes this stuff or because he expects everyone else to believe this stuff?\n\nGohmert is a demagogue. He is not interested in truth because Gohmert has to know very well, unless he is even less intelligent than we are willing to credit, that these so-called \u201cscandals\u201d are Republican-generated and have no relationship with reality. He knows he is demanding information the White House can\u2019t possibly give.\n\nBut hey, that\u2019s what demagogues do: grandstand. Gohmert put on his big show, made himself a hero to the cray-cray fringe that is the Republican base, and in all likelihood he thinks he scored some meaningful, even game-changing points on some ledger or another.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, even a dim bulb can be a danger to democracy. Especially when there are a whole lot of dim bulbs and they control the House of Representatives", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louie Gohmert wants the Obama administration to come clean about non-existent scandals or face being defunded", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Louie Gohmert wants the Obama administration to come clean about non-existent scandals or face being defunded", "title": "Louie Gohmert Suggests Defunding Executive Branch to Punish Obama", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/09/13/louie-gohmert-suggests-defunding-executive-branch-punish-obama.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Gohmert-Benghazi-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-13T10:33:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,Republican Party,U.S. House of Representatives,White House,america,Barack Obama,House of Representatives,Internal Revenue Service,Libya,Louie Gohmert,Obama Administration,Presidency of Barack Obama,Texas,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "White House", "published_time": "2013-09-13T07:35:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-13T10:33:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "america, Barack Obama, House of Representatives, Internal Revenue Service, Libya, Louie Gohmert, Obama Administration, Presidency of Barack Obama, Texas, White House"}, "article_summary": "In case you don\u2019t know, this is a big deal: On Wednesday, Gohmert admitted that 10-12 Republicans meet weekly to plot against Obamacare.\nBut having invented a premise, Gohmert, in true Beckian style, warmed to his conspiracy theories and went flat-out, full-bore stupid on America.\nGohmert has a lot to learn about Barack Obama.\nOther than the fake IRS scandal, Gohmert also wants \u201ctruth\u201d about other invented Republican scandals, the so-called Fast and Furious scandal and Benghazi, which is not about Benghazi at all but about stopping Hillary Clinton.\n), they will defund the executive branch and put the president out of business."}
