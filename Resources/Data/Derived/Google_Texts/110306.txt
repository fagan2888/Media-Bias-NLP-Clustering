Wood Dale egg hunt goes to the dogs

hello

An Easter egg hunt went to the dogs Sunday, as various weight classes of canines and their owners battled for treats and other goodies during the sixth annual Doggie Egg Hunt at the Cabin Nature Center White Oaks Dog Park in Wood Dale.

About 100 dogs participated in the event, in which they searched the park for plastic eggs filled with treats and coupons.

"I'm a dog lover myself and I enjoy watching this event," said Adam Vasquez, recreation supervisor for the Wood Dale Park District, which organized the event. "It also highlights our fine dog park we have here at the Cabin Nature Center."

The eggs were filled thanks to the generosity of K-9 Hair Design, a Wood Dale dog grooming business.

"It's great to see all these dogs," said Nancy Desmedt, owner of K-9 Hair Design.

Debora Oliveira of Itasca and her Golden Retriever, Donovan, wove their way through a lane of inquisitive dogs to fill a bag with dog treats during the first Easter egg race.

"This is a lot crazier than I thought it would be, in a good way though," she said. "I've never been to anything like this."
