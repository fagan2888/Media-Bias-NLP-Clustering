Staff writer Nicholas Friedman reports:

An employee at a Lewisville Whataburger has been fired after reportedly telling two off-duty police officers they couldn’t order food at the restaurant Tuesday night.

The officers were in uniform working an off-duty security job at a construction site near Interstate 35E when they went into Whataburger. FOX 4 identified the men as Michael Magovern with the Strawn City Marshall’s Office and Milford police officer Cameron Beckham.

They said the man behind the counter didn’t say anything other than, “We don’t serve police officers.” They opted to go to Dairy Queen instead, FOX 4 reported.

The officers said they believe this is an isolated incident and doesn’t reflect the overall mantra of the fast food chain.

“We’ve seen it on social media. We heard it on the news. 17 years as a firefighter and now as a police officer this is the first time this has ever happened to me,” Magovern told FOX4. “It really strikes a nerve personally.”

Whataburger responded on Twitter saying, “We would never condone this action and this is completely unacceptable. We are working hard to address this as soon as possible.”

The company also released a full statement: “We were appalled to hear of an employee refusing service to two officers, as we have proudly served first responders across our system for decades. As soon as we heard of this isolated incident, we began our own internal investigation overnight. The employee that refused service is no longer employed with Whataburger. We’ve also invited the officers back today so we can apologize in person and make this right.”
