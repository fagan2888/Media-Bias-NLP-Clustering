Local businesses are looking to hire hundreds of employees this spring. Pier Park hosted their first annual job fair with more than 50 vendors seeking for new employees. Some people were even hired immediately.

Youngstown resident Caitlin Snyder has been looking for a job for months. She didn't hesitate to come to Pier Park when she found out about the job fair.

"I'm here to support my two-year-old and I don't have a lot of work experience but I been trying to look for work." Snyder said.

Spring break is right around the corner and employers say they're hiring now for that upcoming busy season. Each employer is looking for anywhere between two and 100 part-time and full-time workers.

Pier Park Marketing Director Michael Kerrigan said, "Both Pier Park tenants and businesses throughout the community in Bay County are here hiring. We have retail, hospitality, food service, all sorts of different industries represented."

Locals seeking employment came to the right place. Tables were lined up with things like applications and brochures. Prospective employees could chat with workers and managers from the companies they're applying to.

As for Synder, she's taking home some good news.

“Pretty much I been going down the row and everything and applying for jobs. I just got hired on for Whataburger, so I’m pretty excited about that,” she said.

Snyder said she hopes others at today's job fair can be as successful as her.

Several hundred job positions are expected to be filled from today's job fair. Pier Park plans to host another job fair around this time next year.
