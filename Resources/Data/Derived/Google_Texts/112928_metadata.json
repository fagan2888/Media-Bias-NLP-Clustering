Instead, when determining which patients with multiple chronic conditions would receive care complicated enough to be eligible for this new payment, the CMS will now just use the term \u201cchronic-care management\u201d to describe the services that will be reimbursed.\u201cWe regret any confusion generated by our proposed use of the term 'complex' to describe the chronic-care management services that are not adequately reflected in the existing E/M codes,\u201d the CMS stated in the fee schedule document. \u201cAlthough the provision of these services is complex relative to the care management reflected in the existing E/M codes, we understand the confusion on the part of commenters regarding the number of patients within a practice that are potentially eligible for the service versus those that would be considered 'complex.' \u201dThe document also made note of comments the CMS received on its proposal to require a clinician be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to respond to the needs of these patients. The CMS acknowledged that some felt this was impractical, but said it was moving ahead with that requirement.\u201cThe evolving medical literature on chronic-care management and patient-centered medical homes emphasizes the central importance of members of the care team being available 24/7 to address a patient's acute chronic-care needs,\u201d the CMS stated. \u201cMoreover, we believe the 24/7 availability of the care team is an important factor contributing to higher resource costs for these services that are not currently reflected in E/M services. Therefore, we disagree with commenters who requested that we relax or phase in the 24/7 requirement.\u201dThe CMS defined chronic-care management of patients with multiple chronic conditions as the \u201csystematic assessment of patient's medical, functional and psycho-social needs; system-based approaches to ensure timely receipt of all recommended preventive-care services; medication reconciliation with review of adherence and potential interactions; and oversight of patient self-management of medications.\u201dIncluded in this is a requirement to develop a \u201cpatient-centered plan of care\u201d document, which would typically include a \u201cproblem list,\u201d expected outcomes, measurable treatment goals, symptom and medication management, and coordination of services delivered by specialists and social service providers.Still in play are the standards the CMS will require for practices to prove they have the necessary infrastructure to provide high-quality, comprehensive and safe chronic-care management. It was noted in the fee schedule document that these standards would be developed in 2014 for implementation in 2015 and will go through \u201cnotice and comment rulemaking.\u201d\u201cTreating patients with multiple chronic conditions requires significant work beyond the four corners of the physician's office,\u201d the American Medical Group Association said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to working with CMS as it establishes this code over the next year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Primary-care physicians are embracing Medicare's move to compensate them for care coordination services they provide when patients aren't in their offices, although the CMS declined to eliminate the administrative burden that troubled many providers when the idea was proposed.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: Docs welcome Medicare pay for care coordination, but worry about administrative burdens", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Primary-care physicians are embracing Medicare's move to compensate them for care coordination services they provide when patients aren't in their offices, although the CMS declined to eliminate the administrative burden that troubled many providers when the idea was proposed.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: Docs welcome Medicare pay for care coordination, but worry about administrative burdens", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20131202/NEWS/312029975", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20131202/NEWS/312029975/AR/0/AR-312029975.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Primary-care physicians are embracing Medicare's move to compensate them for care coordination services they provide when patients aren't in their offices, although the CMS declined to eliminate the administrative burden that troubled many providers when the idea was proposed.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: Docs welcome Medicare pay for care coordination, but worry about administrative burdens", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20131202/NEWS/312029975/AR/0/AR-312029975.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20131202/NEWS/312029975", "published_at": "2013-12-02", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20131202/NEWS/312029975/AR/0/AR-312029975.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16f6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe look forward to working with CMS as it establishes this code over the next year.\u201d\n\u201cMoreover, we believe the 24/7 availability of the care team is an important factor contributing to higher resource costs for these services that are not currently reflected in E/M services.\n\u201cElderly and disabled patients have complex, multiple and chronic health conditions that require the whole-person medical attention available only through primary-care physicians,\u201d said Dr. Reid Blackwelder, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians .\n\u201dThe document also made note of comments the CMS received on its proposal to require a clinician be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to respond to the needs of these patients.\n\u201cAlthough the provision of these services is complex relative to the care management reflected in the existing E/M codes, we understand the confusion on the part of commenters regarding the number of patients within a practice that are potentially eligible for the service versus those that would be considered 'complex.'"}
