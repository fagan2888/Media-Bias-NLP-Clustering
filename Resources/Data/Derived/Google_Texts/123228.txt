Two people were killed and eight injured in separate accidents on I-39/90 in Rock County involving semitrailer trucks over the weekend.

In the first accident, one person was killed and seven injured when a drunken driver crashed her car and then two vehicles that stopped to help were struck by a semitrailer truck Saturday night, authorities said.

The accident started when a 20-year-old Janesville woman driving a blue Ford Taurus north on the interstate struck the median guardrail at a railroad bridge near Beloit at 11:26 p.m. Her car ended up facing south in the northbound lanes, according to the Wisconsin State Patrol.

Drivers of a blue Dodge Caravan and black Volkswagen Jetta stopped to help. A semi driven by a 31-year-old Peoria, Ill., man smashed into the disabled Taurus before rear-ending the Jetta and Caravan.

A 27-year-old Lake Geneva woman sitting in the front passenger seat of the Jetta was killed, while two Lake Geneva boys, 6 and 9, sitting in the back seat suffered life-threatening injuries. The Jetta driver, a 29-year-old Lake Geneva man, suffered injuries that weren't considered life-threatening. Also injured were three Deerfield residents in the Dodge Caravan: two women, 23 and 49, and a 51-year-old man. The Taurus driver, who was arrested by Beloit police on suspicion of homicide by drunken driving, suffered injuries that were not life-threatening.

The State Patrol did not release the names of those involved.

In the second accident, at 8:20 a.m. Sunday, a northbound semi driven by David V. Juneau, 65, of South Dakota crossed from the right lane over into the median and then into the right lane of southbound traffic, colliding with a pickup truck near Janesville, the State Patrol said. The pickup driver Terry G. Sportsman, 34, of Sycamore, Ill., was pronounced dead at the scene.

Juneau suffered injuries that weren't life-threatening.
