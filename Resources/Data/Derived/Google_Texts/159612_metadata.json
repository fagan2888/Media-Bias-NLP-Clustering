He\u2019s quick with a teasing quip or an inspirational speech about the power of art. And on the set of The Michael J. Fox Show, on which he plays Fox\u2019s boss, local-news director and ladies\u2019 man Harris Green, he\u2019s the most popular guy in the room. As he arrives to shoot a scene with co-star Juliette Goglia and guest Rob Delaney, you can sense the weary crew perk up a bit. Producers and lighting technicians stifle laughs as he improvises a little in each take: a Jack Lemmon\u2013style necktie-tug; a Rat Pack finger-snap; a \u201cCan you believe this guy?\u201d eyebrow-raise. Pierce has a horrible, hacking cough today\u2014thanks, he says, to a mix of seasonal allergies and too much time in the dry-heated air of Silvercup Studios, where the NBC sitcom is shot\u2014but he confines the death rattle to the downtime between camera setups, guzzling water and repeating \u201cExcuse me\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d No sooner has a visiting reporter whipped out a notebook and recorder than an assistant director calls Pierce away for a retake. \u201cAsk me one question now, since I sat down and I coughed on you and everything,\u201d he says, sounding wheezy. \u201cMake it a good one. Go.\u201d\n\nPierce has been commanding rooms like this for almost three decades, most notably as a member of the overqualified ensembles on David Simon\u2019s The Wire and Treme (which begins its fourth and final season on December 1).\n\nHe calls himself \u201ca character guy\u201d and cites Ossie Davis, Roscoe Lee Browne, and Abe Vigoda as role models. He exudes authority as veteran journalist Green, striding through a newsroom set modeled on MSNBC\u2019s. Four seasons as trombonist Antoine Batiste on Treme formalized Pierce\u2019s obsession with jazz, which was sparked by hanging out with Wynton and Branford Marsalis, Terence Blanchard, and other New Orleans musicians. To placate Simon, he studied the trombone hard enough to fake intricate \u201cimprovised\u201d solos (the actual notes are redubbed in editing by Stafford Agee of the Rebirth Brass Band). After five seasons as The Wire\u2019s Detective \u201cBunk\u201d Moreland, he could talk shop with lifer cops.\n\nAnd lately, though not for any acting role, he could also pass for an office-seeker. He insists he\u2019s \u201cnot running for anything,\u201d but you wouldn\u2019t know it from his Twitter feed, which reads like dispatches from the virtual mayor of New Orleans. It\u2019s usually serious stuff: police brutality (\u201cRacial profiling affects everyone. @robrown718 arrested for shopping while black\u201d), health care (\u201cWith all the self-inflicted wounds, people still know Obamacare is a good thing. Millions will now get healthcare\u201d), gun control (\u201cWe should all join the NRA and fight from within their ranks\u201d), agricultural policy (\u201cIf we are willing to lift economic sanctions on Iran, we shouldn\u2019t put economic sanctions on our own American communities. Pass the Farm Bill\u201d).\n\n\u201cThere are days that I wake up and go, \u2018Don\u2019t talk about anything but art,\u2019 \u201d says Pierce. Then he ends up talking about causes anyway. The impetus was Hurricane Katrina: \u201cWhen the entire world is destroyed, and you realize you\u2019re just a moment away from losing everything, then you see the ugly side of human nature,\u201d he says. \u201cTo say nothing is to be complicit in bullshit.\u201d He saw cops and self-appointed posses with guns stop black residents from entering white parts of town. He watched his father, Amos, whose segregated Army unit fought in World War II\u2019s Battle of Saipan, and his mother, Althea, a schoolteacher who died last year, fight for a payout from their insurance company. \u201cMy parents paid Allstate for 50 years and received nothing,\u201d he says. He watched developers contrive to forcibly gentrify his neighborhood, Pontchartrain Park, one of the first African-American postwar suburbs. \u201cPeople came to me and said, \u2018Wendell, you have a great voice, and we need you to use your voice, or they\u2019re going to take our neighborhood away.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn January 2007, Pierce hosted a picnic for his beleaguered neighbors and spearheaded a plan to rebuild damaged homes. He became a familiar face at zoning meetings and City Hall and at rallies protesting the bulldozing of housing projects and public hospitals. In 2012, he and other investors started Sterling Farms, a chain of grocery and convenience stores serving mostly poor neighborhoods; the company has four outlets in New Orleans and plans to build a fifth in Alexandria. And yes, Mr. Pierce has gone to Washington: He\u2019s been a guest at the White House six times. At a state dinner in March 2012, President Obama asked him, \u201cHow\u2019s the trombone-playing?\u201d\n\nWherever his activism leads him, though, Pierce knows that for many viewers, he\u2019ll always be Bunk from The Wire, pub-crawling partner of Dominic West\u2019s heroic screwup McNulty: friends who understood each other so deeply that, in a now-legendary moment, they intuited their way through a crime-scene puzzle while exchanging nothing but exquisitely phrased variants of \u201cfuck.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people buy me drinks: \u2018Have a drink with Bunk!\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cI told someone a long time ago, \u2018That will be the first line of my obit: \u201cWendell Pierce, who played Bunk on The Wire, died today.\u201d \u2019 \u201d He laughs, then adds, \u201c \u2018Of old age.\u2019 But I had an actor tell me, she said, \u2018Wendell, you know, you had your Godfather. Everybody wants to be in The Godfather. Those actors can do anything now! The Wire was your Godfather!\u2019 It frees you up. One day I\u2019m gonna be on the street in a chicken suit going, \u2018I played Bunk! Early-bird special, two for $5! I was Bunk on The Wire!\u2019 \u201d\n\n*This article originally appeared in the December 9, 2013 issue of New York Magazine.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "description": "He insists he\u2019s \u201cnot running for anything,\u201d but you wouldn\u2019t know it from his Twitter feed.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Vulture", "description": "He insists he\u2019s \u201cnot running for anything,\u201d but you wouldn\u2019t know it from his Twitter feed.", "title": "Treme Star Wendell Pierce Plays Politics Even Better Than the Trombone", "url": "http://www.vulture.com/2013/11/wendell-pierce-on-politics-and-treme.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2013/11/27/magazine/27-wendell-pierce.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He insists he\u2019s \u201cnot running for anything,\u201d but you wouldn\u2019t know it from his Twitter feed.", "creator": "@mattzollerseitz", "image": "http://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.1500x1500.png", "title": "Wendell Pierce Talks Politics, Treme", "site": "@vulture", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Vulture", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "wendell pierce, tv, treme, the michael j. fox show, new york magazine", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture", "tag": "wendell pierce,tv,treme,the michael j. fox show,new york magazine", "published_time": "2013-12-02T02:10:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, wendell pierce, tv, treme, the michael j. fox show, new york magazine", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "I was Bunk on The Wire!\u2019 \u201d*This article originally appeared in the December 9, 2013 issue of New York Magazine.\nAnd yes, Mr. Pierce has gone to Washington: He\u2019s been a guest at the White House six times.\n\u201cAsk me one question now, since I sat down and I coughed on you and everything,\u201d he says, sounding wheezy.\n\u201cThere are days that I wake up and go, \u2018Don\u2019t talk about anything but art,\u2019 \u201d says Pierce.\nFox Show, on which he plays Fox\u2019s boss, local-news director and ladies\u2019 man Harris Green, he\u2019s the most popular guy in the room."}
