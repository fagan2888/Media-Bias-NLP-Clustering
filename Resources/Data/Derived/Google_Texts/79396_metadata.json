While well-intentioned, the law has proven to be onerous and inflexible, subjecting students, teachers and administrators to a one-size-fits-all, flawed accountability model.\n\nAs a former chair of the Colorado State Board of Education and founder and former superintendent of a network of charter schools in Colorado and New Mexico, I saw the results of this failed education policy first-hand.\n\nAnd as I\u2019ve traveled throughout Colorado\u2019s 2nd Congressional District as its representative, I\u2019ve heard the same concerns repeatedly: there\u2019s too much redundant testing, too little respect and support for educators, and too many students falling through the cracks.\n\nAll that changed a couple weeks ago. On Dec. 10 we finally moved beyond political differences to make positive change by replacing NCLB with a new education law called the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). The ESSA we passed in Congress, and that the president signed into law, better supports our students, educators and parents, and fixes the problems of NCLB by giving power back to states and local school districts.\n\nAt the core of ESSA is flexibility. We do away with NCLB\u2019s rigid, one-size-fits all parameters and instead lay out a broad framework of accountability and transparency requirements for states to meet, and then give them the power to set up their own systems that work best for their unique needs.\n\nThe new law will also enable students to spend less time taking tests and more time learning. For instance, Colorado high schoolers currently take PARCC, the ACT, and district assessments \u2014 and many students take AP or IB tests on top of that. Under the new law, states can now allow high-quality, recognized tests that are more meaningful to high school students \u2014 like the ACT \u2014 to serve in place of the annual state tests.\n\nThe new law also supports schools\u2019 efforts to expand creative and effective teaching methods beyond the traditional classroom setting. It grows and improves an existing program that provides resources for innovative solutions to common education challenges that have a proven record of supporting student achievement. These provisions (which are taken from legislation that I introduced in the House in February) will create new opportunities for STEM programs and education technology.\n\nThey\u2019re already having an effect in Colorado, where school districts like St. Vrain Valley have used this initiative to support students struggling with math and better engage kids in the sciences. By building on this program, our new education law will help more schools throughout the country take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nThe law also includes important updates to the federal Charter School Program, which provides grants to replicate and expand high-quality charter schools. I\u2019ve been a strong supporter of high-performing charters since first coming to Congress based on my experience as a charter school founder.\n\nWhile by no means perfect, our new education law is an important step in the right direction \u2014 it reduces redundant testing, provides greater flexibility to make school accountability work, and maintains the original intent of our nation\u2019s education law \u2014 that it\u2019s a civil rights law, first and foremost, ensuring that every student, no matter their race or where they live or how much money their parents have, has access to a world-class education.\n\nEducation is the single most powerful tool for creating opportunity, and one of the best investments we can make in our country\u2019s future \u2014 we can\u2019t afford to leave any more students behind.\n\nRep.
