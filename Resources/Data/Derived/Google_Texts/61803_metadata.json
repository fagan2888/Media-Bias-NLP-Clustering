(Jeff Roberson/Associated Press)\n\nHillary Clinton was criticized by a number of mainstream outlets for a speech yesterday light on substance and, in its anti-Wall Street rhetoric, disingenuous coming from someone who has gotten rich off the same Wall Street moneymen she now decries. All that won\u2019t matter to the electorate, however, if the GOP nominee does not seize the opening. Here\u2019s how to do that:\n\nMost important, a GOP tax reform plan cannot amount to an effort to shoehorn the current code and economy into a Reagan-era plan. It\u2019s going to be near-impossible to come up with a tax plan that revives a 28 percent top bracket without sticking it to non-rich taxpayers and/or blowing a hole in the budget. If Republicans try to match that up with draconian cuts to popular government programs, they set themselves up to be painted as heartless. They will not beat a Clinton appeal for the rich to \u201cpay just a little more\u201d with a pie-in-the-sky plan that does not benefit lower- and middle-class Americans.\n\nIn addition, no candidate can get away with promising to repeal Obamacare without explaining what he or she will put in its place. The rationale for the alternative must be directed to people who are hurt by or not helped by Obamacare. That means the alternative must deliver on the \u201caffordable\u201d part of the Affordable Care Act and restore greater choice to consumers. Ideally, the case should be made that consigning the poor to unreformed Medicaid is tantamount to saying the poor will get inferior care.\n\nNext, in lieu of a minimum-wage hike, the GOP candidate should offer something that might actually work and not eliminate entry-level jobs. James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute quotes a new study finding \u201ca $1000 policy-induced increase in the [Earned Income Tax Credit] EITC leads to a 7.3 percentage point increase in employment and a 9.4 percentage point reduction in the share of families with after-tax and transfer income below 100% poverty. . . . The increase in after tax incomes from the EITC may be the largest for this group \u2013 single women with children \u2013 given their well-documented large extensive margin labor supply response to this policy.\u201d\n\nRepublicans will need to win the education-for-the-21st-century issue. A sure way to start is to make the case that you cannot be in the pocket of the teachers unions and be for real school reform. The aspects of school reform that are essential \u2014 the right to fire bad teachers regardless of seniority, school choice, holding teachers accountable for outcomes, maximizing resources in the classroom, etc. \u2014 cannot be accomplished without running around (and if need be, over) teachers unions. Republicans should be supportive of good teachers (not unions), but mostly for students whose quality is adversely affected by unions\u2019 sacred cows. Moreover, it\u2019s time to take on higher ed\u2019s outrageous pricing, as well as lagging graduation and retention rates. Yes, disclosure is well and good, but there is more to be done. Why are colleges with billion-dollar reserves tax-exempt? Is there price collusion among higher ed institutions? There is no surer way to win the hearts of middle-class parents than to get tough with price-gouging institutions. In short, Republicans need to treat university presidents the way Democrats treat oil company CEOs \u2014 with suspicion and the tenacity to shame them publicly.\n\nThere are many other helpful issues for Republicans to champion (e.g. Dodd-Frank\u2019s destruction of community banking, efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to put coal companies out of business), but they will need to offer alternatives that are appealing. No, it\u2019s not enough to argue that Clinton is selling snake oil. She is, but that\u2019s insufficient to win voters\u2019 trust.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans cannot win only by shredding Clinton's economic schemes.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Republicans cannot win only by shredding Clinton's economic schemes.", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s weaknesses won\u2019t matter unless the GOP exploits them", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/07/14/hillary-clintons-weaknesses-wont-matter-unless-the-gop-exploits-them/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/25/Production/WashingtonPost/Images/DEM_2016_Clinton-047b0-2673.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/07/14/hillary-clintons-weaknesses-wont-matter-unless-the-gop-exploits-them/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "hillary clinton and tax reform, republicans EITC, republicans and education reform,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "hillary clinton and tax reform, republicans EITC, republicans and education reform,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccee8\"", "article_summary": "All that won\u2019t matter to the electorate, however, if the GOP nominee does not seize the opening.\nIt\u2019s going to be near-impossible to come up with a tax plan that revives a 28 percent top bracket without sticking it to non-rich taxpayers and/or blowing a hole in the budget.\n\u2014 cannot be accomplished without running around (and if need be, over) teachers unions.\nIn short, Republicans need to treat university presidents the way Democrats treat oil company CEOs \u2014 with suspicion and the tenacity to shame them publicly.\nHillary Clinton speaks during a campaign stop last month at Christ the King United Church of Christ in Florissant, Mo."}
