Texas this week, the case challenging President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, which would protect millions of illegal immigrants from deportation. But if we take a trip down memory lane, it seems President Obama has already made the case against his immigration actions on more than one occasion.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look:\n\n1. May 5, 2010: \u201cAnybody who tells you \u2026 I can wave a magic wand and make it happen hasn't been paying attention to how this town works.\u201d\n\n2. July 1, 2010: \u201c[T]here are those \u2026 who have argued passionately that we should \u2026 at least ignore the laws on the books... I believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair...This could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration.\u201d\n\n3. October 25, 2010: \u201cI am president, I am not king. I can't do these things just by myself.\u201d\n\n4. March 28, 2011: \u201cAmerica is a nation of laws, which means I, as the President, am obligated to enforce the law.\u201d\n\n5. April 20, 2011: \u201cI can't solve this problem by myself. \u2026 I can't do it by myself.\u201d\n\n6. April 29, 2011: \u201cSome here wish that I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that\u2019s not how democracy works\u201d\n\n7. May 10, 2011: \u201cThey wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that\u2019s not how a democracy works.\u201d\n\n8. July 25, 2011: \u201cThe idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. \u2026 But that's not how our system works. That\u2019s not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written.\u201d\n\n9. September 28, 2011: \"I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not True. We are doing everything we can administratively.\n\n10. September 28, 2011: \u201cWe live in a democracy. You have to pass bills through the legislature, and then I can sign it.\u201d\n\n11. September 20, 2012: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve always said is, as the head of the executive branch, there\u2019s a limit to what I can do.\u201d\n\n12. October 16, 2012: \u201cBut we're also a nation of laws. \u2026 And I've done everything that I can on my own...\u201d\n\n13. January 30, 2013: \u201cI'm not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I'm required to follow the law.\u201d\n\n14. January 30, 2013: \u201cI\u2019m not a king. You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law.\u201d\n\n15. February 14, 2013: \u201cThe problem is that I\u2019m the president of the United States, I\u2019m not the emperor of the United States.\u201d\n\n16. July 16, 2013: \u201cI think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative.\u201d\n\n17. September 17, 2013: \u201cMy job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. \u2026 But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law\u2026\u201d\n\n18. November 25, 2013: \u201cIf, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we're also a nation of laws \u2026 The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. \u2026 That\u2019s not our tradition.\u201d\n\n19. March 6, 2014: \u201cAnd I cannot ignore those laws any more than I could ignore \u2026 any of the other laws that are on the books.\u201d\n\n\n\n20. August 6, 2014:\u201cI\u2019m bound by the Constitution; I\u2019m bound by separation of powers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Awkward. .05/27/2016 0:39:27AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Awkward.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - ICYMI: 20 Times Obama Made the Case Against His Own Executive Actions on Immigration", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/04/24/20-times-obama-has-made-the-case-against-his-own-executive-actions-on-immigration-n2152863", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/114/2016-04-22T214326Z_1_LYNXNPEC3L1JR_RTROPTP_3_BRITAIN-EU-OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Awkward.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - ICYMI: 20 Times Obama Made the Case Against His Own Executive Actions on Immigration", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/04/24/20-times-obama-has-made-the-case-against-his-own-executive-actions-on-immigration-n2152863", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/114/2016-04-22T214326Z_1_LYNXNPEC3L1JR_RTROPTP_3_BRITAIN-EU-OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "ICYMI: 20 Times Obama Made the Case Against His Own Executive Actions on Immigration, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "September 20, 2012: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve always said is, as the head of the executive branch, there\u2019s a limit to what I can do.\u201d12.\nYou know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law.\u201d15.\nSeptember 17, 2013: \u201cMy job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed.\nI am the head of the executive branch of government.\nBut if we take a trip down memory lane, it seems President Obama has already made the case against his immigration actions on more than one occasion."}
