Beat Feuz of Switzerland was second, 0.54 of a second behind. Nyman was 0.02 behind Feuz.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super encouraging,\u201d said Nyman, 32. \u201cJust the training this fall was super encouraging. I had some steps I had to make to get back in the (top) 30. Now I can start risking more. If I had DNF\u2019d (not finished) today, I probably would have been out of the 30, but I had to risk it because I know I can ski well here.\u201d\n\nIt was Nyman\u2019s fifth career podium finish in a 13-year career with the U.S. Ski Team and his third here in \u201cNorth America\u2019s Downhill.\u201d He was second in 2007 and third in 2006.\n\nNyman was fast on the flat section at the top of the course and attacked coming onto the first steep pitch, called The Brink.\n\n\u201cI got in the tightest tuck I could and tried cutting line off on that upper section,\u201d Nyman said. \u201cBut then you get to The Brink and I just said, \u2018Go! Throw your body down the hill and search for speed every single turn.\u2019 Over all the terrain I just thought: project myself down the hill and stay over my skis. I thought I skied really, really well down through the bottom, super clean, super tight in the air.\u201d\n\nNyman could tell he had a good run through a section of four jumps at the bottom of the course.\n\n\u201cIt was so cool flying off those jumps because I saw all the other people, their landing tracks, I went by them,\u201d Nyman said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m flying, so this is good.\u2019 \u201c\n\nGanong, 26, may be coming into his own as a downhiller just as the U.S. gets set to hold the world championships for the first time since 1999. He has only two career finishes that were better than Friday\u2019s showing. He was third and fourth in back-to-back downhills last March in Kvitfjell, Norway.\n\n\u201cSkiing right now is just so fun for me,\u201d Ganong said. \u201cI feel really balanced on my skis, so I can just do whatever I want. It\u2019s fun to attack and push hard and see what happens. It\u2019s fun to be close.\u201d\n\nJansrud has won all three races in the speed disciplines this season, having won a downhill and super-G last weekend in Lake Louise, Alberta. Austria\u2019s Marcel Hirscher, who won the past three World Cup oerall titles, said Jansrud is now the favorite. Hirscher specializes in giant slalom and slalom.\n\n\u201cMarcel is a smart guy, because he\u2019s moving all the pressure over to me,\u201d Jansrud said. \u201cI think he\u2019s still the big favorite. Unless I get some really good GS results, I can win as many speed races as I want but come January with all the slalom and giant slalom races, Marcel is probably going to be there grabbing a lot of points.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Americans have strong showing at World Cup downhill in Beaver Creek", "title": "Americans have strong showing at World Cup downhill in Beaver Creek", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/05/americans-have-strong-showing-at-world-cup-downhill-in-beaver-creek/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141205_122302_steve-nyman.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141205_122302_steve-nyman.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-05T13:14:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:52:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca2c4\"", "article_summary": "BEAVER CREEK \u2014 Americans made strong showings in Friday\u2019s World Cup downhill on the Birds of Prey course, where the world alpine championships will be held in less than two months.\nAustria\u2019s Marcel Hirscher, who won the past three World Cup oerall titles, said Jansrud is now the favorite.\nI thought I skied really, really well down through the bottom, super clean, super tight in the air.\u201dNyman could tell he had a good run through a section of four jumps at the bottom of the course.\nSki Team and his third here in \u201cNorth America\u2019s Downhill.\u201d He was second in 2007 and third in 2006.\nHirscher specializes in giant slalom and slalom."}
