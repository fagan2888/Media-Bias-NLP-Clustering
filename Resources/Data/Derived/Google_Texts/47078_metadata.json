They were created through the 2010 Affordable Care Act to increase competition among health insurers and to provide consumers with greater choice in the marketplace.\n\nThere are 23 co-ops throughout the country. Rating company A.M. Best has said that, as of last fall, Lewiston-based MCHO is the only one making money.\n\nAs of Feb. 18, nearly 75,000 Mainers had signed up for insurance through the marketplace, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. About 57,600 of those Mainers chose one of MCHO\u2019s insurance plans, according to preliminary numbers released by the co-op Tuesday. However, MCHO\u2019s figures include only people who have paid their first bill.\n\nWith several days left for consumers to pay for March 1 coverage, Lewis expects that MCHO will ultimately be responsible for about 80 percent of the marketplace.\n\nLast year, MCHO had about 83 percent of the marketplace. At that time only two insurance companies shared the marketplace \u2014 MCHO and Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. This year, a third insurer, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, has joined the marketplace.\n\nMore Mainers are signing up for insurance under the ACA. According to the latest Gallup pol l, 11.6 percent of Mainers were uninsured in 2014, down from 16.1 percent in 2013.\n\nMCHO also started selling insurance in New Hampshire this year. So far 5,200 people there signed up for a MCHO plan. Lewis called that a \u201cstrong start\u201d considering MCHO got a late start there and is one of five companies selling insurance through the marketplace in that state.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to demonstrate to people in the Granite State the tremendous value that we offer,\u201d he said.\n\nAnthem spokesman Rory Sheehan said he was not able to release enrollment figures Tuesday because Anthem\u2019s numbers would only be estimates. However, he said, the company is \u201cencouraged by the significant interest we\u2019ve seen in our plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to see growth in the individual market and are pleased that our market share continues to increase from last year,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile nearly 75,000 people in Maine have signed up for plans on the exchange there are still many who do not have health insurance. We will continue to work to get the word out to people across the state about the benefits of quality and affordable health insurance and the availability of financial assistance.\u201d\n\nHarvard Pilgrim did not respond to requests for enrollment information.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LEWISTON \u2014 Over 66,000 Mainers have signed up for health insurance with Maine Community Health Options, an increase of 65 percent for the state\u2019s only health insurance co-op.
