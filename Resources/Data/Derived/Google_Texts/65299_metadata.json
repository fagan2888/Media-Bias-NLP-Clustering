At the checkout page, you\u2019ll be asked to take a picture of yourself using your phone instead of entering a password.\n\nCurrently, customers can stop hackers from using their credit card on the Web by setting up a \u201cSecureCode,\u201d which requires a password when shopping online. The password system was used in 3 billion transactions last year.\n\nThis fall MasterCard will launch a small pilot program involving 500 customers using fingerprints and facial scans. If the test is a success, the company plans on rolling it out publicly afterward. The company is also looking ahead to one day apply voice recognition technology.\n\nTo use the new selfie system, customers need to download the MasterCard phone app. Once you pay for something, a pop-up will appear asking for your authorization with either a fingerprint or facial recognition. Using facial recognition, customers stare at the phone, blink once \u2014 and bam! All done. The blink is a security measure so thieves can\u2019t just hold up a photo of you. A fingerprint only requires a touch.\n\nPasswords are easily forgotten, stolen or cracked, so the new system is a way to prove your identity using biometrics. Critics of the new system are uncomfortable that the photo or fingerprint a customer puts into his or her phone will transmit to the company\u2019s computer servers. Cybersecurity experts worry the transfer of such information across devices is too big of a privacy risk.\n\nMasterCard wasn\u2019t the first company to develop a facial recognition app \u2014 Chinese shopping brand Alibaba demonstrated one in March, but had to postpone the technology\u2019s launch because of security risks found by China\u2019s central bank and police ministry.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "MasterCard is appealing to America\u2019s obsession with selfies in an effort to reduce credit card identity theft.
