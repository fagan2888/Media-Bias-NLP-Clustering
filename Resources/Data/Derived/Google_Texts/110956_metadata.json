Diet Counseling and Obesity Treatments\n\nThirty-three states now require health plans to cover bariatric surgery and/or diet counseling, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL).\n\nBariatric surgery \u2014 which has the goal of reducing both the size of patients\u2019 stomachs and their appetites \u2014 is now a health benefit requirement in 23 states, up from five states before passage of the ACA. Sixteen states include some coverage for dietary or nutritional screening, and seven states cover nutritional therapy if diabetes is diagnosed.\n\n2. Smoking Cessation Programs\n\nSome type of smoking cessation coverage is now a requirement under the ACA. The American Lung Association website breaks down what is covered.\n\nCoverage differs depending on what type of health insurance you have. But as a general rule, people who have workplace insurance or who buy a policy in the individual market can expect coverage for four sessions of counseling and 90 days of smoking cessation medications. There is no cost-sharing \u2014 such as such as co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles \u2014 associated with these services.\n\nSmoking cessation treatment falls under the umbrella of \u201cmental health services and addiction treatment.\u201d This category also covers rehabilitation and mental health treatments for other addictions.\n\n3. Pre-Natal Folic Acid Supplements and Breastfeeding Supplies\n\nThe ACA requires most health insurance plans to cover breastfeeding support and supplies. This includes breastfeeding equipment \u2014 including the cost of a breast pump \u2014 and counseling for pregnant and nursing women.\n\nMedela, a breastfeeding-supply company, reports that the breastfeeding provisions do not apply to Medicaid or WIC. However, breast pumps are available through WIC and many state Medicaid programs, according to Medela.\n\nFolic acid supplements also are covered \u201cfor women who may become pregnant,\u201d according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The department recommends that women who are or might become pregnant consume an extra 400 to 800 micrograms of folic acid every day. Folic acid is a vitamin that can prevent birth defects.\n\nThe department\u2019s website lists covered preventive services for women, including breast cancer genetic testing, contraception, domestic and interpersonal violence screening, and screening for osteoporosis, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV.\n\n4. Autism Screening and Therapy for Children\n\nOne in 68 children have an autism spectrum disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance plans to cover preventive services for children without cost-sharing. Autism screening at 18 and 24 months is part of this coverage.\n\nAs of December 2015, 43 states and the District of Columbia required health insurance plans to provide coverage of autism services, according to the NCSL.\n\n5. Psychiatric Therapy\n\nIn 2008, the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act began to require coverage of mental and behavioral health services and substance-use disorders to be comparable to coverage of medical and surgical services, according to the American Psychological Association (APA).\n\nFor example, the APA has stated that an insurance company cannot charge a co-pay of $40 for a visit to a psychologist if it typically charges a $20 co-pay for other medical visits.\n\nThe law applies to employee-sponsored health programs with 50 or more employees, health exchanges, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and most Medicaid programs.\n\nA 2014 APA survey found that more than 90 percent of Americans were unfamiliar with the mental health parity law.\n\n6. Discounted or Free Health Clubs\n\nOne effect of the ACA is that insurance companies are vying for market share, said Sally Poblete, CEO of Wellthie, a healthcare software and analytics technology company.\n\n\u201cThe ACA led to record high enrollment numbers and increased competition for insurance companies,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, more than ever, insurance companies are trying to stand out from the crowd. Part of this has created a world of creativity and innovation in benefit design.\u201d\n\nFitness tracking and management is one increasingly popular benefit, she said. And some companies are going beyond merely offering deals or reimbursements for gym memberships.\n\n\u201cThey may actually give you a wearable activity tracker or money back for healthy behavior to keep you motivated,\u201d Poblete said.\n\nFor example, the New York-based health insurance agency Oscar has partnered with the wearable device manufacturer Misfit to pay insured members back for their physical activity as registered on the tracker, Poblete said.\n\nIn addition, many Blue Cross Blue Shield plans reimburse members for joining a health club or weight-loss program.\n\n7. Hair Prosthesis\n\nAre wigs considered prosthetic devices and included as essential benefits? The answer is not clear, said Robin Solomon, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney with Ivins, Phillips & Barker. She said wigs fall into a \u201cgray area.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether they are essential health benefits is determined on a state-by-state basis,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no clear guidance at the federal level.\u201d\n\nWigs are not specifically excluded at the federal level, but they are only included as an essential benefit if a state benchmark determines that they fall into one of the 10 essential benefit categories, she added.\n\nMost health insurance companies that cover the cost of a wig require a prescription from your doctor, according to Breastcancer.org.\n\n8. Gender Reassignment\n\nAccording to MarketWatch, \u201cmore than two dozen major insurance carriers provide plans without blanket exclusions for transgender-related health care.\u201d Human Rights Campaign has information at its website about how to find one of these insurers.\n\nIn addition, regulators in nine states and the District of Columbia have introduced laws banning insurance discrimination against gender-assignment treatments.\n\nMarketWatch also reports that although the ACA does not explicitly require insurers to cover gender reassignment surgery, the White House issued a letter to insurers stating that they no longer can turn someone away just because he or she is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.\n\n9. Chiropractic Services\n\nChiropractic services fall into another gray area where there is no clear federal guidance, said Solomon. \u201cSome states might treat chiropractic as \u2018rehabilitative\u2019 services, but each state can set its own limit on how many visits are covered,\u201d she explained.\n\nSolomon suggested checking the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website, which provides benchmark details for all states for 2014 to 2017. For example, the list shows that Alabama covers $600 of chiropractic costs per year, while Pennsylvania covers 20 chiropractic visits per year.\n\n10. Acupuncture or Massage Therapy\n\nSome insurers are covering alternative treatments that often diverge from traditional approaches.\n\n\u201cSome health plans are embracing alternative medicine benefits when deemed medically necessary, including acupuncture,\u201d Poblete said. She added that some plans also are covering massage therapy deemed medically necessary.\n\nTo find out if these services are covered in your plan, check your plan\u2019s summary of benefits and coverage, Poblete said. \u201cYou should also take a look at the doctors in your network to see who can provide the unique services you are looking for so you can take full advantage of all your health plan has to offer,\u201d she added.\n\nRelated: 10 Best and Worst States for Health Insurance Costs", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many people are not aware of the benefits included in their health insurance plans, especially in the light of federal health care reform.
