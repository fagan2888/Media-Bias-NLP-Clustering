But Hall policy does not allow for live speeches during a posthumous induction.\n\nSydney Seau admitted last week she was upset with not being allowed to give a speech.\n\n\u201cThe Seau family appreciates the overwhelming support for Sydney Seau to be able to accept Junior\u2019s induction into the Hall of Fame live and in her own words,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cUnfortunately, the Hall of Fame is unwilling to reverse its decision despite communicating to the family earlier this year that Sydney would be able to speak at the ceremony. Contrary to the most recent statement by the Hall of Fame, the family does not support the current policy that prevents family members from delivering live remarks on behalf of deceased inductees.\n\n\u201cThe Seau family never intended to use the Hall of Fame as a platform to discuss the serious mental health issues facing the NFL today, which are most appropriately addressed in a legal forum,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cThe Seau family looks forward to celebrating Junior\u2019s extraordinary accomplishments at the Hall of Fame.\u201d\n\nHall representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement from Hall executive vice president Joe Horrigan last Friday, a 2010 policy was referenced.\n\n\u201cThe policy of the Pro Football Hall of Fame since 2010 regarding individuals enshrined posthumously provides for an expanded presenting video (longer than the videos of living inductees) followed by the traditional unveiling of the bronzed bust and no additional comments made from the podium,\u201d Horrigan said.\n\nThe 2011 induction used such a format when former Los Angeles Rams star Les Richter was inducted posthumously.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "The family of the late Junior Seau will not disrupt the Hall of Fame ceremonies on Aug. 8 despite its disagreement with a policy preventing live remarks during a posthumous induction.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The family of the late Junior Seau will not disrupt the Hall of Fame ceremonies on Aug. 8 despite its disagreement with a policy preventing live remarks during a posthumous induction.", "title": "Seau lawyer: family won\u2019t disrupt Hall of Fame ceremonies", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/27/seau-lawyer-family-wont-disrupt-hall-of-fame-cerem/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/27/5ccbe429a2a470217d0f6a7067008ea9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/27/5ccbe429a2a470217d0f6a7067008ea9.jpg", "title": "Seau lawyer: family won\u2019t disrupt Hall of Fame ceremonies", "description": "The family of the late Junior Seau will not disrupt the Hall of Fame ceremonies on Aug. 8 despite its disagreement with a policy preventing live remarks during a posthumous induction.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Seau family appreciates the overwhelming support for Sydney Seau to be able to accept Junior\u2019s induction into the Hall of Fame live and in her own words,\u201d Strauss said.\nSydney Seau admitted last week she was upset with not being allowed to give a speech.\nBut Hall policy does not allow for live speeches during a posthumous induction.\n\u201cThe Seau family looks forward to celebrating Junior\u2019s extraordinary accomplishments at the Hall of Fame.\u201dHall representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCANTON, Ohio (AP) - The family of the late Junior Seau will not disrupt the Hall of Fame ceremonies on Aug. 8 despite its disagreement with a policy preventing live remarks during a posthumous induction."}
