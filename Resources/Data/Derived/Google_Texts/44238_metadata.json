A group of Republican lawmakers seized upon that populist charge Tuesday and said that Obamacare is no exception.\n\nSen. David Vitter (R-La.) and Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) are introducing legislation to undo a recent federal ruling that allows members of Congress and their staffs to retain their current health care subsidies once the Obamacare health insurance exchange begins October 1. Vitter said that the decision, issued by the Office of Personnel Management, is the epitome of why many view the nation\u2019s capital as out-of-touch.\n\n\u201cThese recent maneuverings inside the beltway are precisely why the American people rightly despise Congress,\u201d Vitter said.\n\nThe Vitter/DeSantis bill would strip congresspersons and staff of their eligibility for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan and push them onto the exchange, without the aid of subsidies to purchase insurance on the exchange. It also would do the same for the president, vice-president and political appointees \u2014 which Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), who is helping Vitter introduce the Senate legislation, said should be common sense given that Obamacare is the current president\u2019s policy achievement.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019d think that if the bill was named after you, you\u2019d want to be under it,\u201d Enzi said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re hoping the President will take that approach \u2026 so that Congress and the administration have to live under whatever the American people have to live under.\u201d\n\nEnzi added that the senators will be looking to attach the measure as an amendment \u201cat every opportunity\u201d. DeSantis\u2019 companion measure is expected to be an amendment to pending spending legislation needed to fund the federal government beyond the end of September, when current law expires.\n\nVitter addressed a concern that forcing lower-paid staffers onto the exchange could compel them to depart the government for other work, colloquially referred to as a \u201cbrain drain\u201d. He said that such fears were overstated \u2014 and quipped that such instances may not be all that bad, anyway.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the American people, their first reaction is, \u2018These are the brains that gave us Obamacare?'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "It's a common refrain from the American public: official Washington shouldn't be able to exempt itself from laws it imposes on the people.
