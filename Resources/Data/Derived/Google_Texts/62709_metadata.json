Her four older children were in college; Alexandra was a high school senior.\n\nPelosi approached her daughter with a heavy dose of preemptive mommy guilt: \u201cAlexandra, Mommy has this chance to run for Congress, but it would be better if it were a year from now. . . . It\u2019s up to you, if you want me to be home with you, that\u2019s perfect for me.\u201d\n\nTo which, Alexandra, in a response familiar to any mother of teenage daughters, instantly replied, \u201cMother, get a life.\u201d\n\n1 of 9 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The next Democratic leaders?

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts The former Harvard professor\u2019s staunch populism on issues ranging from financial regulation to expanding Social Security has made her a darling of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Though she insists she is not running for president in 2016 , many liberals hope she will provide a more progressive alternative to Hillary Clinton.

All four Pelosi daughters have since juggled children and careers.\n\n\u201cThey found work situations that worked for them,\u201d Alexandra told Politico\u2019s Lois Romano. \u201cEverybody role-modeled themselves after the first version of their mother \u2014 not the I\u2019m-going-to-go-take-over-the-world second-act version of their mother. Everybody developed careers, but in their own time, and in their own way . . . so they could stay near their kids. . . . Nobody has gone to the 9-to-5 situation. Nobody has a nanny. Everybody secretly retreated to the . . . idealized or romanticized, the stay-at-home mom version that they got and they took that into their career life.\u201d\n\nAt which point Nancy Pelosi made clear that she thought that was the better choice. \u201cI think they [her daughters] all understand: It\u2019s really an important responsibility to have children. They are not accessories. They are people. And the investment that you make in them \u2014 time goes by quickly. . . . But it is really an opportunity that you just can\u2019t get back, and you don\u2019t want to have any regrets about that.\u201d\n\nListening to it, my first thought was: Imagine if Boehner, or Harry Reid for that matter, had been dispensing advice to women about being sure they don\u2019t regret not making more time for their children.\n\nCertainly, Pelosi said all the right things \u2014 things that happen to be politically correct but are also substantively true. About how, \u201cfor women to really unleash who they are, the missing link . . . is the issue of child care.\u201d About how \u201ceveryone\u2019s decision is the right one for them.\u201d\n\nBut it was also clear that Nancy Pelosi is no Sheryl Sandberg. Pelosi\u2019s mind-set is less Lean In than Throttle Back, or at least think hard about doing so. For all her bona fides as a San Francisco liberal, Pelosi remains very much the \u201c1950s housewife,\u201d as Alexandra phrased it.\n\nTellingly, the role of fathers \u2014 when she was raising her children and now as her daughters raise theirs \u2014 never came up. Yes, Gen X dads may be more attuned to work-life balance than their baby-boomer counterparts. But for all the front-page stories of stay-at-home dads backstopping Wall Street moms, the reality is that juggling remains women\u2019s work.\n\n1 of 20 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Top opinions stories of 2013 View Photos From Trayvon Martin to Obamacare: Take a look at a selection of the stories that caught readers\u2019 interests over the past year.

It is hard enough to relaunch a career once your kids are off to school, no less to start one.\n\nThe offramp is easy to take; the on-ramp difficult to find. Pelosi said that the time a mother spends at home \u201ccounts on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. That\u2019s not a blank \u2014 it\u2019s a gold star.\u201d But that assessment seems more aspirational than actual. Maybe it\u2019s part of Pelosi\u2019s hiring calculus. Others are more mindful of the career gap.\n\nIn that sense I find myself in the seemingly odd position of agreeing with both Sheryl Sandberg and Nancy Pelosi. Women shouldn\u2019t limit their options prematurely. Neither should they lose sight of what truly matters. The nest empties more quickly than you ever dreamed possible.\n\nRead more from Ruth Marcus\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nancy Pelosi is no Sheryl Sandberg", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ruthmarcus", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Nancy Pelosi is no Sheryl Sandberg", "title": "Ruth Marcus: Nancy Pelosi is no Sheryl Sandberg", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ruth-marcus-nancy-pelosi-is-no-sheryl-sandberg/2013/12/13/200adf46-642a-11e3-a373-0f9f2d1c2b61_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/13/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Budget_Battle_Pelosi-013bb-1692.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@RuthMarcus"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ruth-marcus-nancy-pelosi-is-no-sheryl-sandberg/2013/12/13/200adf46-642a-11e3-a373-0f9f2d1c2b61_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Ruth Marcus, nancy pelosi, sheryl sandberg, lean in, alexandra pelosi, career moms, work-life balance, working moms,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ruthmarcus"}, "eomportal-uuid": "200adf46-642a-11e3-a373-0f9f2d1c2b61", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Ruth Marcus, nancy pelosi, sheryl sandberg, lean in, alexandra pelosi, career moms, work-life balance, working moms,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce810\"", "article_summary": "In that sense I find myself in the seemingly odd position of agreeing with both Sheryl Sandberg and Nancy Pelosi.\nis the issue of child care.\u201d About how \u201ceveryone\u2019s decision is the right one for them.\u201dBut it was also clear that Nancy Pelosi is no Sheryl Sandberg.\nNancy Pelosi described being approached to run for Congress at age 46, after years as a carpool-driving, cake-baking, stay-at-home mom who also managed to head the California Democratic Party.\nAll four Pelosi daughters have since juggled children and careers.\nidealized or romanticized, the stay-at-home mom version that they got and they took that into their career life.\u201dAt which point Nancy Pelosi made clear that she thought that was the better choice."}
