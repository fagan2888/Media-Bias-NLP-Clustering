Author Günter Grass died last Monday. Kurt Vonnegut passed in 2007. Besides sharing a wrinkled, weary look, both wrote with sharp satire and unyielding disgust from their experiences during World War II. The world is a less literate place without them. We must listen to our veterans when they speak. War may be inescapable at times, but it must never be taken lightly. Günter and Kurt’s words will always remind us of that.
