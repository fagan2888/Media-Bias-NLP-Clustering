He\u2019s the guy who shut down the government in a bid to kill it \u2014 and should he reach the White House, he\u2019d take a blowtorch to the law.\n\nBut Cruz isn\u2019t very clear about what \u2014 if anything \u2014 he\u2019d do to replace a law covering 20 million people. And some establishment Republicans suggest that he address this head-on before the pivotal April 5 primary in Wisconsin, where Republican leaders have been more aggressive in fleshing out alternative health plans.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCruz raised his political profile by defying the Republican establishment to force the government shutdown over Obamacare more than two years ago. But as he approaches the winner-take-all Wisconsin primary \u2014 which may be the party\u2019s best chance to prevent Donald Trump\u2019s nomination \u2014 he needs to court voters who\u2019ve elected politicians like House Speaker Paul Ryan, a policy wonk who\u2019s called on his party to offer a replacement plan.\n\n\u201cI think it would benefit [Cruz] as a candidate, period, but especially in Wisconsin,\" said Brian Fraley, a Republican strategist who describes himself as a \u201cNever Trump\u201d voter who plans to back Cruz in the state\u2019s primary. \"The insurance industry is big in Wisconsin. The health care industry is big in Wisconsin. This is a race where every brick helps in the foundation.\u201d\n\nCruz, who in 2013 spent roughly 21 hours straight on the Senate floor voicing his disdain for Obamacare, hasn\u2019t detailed how he\u2019d expand coverage or extend Obamacare\u2019s insurance protections like covering people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 protections that remain popular even as the country is split on the health care law.\n\nHe\u2019s hardly alone. Republicans have struggled to articulate an Obamacare replacement plan during the six years since the law\u2019s passage, despite regular promises to do so. But Cruz's scorched-earth approach to Obamacare repeal puts him at odds with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who offered a replacement plan last summer before his presidential campaign flamed out. And Ryan has said there\u2019s an \u201curgent\u201d need for the party to offer a replacement plan this year.\n\n\u201cAs leaders, we have an obligation to put our best ideas forward \u2014 no matter the consequences,\u201d Ryan said in a high-profile speech this week. \u201cWith so much at stake, the American people deserve a clear picture of what we believe.\u201d\n\nRyan, who will chair the GOP convention in July, is remaining neutral in the race. Walker plans to endorse a candidate soon and has said Cruz is the only one who could block Trump\u2019s march to the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination. A victory in Wisconsin, which appears to be a wide-open race, could net Cruz the vast majority of the state\u2019s 42 delegates before a series of contests in Northeastern states where he\u2019s not expected to do well.\n\nFew can claim they\u2019ve gone to the lengths Cruz has to scrap the president\u2019s signature domestic achievement. A landmark moment of Cruz\u2019s brief Senate career came in 2013, when his ill-fated effort to defund the law precipitated the first government shutdown in nearly two decades \u2014 and angered establishment Republicans, who accused Cruz of waging an unwinnable fight just to help his own standing with the party\u2019s base.\n\nHe\u2019s steered clear of other replacement bills that Republicans have circulated over the years that never gained traction. When a Supreme Court case last year threatened Obamacare\u2019s insurance subsidies, Cruz offered a replacement bill that primarily would have allowed health insurers to sell plans across states lines \u2014 an idea long favored by Republicans that hasn\u2019t had any success in limited, real-world practice.\n\nCruz\u2019s struggle to explain his Obamacare replacement during an Iowa town hall in January produced one of his campaign\u2019s worst moments. A voter who said his late brother-in-law was able to obtain coverage only because of Obamacare pressed Cruz on his health care replacement \u2014 but Cruz stuck to his standard anti-Obamacare talking points as the voter fought back tears.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pointing out, there are millions who had health insurance, who liked their health insurance, and who have had it canceled because of Obamacare,\u201d Cruz said in an exchange that was covered widely. \u201cSo there are millions of stories on the other side.\"\n\nCruz went on to win the Iowa caucuses days later.\n\nTo be sure, Cruz has discussed boilerplate GOP health care policies in the Senate and on the trail that he says would lower insurance costs and allow more people to purchase coverage without the threat of a federal mandate.\n\nIn a January debate, he emphasized interstate insurance sales, expanding the use of health savings accounts and allowing people to carry over coverage when they switch jobs.\n\n\u201cI think that's a much more attractive vision for health care than the Washington-driven, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign did not respond to questions about whether he will present a more detailed Obamacare replacement plan, or who is advising him on health care. It\u2019s unclear how much the ideas he sketched out would cost, or how many people they would cover.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to articulate not just repeal, but what is the center-right health care system that he\u2019s defining as the future of health care?\u201d said David Winston, a Republican pollster who advises GOP leaders in Congress. \u201cEveryone needs to define what the alternative is. I think it\u2019s incumbent upon all candidates to do that.\u201d\n\nSome Obamacare critics who\u2019ve urged Republicans to keep up their fight against Obamacare said Cruz is missing an opportunity to draw a clear distinction between himself and Trump.\n\n\u201cOne of the defining decisions the rest of the way in the Republican race is whether Cruz decides to put out a full-fledged alternative and really vaults Obamacare to the center of the race,\u201d said Jeffrey Anderson, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s always seemed like it could be his best issue, but by not putting out an alternative he\u2019s been unable to capitalize on it.\u201d\n\nEndorsing any specific plan comes with political peril \u2014 it offers a bull's-eye for opponents. Trump\u2019s high-level health care proposal was skewered by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington-based think tank that said his plan would add hundreds of billions to the federal deficit and insure a tiny fraction of those covered by Obamacare. And the three Republican candidates who offered detailed Obamacare replacement blueprints \u2014 Walker and former Govs. Bobby Jindal and Jeb Bush \u2014 failed to gain any traction in the race.\n\nThe takeaway for the remaining presidential candidates may be that sticking with the Obamacare red meat is better than getting bogged down in specifics.\n\n\u201cThe safe rhetoric has yet to move beyond repeal and replace for these guys,\u201d said Terry Holt, a Republican strategist who worked for John Kasich when he chaired the House Budget Committee. \u201cBetter to keep your powder unless you want to blow up the anti-ACA coalition.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "No one doubts he would take apart the health law.
