As Health Care Tech Fuels M&A, KPMG Buys Beacon Partners

Digirad and Navigant have also made health care technology acquisitions recently

Financial services firm KPMG LLP is buying health care consulting business Beacon Partners Inc. for an undisclosed amount.

Beacon Partners, headquartered in Weymouth, Massachusetts, is an information-technology and consulting firm that serves health care providers. Ralph Fargnoli (pictured), Beacon's CEO, will join KPMG as a management consulting managing director.

Amsterdam-based KPMG says the deal adds to its management consulting and IT service offerings for hospitals and other providers, including electronic health record systems.

"As the health care industry experiences unprecedented transformation  with increased regulations, technological disruption, and wide scale adoption of new business and operating models driving demand for our services  this acquisition will strengthen KPMGs market position in this industry, says John Veihmeyer, KPMG's global chairman.

KPMG isn't the only company stocking up on health care-related technology services. Digirad Corp. (Nasdaq: DRAD) bought MD Office Solutions, a mobile diagnostics imaging business, in March. Navigant (NYSE: NCI) bought RevenueMed, a coding and revenue management business, in February.
