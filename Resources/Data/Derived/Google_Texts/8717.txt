Trump asked for the man to be removed.

"Get him out of here. Throw him out. Get him the hell out of here. Get him out of here! Get out! Get him out of here," Trump said at the rally.

You can see what appears to be one person from the left attempting to kick the protester while he is on the ground.

Another person from the right puts his hands up in a combative manner.

The shouting and shoving continued as the protester was forced away from the crowds.

You can hear people chanting "all lives matter."

"You have one guy over there shouting, thousands of people are here and you’ll hear about him tomorrow,” Trumps said after the protester was removed.

Birmingham police confirmed that three people were escorted off the premises and no arrests were made.
