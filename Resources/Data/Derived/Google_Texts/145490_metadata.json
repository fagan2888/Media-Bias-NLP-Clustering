And now he\u2019s $200,000 in debt.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the back of my mind I was always thinking, this money is an investment \u2014 that later on, when I graduate and get a job, I\u2019ll be able to pay it off,\u201d says Manfre, who earns $61,500 a year working for the Veterans Administration. \u201cBut now I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to get the return I thought I would.\u201d\n\nMuch of the concern about ballooning student debt has focused on undergrads taking out steep loans to pay for the rising cost of college. Largely overlooked are a principal source of the problem: graduate students like Manfre, who are less likely to have support from parents or other sources, and who face almost no limits on how much they borrow.\n\nGraduate students now collectively owe as much as 40 percent of the estimated $1.2 trillion in outstanding student debt, according to the New America Foundation, even though they make up only 14 percent of all university enrollment.\n\n\u201cPeople focus on the undergraduates, because there are more of them and they\u2019re younger and more na\u00efve,\u201d says Joel Best, a professor at the University of Delaware and coauthor of The Student Loan Mess. \u201cThey aren\u2019t really paying attention to graduate students, but graduate students are really stacking up substantial student-loan debt.\u201d\n\nThis indifference helps graduate programs get away with continually increasing their prices, Best says. \u201cThey can charge whatever they want and say to themselves that they don\u2019t need to worry about it, the students can get loans.\u201d\n\nIt has also freed lawmakers to raise interest rates on graduate and professional students, who are being charged rates nearly 50% more than those paid by undergrads. In 2012, to save about $1.8 billion a year, Congress also stopped subsidizing the interest that accumulates on federal student loans taken out by graduate students while they\u2019re in school and for six months after they finish. And a proposal to streamline existing federal tax credits would reduce the deductions they will be able to take for educational expenses.\n\nOften past the point at which their parents help them pay for their tuition, room, and board, graduate students borrow an average of nearly three times more per year than undergraduates, according to the College Board. And while the average debt of undergraduates has more than doubled since 1989, according to the Brookings Institution, it has more than quadrupled during that time for graduate students.\n\nThis comes at a time when the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the fastest-growing careers through 2022 will require workers to have graduate degrees.\n\n\u201cWe might have a philosophical discussion about, \u2018Do you need a master\u2019s degree for X, Y, and Z,\u2019 but in a free and open marketplace employers are asking for them,\u201d says Suzanne Ortega, president of the Council of Graduate Schools.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Graduate and masters degrees are becoming increasingly expensive and difficult to pay off.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Graduate students now collectively owe as much as 40 percent of the estimated $1.2 trillion in outstanding student debt", "title": "The Real Student Debt Problem", "url": "http://time.com/3544912/graduate-school-loans-debt/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/student-debt.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/student-debt.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Graduate students now collectively owe as much as 40 percent of the estimated $1.2 trillion in outstanding student debt", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Real Student Debt Problem"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "student loans, graduate school loans, student debt, student loan payment plans, paying for college", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "student loans, graduate school loans, student debt, student loan payment plans, paying for college"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey aren\u2019t really paying attention to graduate students, but graduate students are really stacking up substantial student-loan debt.\u201dThis indifference helps graduate programs get away with continually increasing their prices, Best says.\n\u201cBut now I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to get the return I thought I would.\u201dMuch of the concern about ballooning student debt has focused on undergrads taking out steep loans to pay for the rising cost of college.\nAn Army veteran, Anthony Manfre paid for his associate\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degrees mostly with his GI Bill benefits, although he also took out $4,000 worth of student loans.\nIn 2012, to save about $1.8 billion a year, Congress also stopped subsidizing the interest that accumulates on federal student loans taken out by graduate students while they\u2019re in school and for six months after they finish.\nAnd while the average debt of undergraduates has more than doubled since 1989, according to the Brookings Institution, it has more than quadrupled during that time for graduate students."}
