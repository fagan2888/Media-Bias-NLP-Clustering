In 1916, a geologist announced he found evidence in Vero Beach that humans lived there during the Ice Age. That was thousands of years earlier than the accepted scientific view at the time. The claims were discredited. NPR's Greg Allen reports the team now digging at the site is making finds they believe may vindicate that earlier work.\n\nGREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Today it's just a strip of land near an airport, but a century ago, it's a spot that became world-famous because of the work of Florida State geologist Elias Sellards.\n\nANDY HEMMINGS: We're standing out on the point immediately adjacent to where Sellards did the bulk of his excavation.\n\nALLEN: Andy Hemmings is with Mercyhurst University. He's the lead archaeologist on a project that has picked up where Sellards left off a century ago. In 1915, workers digging a drainage canal found fossilized animal bones and then human remains. Hemmings says Sellards led a scientific excavation of the site.\n\nHEMMINGS: Quite literally, where we're standing, they found what they, at the time, dubbed skeleton two and skeleton three. It turns out it's actually one individual now known as Vero Man.\n\nALLEN: The human remains were in a layer of soil that also contained bones from animals that lived in Florida during the Ice Age - mastodons, giant sloths, sabertoothed cats.

That's when Mercyhurst University got involved. Archaeologists from the school began work on the site last year.\n\nHEMMINGS: So now we're down in our tents in our excavation.\n\nALLEN: Backhoes have dug a large pit to remove several feet of soil. A 24-by-60-foot tent now protects the area. Inside under Hemmings's direction, several college students are painstakingly beginning work on a layer of soil that was on the surface during the Ice Age.\n\nHEMMINGS: We don't even use shovels.
