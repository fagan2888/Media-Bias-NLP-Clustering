The online auction firm revealed on Tuesday that it was the victim of a \u201ccyberattack\u201d several months ago. Employee logins were compromised, giving the attackers access to eBay\u2019s corporate networks. EBay stressed that there was no evidence that financial information had been accessed, but still: best for everyone to change their password, like, right now.\n\nFrom eBay\u2019s press release:\n\nThe database, which was compromised between late February and early March, included eBay customers\u2019 name, encrypted password, email address, physical address, phone number and date of birth. However, the database did not contain financial information or other confidential personal information\n\nOf course, if you happened to do something dumb like use the same password for eBay and PayPal, well, then, you are screwed.\n\nBut when it comes to online security we\u2019re already so screwed that it\u2019s hard to know where to begin. On the most basic level, online giants like eBay, Facebook, Google and Amazon have collected vast amounts of data capturing aspects of every part of our life. Both willingly and unwillingly, these companies have handed over that data to U.S. government intelligence agencies. And on top of that, these companies are also routinely compromised by data breaches precipitated by unknown parties.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Change your password.
