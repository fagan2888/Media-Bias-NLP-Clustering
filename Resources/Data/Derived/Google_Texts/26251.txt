Section Sponsored by: The healthcare sector added 34,400 new jobs in the month of September as the overall unemployment rate for the country remained unchanged at 5.1%. Of these new jobs, hospitals contributed 15,500, leading the healthcare sector in new employment, according to the most recent jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the first 9 months of 2015, hospitals have created more than 117,000 new jobs. In September, hires in the healthcare sector accounted for approximately a quarter of all new jobs. Based on this information, healthcare occupations in hospital environments are certainly experiencing a steady upsurge. In fact, they have done so for more than a decade.

While some employment experts attribute these numbers to the Affordable Care Act, others attribute the baby boomer generation to the strong statistics. As these patients age and continue living longer than previous age groups, they readily flow into outpatient centers, home care facilities and nursing homes, prompting hiring in the healthcare sector to increase. MarketWatch1 published a report earlier this year stating that of the healthcare professions, the No. 1 position for job security is that of a chiropractor. Chiropractors had an unemployment rate of 0.1% in 2014, a median annual pay of $66,160 in 2012, and a predicted employment change of 14.6% from 2012 to 2022. Following at No. 2 is dentistry, with a 0.2% unemployment rate in 2014, a median annual pay of $149,310 in 2012, and a predicted employment surge of 15.9% from 2012 to 2022. Also on this list were physician assistants at No. 3, physicians and surgeons at No. 5, and medical, dental and ophthalmic laboratory technicians at No. 6. Also growing at a faster-than-average pace are registered nurse positions, who have a job outlook of 19% projected growth from 2012 to 2022. During this period, employment of nurses is expected to grow by 526,800 jobs. This growth is expected for a number of reasons, including an increased emphasis on preventive care and growing rates of chronic conditions such as diabetes and obesity. In addition to the evidence of steady job security in the healthcare industry, a poll conducted by healthcare staffing firm Randstad Healthcare found that healthcare workers' confidence in the overall strength of the economy and job availability is on the rise. According to this poll, which surveyed more than 3,100 people - including more than 150 physicians, nurses, healthcare administrators and other healthcare professionals - healthcare employees' confidence jumped to 57 points in the fourth quarter of 2014, up from 54.3 points in the third quarter. Additionally, 76 % of healthcare workers said they felt it was unlikely they would lose their job within the next 12 months. Healthcare professionals exhibited the highest levels of job security among all professions surveyed. References:
