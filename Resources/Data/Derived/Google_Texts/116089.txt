A Wichita man is left injured after intruders break into his home.

It happened just after 1:05 a.m. Saturday. Wichita Police Sgt. Brian Sigman said a confrontation broke out when two people forced their way into the 26-year-old victim's home in the 1200 block of South Longfellow.

Two suspects -- a 23-year-old female and a 22-year-old male -- then beat the man, stabbed him with a knife and tased him before leaving the scene.

The victim suffered minor injuries. He was treated by EMS at the scene.

Felony pickups were issued for both suspects on charges of battery and aggravated burglary.

Sigman said he was unsure whether or not the victim and suspects knew each other, but that the victim was able to give police names and addresses of his attackers.
