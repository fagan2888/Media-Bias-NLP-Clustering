The person should think of something \u2014 an event, an argument, even a person \u2014 that upsets them and imagine that thing floating farther and farther away with each breath, Sieg said.\n\nCindy Parsons, a nurse in the hospital's pre-operative and post-operative section, tasked with prepping patients for surgery and helping them recover after, said she has enjoyed the simple meditative exercise taught by Sieg.\n\n\"You just kind of go to your own meditative place. I always go to the water,\" she said. \"Sometimes when you're having a stressful day, it's nice knowing I can go away for five minutes and it's not about work. If I'm not stressed, that does float over to other people, and they become less stressed.\"\n\nWanda Boyd is an administrative assistant who works for five different BCH nursing directors, including two who are heavily involved in the upcoming move. Boyd, 62, said before the challenge started she already had a note on her computer monitor that read \"breathe.\"\n\nShe said she has really felt the benefits of the \"let go\" exercise.\n\n\"I really appreciate the opportunity that the hospital gave us, bringing in this program, because it just reminds you every day to take five minutes and do some deep breaths or close your eyes and let go,\" she said. \"It's helped me a lot.\"\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Joe Rubino at 303-473-1328 or rubinoj@dailycamera.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26439445/move-looming-boulder-community-health-employees-take-mindfulness", "sailthru.author": "By Joe Rubino ,  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26439445:view"}, "startDate": "2014-09-01T14:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "From ambulances bringing in gravely injured patients to constant dealings with insurance providers in a changing health coverage landscape, there are numerous sources of stress in every hospital.", "title": "With move looming, Boulder Community Health employees take on mindfulness", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26439445/move-looming-boulder-community-health-employees-take-mindfulness", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0830/20140830__02DCAMINw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0830/20140830__02DCAMINw~2_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2014-09-01T10:05:17-0600", "endDate": "2024-09-01T14:07:29-0600", "description": "From ambulances bringing in gravely injured patients to constant dealings with insurance providers in a changing health coverage landscape, there are numerous sources of stress in every hospital.", "byline": "By Joe Rubino,", "pubDate": "2014-08-30T14:03:37-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-01T14:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "With move looming, Boulder Community Health employees take on mindfulness", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26439445/move-looming-boulder-community-health-employees-take-mindfulness", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "From ambulances bringing in gravely injured patients to constant dealings with insurance providers in a changing health coverage landscape, there are numerous sources of stress in every hospital.", "title": "With move looming, Boulder Community Health employees take on mindfulness"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0830/20140830__02DCAMINw~2.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15a0\"", "article_summary": "She has also created a page on her website, yourmindfulyear.com, especially for BCH participants where they can access guided videos.\nEnter the 30-day mindfulness challenge.\nAdvertisementThe challenge was launched in Boulder on Aug. 13, and 577 of the hospital's roughly 2,400 employees signed up, according to Sieg.\nAdd Boulder Community Health's impending October mega-migration from its longtime Broadway digs to its Foothills Parkway campus, and things have the potential to get overwhelming for some employees.\n\"It's just about being present in your experience,\" Sieg, a longtime emergency room nurse, said of mindfulness."}
