And that could mean those workers might be leaving the work force earlier than expected.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cIn the past, many older employees under age 65 made a conscious decision to continue working even if they could afford to retire because they knew they would be covered by their group employer insurance policy,\u201d says Amy Gordon, employee benefits attorney at McDermott Will & Emery in Chicago. \u201cBut now they have the exchanges, and we could see a flood of workers retiring.\u201d\n\nThe law makes people much less dependent on employers for coverage, says Dr. Keith Cantor, CEO of Greenbox Foods. The increased availability of getting health insurance will make it easier for employees to change and leave jobs without having the big question of how they are going to find coverage hanging over their heads.\n\nIn the past, many workers continued at their jobs until they became Medicare eligible at 65, to remain on their company\u2019s health-insurance plan, creating the so-called \u201cemployment lock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will now leave the comfort of sharing risk and underwriting and will move to the exchanges because the barriers of gaining coverage on their own at that age have been removed,\u201d says Gordon.\n\nThe federal and state marketplaces are structured to favor older enrollees, which could make walking away from employer coverage more appealing, particularly those eligible for subsidies and without children younger than 26.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs a cost-cutting measure, some cities, including bankrupt Detroit, that have offered early retirees in the past continued health insurance have moved those individuals onto the exchanges with a set subsidy.\n\nAccording to research, the president\u2019s signature law could lead between 530,000 to 940,000 Americans to stop working, which would bring an estimated decline in the aggregate employment rate of as much as 0.3 to 0.6 percentage points.\n\nExperts agree that Medicare coverage is superior to the majority of plans of the exchanges, but the option to enter retirement before 65 is tempting and could create a shift in the insurance industry. \u201cHistorically, Medicare has been secondary and group health plans have been retirees\u2019 primary coverage, but if they go to the exchange, Medicare will become the primary insurer and it will tax the Medicare budget.\u201d\n\nCantor says this potential added burden to Medicare\u2019s budget could lead to reduced doctor care and availability.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing this now with Medicaid; when a system starts getting overloaded, that means the government starts paying less money for procedures and visits which means two things: we take on more patients, meaning shorter visits to make up the lost revenue or stop accepting patients on these plans.\u201d\n\nGordon adds that if the exchange\u2019s insurance pools become too saturated with older customers it could cause prices to increase. \u201cIf costs go up significantly, and insurers are looking to make a product attractive without losing their shirts, there could be a reduction in provider compensations and more providers could decide not to accept exchange coverage and force people to pay out of network.\u201d\n\nStephen Daley, chairman of the Employee Benefits and Executive Compensation Practice Group at Bond, Schoeneck & King, isn\u2019t worried about a flood of older workers leaving their jobs and entering the exchanges -- yet.\n\n\u201cThese marketplaces are still young and don\u2019t have a track record right now. Future workers might be tempted to leave the workforce early, but right now I just don\u2019t see that happening with these exchanges not being tested this early on.\u201d\n\nThe struggling labor market might welcome a flood of baby boomers leaving the workforce and potentially opening up positions for younger job seekers. \u201cIt all depends on whether employers decide to fill the positions. If so, it would create a good opportunity for younger workers to get jobs,\u201d says Gordon.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/RETIREMENT/Retirement Planning,/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE,/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/Money Tree", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-07 08:20:04 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/01/20/will-obamacare-create-retirement-stampede.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/01/20/will-obamacare-create-retirement-stampede/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452099296695.jpg?ve=1", "description": "The ACA makes it easier for older people to get health coverage, but will it lead to a stampede of older workers saying farewell to their employer-sponsored plans and hello to early retirement?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Will ObamaCare Create a Retirement Stampede?"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/RETIREMENT/Retirement Planning\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/Money Tree\"],\"author\":\"Kathryn Buschman Vasel\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Will ObamaCare Create a Retirement Stampede?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/01/20/will-obamacare-create-retirement-stampede/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452099296695.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-20T15:15:28Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/01/20/will-obamacare-create-retirement-stampede.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"9cde116a-adfb-4047-b145-f59d809bab4d\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "The ACA makes it easier for older people to get health coverage, but will it lead to a stampede of older workers saying farewell to their employer-sponsored plans and hello to early retirement?", "dc.description": "The ACA makes it easier for older people to get health coverage, but will it lead to a stampede of older workers saying farewell to their employer-sponsored plans and hello to early retirement?", "dc.identifier": "9cde116a-adfb-4047-b145-f59d809bab4d", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "The ACA makes it easier for older people to get health coverage, but will it lead to a stampede of older workers saying farewell to their employer-sponsored plans and hello to early retirement?", "title": "Will ObamaCare Create a Retirement Stampede?
