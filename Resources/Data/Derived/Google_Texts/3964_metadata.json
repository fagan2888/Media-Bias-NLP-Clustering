The bills have caused outrage for what people perceive as discrimination against the LGBT community.\n\nThey come in light of the legalization of same-sex marriage by the Supreme Court last year, with certain conservative states electing to bypass or ignore the ruling, and now choosing to pass laws that would actively discriminate against members of the LGBT community on religious grounds, with Indiana being the earliest and most-talked about example. More recently, Georgia has passed a religious liberty bill that would allow faith-based organizations \u2013 including Chick-Fil-A and Hobby Lobby \u2013 to deny services and hire or fire based on sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, the bill would have qualified Chick-Fil-A as faith-based. Although to be fair, anywhere 15-year-olds are cooking your dinner, you\u2019re operating on faith,\u201d Meyers joked. \u201cSo Chick-Fil-A is doing God\u2019s work, whereas Chipotle practices the dark arts.\u201d\n\nThe comedian argued that the biggest problem with the law is how broadly it defines faith-based organizations, as evidenced by a state senator questioning the law\u2019s sponsor as to whether the KKK \u2013 which describes itself as a Christian organization \u2013 would be protected under the bill.\n\nThe state\u2019s Republican Gov. Nathan Deal announced on Monday that he would not be signing the bill into law, citing his religion as a reason not to discriminate against others as seen through Jesus\u2019 teachings in the New Testament.\n\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s the New Testament. You need to read the New, New Testament where Jesus is opposed to same-sex marriages, teachers unions, financial reform and Obamacare,\u201d Meyers continued.\n\nWhile the governor deserves credit for vetoing the bill, the host also noted that he received an immense amount of pressure from companies that threatened to stop doing business in Georgia if the bill became a law, including AMC, which films zombie drama The Walking Dead in the southern state.\n\nHowever, North Carolina\u2019s Gov. Pat McCrory took the opposite approach, signing into law a bill that not only allows discrimination against LGBT people, but also overturned a non-discrimination ordinance passed last month in Charlotte, which would have allowed transgender individuals to select the restroom of their choice based on how they identify. Similar bills have been passed in states like Florida where businesses are allowed to check people\u2019s ID\u2019s before they\u2019re allowed to use the restroom.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s all just spare a thought for the poor soul at the Tallahassee Applebee\u2019s who has to card people on the way to the bathroom,\u201d added Meyers, who imagined a fake conversation where the person admitted to being a \u201ctoilet bouncer\u201d with dreams of moving to Georgia to become a zombie.\n\nMeyers concluded, \u201cThese so-called bathroom bills are ridiculous for one thing, and there\u2019s no evidence that sexual predators have ever exploited equal rights laws to commit crimes in bathrooms. Most importantly, laws like these legalize discrimination.\u201d Watch the segment below:\n\nThe Late Night host \u2013 who routinely joked about political issues during his tenure as anchor of SNL\u2018s Weekend Update \u2013 continues to extensively cover the world of politics on a nightly basis in a way that is often superior to that of Late Show host Stephen Colbert and The Daily Show with Trevor Noah. The move is a wise one in an election year, but he also risks turning off viewers who stick around after The Tonight Show that aren\u2019t into politics or may reside on the other side of the aisle.\n\nLate Night with Seth Meyers airs weeknights at 12:35 p.m. on NBC. Next week\u2019s guests include Claire Danes, Jerrod Carmichael, Cecily Strong, Chuck Todd and Matthew Perry.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Last Night On", "twitter": {"domain": "http://lastnighton.com", "description": "Seth Meyers takes Georgia and North Carolina to task over their anti-LGBT bills on Late Night Seth Meyers took \"a closer look\" at religious freed...", "title": "Late Night\u2019s Seth Meyers slams North Carolina\u2019s anti-LGBT law", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/361/files/2016/04/Seth_Meyers_Late_Night_LGBT.jpg"}, "creator": "@LastNightOnFS", "site": "@LastNightOnFS", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "FanSided", "iphone": "FanSided", "googleplay": "FanSided"}, "id": {"ipad": 553311886, "iphone": 553311886, "googleplay": "com.noticesoftware.FanSided"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://lastnighton.com/2016/04/01/late-nights-seth-meyers-slams-north-carolinas-anti-lgbt-law/"}, "android": {"url": "fansided://fansidedblogs.net/app/v2/?id=361&post_id=1945", "app_name": "FanSided", "package": "com.noticesoftware.FanSided"}, "ios": {"url": "fansided://fansidedblogs.net/app/v2/?id=361&post_id=1945", "app_store_id": 553311886, "app_name": "FanSided"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#ED9121", "description": "Seth Meyers takes Georgia and North Carolina to task over their anti-LGBT bills on Late Night", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2a2746", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": "10105391,1369422511"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=553311886", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/lastnighton/logo_lastnighton-com__300x300.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "news_keywords": "late night with seth meyers, north carolina, seth meyers", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/lastnighton/logo_lastnighton-com__150x150.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Late Night Show TV News, Rumors and Recaps", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/lastnighton/logo_lastnighton-com.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-TileImage": "//cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/lastnighton/logo_lastnighton-com__300x300.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-01T17:59:46+00:00", "author": "http://lastnighton.com/author/"}, "theme-color": "#2a2746", "og": {"site_name": "Last Night On", "description": "Seth Meyers takes Georgia and North Carolina to task over their anti-LGBT bills on Late Night Seth Meyers took \"a closer look\" at religious freed...", "title": "Late Night\u2019s Seth Meyers slams North Carolina\u2019s anti-LGBT law", "url": "http://lastnighton.com/2016/04/01/late-nights-seth-meyers-slams-north-carolinas-anti-lgbt-law/", "image": "http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/361/files/2016/04/Seth_Meyers_Late_Night_LGBT.jpg", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "Seth Meyers takes Georgia and North Carolina to task over their anti-LGBT bills on Late NightSeth Meyers took \u201ca closer look\u201d at religious freedom laws that were recently proposed in North Carolina and Georgia during Wednesday\u2019s episode of Late Night.\nLate Night with Seth Meyers airs weeknights at 12:35 p.m. on NBC.\nAlthough to be fair, anywhere 15-year-olds are cooking your dinner, you\u2019re operating on faith,\u201d Meyers joked.\nSimilar bills have been passed in states like Florida where businesses are allowed to check people\u2019s ID\u2019s before they\u2019re allowed to use the restroom.\nMore recently, Georgia has passed a religious liberty bill that would allow faith-based organizations \u2013 including Chick-Fil-A and Hobby Lobby \u2013 to deny services and hire or fire based on sexual orientation."}
