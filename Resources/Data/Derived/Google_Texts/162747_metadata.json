Soft, at first. Then, much more ruthless ... Right up this Tea Partier\u2019s alley.\"\n\nBut Sutherland, who plays Snow, is a lifelong leftist who told Britain's Guardian newspaper that he hopes the movies inspire young people to the kind of activism he took part in the in 1960s as a protester against the war in Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\"Hopefully they will see this film and the next film and the next film and then maybe organize,\" Sutherland said. \"Stand up. They might create a third party. They might change the electoral process, they might be able to take over the government, change the tax system.\"\n\nIn an interview with the website Screen Rant, Sutherland said that the notion of a heroic character provoking civil unrest against an unjust government was part of what made him interested in taking a role in the \"Hunger Games\" in the first place.\n\nHe said the movie series \"could be another Battle of Algiers,\" a reference to the 1966 film about the organization of a guerrilla movement during that Algerian War that has been a source of inspiration for insurgent groups.\n\nJeffrey Wright, the actor who plays Beetee, a \"Hunger Games\" participant gifted in the use of electronics, said the genius of the series is in its varying possible interpretations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s welcoming of the entire political spectrum,\u201d Wright told the website Hypable. \u201cSome people look at these stories and take a 1% versus the 99% perspective, which can be read something as a left-leaning perspective. I think others look at this and they view it from a more right-leaning perspective as a condemnation of government. Others may look at is as a validation of a need for strong allegiance to the 2nd Amendment. So it\u2019s nondiscriminatory, it\u2019s nonpartisan.\"\n\nALSO\n\n'Hunger Games: Catching Fire' a sequel with spark, critics say\n\nFans mass expectantly at 'Hunger Games: Catching Fire' premiere\n\n'Hunger Games: Catching Fire' likely to hit big, bucking YA film trend", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "The malleable politics of 'Hunger Games: Catching Fire'", "date": "2013-11-23", "Description": "Like any good dystopia, \"The Hunger Games\" depicts a frightening world that resonates with the anxieties of contemporary audiences -- a futuristic version of North America blighted by income inequality, government overreach and sadistic entertainment.
