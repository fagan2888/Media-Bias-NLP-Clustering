However, June wants to file her own tax return and claim her son (the client\u2019s grandson) Nathan as a dependent because although he worked part time, he was in college and June funded his tuition, books, and board from a college fund that she owned and controlled after the divorce. Consequently, June feels that she provided more than 50% of Nathan\u2019s support.\n\nWell, let\u2019s sort through the 75,000 pages of tax code and see if we can figure this out.\n\nRidiculous, right? Here\u2019s the truly scary part: it\u2019s just one of many realistic tax situations thanks to our nation\u2019s confusing tax code.\n\nOur tax system has become so complicated that many tax professionals are now specializing in specific tax segments. Some prefer to only prepare trust and estate tax returns, some specialize in real estate, others in small business returns and then there are the pros that cater to those who only have W2s and very simple tax returns.\n\nIn 1986, the tax code was overhauled and simplified\u2014and I think they did a pretty good job. They dumped a bunch of loopholes and trimmed down the plethora of tax rates to only three. The pundits predicted that many more people would be preparing their own taxes and there would be a significant drop in the need for a tax professional. Hah! There was no significant drop in need whatsoever. In fact, my client base increased because, truth be told, taxes did not get easier. Simply put, tax law is murky--there is always that gray area that must be judged or legislated further. And the 1986 act created a lot of confusion for the layman.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs the years went by, lawmakers added more twists and turns to the tax code to either clarify existing law or to create more law \u2013 mostly to satisfy special interest groups.\n\nEach new president promises tax simplification. Proposals fly for a flat tax, a consumption tax, a fair tax\u2014and they\u2019ve all died sad little deaths in Congress.\n\nI have to laugh when I see commercials on television during tax season that basically say that if you can answer all the simple questions asked by a particular tax software then you can do your own taxes. For many that may be true, for instance, if all you\u2019ve got is a W2 and maybe some itemized deductions. After all, if you have a splinter, you don\u2019t need a doctor right? You can certainly sterilize a needle and extract it from your finger. But if you have a brain tumor, just because you know how to slice with a knife doesn\u2019t mean you should do your own brain surgery. You might want to get a professional.\n\nSo it is with taxes. For example, if you\u2019re self-employed, tax law gets even more complicated. A tax professional can usually save you more in taxes than the preparation fee. Taxes are not simple, and the IRS loves to audit complicated self-prepared tax returns.\n\nLast night I heard a TV commentator say that the tax preparation industry does not want tax simplification because we\u2019ll lose business. You\u2019ve got to be kidding. I know tax professionals who drop out of the industry every year because they are drowning in frustration at all the new complexities.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I attended a tax seminar that focused on a federal update. I spent eight hours learning about the changes that were reflected in a handout manual that measures one-inch thick. The two new taxes have been added to the code contain so many \u201cwhat if\u201d and \u201cif, then\u201d statements that it\u2019s mind boggling. Then there is all the complexity created by the Affordable Care Act. And don\u2019t forget all the tiny changes to mileage rates and IRA contributions and dependency exemptions that change every year.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/Taxpertise,/FOX BUSINESS/TAXES", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-07 10:35:42 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "If you have a tough tax situation, sorting through the 75,000 pages of tax code to try and figure it out is not easy.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/02/06/here-proof-our-tax-code-is-too-complicated.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/02/06/here-proof-our-tax-code-is-too-complicated/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452224146262.jpg?ve=1", "description": "If you have a tough tax situation, sorting through the 75,000 pages of tax code to try and figure it out is not easy.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Here's Proof Our Tax Code is too Complicated"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/Taxpertise\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/TAXES\"],\"author\":\"Bonnie Lee\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Here\\\\u0027s Proof Our Tax Code is too Complicated\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/02/06/here-proof-our-tax-code-is-too-complicated/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452224146262.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-06T13:15:15Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/02/06/here-proof-our-tax-code-is-too-complicated.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"d66403ca-3abf-4642-a247-7c29315dc804\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "If you have a tough tax situation, sorting through the 75,000 pages of tax code to try and figure it out is not easy.", "dc.identifier": "d66403ca-3abf-4642-a247-7c29315dc804", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "If you have a tough tax situation, sorting through the 75,000 pages of tax code to try and figure it out is not easy.", "title": "Here's Proof Our Tax Code is too Complicated  | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/02/06/here-proof-our-tax-code-is-too-complicated.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/02/06/here-proof-our-tax-code-is-too-complicated/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452224146262.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "classification-isa": "taxpertise,taxes", "description": "If you have a tough tax situation, sorting through the 75,000 pages of tax code to try and figure it out is not easy.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Here's Proof Our Tax Code Is Too Complicated", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-07 10:35:42 EST", "column": "taxpertise", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-02-06", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/Taxpertise\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/TAXES\"],\"author\":\"Bonnie Lee\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Here\\\\u0027s Proof Our Tax Code is too Complicated\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/02/06/here-proof-our-tax-code-is-too-complicated/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452224146262.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-06T13:15:15Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/02/06/here-proof-our-tax-code-is-too-complicated.html\",\"post_id\":\"d66403ca-3abf-4642-a247-7c29315dc804\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "dc.creator": "Bonnie Lee"}, "article_summary": "Here\u2019s the truly scary part: it\u2019s just one of many realistic tax situations thanks to our nation\u2019s confusing tax code.\nWell, let\u2019s sort through the 75,000 pages of tax code and see if we can figure this out.\nOur tax system has become so complicated that many tax professionals are now specializing in specific tax segments.\nIn 1986, the tax code was overhauled and simplified\u2014and I think they did a pretty good job.\nLast night I heard a TV commentator say that the tax preparation industry does not want tax simplification because we\u2019ll lose business."}
