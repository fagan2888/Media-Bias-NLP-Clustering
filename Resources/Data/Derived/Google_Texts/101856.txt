On July 17, a citizen armed with an AR-15 stood guard outside various military recruitment offices in Virginia.

The man said “fundamental Muslim extremism” is at war with us, but out leaders seem unable–or unwilling–“to put it in perspective and [realize] that the war is here.”

According to Fox 5, the man wishes to remain anonymous, but did shake hands with those who came by to thank him for standing guard.

He said those inside the recruitment offices were glad to see him too:

I went into each office, the ones that were open, and I was received with handshakes and thank yous. They constantly came by, and not only them, but their wives came by in tears thanking me for just being out here. They baked cookies for me and brought lunch by.

The unidentified man said the police stopped and “checked [him] out.” He said they were just “doing their duty” and “It was all good.”

He urged Americans to contact their Representatives and Senators and get the laws changed so Marines, soldiers, and other military personnel can defend themselves.

He said: “People need to call their [Representatives], they need to call their Senators and they need to change these laws that are on the books so these guys can protect themselves so a regular old citizen doesn’t have to go out and do it,” he told us.”

Breitbart News previously reported that Representative Scott DesJarlais (R-TN-4th) will introducing legislation to abolish military gun-free zones on July 20.

DesJarlais’ bill is titled the “Enhancing Safety At Military Installations Act.”
