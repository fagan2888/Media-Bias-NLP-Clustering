The IRS considers that, in effect, a group policy and does not meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI had no idea. I do not get that thinking,\u201d Cochran said.\n\nThe tax would be $1,900 a day. \u201cIt would put me out of business,\u201d she said of the 35-year-old concern.\n\nCochran says she prides herself in being IRS compliant. For example, she reports the tips her stylists get.\n\nPlus, she offers a retirement plan and six weeks\u2019 paid maternity leave and up to three weeks\u2019 paid vacation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do the right thing by being a progressive company but we get penalized for encouraging our employees to get health insurance.\u201d\n\nThe majority of the 2,800 Mississippi members in the National Federation of Independent Businesses have fewer than 50 employees, according to Ron Aldridge, state director.\n\nAnd roughly one in seven of them reimburse their employees for medical expenses, Aldridge said.\n\nLegislation has been introduced in Congress to undo what would prove to be a crippling if not fatal tax that the IRS has imposed on small businesses.\n\nCalled the Small Business Healthcare Relief Act, it would amend the IRS code and the Affordable Care Act to allow businesses with fewer than 50 employees to make contributions to employees to defray their health-care costs.\n\nAldridge said he is hopeful that the legislation will be approved because there is \u201csignificant bipartisan support\u201d in Congress.\n\nThe law would require that employees prove they have individual health policies in line with the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which had specifically excluded businesses with fewer than 50 employees from the health-care mandate.\n\nBut the IRS said that many of those businesses were, in effect, engaging in unsanctioned group policies by subsidizing their employees.\n\nHouse Resolution 2911 and Senate Bill 1697 are in committee in their respective houses. Efforts to contact Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., lead sponsor on the House measure, were unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t anyone thought it would be a good idea to punish small employers for doing what doing what everybody in Washington claims to want,\u201d said Jack Mozloom, national media director for the National Federation of Independent Businesses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange interpretation by the IRS because that\u2019s precisely the consequence, because they are punishing employers who cannot afford to buy a group plan,\u201d Mozloom said in an interview. \u201cAnd not only are they punishing them heavily but far more heavily than they\u2019re punishing far larger employers who simply opt not to provide any insurance at all.\u201d\n\nThe fine called for under the Affordable Care Act for employers with more than 50 workers is $2,000 per worker per year. The tax that stands to be imposed on the small employers is 18 times that, $36,500 per worker per year, Mozloom noted.\n\nThe IRS did not respond to a question posed to them by the Mississippi Business Journal as to why the rule was imposed.\n\nThe NFIB likewise got no answer to that question, Mozloom said.\n\n\u201cMy guess is it\u2019s a natural bureaucratic instinct when confronted with something they don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t keep track of, they just simply think: \u2018Well, we\u2019ll just ban it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThey realized that they are potentially hundreds of thousands of small-business owners in this situation acting sort of anonymously without their supervision or approval.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "By JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0\r\n\r\nLisa Cochran, owner of two hair salon and spa shops called The Studio in H...", "title": "Lawmakers, small businesses take steps to blunt IRS rule", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://msbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/irs-logo-620x330.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-25T10:42:27-05:00", "url": "http://msbusiness.com/2015/08/lawmakers-small-businesses-take-steps-to-blunt-irs-rule/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mbjournal", "section": "Banking & Finance", "tag": "NEWS", "published_time": "2015-08-20T11:12:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-25T10:42:27-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "By JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0 Lisa Cochran, owner of two hair salon and spa shops called The Studio in Hattiesburg, said that she has been helping her employees for years by contributing $50 a month toward their health coverage premiums.
