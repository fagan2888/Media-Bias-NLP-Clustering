Our economy isn\u2019t recovering fast enough if our fellow Americans have lost confidence in the job market.\u201d\n\nAs reported by National Review earlier this month:\n\nIn April, the U.S. economy added 288,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest numbers, which easily beats expectations of around 215,000 hires. The unemployment rate dropped to an encouraging 6.3 percent, but not because of that impressive headline number. Rather, the labor-force-participation dropped 0.4 percentage points, to 62.8 percent. After a few months when it appeared to be holding steady or rising, it\u2019s now dropped back to the lowest level since 1978. Why? It could be the incipient effects of Obamacare reducing \u201cjob lock,\u201d or it could be the expiration of unemployment benefits, or it could just generally be frustration with the labor market, especially among the long-term unemployed. The statistic used to calculate the unemployment rate, in fact, the \u201chousehold survey\u201d that polls people as to whether they\u2019re employed (rather than asking employers whether they\u2019ve hired anyone), saw the number of jobs in the economy drop by 73,000 jobs, though this number by itself isn\u2019t considered all that reliable.\n\nThough unemployment fell by 0.4% to 6.3% in April, it\u2019s clear that millions of Americans see their economic outlook as very bleak.\n\nThere is a silver lining in this report, however. Ninety-one percent (91%) of those surveyed said, \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that I will find a job I really want in the next six months.\u201d Outlook is key. Americans who give up looking for work and have no hope are doomed to become victims of long-term unemployment.\n\nHarris surveyed 1,500 Americans who are unemployed but capable of working.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Barack Obama,Economy,Financial Crisis,Obama e,Obama Recovery,Unemployment,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "DC.Title": "More bad news for Obama: Nearly half of unemployed Americans have given up looking for work", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "description": "Thanks Obama More bad news for President Obama: According to a\u00a0Harris Poll behalf of Express Employment Professionals (EEP), nearly half of unemployed Americans have &#8220;completely given up&#8221; looking for work.
