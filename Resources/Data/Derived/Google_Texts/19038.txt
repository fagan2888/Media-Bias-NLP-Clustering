PRESIDENT OBAMA: I think this is especially important for-- Latino community to-- to understand, because nobody is more likely to have [sic] health insurance than-- Latinos in this country.



And they stand to, for the first time, get affordable healthcare coverage that they can count on for themselves and their families. And-- and they don't have to take my word for it. They'll be able to go to-- a website or place a phone call. And they'll be able to look at the plans, how much they cost, the deal that they get for it, and-- choose one that's right for them. And-- and I think what people will find is, in fact, that-- it's-- an absolute good deal and they should take advantage of it.



That is a lot of people. And, you know-- when you look at-- some states, like California, who are really movin' this forward, they've already started to estimate what their premiums are gonna be, people are -- potentially are gonna be able to get health insurance for less than their cell phone bill. They'll have that security and that coverage. (Telemundo, 9/17/2013)
