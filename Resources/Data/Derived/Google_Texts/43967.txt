Hillary Clinton wants to use Obamacare to provide health coverage for illegal immigrants.

In an interview with Anderson Cooper as part of CNN’s presidential primetime event Monday, Clinton said, “It’s not only the right and moral thing to do for them, it’s also important that we keep ourselves healthy and public health requires that.”

Cooper asked Clinton, “[A]re you in favor of extending Obamacare to undocumented immigrants” and the former Secretary of State replied, “There are two steps here. If someone can afford to pay for an insurance policy off the exchanges that were set up under the Affordable Care Act, I support that.”

“Even if they are undocumented?” Cooper followed up.

“Yes,” Clinton replied. Adding, “If they can afford it, they should be able to go into the marketplace and buy it. But it is not going to apply to people who are in need of subsidies in order to afford that because the subsidies question has to be worked out in comprehensive immigration reform.”

“And what I do want to see is that we have more options for undocumented people to be able to get the health care they need,” Clinton said.
