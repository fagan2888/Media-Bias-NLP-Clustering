Chris Smith (R-NJ), a pro-life warrior who has been involved in the movement for 42 years, exposed President Obama\u2019s misleading statement about his signature legislation:\n\n\u201cOn Sept 9, 2009 in a joint session of Congress, Obama said in his health care reform, under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortion. In an eleventh hour ploy to garner a remnant of pro-life congressional Democrats absolutely needed to pass the Affordable Care Act, the president issued an executive order on March 24, 2010 and said, \u2018The act maintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to duly created health insurance exchanges.'\u201d\n\n\u201cIt turns out that those ironclad promises by the president himself, are absolutely untrue.\u201d\n\nThe Hyde Amendment, Smith explained, has two indisputable parts: it prohibits direct funding for abortion and funding for any insurance plan that includes abortion, except in the cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.\n\nSmith discussed just how Obamacare violates this specific law.\n\n\u201cObamacare violates the Hyde funding by funding insurance plans and by paying for abortion on demand. Despite an appalling degree of non-transparency and obfuscation by the Obama administration, an extensive audit by the Government Accountability Office found in September that 1,036 Obamacare exchanges covered elective abortion. GAO also found that separate billing of the abortion surcharge required by the act is not being enforced, the abortion funding premium, and again, this is in 2015 now, is being illegally rolled into the total plan cost. Health care consumers are therefore buying health care insurance with little or no knowledge that they are purchasing abortion subsidizing plans.\u201d\n\nIn his own state of New Jersey, Smith says every single plan on the exchange pays for abortion on demand. The same is true for other states as well.\n\nWhen it comes to public funding for abortion, the 2015 open enrollment is at least as bad, if not worse, than last year, Smith said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been about a website. Again President Obama\u2019s promise not to fund abortion on demand, continues to be broken. It\u2019s not just a lie that was done once, it gets replicated year in and year out because what he said got the votes to procure enactment of that egregiously flawed legislation.\u201d\n\nSmith encouraged his audience to visit Obamacareabortion.com, a website created by the Family Research Council and the Charlotte Lozier Institute that offers consumers the chance to click on their state and find out if their health care plans include abortion coverage.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s cover-up of abortion insurance plans on the exchange is absolutely unnecessary, it\u2019s unacceptable, and it is unconscionable. Consumers have a right to know.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Smith and his colleagues are introducing several pro-life bills this session to help expose and counteract the health care law\u2019s misleading agenda.\n\n\u201cLast year, the House passed HR 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act which would end public funding for abortion, while alerting in 2015, consumers which plans in 2014 had abortion in them. As you all know, Harry Reid refused to allow a vote on that legislation and the president issued a statement of admin policy saying he would veto it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Congress should be different. We are hopeful the Senate will take up the legislation, we will take it up as well and hopefully this legislation will \u2013 even if the president vetoes it \u2013 it will be another step and another move in the direction of finally excising the killing of unborn children from abortion.\u201d\n\nWith an impressive amount of pro-lifers in Congress, Smith once again emphasized his belief that they will be able to slow down Obama\u2019s pro-abortion agenda.\n\n\u201cWe are now more optimistic that the life issues and the sanctity of human life and for marriage is something, especially given the fact that this administration, this president, he is the \u2018abortion president,\u2019 we are in the process of turning this around.\u201d\n\nWhy is he so confident?\n\n\u201cBecause people are waking up. The culture of denial is being replaced with a culture of enlightenment,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president misled Congress and Americans to accept a health care bill that would fund abortions..05/26/2016 4:03:55AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The president misled Congress and Americans to accept a health care bill that would fund abortions.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - \u201cLike Your Doctor, Keep Your Doctor\u201d Wasn\u2019t the Only Obamacare Lie", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/01/14/like-your-doctor-keep-your-doctor-wasnt-the-only-obamacare-lie-n1942941", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/13/2015-01-13T181928Z_1_LYNXMPEB0C0QL_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The president misled Congress and Americans to accept a health care bill that would fund abortions.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - \u201cLike Your Doctor, Keep Your Doctor\u201d Wasn\u2019t the Only Obamacare Lie", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/01/14/like-your-doctor-keep-your-doctor-wasnt-the-only-obamacare-lie-n1942941", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/13/2015-01-13T181928Z_1_LYNXMPEB0C0QL_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "\u201cLike Your Doctor, Keep Your Doctor\u201d Wasn\u2019t the Only Obamacare Lie, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde2f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cObamacare violates the Hyde funding by funding insurance plans and by paying for abortion on demand.\n\u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s cover-up of abortion insurance plans on the exchange is absolutely unnecessary, it\u2019s unacceptable, and it is unconscionable.\nConsumers have a right to know.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, Smith and his colleagues are introducing several pro-life bills this session to help expose and counteract the health care law\u2019s misleading agenda.\nWhen it comes to public funding for abortion, the 2015 open enrollment is at least as bad, if not worse, than last year, Smith said.\nPolitifact was right to name President Obama\u2019s \u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor\u201d proclamation as its 2013 \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d Yet, they missed out on another whopper of a fib a few years earlier in 2009."}
