Even when the researchers adjusted the hospital expenses to focus on patients with similar backgrounds, ages, and time spent in the hospital, they still found that the differences in what people were paying were significant. The study states in its conclusion: \u201cThese results indicate that charges and discounted prices for two common, relatively homogeneous diagnosis groups \u2014 uncomplicated vaginal delivery and Caesarean section \u2014 vary widely between hospitals and are not well explained by observable patient or hospital characteristics.\u201d\n\nOverall, the study found that California hospitals were more likely to charge more if they were located in areas with a high cost of living, treated a sicker population, or were for-profit institutions. But this didn\u2019t account for the majority of differences. It appears the wide variety of prices is linked to the fact that hospitals often charge whatever they want to.\n\n\u201cHealth care pricing is kind of like the Wild West,\u201d Dr. Renee Y. Hsia, the lead author of the study and an associate professor of emergency medicine at University California San Francisco, told Kaiser Health News. \u201cThere is no real system of health care pricing. The \u2018system\u2019 is that hospitals are allowed to charge whatever they want and whatever they feel they merit.\u201d In a study completed earlier, Hsia had reviewed the different prices for appendectomy in California. She found that they ranged from $1,500 to $182,955. \u201cIt\u2019s not an exception, it\u2019s the rule in the United States,\u201d she said.\n\nHospitals previously didn\u2019t give out information about fees and procedure costs in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Last year, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a report that identified the differences in costs for 100 medical procedures, and found there was a stark difference between what hospitals were charging patients. \u201cCurrently, consumers don\u2019t know what a hospital is charging them or their insurance company for a given procedure, like a knee replacement, or how much of a price difference there is at different hospitals, even within the same city,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told USA Today. \u201cThis data and new data centers will help fill that gap.\u201d The report found that a joint replacement in Oklahoma cost $5,300 in comparison to the same procedure done in California for $223,000. The data spurred a law that requires hospitals to provide patients with information about how much procedures cost, as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cMost perniciously, uninsured people are the ones who usually pay the highest prices for their hospital care,\u201d Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group, said in a statement, according to USA Today. \u201cIt is absurd \u2014 and, indeed, unconscionable \u2014 that the people least capable of paying for their hospital care bear the largest, and often unaffordable, cost burdens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hospital charges, kathleen sebelius, delivering baby costs, obamacare, affordable care act, the cost of giving birth", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The expense of having a baby in a hospital varies widely across California medical centers, with some charging significantly more than others.", "title": "Is Your Hospital Charging 11 Times More Than It Should For Childbirth?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cost-delivering-baby-why-some-hospitals-charge-11-times-more-others-267417", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/18/hospital-procedure.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The expense of having a baby in a hospital varies widely across California medical centers, with some charging significantly more than others.", "title": "Is Your Hospital Charging 11 Times More Than It Should For Childbirth?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cost-delivering-baby-why-some-hospitals-charge-11-times-more-others-267417", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/18/hospital-procedure.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/18/hospital-procedure.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-18T17:42:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-01T12:38:10-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The expense of having a baby in a hospital varies widely across California medical centers, with some charging significantly more than others."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05c0\"", "article_summary": "It appears the wide variety of prices is linked to the fact that hospitals often charge whatever they want to.\nA new study published in the journal BMJ reviewed 195 different hospitals\u2019 price tags when it came to delivering babies and found that the varying degree of expense is so wide that some California medical centers charge women 11 times more than others.\n\u201cThere is no real system of health care pricing.\nThe researchers looked at some 110,000 births and Caesarean sections, finding that the lowest charge was $3,296 and the highest was $37,227 \u2014 a trend that is mirrored throughout the U.S. health care system.\n\u201cIt is absurd \u2014 and, indeed, unconscionable \u2014 that the people least capable of paying for their hospital care bear the largest, and often unaffordable, cost burdens.\u201d"}
