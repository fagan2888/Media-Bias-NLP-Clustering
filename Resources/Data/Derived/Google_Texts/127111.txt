Bernie Sanders’ policy proposals would slow economic growth in the long term, the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget wrote in an analysis Thursday.

His proposal to implement a Medicare-for-All health plan would increase federal costs by $1.95 trillion, the group, which has been analyzing the costs of policy proposal from presidential candidates, said.

Overall, Sanders’ major initiatives would cost more than $17 trillion, assuming lower health costs, and up to $28 trillion, assuming higher health costs.

The group repeatedly praised Sanders for putting forth specific proposals to pay for his policy plans, though they said such revenues would not cover the total costs of his plans.

“These offsets will fall short of paying the full cost of Senator Sanders’s proposals, and they certainly fall short of putting the debt on a sustainable path,” the group wrote. “This is particularly troubling given that the magnitude of Senator Sanders’s tax increases leave few options available to further tackle the debt.”

In a February analysis, the group said that the proposed offsets for Sanders’ Medicare-for-All plan would only cover three-quarters of the costs of such a policy.
