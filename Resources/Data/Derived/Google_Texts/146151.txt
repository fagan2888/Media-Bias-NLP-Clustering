CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) - Clemson University has announced that it will ban the use of all tobacco products, inside or outdoors, starting next year.

Local media outlets report that the new policy was approved by the universityâ€™s administrative council and announced Wednesday after three years of discussions, surveys and consultations with different campus groups.

Clemson already bans smoking in buildings. Effective Jan. 1, the new rule also bans smoking in outdoor areas and adds smokeless tobacco to the indoor ban.

Although the administration, rather than the Board of Trustees made the decision, Board Chairman Smyth McKissick says he thinks his colleagues will embrace the move when they reconvene on campus next month.

Clemson joins over 1,600 colleges and universities with tobacco-free policies, including Tri-County Technical College, Anderson University and the University of South Carolina.
