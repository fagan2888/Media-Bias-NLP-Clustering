(Lee Walker/Sideline Carolina)\n\nThe pipeline between the Palmetto State and the Bay Area remains alive and well.\n\nOnline Read David Caraviello\u2019s blog at postandcourier.com/blog/spur-of-the-moment. Get more Carolina news at postandcourier.com/gamecocks.\n\nThe team which drafted South Carolina\u2019s Marcus Lattimore and Bruce Ellington the past two seasons doubled down on Gamecocks in the NFL draft Saturday, when the San Francisco 49ers took USC running back Mike Davis in the fourth round, and then picked up tight end Rory Anderson in the seventh.\n\nAlso Saturday, USC offensive tackle Corey Robinson went to Detroit in the seventh round. Including offensive guard A.J. Cann, who went to Jaguars in the third round Friday, the Gamecocks have had 19 players drafted in the past four years, and head coach Steve Spurrier has produced 104 career draft picks, the most of any active coach.\n\nWhile some analysts projected that Davis might linger until near the end of the draft, he went with the 126th overall selection, and the 27th of the fourth round. The Atlanta native goes to the same team which drafted Lattimore, his predecessor at USC, in the fourth round in 2013. And in San Francisco he\u2019ll reunite with Moncks Corner native Ellington, a former Gamecocks receiver drafted in the fourth round in 2014 who caught two touchdown passes last season.\n\n\u201cI love the weather. I love (49ers running backs) coach Tom Rathman a lot. Get to play with Bruce Ellington,\u201d Davis said through the 49ers\u2019 Twitter feed. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be nice.\u201d\n\nAnd when he arrives for mini-camp in Santa Clara, Calif., Davis will be joined by another former Gamecock \u2014 quarterback Dylan Thompson, who went undrafted but tweeted that he had signed a free-agent deal with the 49ers. San Francisco GM Trent Baalke was once a scout with the Washington Redskins under Spurrier.\n\n\u201cYou know they\u2019re going to be well-coached,\u201d Baalke, speaking to reporters in Santa Clara, said of USC players. \u201cYou know they\u2019re going to come into the league prepared, especially on the offensive side of the ball. You know they\u2019re going to come into the league well-versed. They\u2019re going to pick up information, they\u2019re always going to play three downs if they\u2019re a back, and they\u2019re prepared.\u201d\n\nAnother former Gamecock is staying closer to home \u2014 receiver Damiere Byrd tweeted that he had signed with the Carolina Panthers as an undrafted free agent.\n\nDavis left USC after an injury-plagued junior season where he rushed for 982 yards, 18 shy of becoming the first Gamecock back to compile consecutive 1,000-yard seasons since George Rogers did it from 1978-80. His 1,183 yards as a sophomore was the fourth-highest single-season mark in USC history, but he didn\u2019t display the same form as a junior, and was ranked by ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr. as the 12th-best tailback in the draft.\n\nWith Frank Gore now in Indianapolis, Baalke said the 49ers had their eyes on Davis, whose ability to catch the ball out of the backfield was particularly appealing. \u201cHe\u2019s a three-down back in the National Football League,\u201d Baalke said, \u201cand that was what we were looking for.\u201d\n\nThe 6-8, 344-pound Robinson, taken with the 240th overall pick, was a three-year starter who was tasked at USC with manning the quarterback\u2019s blind side. Offensive line coach Jeremiah Washburn said the Lions held a private workout with Robinson in Columbia, and Detroit\u2019s track record of adding proven players from the SEC didn\u2019t hurt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a little bit of success with that with our recent picks,\u201d Washburn told reporters in Detroit. As for Robinson\u2019s best attribute? \u201cHe gets out of bed big,\u201d Washburn added. \u201cHe rolls out of bed tall and long. He\u2019s smart.\u201d\n\nCann and Robinson represent the first two USC offensive linemen taken in the same draft since 1991, when Calvin Stephens went to the Patriots and Ike Harris to the Seahawks. By going with the 67th overall pick, Cann became the highest-drafted offensive lineman out of South Carolina since Earnest Dye went 18th overall to the Cardinals in 1993.\n\nAnderson, a 6-5, 227-pound native of Powder Springs, Ga., was chosen with the 254th overall \u2014 and third from last \u2014 pick. He caught 22 passes for 260 yards last year before his season ended due to a torn triceps muscle suffered against Clemson which also prevented him from working out at the NFL combine.\n\n\u201cHe was the highest-rated player on our board,\u201d said Baalke. \u201cYou never go wrong taking good football players.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Davis leads a Gamecocks reunion in San Francisco, while Robinson goes to Detroit, Sports, \r\nSportssouthcarolina, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Gamecocks,Mike Davis,NFL draft,San Francisco 49ers", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 The pipeline between the Palmetto State and the Bay Area remains alive and well.", "title": "Davis leads a Gamecocks reunion in San Francisco, while Robinson goes to Detroit", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150502/150509824/davis-leads-a-gamecocks-reunion-in-san-francisco-while-robinson-goes-to-detroit", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150502/PC20/150509824/AR/0/AR-150509824.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150502/PC20/150509824/AR/0/AR-150509824.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 The pipeline between the Palmetto State and the Bay Area remains alive and well.", "title": "Davis leads a Gamecocks reunion in San Francisco, while Robinson goes to Detroit", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150502/PC20/150509824/AR/0/AR-150509824.jpg?201505022116", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150509824}}, "keywords": "Davis leads a Gamecocks reunion in San Francisco, while Robinson goes to Detroit , Sports, \r\nSportssouthcarolina, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Gamecocks,Mike Davis,NFL draft,San Francisco 49ers", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-02T13:24:15Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-02T21:16:00Z", "author": "David Caraviello"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 The pipeline between the Palmetto State and the Bay Area remains alive and well."}, "article_summary": "Also Saturday, USC offensive tackle Corey Robinson went to Detroit in the seventh round.\n\u201cYou know they\u2019re going to come into the league prepared, especially on the offensive side of the ball.\nYou know they\u2019re going to come into the league well-versed.\n\u201cYou know they\u2019re going to be well-coached,\u201d Baalke, speaking to reporters in Santa Clara, said of USC players.\nThe Atlanta native goes to the same team which drafted Lattimore, his predecessor at USC, in the fourth round in 2013."}
