That should allow it to quickly shed an estimated $140 million in debt, and emerge from bankruptcy as a healthier company.\n\nAccording to CNNMoney, the company announced in February it was closing 155 company-owned restaurants in the U.S., effective immediately. That left it with 220 U.S. locations and more than 600 other locations owned by franchise operators in 40 different countries.\n\nThe closings left the company with some 2,700 employees.\n\nSpokesman Jonathan Dedmon told CNNMoney no further closings are envisioned under the bankruptcy plan. He said Sbarro has already closed its weaker locations and expects to shed 80 percent of its debt during the bankruptcy. It has also secured $20 million in new financing.\n\n\u201cThe previous closures and bankruptcy filing are part of an overall plan to invest in and grow the company for the future,\u201d he said.\n\nThis latest closing announcement was one of many mass store closing announcements so far in 2014.\n\nJust this month, Radio Shack announced plans to shut up to 1,100 stores, and office-supply giant Staples said it would close 225 locations.\n\nDepartment-store chain J.C. Penney announced in January it would close 33 stores, while Macy\u2019s said it would shut five stores and lay off 2,500 employees in a cost-cutting effort.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The news was not so mouth-watering for pizza fans Monday, as the Sbarro pizza chain filed for bankruptcy court protection.
