The doctor said you can't work like that [for] two to three weeks because [my] knees [were] swelling, hands swelling and I was staying home.\n\n\"I'm making arrangements - paying monthly little bit, little bit.\"\n\nUnder Obamacare - president Barack Obama's healthcare reforms - Ms Zapata can get a monthly private health insurance plan worth $US499.97, for which she will pay just $US25.97.\n\n\"My heart is bumping more fast - this is something wonderful for me,\" she said, clearly emotional when she signed up.\n\nOver 10 million Americans covered by Obamacare\n\nMore than 10 million Americans have medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act which came into effect at the end of 2013.\n\nThe president's health secretary said it was meeting its goals of access and affordability, and significantly, people with pre-existing health conditions could also no longer be denied health coverage.\n\nDr Linda Blumberg, an economist and former adviser to the Clinton White House who is now at the Urban Institute in Washington DC, said the program had cut the number of Americans without insurance by a third.\n\n\"The program put in place was not intended to cover everyone,\" she said.\n\nWhat is Obamacare? Affordable Care Act was passed by Congress in 2010\n\nPromised to help tens of millions of uninsured Americans get health coverage\n\nUnder the plan, people can buy cheap insurance on healthcare.gov\n\nMost coverage will cost less than $100 per month\n\nPolicies vary according to person's income, location, family size and level of coverage desired\n\nMore than 10 million people now have medical cover under the laws\n\nNumber of uninsured adults reduced by 26 per cent\n\n\"It was not a universal coverage plan. Our best estimate is that with everyone participating and changing their behaviour and realising what's out there for them, that we would decrease the number of uninsured [people] in the US by half.\n\n\"Right now we think we are probably in the neighbourhood of decreasing it by about a third.\"\n\nMs Blumberg said it was a political failure that the US was \"the only remaining developed nation that still has a large uninsured population\".\n\n\"That's a failure of political will essentially here and an aversion to re-distributing income and relying on government programs,\" she said.\n\n\"This law provides a great framework but doesn't solve problems until we put more resources into it.\n\n\"In a large number of states people can be extremely low income and have no federal assistance available to them, even though the law intended that to be implemented across the country.\"\n\nLow income for a family of four is defined as about $US24,000 per year.\n\nA total of 19 mostly Republican states have decided not to carry out the full expansion of Obamacare which would have allowed those low-income people to get help.\n\nThe campaign to repeal Obamacare has stagnated, although the speaker of the House, Republican John Boehner, described the program as America's \"biggest job-killer\".\n\nAfter the mid-term elections in November he said Obamacare was \"hurting the economy and hurting middle-class families and hurting the ability for employers to create more jobs\".\n\nLast month the House passed a federal budget giving Obamacare full funding, but some Republicans are now backing a legal challenge in nation's highest court.\n\nFour potentially fatal words\n\nThe Supreme Court challenge to the law to be heard in March could derail Obamacare entirely. It hinges on the words \"established by the state\".\n\nFour residents of Virginia launched a case that argued the federal government could not pay subsidies to people if they received private health insurance in a state which did not establish its own Obamacare insurance exchange.\n\nThe exchange is a website which allows people to input their personal information and shop across a range of private health insurance plans to decide what they like and can afford.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the King v Burwell case are essentially arguing that the law as it stands allows for Obamacare subsidies to be paid only in states which have opted in to the law by running their own Obamacare insurance exchanges.\n\nThirty-six states do not have their own exchanges, and rely on the federal government for the service.\n\nA lawyer representing several Republican senators who have joined the case as interested observers wrote in an online blog that \"state is a defined term under the act and plainly does not mean the federal government\".\n\nThe defendant, new health and human services secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, disagreed, telling a press conference before Christmas that she believed the law was on the government's side.\n\nBut if the Supreme Court decides in favour of the applicants, Dr Blumberg said it would be \"devastating\" for coverage in those 36 states without exchanges.\n\n\"You would see many more people becoming uninsured again, and the financial burdens for buying insurance increases and the average premiums go up at the same time,\" she said.\n\n\"It could all unravel in those states, and then the big question is, if the clock is set back to the pre-Affordable Care Act days, does the law remain in the states where it is working or does political pressure to repeal it there become even stronger?\"\n\nObamacare is certain to remain an issue for debate in a now Republican-controlled Congress from January 6.\n\nTopics: world-politics, obama-barack, health-insurance, united-states\n\nFirst posted", "article_metadata": {"ABC_WCMS_sitesearch_include": "true", "ContentId": 5994348, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/6001962-1x1-700x700.jpg", "site": "@ABCNews", "card": "summary"}, "ICBM": "38,-97", "keywords": "Obamacare, Obama, healthcare, insurance, republican, senator, anniversary", "DC.language": "en-AU", "DC.title": "Obamacare passes one-year anniversary as fresh legal challenge looms", "geo.position": "38;-97", "DCTERMS.modified": "2015-01-06T11:14:42+1100", "DC.type": "Current", "DC.date": "2015-01-06T09:51:11+1100", "DC.rights": "http://www.abc.net.au/conditions.htm#UseOfContent", "DCTERMS.spatial": "east=-97;north=38", "DC.creator.CorporateName": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "ABC.site": "ABC News", "DCTERMS.issued": "2015-01-06T09:51:11+1100", "description": "More than 10 million people in the United States have taken up health insurance since president Barack Obama's healthcare reforms came into effect a year ago, but a new legal challenge against the laws loom in the nation's highest court.", "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.identifier": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-06/obamacare-reaches-one-year-anniversary/5994348", "ABC.tags": "world-politics;obama-barack;health-insurance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/abcnews.au", "tag": "Health", "published_time": "2015-01-06T09:51:11+1100", "modified_time": "2015-01-06T11:14:42+1100", "author": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/michael-vincent/4269358"}, "DC.rightsHolder": "ABC", "DC.Publisher.CorporateName": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "More than 10 million people take up insurance in the first year of Obamacare, but legal challenges loom.", "title": "Obamacare passes one-year anniversary as fresh legal challenge looms", "url": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-06/obamacare-reaches-one-year-anniversary/5994348", "image": {"width": 700, "identifier": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/6001962-1x1-700x700.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 700}, "updated_time": "2015-01-06T11:14:42+1100", "type": "Article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ABC News", "ABC.editorialGenre": "News & Current Affairs", "title": "Obamacare passes one-year anniversary as fresh legal challenge looms", "DC.subject": "Government and Politics:World Politics;Person:Obama, Barack;Health:Health Insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc1e\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare passes one-year anniversary but fresh US Supreme Court challenge loomsUpdatedIf the Australian Government warns its citizens not to travel to the United States without private health insurance, imagine what it is like for those who live there without it.\nUnder Obamacare -
