However, getting involved is time-consuming. You have to learn about a topic, stay up to date on elected officials, news, and legislation, and connect with other supporters.\n\nAs a result, many voters have minimal interaction with the political process outside of elections every 2 to 4 years.\n\niCitizen wants to heighten this engagement and inspire action by monitoring and delivering relevant information to your phone, and opening up channels for communication.\n\nPeople choose from 18 different issues to follow when they sign up, such as education, gun rights, taxation, women\u2019s health, etc. iCitizen will track relevant news stories and political activity relating to those issues.\n\nThe app also prompts you to select and rate your representatives at the federal and state level. It will then track all relevant activity from those representatives and show you what bills they are voting on. You can express your support or opposition in the app and voice your opinion on questions like \u201cis the economy getting stronger?\u201d\n\nFor officials, iCitizen provides a quick and easy way to tap into the opinions of constituents.\n\nThe first official report of iCitizen\u2019s findings delivered to Congress found that 73% of iCitizens do not see added benefit from the Affordable Care Act, 61% of iCitizens do not want increased restrictions on buying firearms, and 64% of iCitizens disagree with raising the federal debt ceiling.\n\nOne of the challenges for apps like iCitizen is achieving a critical mass of constituents and lawmakers \u2014 a significant amount of both are necessary for success. Without enough constituents, lawmakers won\u2019t take the polling seriously. Without enough lawmakers, people won\u2019t feel like their opinions are being heard.\n\niCitizen launched in November, and its iPhone app has been downloaded more than 200,000 times, with an Android app in the pipeline.\n\nInvestors include Harry Jacobson, founder of Contact Software. iCitizen\u2019s advisory board includes former U.S. Senator and Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist; Liza Lowery Massey, former CIO of the City of Los Angeles and the City and County of San Francisco; Andrew Rice, former Democratic State Senator of Oklahoma, and a number of private sector leaders.", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2014-02-11T11:00:36+00:00", "author": "rebecca-grant", "modDate": "2014-02-11T11:00:36+00:00", "keywords": "civic-engagement,government,politics", "type": "news", "id": 893623}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "iCitizen has raised $3.3 million for its mobile app that tracks and monitors relevant information about elected officials, hot topics, and votes.", "title": "iCitizen aims to strengthen American democracy with a mobile\u00a0app", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/11/icitizen-aims-to-strengthen-american-democracy-with-a-mobile-app/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/american-flag.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "iCitizen has raised $3.3 million for its mobile app that tracks and monitors relevant information about elected officials, hot topics, and\u00a0votes.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd476e\"", "article_summary": "iCitizen is a startup with the ambitious aim of strengthening our democracy through a mobile app.\niCitizen launched in November, and its iPhone app has been downloaded more than 200,000 times, with an Android app in the pipeline.\niCitizen will track relevant news stories and political activity relating to those issues.\niCitizen keeps track of political issues you care about and what your elected officials are up to, making it easier to stay up to date and voice your opinions.\nIt will then track all relevant activity from those representatives and show you what bills they are voting on."}
