The program allows caregivers, social workers, guardians and the kids themselves the ability to communicate and share information over the Internet.\n\nEventually, the policies and practices being tested in Ventura County could be applied to all children, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe use of an \u2018electronic backpack\u2019 that safely stores accurate, timely and complete information about a child and allows it to be shared with medical providers and others as appropriate is an approach that could benefit all children,\u201d said Ginny Puddefoot, director of Health IT Initiatives for Vulnerable Youth at The Children\u2019s Partnership, one of the private partners.\n\nThe Children\u2019s Partnership has plans to expand the project to all parts of the state. A similar program is launching in Sacramento County.\n\nMany Policy, Bureaucratic Hurdles To Overcome\n\n\u201cThe concept of taking two separate functions \u2014 especially government functions \u2014 and coordinating them is challenging enough,\u201d said Barry Zimmerman, director of Ventura County\u2019s Human Services Agency. \u201cBut when you start dealing with the complexities and privacy issues of integrating health care and foster care for youth, there are a lot of policy issues that need to be overcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think Ventura is a good place to start this kind of effort because we have a robust county hospital system that allows us to work basically with one entity on the health care side and that will make interoperability easier. At least we hope so,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nChildren in foster care often don\u2019t have built-in support systems and background knowledge of family medical histories so coordinating care becomes more important, officials said.\n\n\u201cThis tool can improve care coordination and outcomes for children whose lives and care tend to be more fragmented and chaotic,\u201d Puddefoot said.\n\n\u201cThe reason we focus on children and youth in foster care is that this is a uniquely vulnerable population of children whose health care and health outcomes have been documented to be significantly below those of their non-foster care peers,\u201d Puddefoot said.\n\nLessons learned in Ventura can be used elsewhere.\n\n\u201cOur vision is very much that this approach can be extended to other vulnerable populations, such as children with special health care needs, children in Medi-Cal, and homeless youth. In fact, this approach is being designed so it can be adapted and implemented across the state and nationally,\u201d Puddefoot said. Medi-Cal is California\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nFiles Will Follow Children\n\nThe intention is that a child\u2019s electronic file will follow the child as he or she moves in and out of various care settings. Each backpack will have different contents, depending on the individual\u2019s circumstances, but the basics in each file will be clinical records as well as an accounting of the child\u2019s history in the social welfare system. The information will be available to case workers, new caregivers, health care providers and others \u201cto the extent authorized by existing privacy and confidentiality laws,\u201d Puddefoot said. The project is designed to adhere to all provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.\n\n\u201cThe electronic files are designed to allow specific information to be shared with specific individuals under specific circumstances. What information is shared will vary depending on the authorizations and circumstances,\u201d Puddefoot said.\n\nFor example, foster parents may be authorized to see certain information about the medical conditions of a child in their care. That\u2019s the case legally now, but because paper records are often lost, incomplete or out-of-date as children move from place to place, the hope is that electronic records will be more timely, accurate, complete and always readily available, officials said.\n\nEventually, records may be available all over the state and country, but for now, the pilot promises they\u2019ll be available only within Ventura County.\n\n\u201cWhile our vision is that these electronic files should be available to outside-the-area social workers or health care providers \u2026 achieving this goal is some years in the future,\u201d Puddefoot said. The Children\u2019s Partnership \u201cis working at both the county and state levels to lay the groundwork for this to become a reality for California,\u201d Puddefoot said.\n\nProject\u2019s Roots Traced to Health Information Exchange\n\nHealth information exchange efforts funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Affordable Care Act\u2019s support of HIE networks laid the groundwork for the Ventura project, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe goal of having uniformity of health information is what sparked the idea here,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cThere was a lot of early momentum in California for health information exchange and that momentum I think is why we are able to get this project off the ground.\u201d\n\nPhase one of the Ventura project, expected to be completed in 2015, is funded with a variety of public funds and private philanthropic contributions.\n\nPublic partners \u2014 Ventura County Human Services Agency, Ventura County Health Care Agency and California HHS \u2014 are joined by The Children\u2019s Partnership, Verizon Foundation, Sierra Health Foundation, Ventura County Medical Resource Foundation and KCN Consulting from the private sector.\n\n\u201cThis project is a powerful example of how technical innovation, combined with knowledge of children\u2019s needs, can lead to stronger support for kids and a more efficient use of taxpayer money. We are very pleased to see California taking the lead in this field,\u201d said Wendy Lazarus, founder and co-president of The Children\u2019s Partnership, a not-for-profit children\u2019s advocacy organization.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A pilot project using information technology and the Internet to coordinate social workers and health care providers working with foster children launched last week in Ventura County.
