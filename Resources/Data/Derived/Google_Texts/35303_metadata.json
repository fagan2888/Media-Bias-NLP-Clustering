Or shall we try to forget it?\n\nIt is always hard to know when a turning point has been reached, and usually it is long afterwards before we recognize it. If 2015 has been a turning point, it may well have marked a turn in a downward direction for America and for Western civilization.\n\nThis was the year when we essentially let the world know that we were giving up any effort to try to stop Iran \u2014 the world\u2019s leading sponsor of international terrorism \u2014 from getting a nuclear bomb.\n\nIt will not matter if we have more nuclear bombs than they have, if they are willing to die and we are not. That can determine who surrenders. And ISIS and other terrorists have given us grisly demonstrations of what surrender would mean.\n\nPutting aside, for the moment, the fateful question of whether 2015 is a turning point, what do we see when we look back instead of looking forward? What characterizes the year that is now ending?\n\nMore than anything else, 2015 has been the year of the big lie. There have been lies in other years, and some of them pretty big, but even so, 2015 has set new highs \u2014 or new lows.\n\nThis is the year when we learned, from Hillary Clinton\u2019s own e-mails, after three long years of stalling, stone-walling and evasions, that Clinton, as secretary of state, lied \u2014 and so did President Barack Obama and others under him \u2014 when they all told us in 2012 that the terrorist attack in Benghazi that killed the American ambassador and three other Americans was not a terrorist attack, but a protest demonstration that got out of hand.\n\n\u201cWhat difference, at this point, does it make?\u201d as Clinton later melodramatically remarked at a Congressional committee hearing investigating that episode.\n\nFirst of all, it made enough of a difference for some of the highest officials of American government to concoct a false story that they knew at the time was false.\n\nIt mattered enough that, if the truth had come out, on the eve of a presidential election, it could have destroyed Barack Obama\u2019s happy tale of how he had dealt a crippling blow to terrorists by killing Osama bin Laden (with an assist from the Navy\u2019s SEALs).\n\nHad Obama\u2019s lies about his triumph over terrorism been exposed on the eve of the election, that could have ended his stay in the White House. And that could have spared us and the world many of Obama\u2019s disasters in the Middle East and elsewhere around the world. That is why it matters, and will continue to matter in the future.\n\nLying gains acceptance\n\nLying, by itself, is obviously not new. What is new is the growing acceptance of lying as \u201cno big deal\u201d by smug sophisticates, so long as these are lies that advance their political causes. Many in the media greeted the exposure of Clinton\u2019s lies by admiring how well she handled herself.\n\nThe biggest lie of 2014 \u2014 \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d \u2014 had its repercussions in 2015, with the open advocacy of the killing of policemen in marches across the country. But the ambush killings of policemen that followed aroused no such outrage in the media as any police use of force against thugs.\n\nNor has there been the same outrage as the murder rate shot up when the police pulled back, as they have in the past, in the wake of being scapegoated by politicians and the media. Most of the people murdered have been black. But apparently these particular black lives don\u2019t matter much to activists and the media.\n\nNo one expects that lies will disappear from political rhetoric. If you took all the lies out of politics, how much would be left?\n\nIf there is anything that is bipartisan in Washington, it is lying. The most recent budget deal showed that Congressional Republicans lied wholesale when they said that they would defund Obamacare, Planned Parenthood and other pet projects of the Democrats.\n\nAs for 2015, good riddance. We can only hope that people who vote in 2016 will have learned something from 2015\u2019s disasters.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "How shall we remember 2015?
