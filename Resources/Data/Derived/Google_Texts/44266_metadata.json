Lea Hidalgo, CC BY 2.0\n\nIt\u2019s probably safe to say that as teens we all knew someone who smoked cigarettes, someone who swore they never would, and someone who said they only did it here and there. Just like hookah, smoking cigarettes here and there may seem harmless, but it\u2019s not. Yet many teens believe it is, according to a new study.\n\n\u201cAll smoking counts,\u201d said lead author Stephen Amrock, a student of pediatric medicine at New York University School of Medicine, according to HealthDay. \u201cSocial smoking has a price, and even the occasional cigarette truly is bad for you. Light and intermittent smokers face tremendous future health risks.\u201d\n\nCigarettes contain over 7,000 chemicals, with 69 of them known to cause cancer, according to the American Lung Association. Every time a teen drags a cigarette, they\u2019re exposing all the organs in their body to those chemicals \u2014 even if it\u2019s their first cigarette in two or three days. Results from the study on 24,658 teens, however, showed that almost a quarter of them felt intermittent smoking caused no harm. Specifically, 35 percent of light smokers (a few cigarettes a day) and 14 percent of intermittent smokers (smoking in intervals; stopping for a few days) said their own levels of tobacco use weren\u2019t harmful, the NY Daily News reported.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say these teens were oblivious to the harms of smoking. Roughly 90 percent of them said heavy smoking \u2014 defined as 10 cigarettes per day \u2014 was very harmful. But as frequency of use dropped, so did teens\u2019 perceptions of the harm; 64 percent said light smoking was very harmful while only 33 percent said intermittent smoking was very harmful.\n\n\u201cOur findings suggest that public health efforts have been working, but that those efforts have likely been incomplete,\u201d Amrock said. \u201cDecades of anti-tobacco work have succeeded in convincing adolescents that heavy smoking patterns are dangerous, but the complete message has not been broadly received.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that it could be easier for light and intermittent smokers to quit, Amrock said \u2014 these people are likely not yet addicted to nicotine. Helping them quit could be as easy as educating them on the dangers they\u2019re making themselves available to. Getting this done early is crucial to lowering smoking rates, which currently stand at an estimated 46.6 million adults, because 68 percent of smokers began smoking regularly at age 18 or younger.\n\n\u201cPreventing tobacco use is among the most cost-effective things we can do as a health care system,\u201d Amrock said. \u201cMaking sure that all teens understand just how dangerous all tobacco is, [is] an important first step in curbing tobacco use nationwide.\u201d\n\nSource: Amrock S, Weitzman M.
