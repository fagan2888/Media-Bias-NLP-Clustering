The largest number of defections were among female voters ages 18-54, 31 percent of whom said they would not have supported the president.\n\nAn ABC/Washington Post poll released earlier this week found that if they had a do-over, Romney would win 49 percent to 45 percent. The difference is within the margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, but Obama polls a lower percentage of the vote today than he did in November 2012.\n\nA generic ballot question on the poll found likely voters favoring Republicans for 2014: 39 percent of independents said they would vote for the unspecified Republican candidate over the unspecified Democratic candidate, compared to 30 percent who said they would vote for the Democrat.\n\nEight percent of Democrats said they would vote Republican, compared to just four percent of Republicans who said they would vote Democrat.\n\nThe poll surveyed 801 likely voters with live phone interviews and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nThe sample of 2012 Obama voters was 384 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nFollow Alexis on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alexis Levinson", "description": "If voters had been aware last year that they might lose their health-care plans when Obamacare went into effect, Republican President Mitt Romney would be", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "If voters had been aware last year that they might lose their health-care plans when Obamacare went into effect, Republican President Mitt Romney would be sitting in the White House today, according t", "title": "Poll: If voters had known they\u2019d lose insurance, Romney would have won", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/22/poll-if-voters-had-known-theyd-lose-insurance-romney-would-have-won/", "image": {"width": 623, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Romney113-e1383495693279.jpg", "height": 268}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Twenty-three percent of Obama voters said they would not have voted to re-elect them had they known", "title": "Poll: If voters had known they\u2019d lose insurance, Romney would have won Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/22/poll-if-voters-had-known-theyd-lose-insurance-romney-would-have-won/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Romney113-e1383495693279.jpg"}, "creator": "@alexis_levinson", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-22 17:47:24", "sailthru.title": "Poll: If voters had known they'd lose insurance, Romney would have won", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "affordable-care-act,barack-obama,mitt-romney,obamacare,alexis-levinson", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "affordable care act,barack obama,mitt romney,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "If voters had been aware last year that they might lose their health-care plans when Obamacare went into effect, Republican President Mitt Romney would be sitting in the White House today, according t", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Romney113-e1383495693279.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Eight percent of Democrats said they would vote Republican, compared to just four percent of Republicans who said they would vote Democrat.\nThe sample of 2012 Obama voters was 384 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n3982041If voters had been aware last year that they might lose their health-care plans when Obamacare went into effect, Republican President Mitt Romney would be sitting in the White House today, according to a poll released Friday.\nThe poll surveyed 801 likely voters with live phone interviews and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\nThe largest number of defections were among female voters ages 18-54, 31 percent of whom said they would not have supported the president."}
