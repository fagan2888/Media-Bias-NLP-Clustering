There\u2019re so many alternatives that are so much better.\u201d\n\nTrump said \u201cObama lied\u201d when he said the federal health care program would allow people to keep their current physicians and insurance plans, and he said that wasn\u2019t the case. Trump cited reports that Obamacare users are unhappy with high deductibles, and that the national health care program is seeing falling approval ratings.\n\nTrump also talked about the need to build a wall across the southern U.S. border with Mexico to curb illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall, it\u2019s going to be a great wall, it\u2019s not going to be a little toy, we\u2019re going to build it for not a lot of money\u2026\u201d said Trump.\n\nThe wall would span 2,000 miles across the border, with 1,000 of the wall and the rest \u201cnatural barriers,\u201d he said.\n\nWe cannot display this gallery\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stop people from coming into our country illegally\u2026and if they want to come in legally we want them to come in, and they have to go through the process\u2026\u201d added Trump.\n\nTrump also turned his attention to Hillary Clinton and the email controversy, where Clinton stored public emails on a personal server at her New York home.\n\n\u201cHillary shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run because what she did is illegal,\u201d said Trump, who added he wants face Clinton for the presidency.\n\nThe Republican also promised reforms in the Veterans Affairs medical system and praised its doctors but denounced its administrators. He also promised to bring jobs back to the U.S. that have been outsourced to countries like China, Japan, and Mexico, giving more college graduates the opportunity for work.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re choking with debt,\u201d Trump said of recent college graduates. \u201cThey\u2019ve went two years or four years to college, and they can\u2019t get a job when they get out.\u201d\n\nA U.S. Secret Service official said 1,200 packed the Commerical Building at the fairgrounds to see the candidate. Trump said heavy rain during the days leading up to his appearance nearly forced the cancelation of the event.\n\nA spokeswoman at the fairgrounds said the Trump campaign requested an indoor space to hold the rally. Previous rallies by major political candidates were held outdoors in a field at the fairgrounds.\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democrat seeking the presidency visited the fairgrounds in September. Obama also rallied at the fairgrounds during his run for office in 2008.\n\nPrince William, a \u201cswing county\u201d and second-largest jurisdiction in the commonwealth, and continues draw the attention of politicians who see it as a political bellwether for Virginia. Prince Wiliam is made up of a majority-minority, population, and the county is considered \u201cpurple\u201d with Fairfax to the north a \u201cblue\u201d county and Stafford to the south firmly \u201cred\u201d territory.\n\nJason Sulser, of Fredericksburg, unfurled a Confederate battle flag inside the Commerical Building before Trump took the stage. He flag was obstructing the view of some at the rally, and he was escorted out by police.\n\nAn Alexandria woman brought a Bernie Sanders campaign sign into the building and was asked to move to the back of the room. Signs were prohibited from the rally and were confiscated at a security check, some rally attendees said.\n\nA group of protesters also gathered outside the entrance of the Commerical Building, linked hands and shouted \u201cdump Trump.\u201d The protesters were asked to leave, and the majority white group began shouting \u201cblack lives matter\u201d as police escorted them out.\n\nTrump supporters said they like that the candidate \u201cspeaks his mind\u201d and because he seen as a political outsider.\n\n\u201cIf he all of a sudden says \u2018I\u2019m going to do something about the second amendment, if he changes it, he\u2019d be off my list really quick. I like that he protects it a lot,\u201d Brian Aiello, of Fairfax. \u201cIf he goes the other way, so will I.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Potomac Local", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://potomaclocal.com/2015/12/03/trump-rallies-manassas-calls-for-end-of-obamacare-wall-between-u-s-and-mexico/", "article_author_name": "Potomac Local", "image": "http://potomaclocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/trump1.jpg", "site_id": "21d11a6178e95e48c5d3d01ae35422fe", "article_published_time": "2015-12-03T14:49:32+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T12:42:35+00:00", "keywords": "manassas local, news", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "generator": "NextGEN Gallery Optimizer Basic v2.1.3", "og": {"site_name": "Potomac Local", "description": "Donald Trump drew a mixture of fans from his TV days and\u00a0his presidential campaign\u00a0supporters to the Prince William County Fairgrounds...", "title": "Trump rallies Manassas: Calls for end of Obamacare, wall between U.S. and Mexico - Potomac Local", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://potomaclocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/trump1.jpg", "height": 416}, "updated_time": "2015-12-03T11:35:20-04:00", "url": "http://potomaclocal.com/2015/12/03/trump-rallies-manassas-calls-for-end-of-obamacare-wall-between-u-s-and-mexico/", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "0a55ba0c77b2036175bb0e817e4e3681"}, "google-site-verification": "gJabQu49Pm9Zl4QAE5KZHcaE3FzdaWTadTu7PaUBG-Y", "article": {"section": "Manassas Local", "published_time": "2015-12-03T09:49:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-03T11:35:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd68\"", "article_summary": "Trump supporters said they like that the candidate \u201cspeaks his mind\u201d and because he seen as a political outsider.\nTrump also talked about the need to build a wall across the southern U.S. border with Mexico to curb illegal immigration.\nDonald Trump drew a mixture of fans from his TV days and his presidential campaign supporters to the Prince William County Fairgrounds Wednesday night.\nThe wall would span 2,000 miles across the border, with 1,000 of the wall and the rest \u201cnatural barriers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get rid of Obamacare which is a disaster,\u201d Trump said to applause."}
