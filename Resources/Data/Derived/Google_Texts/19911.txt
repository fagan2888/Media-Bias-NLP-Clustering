Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield.

Topspin

It's Friday, Oct. 16, the day after President Barack Obama announced he’d be keeping some troops in Afghanistan past his time in the White House after all.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will appear in Chicago on Friday morning at David Axelrod’s Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago.

Pelosi and Axelrod are expected to talk about the “disarray of House Republicans, upcoming deadlines facing Congress and the 2016 elections,” Pelosi aide Evangeline George said.

No word if Pelosi will have more to say about the man she followed as speaker: Illinois Republican Dennis Hastert.

Hastert’s lawyers told a judge Thursday he will plead guilty to an indictment alleging he agreed to make $3.5 million in hush money payments to cover up wrongdoing from years ago.

In May, Pelosi told MSNBC: “Well, when we ran for — when Mr. Hastert was the speaker, our run for winning the House in '06 was to say that we were running against a culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence. At the time, there were many indictments, but we had no idea that that would include the speaker of the House.”

The 75-year-old California Democrat is the first woman to serve as House speaker, a post she held from 2007 to 2011. She entered Congress in 1987.

The GOP retook House control after the 2010 mid-terms and now hold 247 seats to the Democrats’ 188.

Pelosi’s successor, Republican House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, is stepping down from the post — another topic that could come up, given the succession situation. (Katherine Skiba)

From the notebook

*Rauner in Quincy: The governor on Thursday said Chicago’s financial problems will push a budget deal in Springfield.

“I’m cautiously optimistic that we’re going to get (a budget) in the next 60 to 90 days, frankly, if for no other reason than Chicago needs help and I said I’m willing — I’m not going to do a bailout, but I’ll help Chicago solve its own problems by giving them the power to do it, but only if Chicago is helping us get reforms at the state. This is a two-way partnership … and Chicago needs help in December and January, big, big help," Rauner said during an appearance in Quincy. (Kim Geiger)

*Busy news day: On Oct. 28, ex-U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert plans to plead guilty in his federal case. That’s the same day the Chicago City Council is scheduled to vote on Mayor Emanuel’s budget, the one with the record property tax increase and several other tax and fee hikes. Game 2 of the World Series also will be played that day, which may end up being of local interest.

*In her court: First lady Michelle Obama partners with NBA superstar LeBron James in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday as part of her “Reach Higher” initiative that encourages students to continue their education past high school.
