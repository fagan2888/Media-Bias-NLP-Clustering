Autonomy\n\nBy Dr. James Palermo // February 27, 2014\n\nBIPARTISAN HOUSE BILL WOULD ALLOW ARNP PRACTICE WITHOUT PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION\n\nHealthcare facilities in Florida and nationwide are gearing up to meet the enhanced demand for primary care physicians that has begun with millions of people obtaining health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA, aka Obamacare).\n\nFlorida House leaders proposed a bill that would expand the power of advanced registered nurse practitioners (ARNP), who have more advanced education and training in direct primary medical care than registered nurses, to address the anticipated shortage of primary-care physicians in Florida.\n\nLast week, the Florida House Select Committee on Healthcare Work Force Innovation, with bipartisan support and a vote of 13-2, approved the bill (PCB SCHCWI 14-01), which would allow advanced registered nurse practitioners to provide care without physician supervision.\n\nARNPs have long sought the expanded power and argued that primary care physicians are in short supply, so it\u2019s only sensible to make full use of nurses who have postgraduate training.\n\nFORMIDABLE OPPOSITION TO ARNP AUTONOMY\n\nHowever, these types of \u201cscope of practice\u201d issues have historically been highly controversial, and groups such as the Florida Medical Association (FMA) oppose lifting physician-supervision requirements.\n\nThe FMA has staunch support in the Florida Senate.\n\nDon Gaetz (R-Niceville), president of the Florida Senate, presents a formidable obstacle to passage of the bill and came out strongly against the proposal during an interview Friday with The News Service of Florida.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m against it,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cI think if you want to be a doctor, go to medical school.\u201d\n\nARNP AUTONOMY ALLOWED IN NEARLY HALF OF THE STATES\n\nARNPs and House supporters of the bill claim that beyond addressing a shortage of primary-care physicians in the state, sound rationale for passage of the bill is that ARNPs already provide much of the care that the bill would allow, and nearly half the states allow ARNPs to practice independent of a supervising physician.\n\nSENATE PRESIDENT, GAETZ, SUPPORTS FMA PROPOSAL\n\nGaetz said the state should address primary-care shortages in other ways, such as expanding medical-residency programs to train and keep doctors in Florida, and supports the FMA\u2019s proposal.\n\nRather than deregulate and grant more autonomy to ARNPs to practice out on their own, not just as a staff member in a doctor\u2019s practice, the FMA has proposed a five-point strategic plan to address the primary care shortage.\n\nThis includes additional funding for family practice residency slots, fair pay for family doctors who treat Medicaid patients, new technologies such as telemedicine, and a student loan forgiveness program geared to primary care.\n\nPASSAGE NOT LIKELY THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\nThe legislative debate remains focused on the question, to innovate, do we need to deregulate, and will continue to hinge on what services trained doctors and nurses in the appropriate settings can deliver to meet the increasing demands for primary care and ensure safe, high quality healthcare.\n\nWith the power to kill legislation in the hands of Senate President Gaetz, it is very unlikely that this bill will pass in the upcoming legislative session.\n\nWhen asked if the House proposal is dead in the Senate, Gaetz did not give a direct answer, but said, \u201cI\u2019ll vote against it if it gets to the floor.\u201d\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "advanced registered nurse practioners,florida house of representatives,florida medical
