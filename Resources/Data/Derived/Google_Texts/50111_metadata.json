It\u2019s time we join the growing number of states who recognize the benefits that NP\u2019s provide to their communities.\u201d\n\nThere are currently 21 states and the District of Columbia that allow nurse practitioners to practice independently, according to a news release from The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania, or HAP.\n\nHAP said it supports allowing nurse practitioners to practice without physician supervision or a collaborative agreement, as long as they work under a doctor\u2019s supervision for at least three years and 3,600 hours, a news release said.\n\nHAP also said it supports nurse practitioners who are licensed in another state and meet the three-year/3,600-hour requirement to practice in Pennsylvania without a collaborative agreement.\n\n\u201cThe 2010 Affordable Care Act is the largest overhaul to our nation\u2019s health care system since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965,\u201d HAP President and CEO Andy Carter said. \u201cIt has required a comprehensive rethinking of the way care is provided. This rethinking also must include the role of health care professionals in new, team-based models of care.\u201d\n\nThe Pennsylvania Medical Society continues to object to nurse practitioners practicing independently. It would prefer to see more collaboration between physicians and nurse practitioners.\n\n\u201cWith the complexity of patients increasing, and the need to promote team-based care between health care professionals, now is not the time for hospitals to make things worse by further risking the safety of their patients by lobbying to eliminate physician-nurse practitioner collaboration,\u201d Dr. Scott Shapiro, president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society and a practicing physician in Montgomery County, said. \u201cInstead, HAP should be promoting team care that is best for patients and providers. Studies have consistently shown that when health care professionals work together in a coordinated, efficient manner, care improves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Central Penn Business Journal", "description": "On Tuesday, nurse practitioners rallied in Harrisburg in their fight to practice independently in Pennsylvania, a cause that has drawn support from The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsy", "title": "Nurse practitioners rally to practice independently | CPBJ", "url": "http://www.cpbj.com/article/20160505/BLOGEXTRA/160509904/nurse-practitioners-rally-to-practice-independently", "image": "http://www.cpbj.com/storyimage/JP/20160505/BLOGEXTRA/160509904/AR/0/AR-160509904.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "cpbj.com", "description": "On Tuesday, nurse practitioners rallied in Harrisburg in their fight to practice independently in Pennsylvania, a cause that has drawn support from The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsy", "title": "Nurse practitioners rally to practice independently | CPBJ", "image": {"src": "http://www.cpbj.com/storyimage/JP/20160505/BLOGEXTRA/160509904/AR/0/AR-160509904.jpg"}, "site": "@cpbj", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "On Tuesday, nurse practitioners rallied in Harrisburg in their fight to practice independently in Pennsylvania, a cause that has drawn support from The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "On Tuesday, nurse practitioners rallied in Harrisburg in their fight to practice independently in Pennsylvania, a cause that has drawn support from The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania.\nRight now, for a nurse practitioner to practice in this state they must first have collaborative agreements with two physicians, which are basically contracts that allow them to practice alone.\n\u201cNurse practitioners have the skills and training to assist our most vulnerable populations.\nStudies have consistently shown that when health care professionals work together in a coordinated, efficient manner, care improves.\u201d\nThis rethinking also must include the role of health care professionals in new, team-based models of care.\u201dThe Pennsylvania Medical Society continues to object to nurse practitioners practicing independently."}
