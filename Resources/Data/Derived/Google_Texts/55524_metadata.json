Her support for the Iraq war (before she was against it) likely cost her the presidential nomination in 2008. She\u2019s not been on the cutting edge of social issues either, trailing instead of leading on gay marriage. Even on health care she wasn\u2019t, say, with former Vermont governor Howard Dean; instead she was an advocate of the individual mandate and a plan that became the essence of Obamacare. And yet she is heading into a Democratic presidential primary in 2016 as the \u201cinevitable,\u201d albeit stodgy, nominee. Like the president, she is now the defender of the status quo \u2014 no on school choice, no on entitlement reform, no on Obamacare modification. It is inevitable for the candidate whose party holds the White House to wind up either the beneficiary (George H.W. Bush) or the victim (Sen. John McCain) of the incumbent\u2019s current performance. She is not, needless to say, a fresh face nor a purveyor of fresh ideas.\n\nHillary Clinton (left) deflects questions about running for president in Tempe, Ariz., this month. (REUTERS/Samantha Sais)\n\nIn Clinton\u2019s case, not only does she have to contend with the Obama administration\u2019s failures (including some for which she was directly responsible), but she must also keep the base engaged (despite her \u201cinevitability\u201d) and fend off a challenge from the left. The Post gives a hint as to how she plans on doing it, reporting that at a Clinton Global Initiative forum, \u201cClinton also spoke forcefully about climate change, saying she hopes the millennial generation sparks a \u2018mass movement\u2019 to bring environmental issues to the forefront of American politics. \u2018This is not just some ancillary issue,\u2019 Clinton said. \u2018This will determine in large measure the quality of life in so many places around the world. I\u2019m hoping that there will be this mass movement that demands political change.'\u201d Really?\n\nFirst of all, her timing could not be worse. As Bill Clinton tries to rescue red-state senators already vulnerable on their party\u2019s anti-domestic energy development views, she is now, apparently, picking up the anti-pipeline, anti-carbon fuel cudgel.\n\nAnd with Republicans and Democrats calling for the United States to use energy exports strategically to hobble Vladimir Putin, here\u2019s Hillary Clinton inveighing against fossil fuel. The Post editorial board observed on Sunday, \u201cContributing to an already widening and more diverse global supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) would also give European importers more flexibility in sourcing their fuel \u2014 from the United States, Qatar, or others \u2014 the sort of market conditions that have already enabled Europeans to renegotiate gas contracts with Russia. The Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Michael Levi points out that Mr. Putin might end up with an uncomfortable choice between maintaining market share in Europe and slashing his prices more. . . . The economic case for allowing natural gas exports is compelling on its own. Doing so would bring money into the country and uphold the vital principle that energy resources should flow freely around the globe, making the markets for the fuels the world economy needs as flexible and robust as possible. The more major suppliers there are following that principle, the less control predatory regimes such as Mr. Putin\u2019s will have over the market.\u201d In short, Clinton risks doubling down on her reset failure, highlighting her lack of long-term strategic and economic thinking.\n\nMore troubling for her, however, is the identification with the party\u2019s green elites in an emerging class war in the Democratic Party. Rich donors get Solyndra subsidies; blue-collar workers don\u2019t get the Keystone XL pipeline. Liberal senators from the coasts, such as California\u2019s Barbara Boxer and Connecticut\u2019s Richard Blumenthal, hold an all-night talkathon railing against domestic energy development; Democratic incumbents such as Mark Warner of Virginia and such challengers as Alison Lundergan Grimes hide under their beds, nervous to be identified with views that nix thousands of jobs back home. In the industrial heartland (e.g. Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, etc.) the pro-green movement amounts to an anti-jobs and anti-growth position, which is why Midwest governors are so adamantly opposed to EPA overkill and federal hurdles to domestic energy production.\n\nThe shale revolution is an economic godsend for the U.S. economy. The opportunity to develop, use and export natural energy resources is an economic and national security no-brainer. Republicans in their battle for the Senate should embrace the energy issue, second only to Obamacare in its economic and political importance. And if Clinton wants to jump in on the other side, well all the better for the GOP. Instead of making some half-baked argument about Bill Clinton\u2019s past philandering, the GOP should focus on the Clintons\u2019 co-dependent relationship with big donors who push an anti-jobs initiative \u2014 and all the hedge fund, foreign governments ( I bet the Saudis don\u2019t want the United States developing domestic energy, either) and lobbyists who pour money into their foundation and pony up gobs of money for Hillary\u2019s and Bill\u2019s speeches.\n\nIn sum, Hillary Clinton\u2019s identification with the radical greens is in its own way an embrace of the status quo \u2014 big government squashing employers, ongoing dependence on foreign oil and acceptance of the slow-growth economy. It perpetuates economic inequality. The Tesla buyers get richer while the Ford pickup drivers languish. If Republicans can\u2019t figure out how to use all this to become the party of the future (a new world of cheap, available energy and economic boom) and of opportunity (all those $100-per-hour jobs) they should close up shop. If they are smart, they\u2019ll super-glue Hillary Clinton and the Democrats to the pro-green, anti-energy position and ride the issue to victories in 2014 and 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP's huge opening vs. inequality, Hillary Clinton and economic stagnation.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The GOP's huge opening vs. inequality, Hillary Clinton and economic stagnation.", "title": "Hillary Clinton: Pro-green, pro-elite and anti-growth", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/03/24/hillary-clinton-pro-green-pro-elite-and-anti-growth/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/23/Production/WashingtonPost/Images/2014-03-23T041204Z_01_CGI610_RTRIDSP_3_USA-3683.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/03/24/hillary-clinton-pro-green-pro-elite-and-anti-growth/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Hillary Clinton and green movement, Hillary Clinton and global warming, Hillary Clinton and hedge funds, Saudis give money Clinton foundation,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton and green movement, Hillary Clinton and global warming, Hillary Clinton and hedge funds, Saudis give money Clinton foundation,"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe53e5\"", "article_summary": "If they are smart, they\u2019ll super-glue Hillary Clinton and the Democrats to the pro-green, anti-energy position and ride the issue to victories in 2014 and 2016.\nHillary Clinton (left) deflects questions about running for president in Tempe, Ariz., this month.\nHillary Clinton has never been the darling of the left when it comes to foreign policy.\nAnd with Republicans and Democrats calling for the United States to use energy exports strategically to hobble Vladimir Putin, here\u2019s Hillary Clinton inveighing against fossil fuel.\nAnd if Clinton wants to jump in on the other side, well all the better for the GOP."}
