Two Midwest City masseuses were arrested after police say they offered undercover officers more than just a massage.

Formal charges have been filed Friday against 47-year-old Xiangyang Qin, and 63-year-old Chang U Williams.

According to Midwest City police, on December 2, 2013, an undercover officer went to Empress Massage after the police department received several complaints of acts of prostitution being committed.

The officer says he told the suspect, Qin, that he wanted a massage and paid her $60 for an hour-long session. However, about 20 minutes into the massage, Qin asked the officer for $40 more as she began touching the officer's genitals. Qin was immediately arrested.

Midwest City police say they also received a complaint about possible sex acts taking place at King Spa. On December 10, an undercover officer went to this massage parlor and paid the suspect, Williams, $60 for an hour-long massage.

During the massage, Williams reportedly placed her hand on the officer's genitals. She was immediately arrested as well.

Qin has been charged with engaging in prostitution, and Williams has been charged with engaging in an act of lewdness.

A mug shot of Williams is not available at this time.
