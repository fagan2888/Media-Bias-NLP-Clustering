The task force might give communities wide latitude on setbacks between drilling pads and occupied structures, or it might push for a mandated setback of a minimum distance \u2014 say, 1,000 feet or more.\n\nOr it could adopt some combination of both approaches.\n\nIn announcing the final 19 members of the 21-member task force, Gov. John Hickenlooper described the effort as \u201cone of the most important issues I\u2019ve worked on in the 12 years I\u2019ve been in public service.\u201d That\u2019s not an exaggeration. Oil and gas production is immensely important to this state and nation, and yet the intense backlash against drilling in the vicinity of populated areas cannot simply be dismissed. It often represents heartfelt frustration over the fact that an industrial activity has appeared on the fringes of housing developments.\n\nStill, a compromise over setbacks and all of the other issues Hickenlooper cited in his executive order, from noise abatement to dust management, is possible. But it will require that all parties engage in good faith, remain open to solid data and anticipate getting some but not all of what they\u2019d actually like to see in a final plan.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy reaching consensus given the wide spectrum of views represented on the task force \u2014 and unanimity may well be impossible. Even one of the co-chairs, La Plata County Commissioner Gwen Lachelt, has been associated with groups that seem to harbor a general hostility to drilling.\n\nFortunately, everyone doesn\u2019t have to be on board for the task force to issue an official recommendation. A two-thirds majority is required.\n\nFrankly, if the task force can\u2019t muster a two-thirds vote on recommendations by Feb. 27, it won\u2019t have tried very hard.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado oil and gas task force must strike a deal", "title": "Colorado oil and gas task force must strike a deal", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/12/colorado-oil-and-gas-task-force-must-strike-a-deal/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140912__oil-gas-taskforcep1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140912__oil-gas-taskforcep1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-12T13:06:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:40:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0047\"", "article_summary": "Fortunately, everyone doesn\u2019t have to be on board for the task force to issue an official recommendation.\nIn announcing the final 19 members of the 21-member task force, Gov.\nFrankly, if the task force can\u2019t muster a two-thirds vote on recommendations by Feb. 27, it won\u2019t have tried very hard.\nDon\u2019t be surprised if the state oil and gas task force whose members were announced last week wind up proposing a law not very different from the compromise floated last summer by the governor.\nIt won\u2019t be easy reaching consensus given the wide spectrum of views represented on the task force \u2014 and unanimity may well be impossible."}
