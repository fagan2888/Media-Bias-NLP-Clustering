By staring deep into a not-particularly-interesting region of space, the HDF became famous for the rich variety of distant galaxies we wouldn't be able to see without the help of Hubble. Now, in 2014, we have a next generation version of the same scene, reminding us just how rich and infinitely beautiful our vast universe really is.

Soon after the initial flash was reported, plans were afoot for a Hubble observational campaign, resulting in some outstanding imagery of stellar death in our intergalactic back yard.

Often lost in the glare of their parent stars, exoplanets can be hard to image. But Hubble has turned into quite the exoplanet hunter. This year, however, Hubble has gone a step further -- surveying stars for their exoplanet forming dusty disks that existed before the alien worlds have even started to form.

In this observation, the space telescope peered deep into the outermost reaches of the universe to look at the detail of two primordial galaxies billions of light-years away. Called Zw I 136, the pair (left) don't appear to conform to a well-ordered spiral shape. They are instead gravitationally interacting, pulling at one another's stars.

Looking like a string of pearls on a necklace between two colliding galaxies, it is over 100,000 light years long and is thought to be a short-lived feature that rises from galactic mergers.

It is a cocoon of gas and dust that is gradually birthing stars, and the bright reflection nebula (lower left) that is illuminated by a flurry of adolescent stars.

It's celestial serendipity at its finest! READ MORE: Eye of the Storm: Jupiter Moon Occults Great Red Spot\n\nIt's hard to take your eyes off the delicate spiral structure of this Hubble observation of the center of the galaxy NGC 1433, an active galaxy known as a \"Seyfert galaxy.\" Located around 32 million light-years away, the supermassive black hole in the core of NGC 1433 is voraciously consuming matter, causing the active galactic nucleus to shine bright.

It was a space rock, in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, that was slowly breaking apart. It was interesting enough that Hubble mission managers decided to slew the telescope around for a closer look. Sure enough, after watching the pieces of asteroid drift apart, Hubble confirmed that the asteroid hadn't hit anything, only that it had mysteriously broken up. So what happened? Astronomers think that the asteroid was sped up by radiation from the sun, causing it to literally fall apart as the angular momentum flung loosely-bound chunks of asteroid into space. READ MORE: Hubble Witnesses Mysterious Breakup of Asteroid\n\n2014 marks the 25th year that the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has been in orbit -- Hubble will officially turn 25 on April 24, 2015. The veteran observatory has revolutionized our view of the cosmos over the past quarter century where no celestial target is hidden from its unblinking 2.4 meter diameter mirror. From galaxies to galactic clusters and asteroids to exoplanets, Hubble's new imagery always generates huge interest. It is our planet's window to the universe. Like the 24 years that have come before, Hubble's 25th year has been one full of stunning imagery and outstanding science, so let's take a look back over the past 12 months at some of the stand-out moments* from this historic mission. First up is a scene that combined Hubble data with NASA's Chandra X-ray space telescope -- a cosmic 'bloodbath.' In this freeze frame of a particularly violent galactic encounter, a galaxy called ESO 137-001 drifted into the heart of the galactic cluster Abell 3627. Hubble and Chandra had basically witnessed a galactic blender rip ESO 137-001 to shreds.

It is, like its neighbor the Quintuplet Cluster, a fairly young astronomical object at between two and four million years old.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Barack Obama mentioned something curious in a tweet. It wasn\u2019t about the Affordable Care Act, it wasn\u2019t concerning national security and wasn\u2019t part of the climate change conversation. Instead, it was a message about the cosmos.\n\n\u201cThis was a fun briefing: My science advisor just showed me this Hubble shot of the most crowded place in our galaxy,\u201d wrote the President, with a dazzling Hubble Space Telescope observation of the Arches Cluster, located some 25,000 light-years away toward the center of our galaxy, attached.\n\nHubble at 25: The Space Telescope by the Numbers\n\nPresident Obama is a well-known advocate for the sciences, STEM and science outreach, but this tweet didn\u2019t focus on a specific policy or the White House Science Fair, this was just a guy (who happens to be the leader of the United States), looking up in wonder.\n\nThe story behind the tweet became apparent on Thursday morning when the President\u2019s Chief Science Advisor John P. Holdren issued a White House statement. It just so happens that this particular observation, which was a part of an \u201cad-hoc\u201d note he sent to White House staff, resonated with the President.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s morning report from NASA contains a Hubble photo I thought worth sharing,\u201d Holdren wrote in the White House briefing. \u201cThe astonishing density of stars \u2014 most of which, we now know, have planets \u2014 really does make one wonder whether there\u2019s anybody else out there. And this is just one piece of our own galaxy. There are an estimated 100 billion other galaxies in the observable universe. Enjoy!\u201d\n\nTop 10 Hubble Hotshots of 2014\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope is still going strong 25 years after it was launched by Space Shuttle Discovery\u2019s crew in 1990 and this observation of the densely-packed stars in the Milky Way\u2019s core is just one of the million images taken by Hubble to date. But how densely packed is this star cluster?\n\n\u201cThe Arches cluster is so dense that in a region with a radius equal to the distance between the sun and its nearest star there would be over 100,000 stars! At least 150 stars within the cluster are among the brightest ever discovered in the Milky Way,\u201d Holdren added.\n\nThe observation in question was released by NASA and the European Space Agency on May 29.\n\nAs noted by Holdren, it\u2019s images like these that really put things in perspective, and makes us question our place in the universe and whether there is life elsewhere. Astronomy is a profound science; it has the ability fire-up our sense of wonder and question our very existence. By looking into the furthest-most reaches of the universe, we are actually seeking answers to questions we didn\u2019t know we had about our own existence. Humanity can be very myopic, we only really care about what\u2019s happening down here on this tiny speck of life-giving sand, but the possibilities the universe provides makes us want to push the envelope, to look out further, to explore.\n\nNEWS: White House Requests Boosted $18.5B NASA Budget\n\nI have little doubt that small-minded politically-blinded individuals will criticize the President\u2019s wonderment at this particular Hubble image \u2014 after all, who has time to be dazzled by one of the most mindbogglingly beautiful and overwhelming portraits of our Milky Way\u2019s core, the light from which took 25,000 years to reach Earth, when they\u2019ve got a country to run? But as the White House has shown us, even the most powerful governments have the ability to look up and ponder the universe.\n\nIf only more world leaders would do the same. We all live in the same tiny biosphere in a minute region of a spiral galaxy containing around 400 billion stars and many more planets \u2014 a little bit of perspective would go a long way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Wednesday, President Barack Obama mentioned something curious in a tweet -- it was a message about the cosmos.", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.discovery.news", "og": {"site_name": "DNews", "description": "On Wednesday, President Barack Obama mentioned something curious in a tweet -- it was a message about the cosmos.", "title": "Hubble Image Inspires White House to Ponder Our Cosmos : DNews", "url": "http://news.discovery.com/space/astronomy/hubble-image-inspires-white-house-to-ponder-our-cosmos-150604.htm", "image": "http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/blogs/dnews-files-2015-06-star-cluster-200x200-150604.jpg", "type": "Dnews:blog-post"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Wednesday, President Barack Obama mentioned something curious in a tweet -- it was a message about the cosmos.", "title": "Hubble Image Inspires White House to Ponder Our Cosmos", "url": "http://news.discovery.com/space/astronomy/hubble-image-inspires-white-house-to-ponder-our-cosmos-150604.htm", "image": "http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/blogs/dnews-files-2015-06-star-cluster-200x200-150604.jpg", "site": "@dnews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=513902154", "fb": {"admins": 100001675325868, "app_id": 157869477569917}, "keywords": "Space, barack obama, clusters, Current Events, galaxy, Government, hubble, hubble space telescope, Hubble Telescope, Obama, Peoples and Government, Politics, President, Space Politics, Stars, white house Current Events Stars Space Politics hubble galaxy White House Hubble Space Telescope Space Hubble Telescope Politics government Obama", "viewport": "width=1075", "news_keywords": "Space, barack obama, clusters, Current Events, galaxy, Government, hubble, hubble space telescope, Hubble Telescope, Obama, Peoples and Government, Politics, President, Space Politics, Stars, white house Current Events Stars Space Politics hubble galaxy White House Hubble Space Telescope Space Hubble Telescope Politics government Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95b6\"", "article_summary": "READ MORE: Hubble Witnesses Mysterious Breakup of Asteroid2014 marks the 25th year that the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has been in orbit -- Hubble will officially turn 25 on April 24, 2015.\nFor all of Hubble's mindblowing observations, be sure to browse Hubblesite.org and the Space Telescope Science Institute homepage .\nFirst up is a scene that combined Hubble data with NASA's Chandra X-ray space telescope -- a cosmic 'bloodbath.'\n\u201cToday\u2019s morning report from NASA contains a Hubble photo I thought worth sharing,\u201d Holdren wrote in the White House briefing.\nBut as the White House has shown us, even the most powerful governments have the ability to look up and ponder the universe."}
