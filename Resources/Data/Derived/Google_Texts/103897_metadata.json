( JEREMY PAPASSO )\n\nMore than 90 children in Weld and Adams counties will have a very merry Christmas this year thanks to the members of White Fields Community Church in Longmont.\n\nMembers of the congregation have bought gifts for children of low-income foster families in the two counties for four years, but this year a miscommunication amplified the program.\n\nChurch member Christine Appel launched Project Greatest Gift in 2010 after adopting her 4-year-old foster son, Michael.\n\n\"We thought we knew what we were getting into, but you really don't know until it happens,\" Appel said. \"There is a lot of grief and loss for these kids. They're being taken from everything they've known and maybe had to leave all of their belongings behind and those losses are amplified by the holidays.\"\n\nAppel reached out to Adams County, where the Appels are registered, to provide gifts for children who were part of the county's holiday donation program for foster families. The church began including children from Weld County in 2011 and provided gifts for about 20 children each year. But when Appel contacted Weld County this year, she took on more than she expected.\n\n\"I asked for 20 kids but got 20 families,\" Appel said.\n\nThe congregation has stepped up this year, providing gifts for 91 children in the two counties, she said.\n\nNow, that Appel knows her congregation will provide for the need, she plans to raise the bar and take on at least 100 children next year, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite Fields does not have any names left this year, but the holidays have inspired other drives that are still seeking donations and support.\n\nHere are a few local opportunities to give this season.\n\nShare the Joy Christmas Decoration Drive\n\nLongmont resident Lisa Truesdale will be handing out free Christmas decorations and fresh-cut trees to families affected by the September flood.
