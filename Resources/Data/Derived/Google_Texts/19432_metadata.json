The committee showed Chao the memo that did not reach him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn late September, Chao signed off on a memo to CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner that said there were no \u201copen high findings\u201d of security risks and that the site was ready to proceed with its launch.\n\nHowever, a memo from CMS Chief Information Officer Tony Trenkle dated Sept. 3, which Chao was not included on, described six security flaws, two of which were of the \u201copen high findings\u201d variety.\n\nChao said he should\u2019ve been included on Trenkle\u2019s memo and that he was surprised Trenkle recommended he move forward with the approval memo to Tavenner while these items remained open.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised,\u201d Chao said in his Oversight testimony. \u201cAnd I probably, with that knowledge, I would have at least acknowledged what those findings were in the risk assessment.\u201d\n\nChao said \u201cit\u2019s a good possibility\u201d the lines of communication between the agencies and the contractors involved in launching the ObamaCare website were not functioning properly.\n\nChao will testify in front of the Oversight Committee on Wednesday.\n\nOversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) has sought to highlight the confusion between the contractors and the government agencies in the run-up to the ObamaCare launch by releasing a slow drip of documents he\u2019s obtained through panel requests and interviews.\n\nRepublicans have also sought to make the security of personal data on the website a central issue as they drag administration officials and contractors to Capitol Hill to testify.\n\nA Democratic Oversight committee staffer said the security issue relates to a function of the website that isn\u2019t currently active and won\u2019t be until early next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand why anyone would trust the accuracy of Chairman Issa\u2019s press releases when they consistently distort and manipulate the truth,\u201d the staffer said. \u201cThe chairman\u2019s staff basically sandbagged this witness with a document he had never seen before and then failed to inform him that it has nothing to do with parts of the website that launched on Oct. 1.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather than seeking out the truth, this press release tries to scare the public by capitalizing on confusion caused by the chairman\u2019s own staff,\u201d the staffer added.\n\n\u2014 Updated at 9:24 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Henry Chao learned from a House committee that he'd been cut out of the loop.", "description": "Henry Chao learned from a House committee that he'd been cut out of the loop.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Jonathan Easley", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Henry Chao learned from a House committee that he'd been cut out of the loop.", "title": "Top CMS official didn't know about ObamaCare security flaws", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/189916-top-cms-official-didnt-know-about-obamacare", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-12T11:27:25-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2013-11-12T11:27-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/189916-top-cms-official-didnt-know-about-obamacare", "dcterms.date": "2013-11-11T20:15-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Studies, Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, healthcare.gov,Henry Chao, Tony Trenkle, Darrell Issa,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-11T20:15:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-12T11:27:25-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/189916-top-cms-official-didnt-know-about-obamacare", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Henry Chao learned from a House committee that he'd been cut out of the loop.", "card": "summary", "title": "Top CMS official didn't know about ObamaCare security flaws"}, "dcterms.title": "Top CMS official didn't know about ObamaCare security flaws"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34c7\"", "article_summary": "In testimony released Monday by the House Oversight Committee, Chao, a top official charged with implementing the ObamaCare website, indicated he was cut out of the loop about the potential flaws and should have been included.\nA Democratic Oversight committee staffer said the security issue relates to a function of the website that isn\u2019t currently active and won\u2019t be until early next year.\nChao will testify in front of the Oversight Committee on Wednesday.\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised,\u201d Chao said in his Oversight testimony.\nThe committee showed Chao the memo that did not reach him."}
