Brown, an Army reservist, spent 10 months in Iraq while serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates. He is shown here in Fallujah. Cameron W. Barr/The Washington Post\n\nLt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown served two terms in the House of Delegates, spending some of his tenure deployed in Iraq.\n\nBefore his gubernatorial bid, Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown served two terms in the Maryland House of Delegates, spending part of his tenure deployed in Iraq.\n\nBefore his gubernatorial bid, Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown served two terms in the Maryland House of Delegates, spending part of his tenure deployed in Iraq.\n\nAnthony G. Brown barely made it to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1999, winning his first Democratic primary by 155 votes.\n\nHe was a newcomer to Prince George\u2019s County, lacking deep roots or connections. Once in Annapolis, the man who hopes to be elected governor Tuesday bucked the tradition that freshman lawmakers stay in the shadows. He eagerly spoke up for his constituents and pushed through bills.\n\nThe young African American legislator rose quickly through the ranks. During his second term, he became majority whip, helping assemble veto-proof majorities for bills opposed by Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R). Suddenly, the newcomer was an insider.\n\n\u201cI was more of the backroom guy,\u201d Brown said. \u201cLiterally counting the votes and convincing legislators that needed to be convinced.\u201d\n\nIntensely ambitious, Brown found himself wooed by both 2006 Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls. He joined what turned out to be the winning ticket led by Martin O\u2019Malley. The job by definition put Brown into O\u2019Malley\u2019s shadow, although the governor gave him more responsibility than previous deputies had received.\n\nView Graphic A look at the two candidates and their views on some of the most pressing issues in the 2014 Maryland governors race.\n\nBrown\u2019s tenure as lieutenant governor was bookended by two projects, both of which offered opportunities for Maryland to stand out from other states: Preparing for an influx of jobs at military posts because of a congressionally ordered base realignment, and leading the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe base project was deemed a success \u2014 \u201cthe one bright light through the recession,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. The health-care effort was marred by the failed launch of the state\u2019s online insurance marketplace, which Brown has said was not his direct responsibility.\n\nBrown also helped build public support and whip votes for O\u2019Malley\u2019s landmark legislative efforts, including gun control, allowing casinos and legalizing same-sex marriage. And he took on projects he felt personally connected to \u2014 combating domestic violence, helping veterans and improving life for children in foster care.\n\nBut even his closest allies have difficulty naming one signature project that defined his time in office. They say his legacy was transforming the role of lieutenant governor from ceremonial \u2014 kissing babies, cutting ribbons and attending funerals \u2014 to one that\u2019s focused on legislation and policy.\n\nHouse Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) said he has worked with four lieutenant governors, including some who didn\u2019t get along with their bosses and were not given any piece of the power.\n\n\u201cI can tell you,\u201d he said, \u201cAnthony has been the more active lieutenant governor of any of them.\u201d\n\nBases and health care\n\nWhen O\u2019Malley took office in 2007, Maryland was behind in preparing for the expansion of several military bases. Tens of thousands of new workers were headed to the state \u2014 bringing spouses and children, more traffic and the potential to strain public utilities.\n\nLt. Gov. Anthony Brown, Democratic candidate for Maryland governor, speaks with Nicole Olson from Two Acre Farm at the Bethesda Farmers Market on Oct. 12. (Sammy Dallal/For the Washington Post)\n\nBrown was a logical pick to oversee preparations, a\n\nHarvard-educated lawyer and an Army reservist who spent 10 months in Iraq helping to rebuild that country\u2019s infrastructure. The group he oversaw organized community meetings, visited bases and churned out hundreds of pages of reports and a matrix of tasks to complete, including working with property and landlord associations to expand lists of housing near bases, reviewing local water and sewer plans, even coordinating carpooling programs for the newly arrived.\n\nIt was a thankless job involving stakeholders known to be uncompromising \u2014 state bureaucrats, county and municipal leaders, and military officials, said Del. Kumar P. Barve (D-Montgomery), who worked with Brown on some of the legislation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an endeavor that can very easily bog down into battling fiefdoms,\u201d Barve said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t allow it to get that way.\u201d\n\nBrown says the expansion brought tens of thousands of jobs and workers to the state. \u201cI tell you, if no jobs came to Maryland, that would be a front-page story,\u201d he said. \u201cBRAC was a success and, therefore, very little attention.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley next tapped Brown to oversee implementation of the newly enacted Affordable Care Act of 2010 as co-chair \u2014 along with the state health secretary \u2014 of the just-created Maryland Health Care Reform Coordinating Council.\n\n\u201cI intend to do everything in my power to ensure that we do it better than any other state in America,\u201d Brown said after the council\u2019s first meeting.\n\nThe lieutenant governor championed a package of health-care reform legislation, including one piece that established a health insurance exchange where individuals and small employers could shop for private coverage. The board created to oversee the exchange did not include the lieutenant governor.\n\nAt that point, Brown says now, his direct involvement with the exchange was done.\n\nHis attention shifted to other issues, such as expanding the state\u2019s ability to partner with the private sector on projects like the building of the light-rail Purple Line through Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties. Brown also geared up to run to replace O\u2019Malley, who by law is prohibited from seeking a third term.\n\nIn May 2013, Brown formally opened his gubernatorial campaign. In late September last year, he won the endorsement of Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), who said, \u201cOn October 1 . . . we know that in Maryland we have a health exchange that\u2019s ready to go because of Anthony Brown.\u201d\n\nBut the health exchange Web site was nowhere near ready. Work had stalled as hired contractors had fought, and internal audits flagged numerous problems. About two weeks before the expected launch, exchange officials warned the O\u2019Malley administration of potential problems. Brown later testified that the gravity of those problems was not conveyed.\n\nDetermined to make Maryland a showcase for the national health-reform effort, O\u2019Malley decided not to delay the launch. The site crashed within minutes of going live and barely functioned for months.\n\nThe debacle quickly became a campaign liability, with especially harsh attacks by Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler, one of Brown\u2019s two primary opponents.\n\nAt a debate in early June, Brown said for the first time that he should have taken a more direct role in overseeing the online exchange.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, I\u2019d go back and say: \u2018Appoint me as a member of the health benefits exchange, maybe even the chairman of the exchange,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the role that I served.\u201d\n\nA passion for lawmaking\n\nWhen Brown became majority whip in 2004, he went to Capitol Hill to see how Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) did the same job in Congress.\n\nBack in Annapolis, Brown set up a chain of command: One Democrat on each House committee would take soft vote counts of fellow members and pass that information along. He would monitor levels of support, meet with concerned delegates and identify legislative hot spots that needed to be addressed.\n\nSome lawmakers find the legislative process boring, but it is one of Brown\u2019s passions. While he can be guarded about his personal life and interests, Brown has championed many bills that provide clues to what he really cares about.\n\nBrown still loves talking about the first bill he drafted, which required condominium developers to give prospective buyers financial information including how much money is being held in reserve and what percentage of owners are paying dues. Brown\u2019s own experience on a condo board convinced him of the need for such a bill.\n\n\u201cThis is my proudest accomplishment,\u201d Brown gushed in an interview as the legislation was signed into law in 1999. \u201cIt was my idea. I drafted it out by hand.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, when Brown was lieutenant governor, his cousin Catherine Brown was fatally shot by her ex-boyfriend in Montgomery County. Brown led the push to pass Cathy\u2019s Law, which requires judges to take guns away from domestic abusers who are served with a protective order.\n\n\u201cI learned that no family is immune to the horrors of domestic violence,\u201d Brown wrote in a column. \u201cI wish I could say that Cathy\u2019s story was unique, but sadly, there are too many Marylanders who are no longer with us because of domestic violence.\u201d\n\nBrown also worked to build support for O\u2019Malley\u2019s strict gun-control legislation. Vincent DeMarco, president of Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence, credits Brown for attending forums, often with unfriendly audiences, and hosting a news conference with law enforcement officers who supported the restrictions.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the most important people in making that law a reality,\u201d DeMarco said.\n\nA veteran himself, Brown became O\u2019Malley\u2019s point person on military and veterans issues. He pushed for better job training and support services for veterans and advocated for the 2013 Veterans Full Employment Act. Despite these efforts, the unemployment rate for Maryland veterans has crept up in recent years.\n\nBrown also traveled through the state, often visiting churches on Sundays, to encourage people to become foster parents or adopt. In doing so, he often shared his own story about adopting his son, Jonathan, as a baby in 2000.\n\nClosing ranks\n\nNo Maryland lieutenant governor has ever been elected to the top job, perhaps because the deputy post does not easily lend itself to building a strong political base. After eight years in office and a long campaign, many voters say they still don\u2019t feel that they know Brown. In June, a radio interviewer pushed the candidate to better introduce himself: \u201cHow much do we know about you, Anthony Brown, as a human being?\u201d\n\nBrown, who is 52, ticked off his human traits: Former first-base coach for his son\u2019s Little League team. Loves listening to his daughter play violin. Enjoys Red Stripe beer (his father was from Jamaica) and Swiss cheese and chocolate (his mother is from Switzerland).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t own a Swiss watch,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut I am pretty punctual.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s prickly side was on display during the Democratic primary in the spring, when he clashed bitterly with Gansler and fended off a challenge from the left from Del. Heather R. Mizeur of Montgomery County. He has kept both former candidates away from his general election campaign, despite offers of help and polls that show he has only a single-digit lead over Republican nominee Larry Hogan, a businessman from Anne Arundel County.\n\nDemocrats throughout the state have closed ranks around Brown, concerned about the tight race and the possibility of jeopardizing their standing with him.\n\nOne of the few who seems willing to criticize Brown is Mizeur, who wrote a Baltimore Sun column that accused him of backtracking on a promise to partner with her on new policy ideas. Instead, Mizeur wrote, Brown has focused on attacking Hogan. Still, given the tightness of the race, Mizeur urged Democrats not to join a fledging effort to launch a write-in campaign on her behalf.\n\n\u201cWhile I reject his campaign tactics, I still embrace the man that is Anthony Brown,\u201d Mizeur wrote.\n\nAs Brown makes a last-\n\nminute push to win voters, he can appear stiff and scripted, speaking in bulleted lists instead of the poetic lyrics O\u2019Malley often delivers. He has tapped national Democratic leaders, including President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, to campaign for him, and has launched a massive and methodical get-out-the-vote effort to boost his chances at the polls.\n\nAgain and again, Brown reminds Marylanders that he\u2019s a Democrat \u2014 the party that has fought for marriage equality, expanded access to birth control, higher wages for the working class and stricter controls on guns. He questions Hogan\u2019s repeated promise not to try to roll back Maryland\u2019s gun or abortion laws, noting that the Republican has a history of more conservative stances.\n\n\u201cLook, what Maryland voters need is a governor who has the courage of their conviction,\u201d Brown said at a debate this month. \u201cYou have to have the courage of your convictions, stand up for what you believe.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic nominee for governor has struggled to introduce himself to voters despite long ascent in politics.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Democratic nominee for governor has struggled to introduce himself to voters despite long ascent in politics.", "title": "After eight behind-the-scenes years as O\u2019Malley\u2019s deputy, many voters still don\u2019t know Anthony Brown", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/anthony-browns-work-as-md-lieutenant-governor-was-mostly-behind-the-scenes/2014/10/29/25471718-5abf-11e4-8264-deed989ae9a2_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/12/Others/Images/2014-10-12/sd-101214-MDGOV-041413144426.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@wpjenna"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Anthony Brown, Anthony G Brown, anthony brown profile, lt gov brown, Martin Omalley, Larry Hogan, Maryland governor, Maryland governors race, Robert ehrlich, doug gansler, douglas gansler, heather mizeur, democratic primary, Maryland general election, michael busch, Maryland house of delegates, Maryland BRAC, BRac, domestic violence, Maryland health exchange, affordable care act, president Obama, Hillary Clinton, purple line, steny hoyer, gun control, Vincent demarco, veterans, unemployment rate, foster care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson"}, "eomportal-uuid": "25471718-5abf-11e4-8264-deed989ae9a2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Anthony Brown, Anthony G Brown, anthony brown profile, lt gov brown, Martin Omalley, Larry Hogan, Maryland governor, Maryland governors race, Robert ehrlich, doug gansler, douglas gansler, heather mizeur, democratic primary, Maryland general election, michael busch, Maryland house of delegates, Maryland BRAC, BRac, domestic violence, Maryland health exchange, affordable care act, president Obama, Hillary Clinton, purple line, steny hoyer, gun control, Vincent demarco, veterans, unemployment rate, foster care"}, "article_summary": "Anthony Brown, Democratic candidate for Maryland governor, speaks with Nicole Olson from Two Acre Farm at the Bethesda Farmers Market on Oct. 12.\n\u201cWhile I reject his campaign tactics, I still embrace the man that is Anthony Brown,\u201d Mizeur wrote.\nClosing ranksNo Maryland lieutenant governor has ever been elected to the top job, perhaps because the deputy post does not easily lend itself to building a strong political base.\nThey say his legacy was transforming the role of lieutenant governor from ceremonial \u2014 kissing babies, cutting ribbons and attending funerals \u2014 to one that\u2019s focused on legislation and policy.\nI drafted it out by hand.\u201dIn 2008, when Brown was lieutenant governor, his cousin Catherine Brown was fatally shot by her ex-boyfriend in Montgomery County."}
