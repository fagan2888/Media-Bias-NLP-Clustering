Today that's not the case. In the Senate you have to have 60 votes, not a majority. That's not in the Constitution; that's a rule.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "kevin mccarthy, senate, government, shutdown, planned parenthood", "pubdate": "2015-09-18T14:27:20", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy slammed the Republican-controlled Senate on Friday for blocking action on Obamacare, tax reform and more while representatives are working hard to push conservative measures through.", "title": "Rep.
