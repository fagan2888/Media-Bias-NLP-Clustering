Hundreds of residents came downtown to watch the annual Longmont Lights Holiday parade.

A horse-drawn sleigh carrying five city employees that spearheaded emergency flood efforts led the parade.

Emergency manager Dan Eamon, Allen Platt and Dan Wolford of the Public Works department and Paul Zuber and Jeff Satur from Public Safety were honored as the parade's grand marshals for their role during the September flood.

After the parade, Roosevelt Park was lighted by fireworks and filled with fire pits, colorful lights and carolers.
