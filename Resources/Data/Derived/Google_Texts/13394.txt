A former Tyndall airman, who pled guilty on child pornography possession charges in September, is dead.

Investigators arrested 30-year old Daniel Freiwald in July after tracing pornography internet downloads to his computer. He pled guilty to the federal charges last fall.

Federal Judge Richard Smoak sentenced him last month to 8-years in a federal prison. Wednesday authorities transferred Freiwald to the Federal Detention Center in Tallahassee, on his way to a federal prison.

But, Thursday he reportedly committed suicide.

Officials at the detention center refused to discuss the case.

But the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Inmate Locator website lists Freiwald's status as deceased.
