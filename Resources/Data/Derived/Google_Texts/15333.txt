INDIANAPOLIS (AP) â€” Community Hospital Network has announced plan for two large projects in Indianapolis, a new $175 million hospital at the Community East campus and a new $60 million cancer treatment center at its north campus.

Network President Bryan Mills said Thursday a decision was made to build a new hospital on the east campus rather than trying to renovate the antiquated buildings. The project includes demolishing four buildings on the campus, building a new hospital tower housing inpatient and procedural rooms and moving its family medicine center.

Mills says increases in patient volume drove the need for a new cancer center at Community Hospital North.

Community opened a $24 million cancer treatment center on its south campus last year.
