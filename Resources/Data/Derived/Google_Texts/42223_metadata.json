We vowed that as God united the two us of into one flesh we would forever, through whatever circumstances unfolding in our lives, remain united in love. The closing wedding promise to each other was that \"we will walk hand-in-hand toward the Kingdom of Heaven.\"\n\nWhen we moved to Loveland in 1985, it was to accept my dream job of being a police officer. The move was hard on Tami as she was a practicing Level II neo-natal intensive care nurse at St. Luke's Hospital in Denver and there were no hospitals in Northern Colorado that provided newborn intensive care at the same level. She commuted for a while, even after our son Vincent was born; but when Mark, son No. 2 arrived, she could no longer bear leaving the boys and we resolved to live solely within the means and income the city of Loveland graciously provided us.\n\nAs time advanced, God blessed us with sons three and four, Callen and Gregory. All the while the dignified Loveland Police Department cruiser sat out in front of our home like a friend and guardian angel. Promotion to the rank of sergeant occurred in 1990, lieutenant in 1995, and captain in the year 2000. It was a great honor during those years to be molded and mentored by servant leader and Police Chief Tom Wagoner. He taught and role modeled for all of us that the good of the community must always be our first priority whenever we pinned our badges over our hearts and onto our shirts.\n\nIn 2005, as then-City Manager Don Williams placed that stars of the office of Police Chief on my collar, Tami and I were committed to sacrificing ourselves for the common good of the community while continuing to nourish our love for each other and our family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decade that followed from 2005 to 2015 contained remarkable life events that included the Great Recession, major budget cuts, devastating flooding, wildfires, the arrival and dismissal of medical marijuana shops, a severe snow storm that knocked out power in large quadrants of the city, and a special investigation that led to the dissolution of the Berthoud Police Department.\n\nThe decade ushered in major developments such as the Budweiser Event Center, the Northern Colorado Regional Crime Lab and The Promenade Shops at Centerra. All quality expansion that aided in making Loveland one of the most desirable places to live in America.\n\nIn March of 2014 the agency and community were rocked to the core when a valiant Loveland police officer was shot at point-blank range with a sawed-off shotgun and was saved by his ballistic vest. We were rocked once again in August of this year when a Loveland police officer was required to use deadly physical force to stop a suspect who stormed a restaurant with a weapon and took a hostage.\n\nThrough all things, the Police Department and community worked in partnership to support each other, enhance Loveland's livability and make Loveland a safe place to call home.\n\nAs I prepare to retire from police work and hand over the reins of this fine agency, I am gratified by the professionalism and integrity of the Loveland Police Department as it exists today, even though maintaining such a high bar of internal excellence and virtue has come at great personal expense. I possess hope that the next generation of leadership will bring new initiatives for making the agency even better; and I pray that the many seeds of good will the men and women of the agency have planted over the last ten years will come to fruition in ways that bless the Police Department and serve the best interest of the Loveland community for years to come.\n\nIn that vein, Tami and I invite you to join us at a Capstone Retirement Mass in which we will pray that God's graces continue to rain down on the Police Department and the community. The Mass will be concelebrated by five holy priests that at different times over the past 10 years have been present in Loveland and played key roles in equipping and supporting Tami and me, so that in turn, I could equip the agency and support its men and women in their service of you.\n\nThe Mass will occur at 8:30 a.m. Saturday, Dec. 19, at St. John the Evangelist Church, 1730 W. 12th St., Loveland.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Mass, my vocation as Loveland's police chief will be completed and my career in law enforcement sealed with a blessing. In peace, I will reach out to Tami, grasp her hand, and now as grandparents, continue to walk with the woman I love through whatever God has in store for us on earth. And then eventually, by the mercy of God, Tami and I, along with our children and grandchildren (and God willing our great-grandchildren!) will walk hand-in-hand through the gates of Heaven into eternal life.\n\nThank you community of Loveland for your friendship and support over the last decade and allowing me to humbly serve you in the role of Police Chief.\n\nI close this letter by sending you all my love.\n\nLuke Hecker has been the police chief for the Loveland Police Department since 2005.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/opinion/letters/ci_29243111/an-open-letter-loveland-community", "modificationDate": "2015-12-13T17:10:56-0700", "sailthru.section": "Letters to the Editor", "sailthru.author": "By Luke Hecker \n \n  Guest Columnist", "description": "Thirty-one years ago, on July 14, 1984, Tami and I exchanged the sacred vows of marriage in front of Father Larry Freeman, the holy priest who officiated at our wedding.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:29243111:view"}, "startDate": "2015-12-13T17:10:42-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/opinion/letters/ci_29243111/an-open-letter-loveland-community", "image": "http://local.reporterherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/reporterherald.png", "type": "article", "description": "Thirty-one years ago, on July 14, 1984, Tami and I exchanged the sacred vows of marriage in front of Father Larry Freeman, the holy priest who officiated at our wedding.", "title": "An open letter to the Loveland community"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Thirty-one years ago, on July 14, 1984, Tami and I exchanged the sacred vows of marriage in front of Father Larry Freeman, the holy priest who officiated at our wedding.", "title": "An open letter to the Loveland community", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/opinion/letters/ci_29243111/an-open-letter-loveland-community", "image": "http://local.reporterherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/reporterherald.png", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-13T17:10:42-0700", "endDate": "2025-12-13T17:10:42-0700", "sailthru.title": "An open letter to the Loveland community", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Luke HeckerGuest", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2015-12-13T17:12:37-0700", "news_keywords": "Letters to the Editor, Letters to the Editor news, Loveland Colorado Letters to the Editor news, Loveland Colorado news, Letters to the Editor Loveland news, Letters to the Editor Colorado news, US Letters to the Editor news, world Letters to the Editor news."}, "article_summary": "And then eventually, by the mercy of God, Tami and I, along with our children and grandchildren (and God willing our great-grandchildren!)\nThank you community of Loveland for your friendship and support over the last decade and allowing me to humbly serve you in the role of Police Chief.\nAll the while the dignified Loveland Police Department cruiser sat out in front of our home like a friend and guardian angel.\nThrough all things, the Police Department and community worked in partnership to support each other, enhance Loveland's livability and make Loveland a safe place to call home.\nLuke Hecker has been the police chief for the Loveland Police Department since 2005."}
