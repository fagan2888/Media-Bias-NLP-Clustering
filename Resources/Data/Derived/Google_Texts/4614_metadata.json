Rand Paul (R-KY) on April 23, 2014.\n\nKentucky senator and Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul\u2019s first two books contain several statements falsely attributed to Thomas Jefferson and other historical figures, Buzzfeed reported.\n\nRecords from the Thomas Jefferson Foundation indicate that \u201cthere is no evidence\u201d Jefferson was responsible for five statements Paul included in his work, and that two other statements were taken out of context.\n\nFor example, Paul claimed to cite Jefferson while criticizing the Patriot Act in his 2011 book The Tea Party Goes to Washington.\n\n\u201cThis sort of invasiveness is also precisely the reason we have a Second Amendment protecting our right to keep and bear arms,\u201d he wrote at the time. \u201cOr as Jefferson wrote \u2018The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.'\u201d\n\nBut according to the Jefferson Foundation, \u201cthis quotation has not been found in any of the writings of Thomas Jefferson,\u201d though it is allegedly often paired with the phrase, \u201cNo freeman shall be debarred the use of arms,\u201d which is taken from his draft of the Virginia state constitution.\n\nPaul explains his opposition to the Affordable Care Act in the same book in part by stating, \u201cWhen Thomas Jefferson wrote that a \u2018government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take away everything you have,\u2019 he could have easily been referencing Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe foundation noted that, while the quote has appeared in print as far back as 1953, it was not attributed to Jefferson \u2014 erroneously \u2014 until 2005.\n\n\u201cNeither this quotation nor any of its variant forms has been found in the writings of Thomas Jefferson,\u201d the foundation stated, adding that it \u201cbecame a popular saying among Republican politicians\u201d after being copyrighted in 1957 by the General Features Corporation.\n\nAccording to Buzzfeed, Paul also mischaracterized a statement by Benjamin Franklin in not only that book, but his follow-up, Government Bullies.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s to say the Tea Party won\u2019t become the government\u2019s next target under the PATRIOT Act?\u201d Paul stated in the first book. \u201cBenjamin Franklin once wrote, \u2018They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety,\u2019 and Americans who continue to support unconstitutional intrusions into the private lives of their fellow citizens will inevitably learn the same lesson.\u201d\n\nBut, as NPR reported this past March, Franklin\u2019s words are frequently taken out of context, since he was writing in support of defense spending and taxation in a dispute between Pennsylvania lawmakers and relatives of the Penn family, the \u201cproprietary family of the Pennsylvania colony.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe legislature was trying to tax the Penn family lands to pay for frontier defense during the French and Indian War,\u201d Brookings Institute senior fellow Benjamin Wittes told NPR. \u201cAnd the Penn family kept instructing the governor to veto. Franklin felt that this was a great affront to the ability of the legislature to govern. And so he actually meant purchase a little temporary safety very literally. The Penn family was trying to give a lump sum of money in exchange for the General Assembly\u2019s acknowledging that it did not have the authority to tax it.\u201d\n\nThe senator has also attributed the following statement to George Washington: \u201cGovernment is not reason; it is not eloquence; it is force \u2026 Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.\u201d However, editors at the Yale Book of Quotations have stated that there is no evidence that Washington ever made the \u201cundoubtedly apocryphal\u201d quote.\n\nPaul has come under criticism for his sourcing before. MSNBC host Rachel Maddow ridiculed him on-air in October 2013 after portions of one of his speeches appeared to have been copied from the Wikipedia page for the film Gattaca.\n\nHe later blamed the criticism on \u201chaters,\u201d without mentioning Maddow by name.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sen.-Rand-Paul-R-KY-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Rand Paul\u2019s first two books are littered with fake Thomas Jefferson quotes"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Kentucky senator and Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul\u2019s first two books contain several statements falsely attributed to Thomas Jefferson and other historical figures, Buzzfeed reported.\nRecords from the Thomas Jefferson Foundation indicate that \u201cthere is no evidence\u201d Jefferson was responsible for five statements Paul included in his work, and that two other statements were taken out of context.\n\u201cOr as Jefferson wrote \u2018The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\n\u201cAnd the Penn family kept instructing the governor to veto.\nFor example, Paul claimed to cite Jefferson while criticizing the Patriot Act in his 2011 book The Tea Party Goes to Washington."}
