Its conservative wing in the House, egged on by outside groups like Heritage Action, had refused to include the Affordable Care Act in the must-pass funding bill. The result, a two-week government shutdown, was a \u201ctotal disaster\u201d for the GOP, a mistake that threatened the majority. Public Policy Polling, a North Carolina firm favored by Democrats, found \u201cas many as 37 Republicans\u201d in danger.\n\nThose flashbacks now read like dispatches from an alternate reality. As Republicans develop their strategy for undoing some of the Obama administration\u2019s policies through next year\u2019s budgets, they\u2019ve been throttling any talk of a new shutdown. They've repeated, like a koan, that the only person in Washington craving a shutdown is President Barack Obama. Yet in the received, popular GOP history of the last Congress, the shutdown really did not end badly for the Republicans. They won, didn't they?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s think about all the hyperbole, the hyperbolic statements coming from everybody, particularly the talking heads on television,\u201d said Arizona Representative David Schweikert, a member of the Tea Party class of 2010. \u201cThis was supposed to be the end of the Republican Party. The public would never understand what the fight was all about. Turns out the public was a lot smarter than a lot in the political class and media class gave them credit for. They were able to discern that it was an honorable fight over many of the things that were rolling out in the new health care law.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoliticians are all Pavlovian at a very elemental level.\u201d Representative Gerry Connolly\n\nThe revisionist history of the shutdown began as soon as the shutdown ended. When the Democratic Senate bottled the Republican House's ACA-defunding bills, House Republicans started moving \u201cpiecemeal bills\u201d that funded portions of the government. By January 2014, Texas Senator Ted Cruz could say that he \u201crepeatedly voted to fund the federal government.\u201d And through the rest of 2014, Cruz claimed that the shutdown fight, rather than distracting from the first wretched fortnight of HealthCare.gov, turned Obamacare into a winning Republican issue.\n\n\u201cThat fight elevated the stakes of the debate, and as a direct consequence suddenly Republicans instead of being competitive in five or six or Senate seats are competitive in 10, 12, 14 Senate seats all over the country,\u201d said Cruz in August 2014, at the Iowa FAMiLY Leader Summit. \u201cObamacare is an albatross around the necks of the Democrats who foisted it on the American people.\u201d\n\nCruz's causation/correlation switcher made absolute sense to conservatives. Before the 2013 crisis, when the very idea of a shutdown came up, conservatives liked to point out that the 1995-1996 winter clash between President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress did not lead to a Democratic victory in November. Clinton was re-elected, but so were the key Republicans.\n\n\u201cTell me in what way we didn't win,\u201d former Speaker Newt Gingrich asked rhetorically in 2010. \u201cAfter that, we got to a balanced budget. And what happened to the Republican majority?\u201d\n\nThe 2014 elections went even better for the GOP than Gingrich's 1996 survival run. Three members of the House Republican majority ran for Senate\u2014Arkansas's Tom Cotton, West Virginia's Shelley Moore Capito, and Colorado's Cory Gardner. All of them won. The first two won by landslides. Only two incumbent Republican members of Congress lost elections, and far more who were put on the October 2013 watch list triumphed.\n\nOne example? At the end of the shutdown month, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Pennsylvania Representative Mike Fitzpatrick and New Jersey Representatives Frank LoBiondo and Jon Runyan had watched their seats \u201cnudged toward the Democratic column\u201d by oddsmakers. LoBiondo won by 25 points, Fitzpatrick won by 24 points, and Republicans held the retiring Runyan\u2019s seat by 10 points.\n\n\u201cThis is the second shut down where the GOP got blamed and saw no catastrophe at the ballot box,\u201d wrote RedState.com's Erick Erickson on Tuesday. \u201cEvery horror story every talking head within the GOP Establishment trotted out to scare congressmen and senators into caving turned out to be crap.\u201d\n\nThat sense of invincibility has slowly worked its way into Republican thinking about 2015. Before Republicans won the Senate, when they speculated about how control of the upper house would change politics, they universally assumed that putting bills on the president's desk would make him, not the GOP, look like the aggressor if he vetoed.\n\n\u201cThe president knows that he has to sign appropriations bills that keep the government up and running,\u201d said Texas Senator John Cornyn in February, before he won his primary for a third term. \u201cWe can package this in a way that would make it almost impossible for him not to sign them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has never had to deal with something on his desk,\u201d said Ohio Representative Jim Jordan at an April meeting of conservatives sponsored by the Heritage Foundation. A Republican Senate, he said, would \u201cchange the whole political landscape, the whole dynamic, and how American politics is going to work.\u201d\n\nThis month, as they've taken power, leading Republicans have insisted they were never talking about shutdowns when they talked about forcing bills on the president. On Tuesday morning, after the House GOP's weekly conference meeting, Virginia Representative Scott Rigell opened his phone and showed off, of all things, a spreadsheet. Republicans had drawn it up to explain their options if the president used an executive order to except millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\n\u201cThey're calling for us, in there, to not overreact to this,\u201d said Rigell, pointing to the room where his colleagues had been meeting.\n\nThe preferred Republican plan was obviously not a shutdown. Kentucky Representative Hal Rogers, who would be re-elected to lead the Appropriations committee, was selling his colleagues on recision\u2014on passing a funding bill now, and later removing the funds that the Obama administration was using on \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\nThat immediately stirred up emotions on the right. In those circles, it's clear that the president can be stared down on immigration. And it's clear that a fight, even if it led to shutdown, would be either rewarded or forgotten by voters when they returned to the polling booths in November 2016. The reality of the Affordable Care Act had, after all, ended up winning elections for them in 2014. Why wouldn't the reality of Obama's new blunders elect the Republicans of 2016?\n\nIt's all deeply frustrating to Democrats. Virginia Representative Gerry Connolly, whose district's contractors and federal employees recoiled at the shutdown, had subsequently watched his state reelect its Republican congressmen and nearly knock off its popular Democratic senator. There clearly was no shutdown hangover for Republicans.\n\n\u201cFrom their point of view, frankly, while it had a temporary impact on their polling numbers, they fully recovered from that and paid no price at all on Nov. 4,\u201d said Connolly as he headed into a vote. \u201cPoliticians are all Pavlovian at a very elemental level. What\u2019s rewarded, what\u2019s punished. They look at that, and they think it seems to have been rewarded. It certainly wasn\u2019t punished.\u201d\n\nAs Connolly talked, outgoing Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman Steve Israel walked by. Seeing the 2014 election strategist prompted me to ask whether Democrats had overestimated the electoral power of the \u201cshutdown\u201d message.\n\n\u201cAttention spans are short, and we live in a media world where even the hottest story fades really quickly,\u201d said Connolly. \u201cThat\u2019s ancient history by this point. I think we sometimes lost sight of the power of the news cycle.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "Many in the GOP have, once again, convinced themselves that they've got nothing to lose from a government shutdown.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iucal5qLfaVo/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "Many in the GOP have, once again, convinced themselves that they've got nothing to lose from a government shutdown.", "title": "Why Republicans Think They Can't Lose a Showdown with Obama", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-19/why-republicans-think-they-cant-lose-a-showdown-with-obama", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iucal5qLfaVo/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many in the GOP have, once again, convinced themselves that they've got nothing to lose from a government shutdown.", "title": "Why Republicans Think They Can't Lose a Showdown with Obama", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-19/why-republicans-think-they-cant-lose-a-showdown-with-obama", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iucal5qLfaVo/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "Many in the GOP have, once again, convinced themselves that they've got nothing to lose from a government shutdown."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Why Republicans Think They Can't Lose a Showdown with Obama", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NFA8O26JTSF201", "parsely-author": "David Weigel", "date": "2014-11-19T10:48:02.807Z", "keywords": "Republicans,Short Memories", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Republicans,Short Memories", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-11-19T10:48:02.807Z", "parsely-tags": "Republicans,Short Memories,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-19/why-republicans-think-they-cant-lose-a-showdown-with-obama"}, "article_summary": "Three members of the House Republican majority ran for Senate\u2014Arkansas's Tom Cotton, West Virginia's Shelley Moore Capito, and Colorado's Cory Gardner.\nWhen the Democratic Senate bottled the Republican House's ACA-defunding bills, House Republicans started moving \u201cpiecemeal bills\u201d that funded portions of the government.\nThey've repeated, like a koan, that the only person in Washington craving a shutdown is President Barack Obama.\nYet in the received, popular GOP history of the last Congress, the shutdown really did not end badly for the Republicans.\nAs Republicans develop their strategy for undoing some of the Obama administration\u2019s policies through next year\u2019s budgets, they\u2019ve been throttling any talk of a new shutdown."}
