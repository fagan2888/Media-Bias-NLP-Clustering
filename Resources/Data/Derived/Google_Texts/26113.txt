HealthPlus nears turnaround as it prepares for business unit sale to Molina

HealthPlus of Michigan, a Flint-based HMO under state supervision for financial losses since March, expects to complete its turnaround on Sept. 1 when it closes on the sale of its Medicaid plan to Troy-based Molina Healthcare of Michigan.

Over the past two years, HealthPlus lost $60 million in its Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and commercial HMO and PPO business, according to state regulatory filings and interviews.

“It was a perfect storm as all products lost money,” said Graham Smith, HealthPlus’ vice president of sales and marketing.

By the end of this year, incoming CEO Mike Genord, M.D., said the commercial HMO and Medicare Advantage business will achieve a $20 million turnaround.

Genord, currently chief medical officer, will succeed CEO Nancy Jenkins on Sept. 1. Jenkins, a HealthPlus employee for 32 years, took over for Bruce Hill, who resigned last October after five years at the helm.

Smith predicted HealthPlus will break even this year with a risk-based capital ratio of 300 and “significant capital in the bank.” Risk-based capital is a ratio that compares a company’s reserve capital to its risk exposures.

On March 9, the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services placed HealthPlus under state financial supervision because losses in 2014 lowered its capital reserves below the required state minimum.

In May, for-profit Molina announced it would acquire the Medicaid and MIChild business units of HealthPlus for an unspecified price. Molina’s parent company is based on Long Beach, Calif.

Genord, who will become the first physician CEO of HealthPlus in its 36-year history, said the past six months have been difficult for the nonprofit health plan as it transitions to a “flatter and leaner organization.”

By the end of this year, HealthPlus will become a 70,000-member company with $500 million in revenue and about 200 employees, Genord said. In 2014, HealthPlus generated nearly $1 billion in revenue with more than 221,000 covered lives and 500 employees.

Genord said HealthPlus downsized its workforce by a combination of 80 employees leaving by attrition, 100 by voluntary separation with outplacement services and the remainder by layoffs. It has closed its Troy office and will close Saginaw Oct. 1.

The unspecified amount of capital infusion from Molina will allow HealthPlus to restructure and focus on strengthening and increasing its 52,000-member commercial HMO and 18,000-member Medicare Advantage service lines, Genord said.

Genord, who conducted the due diligence on the business unit sale process, said HealthPlus looked at about 13 offers from competing health insurers based in Michigan and from outside the state before selecting Molina.

“We didn’t predetermine the outcome." he said. "We evaluated the potential offers and chose the best one to secure the future” of HealthPlus.

Because of the Healthy Michigan expansion and other changes brought about by a rebid of contracts this year under Medicaid, HealthPlus’ Medicaid business was a “very positive asset. Some saw our 95,000 members and the value in that,” Genord said.

He said HealthPlus selected the Molina financial package over the other bids because of the amount and because of the insurer’s ability to work with them in the transition phase.

“This was the best offer to retain jobs and allow us to move forward with our core HMO and Medicare Advantage business,” Genord said. “We have worked hand in hand with Molina on (information technology) and case management. It has been a smooth transition.”

How HealthPlus' financial problems developed

A variety of actuarial miscalculations, higher than expected medical utilization and a flood of new PPO clients led to HealthPlus underpricing its various products the past two years, Genord said.

“There were multiple factors,” he said. “Past financial models didn’t serve us well in the future market. We had new membership, (many of whom) were underwritten for the first time, (which) led to significant losses we didn’t predict.”

Genord said HealthPlus’ various preferred provider organization products with employers and individuals haven’t performed well for several years.

“At year end, we expect to be out of the PPO market,” he said. “The (Affordable Care Act) market didn’t serve us well the past years.”

Genord said HealthPlus also is phasing out its PPO contracts with employers at the end of this year. HealthPlus has about 43,000 PPO members.

“We have informed out customers and are looking to move to self-funded options for our PPO customers and offer PPO projects with other health insurers,” Genord said.

Before joining HealthPlus in 2013, Genord, an obstetrician-gynecologist, was in private practice for 17 years and affiliated with William Beaumont Hospital and United Physicians Inc., a Bingham Farms-based physician organization.

“I joined HealthPlus because I see them as a leader in value-based medicine,” said Genord.

“I am excited about the turnaround we had this year with the executive team, employers, community and employees all going forward,” said Genord. "We have a new strength in marketplace. … We have paid our bills, taken care of our employees and are proud of what we went through. We have grown as an organization.”
