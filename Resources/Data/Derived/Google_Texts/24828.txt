Treasure Coast political donors are overwhelmingly backing former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush’s presidential bid thanks mostly to big checks from wealthy Vero Beach residents.

The nine donors who wrote checks for at least $25,000 made up almost 80 percent of Treasure Coast donations to at least 14 Democratic and Republican presidential candidates and major PACs that support them, according to a Treasure Coast Newspapers analysis. All but one of those checks came from Vero Beach and supported Bush.

Overall, of the donated $1.2 million by people who listed a Treasure Coast address, 75 percent went to Bush’s campaign and the Right to Rise PAC created to support him. Contributions in support of Democrats Hillary Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley made up just above 2 percent of the tri-county region’s total.

FLORIDA TIES

Bush, whose grandmother lived on Jupiter Island and whose father visited the area several times during his presidency, attended an April 13 event with about 25 supporters at a Vero Beach home, according to his biggest donor, William Becker.

Becker, CEO of Vero Beach-based Peace River Citrus Products, and his wife gave $355,400 to Right to Rise and Bush's campaign, making them the top contributors on the Treasure Coast. Becker said he has been friends with Bush, donating to him since he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1994, and the two exchange emails periodically. Becker said he expects Bush to attend another fundraiser in Vero Beach before next year’s primary.

“I’ve always been very impressed with (Bush’s) integrity and intellect,” Becker said. “He is an extraordinary man. I love his sense humor.”

Bush’s protege and only Florida elected official in the race, one-term Sen. Marco Rubio, ranked fourth among Treasure Coast donors, mostly with small donations of up to $5,000.

Andy Taylor, CFO at Peace River Citrus Products, and his wife gave $5,400 to Bush’s campaign. Taylor said Bush’s eight years as Florida governor make him more qualified to hold the presidency than Rubio, who made an unannounced Vero Beach stop in February for a private forum.

“Mr. Rubio is a fine senator,” Taylor said. “But now is time for Gov. Bush.”

Bush wasn’t the only Republican to benefit from big local donors.

A $100,300 contribution by Jupiter Island’s Bruce Kovner to a PAC supporting Chris Christie put the New Jersey governor in second place among Treasure Coast donors. Kovner, who couldn’t be reached for comment, is co-founder of a hedge fund company and is worth $5 billion, according to Forbes Magazine.

Christie is trailed by Texas tea party Sen. Ted Cruz, known for prompting a government shutdown in 2013 in an attempt to defund the Affordable Care Act. Vero Beach resident John W. Childs, the founder of a private equity firm and a major Republican donor, and his wife gave more than 60 percent of the $51,600 Cruz and PACs that support him got from the Treasure Coast. Childs also wrote a $50,000 check to Bush’s PAC.

The predominance of big Treasure Coast donors reflects a nationwide trend in which millionaires and billionaires are funding increasingly more expensive elections by pouring money into PACs and other outside groups. That trend was set in motion after a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling struck down caps on political contributions to PACs.

“I think if you can afford to give more than average to a candidate you should be entitled to do that,” Becker said. “It’s a free country and … you demonstrate that by contributing.”
