And if so, who?\n\nAnd most importantly given the advancing calendar \u2026 \u201cwhen?\u201d\n\nFour years ago, Haley endorsed former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney \u2013 which proved to be a \u201ckiss of death\u201d to the establishment politician\u2019s South Carolina candidacy. At the time she backed Romney, Haley was at her nadir \u2013 polling at just over 52 percent among \u201cRepublican\u201d voters. She has since rehabilitated her standing with the GOP electorate \u2013 although in a cruel twist of fate all of the status quo candidates she\u2019s rumored to be considering are struggling in national and early-state polling.\n\nWhy are they struggling? Because people are no longer buying what Haley and the \u201cRepublican\u201d establishment are selling. In fact Haley acknowledged as much when she tried to walk things back in the aftermath of her speech \u2026 but her vacillation only made things worse (for her).\n\nThe most likely \u201cRepublican\u201d to receive Haley\u2019s support? U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. In fact it was widely believed Haley\u2019s selection by the GOP \u201cleadership\u201d in Washington, D.C. to give the State of the Union response was a quid pro quo for her eventual support of Rubio\u2019s establishment candidacy.\n\nOf course the latest polls show Rubio slipping in New Hampshire \u2013 and he was pummeled by New Jersey governor Chris Christie during a recent debate. Rubio is currently in a four-way fight for second place in the Granite State \u2013 along with Iowa caucus winner Ted Cruz, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Ohio governor John Kasich.\n\n\u201cFirst in the South\u201d polling has him running a distant third behind Cruz and frontrunner Donald Trump \u2013 who is poised to receive a big South Carolina bump assuming he wins New Hampshire.\n\nWhat happens if Haley endorses Rubio \u2013 and it fails to move the needle?\n\nAlso, wouldn\u2019t endorsing Rubio put Haley on the hook for his crony capitalism, his conflicted views on amnesty, his contempt for liberty, his support for energy tax hikes, his mindless imperialism and his casting of the deciding vote for Barack Obama\u2018s trade bill, for starters.\n\nOh \u2026 and what if one of the many Rubio rumors blows up immediately after Haley endorses him?\n\nIdeological and political calculations aside, there\u2019s also a lot of drama between Haley and some of Rubio\u2019s top operatives. Of course it is worth noting that Haley\u2019s top political strategist \u2013 former Mark Sanford advisor Jon Lerner \u2013 is working for the political action committee that\u2019s backing Rubio\u2019s candidacy.\n\nAnd Lerner has tremendous sway with Haley \u2026\n\nPractically speaking, Haley\u2019s options are also limited. And the clock is ticking.\n\n\u201cHaley really has nowhere else to go,\u201d we wrote last month. \u201cNone of the other status quo \u2018Republican\u2019 candidates are even remotely viable in South Carolina \u2013 making Rubio the equivalent of the last guy standing at the dance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2016/02/08/nikki-haleys-2016-endorsement-dilemma/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/haley-568x370.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Nikki Haley's 2016 Endorsement Dilemma"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The most likely \u201cRepublican\u201d to receive Haley\u2019s support?\n\u201cFirst in the South\u201d polling has him running a distant third behind Cruz and frontrunner Donald Trump \u2013 who is poised to receive a big South Carolina bump assuming he wins New Hampshire.\n\u201cNone of the other status quo \u2018Republican\u2019 candidates are even remotely viable in South Carolina \u2013 making Rubio the equivalent of the last guy standing at the dance.\u201d\nAnd Lerner has tremendous sway with Haley \u2026Practically speaking, Haley\u2019s options are also limited.\nAt the time she backed Romney, Haley was at her nadir \u2013 polling at just over 52 percent among \u201cRepublican\u201d voters."}
