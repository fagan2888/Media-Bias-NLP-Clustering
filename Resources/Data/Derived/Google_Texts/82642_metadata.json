These four states rely largely on federal funding from the low-income pool, or LIP, to support hospitals and safety net providers who care for the uninsured. The Medicaid expansion included in the ACA is intended to replace this system by directly offering coverage to low-income Americans, but these states rejected the expansion for political reasons and instead are clinging to expiring LIP funding. Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) has gone so far as to sue the federal government in lieu of accepting the Medicaid expansion\u2014despite the fact that the federal government has no legal obligation to renew LIP funding and warned these states in 2014 that it would expire one year later. Texas and Kansas have each filed amicus briefs in support of Florida in the lawsuit. This blatant political gambit only serves the ambitions of the likes of Gov. Scott, while leaving millions of people without health coverage.\n\nWhat is LIP funding, and why should states expand Medicaid?\n\nThe low-income pool was created to help serve the uninsured, but it does not provide them with health insurance coverage. President George W. Bush established LIP funding in 2005 to help community health centers and hospitals that serve uninsured or underinsured populations.\n\nPresident George W. Bush established LIP funding in 2005 to help community health centers and hospitals that serve uninsured or underinsured populations. Unlike the LIP, Medicaid expansion under the ACA provides health insurance coverage directly to the uninsured\u2014a significantly better way to improve their access to affordable health care . This drastically reduces the number of uninsured people, which vastly reduces the need for LIP funding.\n\n. This drastically reduces the number of uninsured people, which vastly reduces the need for LIP funding. The LIP program is state and federally funded. The state share of the LIP is funded through contributions from health care providers that receive LIP money. The federal funds then match provider contributions at a rate of 60 percent to fully fund the program.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nExpanding Medicaid in just two states would insure more than 40 percent of Americans who are in the coverage gap. If Florida and Texas expanded Medicaid, more than 1.5 million people would become insured.\n\nIf Florida and Texas expanded Medicaid, more than 1.5 million people would become insured.
