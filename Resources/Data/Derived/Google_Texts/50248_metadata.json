You like people who share your opinions. But it\u2019s just not \u2014 you know, people like me are aware of what\u2019s on Fox News. I have a suspicion that the people on \u2014 who are Fox News watchers have no idea what\u2019s on MSNBC, and we see that in lots of things. I mean, one of the kind of things we do in my professional circuits is we say that a liberal economist can imitate a conservative economist, can pretend, can, you know, what will one of those guys say? The reverse is not true. So, there is a level of openness to at least acknowledging that there are other viewpoints, not agreeing with them, but understanding them that is not symmetric.\u201d\n\nKrugman further pointed to conservatives who alleged that unemployment and Obamacare enrollment numbers were inaccurate.\n\n(h/t Mediaite)\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Krugman: Left Has 'Level Of Openness' To Other Views Not Shared By the Right", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Krugman: Left Has 'Level Of Openness' To Other Views Not Shared By the Right", "title": "Krugman: Left Has 'Level Of Openness' To Other Views Not Shared By the Right - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Krugman-113-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/11/03/krugman-left-has-level-of-openness-to-other-views-not-shared-by-the-right/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Krugman: Left Has 'Level Of Openness' To Other Views Not Shared By the Right", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Krugman-113-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Krugman: Left Has 'Level Of Openness' To Other Views Not Shared By the Right - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Paul Krugman, Political Intolerance,Breitbart TV,Krugman", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Political Intolerance", "published_time": "2015-11-03T14:47:30-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "But it\u2019s just not \u2014 you know, people like me are aware of what\u2019s on Fox News.\nI have a suspicion that the people on \u2014 who are Fox News watchers have no idea what\u2019s on MSNBC, and we see that in lots of things.\nSo, there is a level of openness to at least acknowledging that there are other viewpoints, not agreeing with them, but understanding them that is not symmetric.\u201dKrugman further pointed to conservatives who alleged that unemployment and Obamacare enrollment numbers were inaccurate.\n(h/t Mediaite)Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nYou like people who share your opinions."}
