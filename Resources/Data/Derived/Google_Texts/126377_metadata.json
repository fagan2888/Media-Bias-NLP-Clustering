During the year, a couple of local companies went public, with Boulder-based Zayo Group executing a $400 million initial public offering.\n\nThe year included the sale of the Caribou Ranch property and former music studio for $32.5 million to a member of the Walton family, the Walmart heirs. Early in the year, Boulder and Denver played host to the first Trader Joe's specialty grocery stores to open in Colorado.\n\nM&A activity also was lively, with firms such as Rudi's Organic Bakery and EVOL Foods being acquired by the Hain Celestial Group and Boulder Brands Inc., respectively, and Broomfield's L:evel 3 Communications Inc. merging with Littleton-based TW Telecom in a $5.7 billion deal. Boulder County also could be heavily affected by the blockbuster $43 billion proposed acquisition of Covidien by Medtronic.\n\nA couple of those and other items will be highlighted in next week's Business Plus on companies and local business trends to watch in 2015.\n\nBelow are 10 of the top business-related news events to occur this year in Boulder County, as selected by the Daily Camera business staff.\n\n1.) Development boom in Boulder spurs business, draws concern\n\nBy the midpoint of 2012, more than 30 private building projects were in the development pipeline for the city of Boulder. Significant in size, location and historical context, the projects \u2014 most of which were likely held up during the recent recession \u2014 carried the potential to heavily alter portions of the city.\n\nIn 2014, much of those projects and others came to fruition, resulting in a boom of construction activity, big-time business deals, heightened fervor about continued economic growth and also a swelling of concern from some residents, business owners and city leaders about the effects of the development on the surrounding community and the direction of Boulder.\n\nWhen the former Daily Camera building was razed in downtown Boulder, marking the start of a two-year development to build the 400,000-square-foot PearlWest office and retail building, merchants along West Pearl already were feeling the stings from neighboring construction projects including a city streetscaping effort. Some proprietors along the West End of downtown started to mobilize and draft strategies to ensure their viability in the short- and long-term.\n\nConstruction activity at Depot Square at Boulder Junction on Dec. 12. (Cliff Grassmick / Daily Camera)\n\nIn central Boulder, other longtime businesses opted to close shop in the wake of large-scale redevelopments. On the eve of Cafe Food's final day, owner Dennis Oviatt said businesses such as his that catered to lower and middle income residents were being priced out of Boulder. City Councilman Sam Weaver floated the idea that the city should look at ways to maintain service-industrial spaces that would be more affordable for some businesses.\n\nThose suggestions and others could play a factor as the city in 2015 weighs the Envision East Arapahoe urban plan.\n\nNoting concerns about too much housing \u2014 especially high-end student housing \u2014 being developed on the University Hill commercial district, the Boulder City Council enacted a residential-unit moratorium on the Hill business district until March 18, 2015.\n\nPearl Place, the three-building, 330,000-square-foot office campus to be built off 30th and Pearl streets in place of businesses such as Cafe Food, earned the city's approval earlier this month. Preceding a key Planning Board decision, tech giant Google Inc. announced its intention to locate its Boulder campus to Pearl Place, invest more than $100 million in the development and conveyed hiring plans to have up to 1,500 employees eventually working at the site.\n\nWhile Google is targeting a 2017 move-in to Pearl Place, the neighboring Boulder Junction development is expected to come on line early next year.\n\n2.) Recreational marijuana comes to town\n\nA few hours into 2014, thousands of people of Colorado welcomed the states newest industry: recreational marijuana. More than three-dozen retail pot shops opened on Jan. 1, a result of voters passing Colorado Amendment 64 in 2012, but it took another month and a half for retail marijuana to come to Boulder.\n\nBy September, Boulder would record upward of $1 million in sales tax revenue from recreational marijuana retail sales, according to city of Boulder finance documents.\n\nAlthough some municipalities within the Boulder County region remained steadfast in their bans on retail marijuana. Broomfield extended its ban in September, with some city council members conveying concerns about risks and opting to observe how the industry fared elsewhere.\n\nAs recreational marijuana shops opened throughout the county, they did so with little to not backlash. The new legislation also resulted in the development of ancillary cannabis businesses \u2014 firms that do not handle the marijuana products but provide services for those who do.\n\nThe activity could fuel the \"Silicon Valley of weed\" in Colorado and establish areas such as Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins as hubs for the industry expected to bring in $10.2 billion in sales in 2018, analysts say.\n\n3.) Multifamily market on a streak\n\nThe hottest asset class of 2014 was multifamily. And in a college town like Boulder with a booming startup scene and a surrounding region that has experienced an influx of population, Boulder County saw its fair share of the apartment boom.\n\nA favorable lending environment helped fuel the construction of new apartment complexes throughout Boulder and Broomfield counties. The projects that were log-jammed during the recession combined with new arrivals are meant to address the demand that has sunk vacancy rates to historic lows.\n\nIn Boulder and the neighboring Gunbarrel, more than a dozen apartment projects were expected to add upward of 1,000 units. Broomfield has thousands of apartments under construction or in the planning stages.\n\nLongmont saw the rise of the 115-unit Roosevelt Park Apartments \u2014 the largest apartment complex to be built in the city in 10 years \u2014 in addition to the 220-unit, \"resort-style\" Mill Village on the eastern portion of the city. Apartments are expected to be a key feature in the redevelopment of the former Butterball plant in Longmont's downtown.\n\nThe bullish market piqued investors' interests in the region. Firms have paid more than a half-billion dollars this year alone on apartment complexes in Boulder County, according to a Daily Camera analysis of property statistics and deeds.\n\nSome real estate industry experts say they expect the current trend to continue, but others have expressed caution about the potential for overbuilding and how the rental market would fare if Colorado's construction defects law is reformed and condominium developments gain steam.\n\n4.) Amgen leaving Boulder County\n\nIn July, the Thousand Oaks, Calif.-based Amgen Inc. announced plans to close its facilities in Colorado and Washington by the end of 2015. The decision would result in the loss of 430 jobs between Amgen's Boulder and Longmont sites.\n\nThe job cuts started in the third quarter and the facilities are expected to be shut down completely by the end of next year, officials said.\n\nIn addition to the job losses, the move created feelings of uncertainty among members of the local bioscience community and regional economic development officials. Amgen served as a significant philanthropic contributor to the region and also played a significant role in the development of Boulder County's biotechnology industry as former Amgen employees went on to found Array BioPharma.\n\nAmgen also has a combined 1 million square feet of space between its Longmont an Boulder facilities.\n\n5.) Twin Peaks Mall reduced to rubble\n\nTwin Peaks Mall's redevelopment \u2014 plans that were years in the making and later delayed by foreclosure proceedings and legal scuttles \u2014 got under way in August of this year.\n\nTwenty-nine years after the Longmont mall opened its doors, an excavator ripped through the bricks and beams, setting the stage for the property's new life as Village at the Peaks.\n\nThe $85 million development from Newmark Merrill will be an open-air retail center anchored by Whole Foods, Sam's Club and a new Regal Theater. Other announced tenants include Gold's Gym, Wyatt's Total Beverage, and restaurants The Melt, Bad Daddy's Burger Bar and Parry's Pizza.\n\nDevelopers have said the mall could open by the 2015 holiday season. When it is operational, Village at the Peaks is expected to generate more than $175 million in taxable revenue, mall officials say.\n\n6.) Boulder Community Health makes historic moves\n\nSince unveiling a multi-phased, $125 million comprehensive plan in 2010, Boulder Community Hospital invested millions of dollars to expand its Foothills campus, readying the east Boulder facility for a pivotal change set to occur in 2014: Relocating the emergency, surgery and acute care services to 4747 Arapahoe Ave. from the Broadway campus that served as the hospital's base since 1922.\n\nBut this year also included several other noteworthy moves for Boulder's nonprofit health care organization: The sale of its Mapleton Center property for $12.9 million, the rebranding to Boulder Community Health, an agreement to base its Boulder Center for Sports Medicine at the University of Colorado Athletic Department's new facilities, and a reassessment of the Broadway campus.\n\nBoulder Community Health officials are expected to make a decision early next year on the future of the site off Broadway and Balsam Avenue. Plans for the former Mapleton Center \u2014 which traded hands later in the year for $15 million \u2014 likely will be disclosed in 2015 as well.\n\n7.) Dream Chaser misses out on NASA bid\n\nIn September, NASA awarded $6.8 billion Commercial Crew program awards to Boeing Co. and SpaceX to shuttle astronauts to the International Space Station. The awards set the stage for an \"ambitious and exciting chapter\" in space exploration, NASA officials said.\n\nNASA's decision, however, dealt a significant blow to Louisville-based Sierra Nevada Space Systems, a division of the Sparks, Nev.-based Sierra Nevada Corp. that built the Dream Chaser spacecraft. Sierra Nevada was the losing party of the three front-runners for the critical contract.\n\nSierra Nevada later would contest NASA's ruling and also laid off about 90 employees at its Space System division. Sierra Nevada officials said they plan to continue efforts related to human space travel and scientific-related missions in addition to bidding on future NASA projects.\n\n8.) Twitter acquires Boulder's Gnip for $134 million\n\nTwitter became the latest high-tech powerhouse to have an operation in Boulder when the social networking company acquired longtime partner Gnip Inc. for $134 million.\n\nThe deal helps to give Twitter greater control on the provision, aggregation and use of data and the resulting licensing revenue, analysts say. In Boulder, economic development officials expressed optimism that Twitter could eventually grow its local presence.\n\n9.) GoLite files for bankruptcy and liquidates its assets\n\nIn October, a locally based maker of lightweight outdoor gear quietly filed for bankruptcy, surprising many of its customers in the process. GoLite LLC initially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would have allowed for a restructuring of the debt; however, the situation quickly turned more bleak.\n\nTwo weeks later, GoLite updated its filing, indicating that it had no funding for inventory and was already in a \"liquidation mode\" and that Timberland, which held the GoLite trademark, terminated its license.\n\nThe bankruptcy judge approved GoLite's emergency motion for liquidation and the company moved forward on sales at its remaining stores and via online. As the liquidation commenced, GoLite co-founder Demetri Coupounas told BizWest that he had hoped to find investors to keep the company in business after the liquidation.\n\n10.) Diagonal Plaza floods, handicapping small, local businesses\n\nA middle-of-the-night fire line break created a wall of water that careened through the indoor mall at the Diagonal Plaza in Boulder, effectively shutting down the center and handicapping several small, local businesses for weeks.\n\nIt took about two months business to start trickling back into the center but some tenants feared how long it could take to get back to normal. Other tenants still faced lengthy repairs.\n\nAs of last week, Himalayas Restaurant still remained in the throes of repairs. Operators posted signs indicating that the local restaurant plans to reopen.\n\nAlicia Wallace: 303-473-1332, wallacea@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/dc_alicia", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/top-business/ci_27203596/top-10-boulder-area-business-stories-2014", "sailthru.author": "By Alicia Wallace \n  Camera Business Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27203596:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-28T14:00:07-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The final days of the year serve as  a time to reflect on what occurred during 2014.\nAnd in this week's Business Plus, the Daily Camera highlights some of the biggest local business stories of the past 12 months.", "title": "Top 10 Boulder-area business stories of 2014", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/top-business/ci_27203596/top-10-boulder-area-business-stories-2014", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1224/20141224__29DCBCOVw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Business: Top Business", "modificationDate": "2014-12-28T09:02:32-0700", "endDate": "2024-12-24T16:14:26-0700", "news_keywords": "business,economy,technology news,business information,Boulder, Boulder County,Broomfield County,local businesses,tech sector,startups,natural food industry,construction,development,real estate,Boulder,Broomfield,Longmont,Louisville,Lafayette,Colorado", "byline": "By Alicia WallaceCamera", "pubDate": "2014-12-27T22:46:12-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-12-28T14:00:07-0700", "sailthru.title": "Top 10 Boulder-area business stories of 2014", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1224/20141224__29DCBCOVw~2_300.jpg", "description": "The final days of the year serve as  a time to reflect on what occurred during 2014.\nAnd in this week's Business Plus, the Daily Camera highlights some of the biggest local business stories of the past 12 months.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/top-business/ci_27203596/top-10-boulder-area-business-stories-2014", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The final days of the year serve as  a time to reflect on what occurred during 2014.\nAnd in this week's Business Plus, the Daily Camera highlights some of the biggest local business stories of the past 12 months.", "title": "Top 10 Boulder-area business stories of 2014"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1224/20141224__29DCBCOVw~2.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d5b\"", "article_summary": "And in this week's Business Plus, the Daily Camera highlights some of the biggest local business stories of the past 12 months.\nA couple of those and other items will be highlighted in next week's Business Plus on companies and local business trends to watch in 2015.\nDevelopment boom in Boulder spurs business, draws concernBy the midpoint of 2012, more than 30 private building projects were in the development pipeline for the city of Boulder.\nBelow are 10 of the top business-related news events to occur this year in Boulder County, as selected by the Daily Camera business staff.\nThe $85 million development from Newmark Merrill will be an open-air retail center anchored by Whole Foods, Sam's Club and a new Regal Theater."}
