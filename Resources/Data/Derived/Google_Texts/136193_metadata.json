The proceeds from the sale also provide B&G with more cash on hand to pursue additional targets in the sector, the company says.\n\n\u201cB&G Foods intends to use the proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, which could include, among other things, repayment of other long-term debt or possible acquisitions,\u201d says B&G.\n\nThe company sold the stock at $33.55 per share in a public offering that closed March 15, via underwriter Barclays Capital. Following the closure, B&G lowered its earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2016 to a range of $1.90 to $2.00, down from $1.89 to $2.09. As of January 2, 2016, B&G\u2019s long-term indebtedness totaled $1.7 billion, according to a company SEC filing.\n\nWith its most recent target\u2014and the largest to date for the company\u2014B&G acquired frozen and canned vegetable product lines Green Giant and Le Sueur from General Mills Inc. in a $765 million cash transaction. The company completed the acquisition in November. B&G expects Green Giant to generate annualized net sales of approximately $550 million and annualized adjusted Ebitda of approximately $95 million to $100 million, the company said following the acquisition, while also noting the frozen food business provides an additional avenue for future growth and acquisitions.\n\n\u201cWhat investors should always expect from B&G is we do accretive acquisitions,\u201d Robert Cantwell, president, CEO and director at B&G told analysts in a Feb. 25 conference call discussing the company\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings. \u201cWe're buying brands that fit our portfolio. We're buying them for multiples way below what we trade at.\u201d\n\nB&G, which has historically picked up snack and grocery brands, may \u201ccontinue to inch outside of its comfort zone when making acquisitions\u201d as seen with the Green Giant purchase, say analysts at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. The Green Giant acquisition was riskier for the B&G than earlier transactions not only because it represented the company\u2019s foray into the frozen food category, but because it was also the first target for B&G since 2012 with more than $100 million in annual sales.\n\nLooking back, smaller add-ons for the Parsippany, New Jersey-based manufacturer of shelf-stable foods have included the $50 million purchase of Spartan Foods of America Inc., maker of pizza crust brand Mama Mary's, from private equity firm Linsalata Capital Partners in July; its $155 million acquisition of packaged foods company Specialty Brands of America Inc. from private equity firm American Capital Ltd. (Nasdaq: ACAS) in April 2014 ; and its buy of granola bar maker Rickland Orchards LLC from Natural Instincts LLC for $57.5 million in October 2013.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect B&G to make any large acquisitions in the near-term as it absorbs Green Giant, the largest acquisition in its history,\u201d says Moody\u2019s in a report. \u201cBut we expect it to make bolt-on purchases, which it will fund with its $500 million revolver.\u201d\n\nThe rating agency added, \u201cWe expect future acquisitions will occur in snacks and grocery if opportunities present themselves. Frozen foods will also be key once the company has established its frozen infrastructure.\u201d\n\nB&G is likely to pursue assets that help the company scale aspects of the business and targets with growth outpacing the relatively slow overall food industry, say observers.\n\nRepresentatives for B&G did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"status": "open", "domain": "Mergers & Acquisitions", "sailthru.author": "Jakema Lewis", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-04-17 06:00:00", "og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/strategic_m_a/b-and-g-expected-to-make-more-acquisitions-after-stock-sale-260147-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/snackaisle.jpeg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "B&G Expected to Make More Acquisitions After Stock Sale"}, "type": "Article", "brand": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-17 06:00:00", "wordcount": 571, "sailthru.title": "B&G Expected to Make More Acquisitions After Stock Sale", "featured": 1, "sailthru.tags": "News, Food & Beverage, Strategic Buyers, Strategic Buyers, B&G Expected to Make More Acquisitions After Stock Sale, green giant, shares, 4.6 million, Robert Cantwell, $153 million, Le Sueur, Barclays Capital, Spartan Foods, Moody s Investors Service, Spartan Foods of America Inc., Mama Mary s, Linsalata Capital Partners, Specialty Brands of America Inc., American Capital Ltd., Rickland Orchards LLC, Natural Instincts LLC, mergers and acquisitions, Article", "sailthru.description": "The company acquired Green Giant, Le Sueur and Spartan Foods in 2015 and is likely to pursue more targets", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/snackaisle.jpeg"}, "article_summary": "B&G Expected to Make More Acquisitions After Stock SaleThe company acquired Green Giant, Le Sueur and Spartan Foods in 2015 and is likely to pursue more targetsSteady strategic acquirer B&G Foods (NYSE: BGS) sold 4.6 million shares in a public stock offering, giving the company $152 million to repay debt outstanding.\n\u201cB&G Foods intends to use the proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, which could include, among other things, repayment of other long-term debt or possible acquisitions,\u201d says B&G.\n\u201cWe do not expect B&G to make any large acquisitions in the near-term as it absorbs Green Giant, the largest acquisition in its history,\u201d says Moody\u2019s in a report.\nThe proceeds from the sale also provide B&G with more cash on hand to pursue additional targets in the sector, the company says.\n\u201cWhat investors should always expect from B&G is we do accretive acquisitions,\u201d Robert Cantwell, president, CEO and director at B&G told analysts in a Feb. 25 conference call discussing the company\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings."}
