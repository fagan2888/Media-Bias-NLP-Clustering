Director Debra Granik didn\u2019t follow up with another fictional feature, but instead made this documentary, latching onto a charismatic Vietnam War veteran who had a small role in her Appalachian drama. Ron \u201cStray Dog\u201d Hall, a grizzled 60-something biker and Missouri RV park manager, commands the screen as much as any Hollywood ing\u00e9nue.

The film was made by Susan Littenberg, a film editor whose nonfiction credits include Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cAnd Everything Is Going Fine.\u201d Its revival tops a program of films screened as part of the artist-run festival\u2019s 20th anniversary, with documentaries about the late violinist Billy Bang and the prolific partnership of bassist William Parker and drummer Hamid Drake.\n\nENLARGE Queen Bee Ho in \u2018Mala Mala,\u2019 about Puerto Rico\u2019s transgender culture.

The filmmakers, Dan Sickles and Antonio Santini, connect with sex workers and stage performers whose colorful attitudes and anecdotes buoy a struggle to get by. They also get a bigger picture of the island\u2019s LGBT culture, whether from Soraya, a 65-year-old sex-change pioneer, or Ivana, a high-profile activist. The cinematography evokes a seductive tropical noir. The filmmakers join one of the stars, April Carrion, for a Q&A after the 8:25 p.m. Friday show.\n\nImageNation Outdoors Festival\n\nMultiple venues\n\nimagenation.us\n\nThrough Aug. 22\n\nA series of eight films in six city parks across four boroughs continues Monday at Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem with \u201cHalf of a Yellow Sun,\u201d a 2013 historical drama about two sisters (Thandie Newton, Anika Noni Rose) set during the Nigerian Civil War.

The film\u2019s subject and patron is Leon Russell, a laid-back fusion of Hank Williams and Jerry Lee Lewis from Oklahoma, once called \u201cThe Master of Space and Time.\u201d Mr. Blank disorders those dimensions, cutting from jocular performances (anyone you\u2019d want to see at a Willie Nelson barbecue) to recurring interludes with hungry snakes and glass-eating eccentrics.",
