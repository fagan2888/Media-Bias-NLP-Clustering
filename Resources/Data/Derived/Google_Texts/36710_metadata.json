And of course, confer with your tax accountant to ensure you\u2019ve reached the right thresholds for maximum deductions. But here are four \u201creminders\u201d to get your finances in order before the end of the year.\n\nMax out your 401k contributions. By deferring as much as possible of your salary, you\u2019ll significantly lower your tax payment for 2014. Sachs noted that he recently helped a client defer as much as $40,000 of her salary in the last few weeks of the year, saving her $16,000 in taxes.\n\nYou can use some of your salary or even your year-end bonus to max out your 401k for 2014. The limit for this year is $17,500 for those under 50 years old and $23,000 for those over 50 years old. In the case of Sachs\u2019s client, a state university employee, she was able to contribute $23,000 to her 401k and $17,500 to her 457 Retirement plan. \u201cWhen you have a higher salary, it\u2019s obviously a little bit easier to do,\u201d Sachs said.\n\nTry the seven-day cash challenge. Edward Gjertsen, vice president at Mack Investment Securities in Northfield, Ill., recommends ditching credit cards for a full week. He said you should anticipate how much you\u2019ll spend in cash (for everyday expenses such as gas, food and coffee, not for rent or utilities) and see how long your cash will actually last. \u201cThe point is that you\u2019ll be more aware of where your money goes,\u201d adding that most people run out of money by Wednesday. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have credit cards, you control spending better,\u201d William Schretter, a financial advisor with Raymond James in Lebanon, Ohio, said in an email interview.\n\nRelated: 10 Worst States for Taxes in 2014\n\nCheck your \u201cconvenience\u201d payments. Think automatic payments that may come only once a year and get automatically renewed unless you stop them, such as magazine subscriptions or some kinds of gym membership. \u201cWe typically forget about these payments that automatically renew,\u201d said Gjertsen. \u201cWe\u2019re being swiped.\u201d He noted that it\u2019s a good idea to change the number of your credit card every year or couple of years since it forces you to look at payments you may have forgotten about.\n\nReview your insurance coverage. This means all your insurance policies from life to health care, disability, long-term care, car and so on. You should do this checkup on an annual basis since insurance rates fluctuate and your own situation may have also changed since last year. You may find cheaper coverage at a competitor or qualify for a discount from your existing insurance company. \u201cShop around to see if there are better rates out there,\u201d Maria Kutscher, CEO of Allovest in Huntington Beach, Calif., said in an email. This annual review is also a great opportunity to make sure you are adequately covered.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When it comes to your finances, don\u2019t wait until the New Year to make resolutions.
