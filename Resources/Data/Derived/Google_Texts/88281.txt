Have you ever thought, "Hey, I wish my cat could be here with me right now," in the middle your yoga class? Yeah, me neither. However, with the introduction of cat cafes and cat libraries, it seems the new norm for so-called “cat people” is bringing their shady four-legged friends wherever they go. The Homeward Bound Pet Shelter in Decatur, Ill. sent six cats to Yoga at Connie’s in Latham, Ill. in hopes of finding suitable owners for cats in need of homes.

“June is Adopt-a-Cat Month,” the video descriptions reads. “Here is the feature everyone has been talking about! The cats of #‎HBPS enjoyed some time on the mat with the students of Yoga at Connie's in this purrfect promotion. This small event raised over $500 for HBPS, including paw protector sponsors for two cats. In addition to those you see here, we have many other friendly and interactive felines patiently waiting for their forever homes.”

Although this is the first time Homeward Bound Pet Shelter and Yoga at Connie’s collaborated for this unique feline-friendly event, they fully expect similar partnerships in the future to help raise awareness of pet adoption — especially since the event successfully raised $500 and facilitated the adoption of one of the yoga-loving cats. Considering only 37 percent of cats that arrive at animal shelters across the United States are eventually adopted, perhaps other shelters should ponder a similar course of action.
