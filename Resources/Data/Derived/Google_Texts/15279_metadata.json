Liufau threw deep into triple coverage on the game\u2019s first play from scrimmage Saturday and was intercepted by Hawaii cornerback Ne\u2019Quan Phillips.\n\nGive Liufau credit for resilience. Successful quarterbacks must have a short memory in times of adversity, and the native of Tacoma, Wash., continues to demonstrate the ability to focus forward rather than dwell on the past.\n\nShaking off that blunder, Liufau threw two touchdown passes and led Colorado (2-2) to a 21-12 nonconference victory over the Rainbow Warriors on a sun-splashed afternoon with 39,478 watching at Folsom Field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about getting the \u2018W,\u2019 \u201d Liufau said.\n\nWhen asked about the first snap, Liufau said after the game he thought that, in another area of the field, a Hawaii defender would be called for pass interference against freshman wideout Shay Fields. So Liufau just heaved a high pass down the field to Nelson Spruce, evidently with no concern about the coverage.\n\n\u201cI thought we had a free play,\u201d Liufau said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to just throw the ball up there if there\u2019s no foul. But that\u2019s it. That was the end of that. We were moving on.\u201d\n\nAnd how. Later in the first quarter, Liufau spotted Spruce in single coverage down the left sideline and hit the sure-handed junior for a 71-yard touchdown.\n\nAs has been the norm of late, Spruce contributed a huge game. He set a school record by catching a touchdown pass in his sixth consecutive game and finished with 13 receptions for 172 yards.\n\n\u201cNelson is my safety blanket,\u201d Liufau said.\n\nA seven-point favorite, CU added two more touchdowns in the first half: a 13-yard receiver run by Fields with a nifty cutback and a 9-yard flip from Liufau to fullback George Frazier. Those enabled the Buffs to take a 21-6 lead into halftime.\n\nLiufau finished the afternoon with 287 yards passing. But the Buffs failed to score in the second half and seemed to put all the pressure on their defense. CU defenders responded in a stuffing sort of way, especially inside the Buffs\u2019 20.\n\nHawaii (1-3) failed to get into the end zone and netted a total of just 9 total yards for 11 plays in the red zone. Hawaii\u2019s points came on four field goals. The Rainbow Warriors, perhaps just a couple of big plays from challenging for the lead, could not add to their modest point total in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building an identity,\u201d CU sophomore safety Chidobe Awuzie said of the Buffs\u2019 defense. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to play tough and we\u2019re trying to cause turnovers and we\u2019re trying to play fast. This is just the start of it.\u201d\n\nColorado senior cornerback Greg Henderson became a thorn in Hawaii\u2019s game plan of hitting receivers on crossing routes. Henderson deflected four Hawaii passes and, on one play, stuffed the stats sheet by recording a sack, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery when getting to quarterback Ikaika Woolsey on a blitz in the first half.\n\n\u201cGreg Henderson is one of the best defensive backs in the Pac-12,\u201d Spruce said. \u201cGoing against each other in practice makes us both better.\u201d\n\nCU coach Mike MacIntyre said with his team stuck on 21 points, it wasn\u2019t the easiest game for him to watch.\n\n\u201cThat was kind of an exhausting win,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cWe had them (beaten), but all you\u2019re thinking is, \u2018(The Rainbow Warriors) are hanging around.\u2019 But our kids just kept battling and battling.\u201d\n\nCU completed the nonconference portion of its schedule, and it\u2019s back to Pac-12 play for the Buffs on Saturday at California.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler\n\nGame balls\n\n1.
