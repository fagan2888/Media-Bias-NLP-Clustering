With them, go good-paying jobs which are part of a real creative economy. Now that the program sunset is hanging over us, we know we\u2019re at the end of our rope,\u201d he said.\n\nCalifornia and New York have always proved the top production states.\n\nBut Georgia has overtaken a declining Florida for the third spot, many industry-watchers said. Its rich incentive program has earned it the nickname \u201cYa\u2019llywood.\u201d\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott has never been a fan of the incentive program, which has made $296 million available to 312 projects since 2010. Florida House leaders also have sided with tea party-aligned activists angered by the idea of the government handing taxpayer money to corporations.\n\nWhile advocates struggle to come up with a proposal to keep some form of incentives alive, Scott shows little interest in courting Hollywood.\n\nScott is pushing lawmakers hard to approve $250 million that he could dangle before companies interested in moving or expanding in Florida. But film money was again shut out in the $79.3 billion state budget proposal he unveiled on Monday.\n\n\u201cOur state has been in the film industry for 100 years,\u201d said Film Florida President Michelle Hillery, who also is deputy director of Palm Beach County\u2019s Film and Television Commission.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to walk away from it,\u201d she added.\n\nThe county\u2019s film office assists with a couple hundred production permits each year. The movie and television industry brought in $138 million to the county in 2013, according to the commission.\n\nBut industry advocates say Florida has lost more than $650 million in film and TV productions since 2013.\n\nSome productions that got away may not have had the allure of a Miami Vice. Hot Tub Time Machine 2 is a film that considered but declined to shoot in Palm Beach County, the industry points out in its list of lost productions.\n\nDespite the productions lost, film and TV projects are still providing thousands of cast, crew, catering and other jobs tied to location shoots, supporters say. Studies show that projects completed in Florida from 2010 to last year paid Floridians almost $1 billion in wages. State economists put the industry\u2019s economic impact in Florida at $4.1 billion annually.\n\nNot everyone is convinced, though.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in favor of incentives, as long as we get a great return for our taxpayers,\u201d Scott said in Jacksonville last week, following his budget rollout.\n\nA study earlier this year by the Legislature\u2019s Office of Economic and Demographic Research hurt the industry\u2019s self-portrayal as an economic engine. The analysis showed the Florida gets a modest, 43 cents back on every dollar it hands out in tax credits to film and TV productions.\n\nIndustry officials dispute those findings, arguing the return is much higher. They fault the way state economists calculate the dollars and say the value of productions can prove hard to calculate.\n\nHillery said a recent survey by the state\u2019s tourism arm, Visit Florida, showed 22.7 percent of domestic visitors said viewing a movie or television series filmed in Florida contributed to their decision to travel here.\n\nBut such claims don\u2019t quiet critics.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t think that government should be a bank,\u201d said Skylar Zander, deputy Florida director of Americans for Prosperity, the advocacy organization launched by David and Charles Koch, the oil industry titans and conservative financiers.\n\nAFP has spearheaded opposition to Florida\u2019s tax-credit program for building sports stadiums, and sees the film program in a similar light.\n\nWhile Georgia has boomed, other states are scaling back like Florida, including once-robust Louisiana, Michigan and North Carolina.\n\n\u201cWe want to see a thriving film business,\u201d Zander said. \u201cWe just think it should compete, like all businesses have to.\u201d\n\nA problem with the current program is that tax credits were granted on a first-come, first-served basis, leading to the program quickly running through all the available dollars.\n\nSenate Commerce and Tourism Chair Nancy Detert, R-Venice, a leading advocate, has been trying to change that.\n\nShe is filing legislation that would renew the program for another five years, but restructure it to require more evaluation of projects seeking state dollars.\n\nThen, she said she\u2019ll work on getting money in the budget.\n\n\u201cWhat I wanted to see was an energetic film commission seeking out good projects, hoping to lure companies, mainly from California\u2026and bring their industry here permanently,\u201d Detert said at a committee hearing last week, where she lashed out at Scott\u2019s film commissioner, Niki Welge.\n\nUnless it\u2019s fixed, she warned, \u201cIt sunsets in 2016. It\u2019s dead.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida film industry advocates, Sen.
