Now \u201cit is the primary source of retirement income for most working Americans. There is an appreciation for it.\u201d\n\nThe survey also revealed a lot of regrets. The majority of those polled said one of their biggest mistakes in life was not saving enough.\n\nAnd if workers could go back in time and talk to their younger selves, what would they say? No, not \u201cBuy Apple shares in 1980.\u201d Instead, 8 out of 10 pre-retirees would admonish themselves to save more. Even younger workers said they would scold themselves to salt away extra money. This feeling that they haven\u2019t saved enough is reflected in older employees\u2019 outlook for life in retirement: One-third of them expect their standard of living to decline then.\n\nGet discounts on insurance and banking services with your AARP Member Advantages. \u00bb\n\nEven so, American Century notes that workers are still not squirreling away enough money. Most say they don\u2019t earn enough to save, are paying off debts or have unexpected expenses. (AARP offers an online calculator that will tell you if you\u2019re saving enough.)\n\nWorkers want more help from their employers with saving for retirement, the survey found. Two-thirds of pre-retirees would like at least a slight nudge from their employers to encourage saving, and 13 percent would appreciate \u201ca kick in the pants.\u201d\n\nThis nudge usually takes the form of making saving easier with strategies such as automatic enrollment into the retirement plan or regularly increasing the amount that employees contribute to the plan each year, Gallagher says. Employers often underestimate how much workers want this kind of help, she adds.\n\nPhoto: Mphillips007/iStock\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Which would you rather have: a job that offers a 401(k) or one that doesn\u2019t have a retirement plan but comes with a higher salary?
