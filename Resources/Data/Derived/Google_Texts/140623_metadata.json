For female first-timers, the comparable figures are 54 percent and 49 percent, respectively.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS\n\nWithout this guidance, the chances of missteps by newcomers significantly increase the chance that they will make bad first impressions on other directors that may linger, Westphal says.\n\nTheir subsequent participation will continue to be seen through the lens of any early behavior that did not conform, he says. So much so, that the lack of mentoring reduces the likelihood by 57 percent that first-timers will be invited during the next two years to join a second corporate board.\n\nThe findings are ironic given that minority first-time directors tend to have stronger qualifications than white male first-time directors, Westphal says.\n\nThey have significantly higher levels of management experience, provide higher levels of advice and information to CEOs, and demonstrate knowledge and strategic insight that are rated more highly by their peers.\n\n\u201cIt is commonly thought that a particular virtue of having women and minorities as directors is that they bring an outsider\u2019s perspective to boards,\u201d he says. \u201cIronically, it may very well contribute to the discrimination and career impediment that we have uncovered in this study.\u201d\n\nYet the presence of incumbent female or minority board members does significantly increase the mentoring received by newcomers of the same group. Still, this benefit is largely overwhelmed by discrimination on the majority of corporate boards, the study shows.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Futurity.org.
