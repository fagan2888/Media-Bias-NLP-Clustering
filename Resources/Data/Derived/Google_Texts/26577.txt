WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Finance Health Care Subcommittee , today issued the following after a U.S. District Court judge issued a ruling in House v. Burwell that could imperil key provisions of the Affordable Care Act.

"Since day one, Congressional Republicans have put partisan politics above the well-being of millions of Americans by expending an inordinate amount of energy and taxpayer dollars trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. After countless show-votes to repeal the law and before presenting any alternative, a simple fact remains: The Affordable Care Act is working. Millions of Americans who could not afford insurance now have affordable, quality coverage," said Senator Cardin . "The doom-and-gloom prophecies from Congressional Republicans have not come to pass. The Affordable Care Act has not gutted our economy, in fact we are experiencing the longest sustained period of private sector job creation in modern history. I see no reason to celebrate the ruling in House v. Burwell, a decision that stands to price low-income Americans out of receiving basic healthcare. While I respect our judicial system as a separate and co-equal branch, I disagree with today's decision and I believe that it should be overturned."
