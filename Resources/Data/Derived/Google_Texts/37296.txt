How much does lobbying by the major food manufacturers factor into the final guidelines? And do these recommendations have any real impact on the American diet? With Michael Moss, author, and Joe Bastianich, restaurateur.

For the first time ever, the federal government is telling Americans to limit their consumption of added sugar to no more than 10 percent of daily calories. Naturally occurring sugars found in vegetables and fruits are permissible, but Uncle Sam now suggests that consumers also regulate their intake of sugar in processed foods

Based on a 2,000 calorie per day diet, this allows for just 200 calories from added sugarâ€”the equivalent of one 12 ounce can of Coke that contains 140 calories.

The guidelines are issued every five years by health officials, and normally come with a heaping portion of controversy. The new edict is no different: Less than a week after the guidance was issued, a lawsuit was filed that sought to overturn it.

Food watchers tell CNBC it's all part of the politics surrounding food and dieting.

"It's a miracle these things even come out because they are overseen by the Department of Agriculture, which doesn't even have to be lobbied to promote meat, dairy, and big food," author and investigative journalist Michael Moss told "On the Money" recently. "It's their job, it's their mission."
