They stunk of putrid, stale cigarette smoke, urine and feces \u2014 their own, along with cat and rodent urine and excrement. They could not speak. They made noises. Like animals.\n\nWhen horrific child-abusing couple Wayne Sperling and Lorinda Bailey were mercifully relieved of their parental rights and hauled out of their stunningly filthy apartment in Denver more than a year ago, Sperling looked like Saddam Hussein when he was pulled from that hole in Iraq by U.S. troops in 2003. Frankly, Sperling\u2019s wife did, too. The arrest mug shots were unsettling.\n\nFlash forward through the train wreck of our judicial and human services systems to this month, when Sperling and Bailey appeared in court again.\n\nHe had a really nice haircut. A neatly trimmed beard. A spiffy suit. Bailey, too, had a different hairstyle and hair color. She wore makeup. They looked like lawyers. Which shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Their lawyers groomed them and dressed them up for their sentencing appearance.\n\nTried to make them look human.\n\nDenver prosecutors, apparently not confident they could convict the two, first struck a sweet deal with Bailey. They dropped six original charges against her, including four counts of felony child abuse, and allowed her to plead guilty to two lesser child abuse charges.\n\nDenver District Court Judge Eric Elliff thought that was a terrific idea. He not only accepted the lovely plea deal but also capped it off Nov. 7 by sentencing Bailey \u2014 who could have received seven years in prison \u2014 to 90 days in jail.\n\nNinety days.\n\nThen, on Nov. 13, it was Sperling\u2019s turn to play \u201cLet\u2019s Make a Deal\u201d with our tough prosecutors. The original six charges were dropped. In return, he pleaded guilty to one charge of child abuse.\n\nEven though there were four horribly neglected children living with feces and thousands of dead and dying flies, according to police.\n\nSperling will be sentenced Dec. 30. He, too, could get up to seven years in prison. He will not. Same judge. Ninety days in jail would be a good bet.\n\nOh, and both Sperling and Bailey have duped the system previously. The Sperling-Bailey baby machines each pleaded guilty to child abuse in 2006 and 2009. Bailey lost three older children in 2009 when her parental rights were terminated.\n\nFrom the 2013 arrest report in the current cases:\n\n\u201c(The officer) noted a strong odor of a decomposing animal when Sperling opened the door. The officer reported the \u2018smell became unbearable\u2019 as they entered the apartment. The room from which the smell emanated was full of flies \u2026 covering every surface.\u201d\n\nA detective said last week that after the four boys were taken away from the parents from hell, they were each given a sandwich and an apple.\n\n\u201cThe boys, who communicated through grunts and physical contact,\u201d the story said, \u201cpatted the sandwiches and rolled the apples on the floor like toys.\u201d\n\nAnd, somehow, we still find a way to sleep at night.\n\nContact Rich Tosches at richtosches@gmail.com.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tosches: No justice in Denver child abuse case", "title": "Tosches: No justice in Denver child abuse case", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/21/tosches-no-justice-in-denver-child-abuse-case/", "image": {"width": 613, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141121__20141123_Z00_OP23C_TOSCHESp1.jpg", "height": 614}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141121__20141123_Z00_OP23C_TOSCHESp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-21T12:30:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T14:13:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9670\"", "article_summary": "They dropped six original charges against her, including four counts of felony child abuse, and allowed her to plead guilty to two lesser child abuse charges.\nThe Sperling-Bailey baby machines each pleaded guilty to child abuse in 2006 and 2009.\nIn return, he pleaded guilty to one charge of child abuse.\nDenver prosecutors, apparently not confident they could convict the two, first struck a sweet deal with Bailey.\nThey stunk of putrid, stale cigarette smoke, urine and feces \u2014 their own, along with cat and rodent urine and excrement."}
