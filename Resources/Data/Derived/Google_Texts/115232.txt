INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indiana judiciary is seeking input from the public on child support guidelines , which are court rules that determine how much child support money each parent is obligated to pay.

Q+A: Indiana's child support system

Comments from the public about proposed changes to the guidelines will be accepted until Aug. 11.

We have covered child support problems extensively, including talking to parents who say the stateâ€™s child support system is broken and unfair.

The proposed changes include revisions concerning the cost of health insurance for children under the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA), the change in the age of emancipation from 21 years to 19 years and clarification of educational and extracurricular activity expenses.

Once comments are submitted to the Domestic Relations Committee of the Indiana Judicial Conference, it will review the responses and prepare a final draft for submission to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will decide whether to approve the guidelines.
