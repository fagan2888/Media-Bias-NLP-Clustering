However, nearly four years later, the jury is still out on how rural hospitals have been affected by the law.\n\nThis edition of \u201cRoad to Reform\u201d takes a look at the challenges facing rural hospitals and how the ACA might address them.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick overview of the current rural hospital landscape.\n\nNumbers: According to data compiled by the American Hospital Association, there are 1,980 rural community hospitals in the U.S. As of June 30, the Flex Monitoring Team estimated that there were 1,326 critical access hospitals \u2014 which are defined as hospitals located in a rural area, more than 35 miles from another hospital, that typically have a 24/7 emergency department and no more than 25 inpatient beds. Critical access facilities, a subset of rural hospitals, receive an additional 1% payment from Medicare.\n\nMergers and acquisitions: Data from Irving Levin & Associates show the overall number of hospital mergers and acquisitions declined by 21.5% between 2013 and 2012. Among rural hospitals, the annual number of mergers and acquisitions declined between 2010 and 2012, a data brief by the North Carolina Health Research Program shows.\n\nClosures: Meanwhile, the number of rural hospital that closured has increased since the ACA was signed into law, from three closures in 2010 to 13 closures in 2013 and 13 so far this year, according to the NC Health Research Program.\n\nIn an interview with California Healthline, Mark Holmes, director of the NC Health Research Program, said, \u201cThe ACA is getting a lot of credit and blame, but a lot else has happened.\u201d Factors such as the economic recovery also have affected rural hospitals.\n\nThe ACA Provisions Directly Affecting Rural Hospitals\n\nAlthough the health care reform law was not tailored to suit the specific needs of rural and critical access hospitals, such providers are poised to benefit from the law. Here are a few examples of provisions covering rural hospitals.\n\n340B program expansion: Critical access hospitals now can participate in the federal government\u2019s 340B drug discount program, meaning they can receive certain outpatient prescription drugs at a lower price.\n\nAccountable care organizations: Just like other hospitals, rural facilities can create ACOs, which are designed to help coordinate services and improve efficiency and offer the possibility of shared savings.\n\nHealth insurance exchanges: The ACA\u2019s health insurance exchanges were touted as a way to help achieve universal coverage and reduce the amount of uncompensated care provided. Rural areas generally have higher numbers of uninsured residents, meaning providers in those areas could benefit from an increase in health coverage.\n\nPilot projects to test new care models: The ACA established several demonstration projects, including the frontier community health integration project demonstration, which aims to develop and test new care models in rural areas to improve health outcomes and reduce Medicare costs.\n\nValue-based purchasing program: Critical access hospitals must be included in the program\u2019s quality reporting requirements and measurements by 2012, which would increase transparency of hospital practices.\n\nThe ACA Provisions That Missed Expectations\n\nNot all of the ACA\u2019s promised improvements for rural hospitals have become reality.\n\nAccording to Kaiser Health News, fewer than one in 20 critical access hospitals are part of an ACO. Leah Binder of the Leapfrog Group said that many rural hospitals do not have a large enough patient base to form ACOs and, therefore, struggle to take part.\n\nMeanwhile, the frontier community health integration pilot has been limited to five states \u2014 Alaska, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota and Wyoming \u2014 and no critical access hospital participants have been announced yet.\n\nFurther, Congress has yet to provide funding for critical access hospitals to receive bonuses or penalties based on quality.\n\nPriya Bathija, senior associate director of policy at the American Hospital Association, told California Healthline that \u201cthere is a sentiment from critical access hospitals that they want to participate in those programs, and some are publicly reporting their quality data.\u201d She noted that critical access hospitals could benefit from such a program that takes into account the hospitals\u2019 lower patient volume.\n\nAnother challenge for rural hospitals is that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling to allow states to opt out of the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion has created a greater financial burden on hospitals in non-expansion states, Bathija said. A findings brief from the NC Rural Health Research Program notes that of the 11 states not expanding Medicaid at the time of its research, six \u2014 Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming \u2014 had more than 20% of their populations residing in rural areas.\n\nHolmes, also an associate professor of health policy and management at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, \u201cRural areas were generally more uninsured and although a lot of [ACA] provisions were designed to mitigate that gap in some states,\u201d it has gotten worse because some states with large rural populations declined to expand their Medicaid programs. According to Holmes, it\u2019s \u201cnot a design or implementation issue, that is just how things transpired.\u201d\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nDespite the current atmosphere, Holmes said he expects the ACA will eventually benefit rural hospitals, but it will take a few years before those benefits are tangible.\n\nHowever, some industry experts say that rural hospitals have had to resort to mergers to continue to survive. And \u201cthe jury is still out on how [mergers] will play out for rural communities,\u201d Binder said.\n\nIn the meantime, CMS appears to be addressing some of the ACA provisions that rural hospitals struggled to meet. Just this month, CMS announced the ACO Investment Model, which aims to help small and rural providers develop the infrastructure necessary to thrive in Medicare\u2019s ACO program.\n\nAround the nation\n\nHealthCare.gov imposter: The Washington Post\u2018s \u201cWonkblog\u201d takes a look at a private website called HealthCare.com and how it could cause confusion among consumers who are trying to reach the federal government\u2019s health insurance exchange.\n\nPartisan discord: Modern Healthcare reports that a political standoff could be brewing as Republicans continue to criticize the ACA\u2019s risk corridor program as a \u201cbailout\u201d for insurers, while Democrats say it is designed to encourage participation in the law\u2019s insurance exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Rural hospitals stand to benefit from many of the Affordable Care Act's provisions, but some of those benefits have been delayed and others have been changed in court.
