In 2014 CHIP covered about 8.1 million children.The ACA extended the authorization for CHIP through 2019 but left it up to Congress to extend funding for the program beyond 2015. Lawmakers included a two-year extension in legislation last year that repealed Medicare's sustainable growth-rate formula for paying physicians.It's likely that Congress will extend funding again before 2017 to avoid disrupting coverage for millions of children, according to Rachel Klein, director of organizational strategy for the consumer advocacy group Families USA. She added that the program enjoys strong bipartisan support.In addition to offering more affordable coverage, CHIP plans are generally more comprehensive for \u201cchild-specific\u201d services (such as dental, vision and habilitation) and for children with special healthcare needs, according to the new HHS analysis.That contrast should also influence lawmakers, said Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families. \u201cWe believe it is very important that children are not made worse off,\u201d Alker said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "With federal funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program set to run out in 2017, HHS has determined children can't get comparable benefits and cost-sharing on the insurance exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "HHS banks on Congress extending CHIP funding", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "With federal funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program set to run out in 2017, HHS has determined children can't get comparable benefits and cost-sharing on the insurance exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "HHS banks on Congress extending CHIP funding", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151130/NEWS/151139995", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "With federal funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program set to run out in 2017, HHS has determined children can't get comparable benefits and cost-sharing on the insurance exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act.", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "title": "HHS banks on Congress extending CHIP funding", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "published_at": "2015-11-30", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151130/NEWS/151139995", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe believe it is very important that children are not made worse off,\u201d Alker said.\nIn 2014 CHIP covered about 8.1 million children.The ACA extended the authorization for CHIP through 2019 but left it up to Congress to extend funding for the program beyond 2015.\nLawmakers included a two-year extension in legislation last year that repealed Medicare's sustainable growth-rate formula for paying physicians.It's likely that Congress will extend funding again before 2017 to avoid disrupting coverage for millions of children, according to Rachel Klein, director of organizational strategy for the consumer advocacy group Families USA.\nShe added that the program enjoys strong bipartisan support.In addition to offering more affordable coverage, CHIP plans are generally more comprehensive for \u201cchild-specific\u201d services (such as dental, vision and habilitation) and for children with special healthcare needs, according to the new HHS analysis.That contrast should also influence lawmakers, said Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families.\n\u201cWithout those changes, continuing CHIP funding remains an imperative.\u201dPolicy analysts have estimated as many as 2 million children could end up without coverage should CHIP end because they are not eligible for Medicaid, don't qualify for exchange subsidies or qualify for subsidies but their families still can't afford the higher premiums and cost-sharing.For example, the average out-of-pocket costs for children in Alabama are $1,455 in an exchange plan versus $175 in CHIP.Bruce Lesley, president of the bipartisan children's advocacy organization First Focus, said the HHS analysis \u201cgoes to show how great CHIP is for children and their families and is further validation that CHIP provides the most comprehensive benefits at the lowest cost for kids.\u201dCHIP was established in 1997 with bipartisan congressional support to cover low-income children who were not eligible for Medicaid."}
