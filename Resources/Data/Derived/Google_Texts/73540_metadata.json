He led the NFL with 134 yards rushing in Week 1.\n\nMoreno signed a $3.275 million, one-year contract in March after five seasons with the Denver Broncos. His injury likely means a heavier load for Lamar Miller, who is averaging 5.2 yards per carry this season.\n\nThe Dolphins also reinstated reserve defensive lineman Derrick Shelby from his suspension, which came after he was arrested on misdemeanor charges of resisting arrest and trespassing at a nightclub.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Knowshon Moreno done for season with knee injury", "title": "Knowshon Moreno done for season with knee injury", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/14/knowshon-moreno-done-for-season-with-knee-injury/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141014__morenop1.jpg", "height": 606}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141014__morenop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-14T10:14:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T16:23:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "DAVIE, Fla. \u2014 Miami Dolphins running back Knowshon Moreno has been placed on injured reserve with a season-ending knee injury.\n___AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\nThe move came Tuesday, two days after Moreno hurt his anterior cruciate ligament in the Dolphins\u2019 loss to Green Bay.\nHis injury likely means a heavier load for Lamar Miller, who is averaging 5.2 yards per carry this season.\nMoreno signed a $3.275 million, one-year contract in March after five seasons with the Denver Broncos."}
