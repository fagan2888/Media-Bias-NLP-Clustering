At the same time, increasing oral health care getting more Missourians signed up for health insurance coverage and educating on public health and health policy issues are important target areas as well.\n\nIn 2012, Hughes moved from New Jersey to head the MFH, after serving as a visiting professor at the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University and leadership roles at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, including vice president and chief learning officer.\n\nSince then, the foundation has become a more visible partner with grantee organizations in the communities they serve.\n\nHughes sat down with The American recently to talk about the Foundation\u2019s new strategic plan.\n\nThe American: Tell us about the Missouri Foundation for Health and the direction you are going.\n\nRobert Hughes: A good place to start is our mission, because that really drives everything we do and really is focused on the underserved \u2013 the people who don\u2019t have access to health care; and really trying to make Missouri healthier, and the communities healthier and individuals and neighborhoods healthier. It\u2019s an ambitious mission, and we are fortunate to have resources to wrestle with. That\u2019s the work that we do in conjunction with folks all across the region.\n\nThe American: Tell me what you have done differently in the past few years.\n\nRobert Hughes: I think we really built on what was there previously. So, one of the things we learned, for example, from work that had been done for almost a decade was working on reducing tobacco use. The lesson there was \u2013 when you stick with something over a period of time, you have a greater change of it having an impact on it at a systems level.\n\nAnd so, we felt it was important to choose a small number of things that we felt we could have an influence on over a five- to 10-year period and make a commitment to those things. Choosing those were a big part of our strategy planning; choosing things where we thought there was some evidence that activities we could support could make a difference; that they are important health problems for our region.\n\nChildhood obesity is a great example of that. Across the country, there has been some progress, some analysis, some lessons learned, and we felt we could build on the work we had done here previously in \u2018Healthy Communities,\u2019 but also bring in evidence from across the country and some practices that have really informed our work now, \u2018Healthy Schools, Healthy Communities.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe American: What are the things you are focusing on now?\n\nRobert Hughes: \u201cPreventing childhood obesity. Expanding insurance coverage \u2013 that one, we really saw that opportunity there with the passage of the Affordable Care Act and have really tried to take advantage of those opportunities that reinforce and accelerate the progress.\n\nThe American: How about Medicaid Expansion? Are you advocating for that?\n\nRobert Hughes: Well, our goal is to get people health insurance coverage and the more, the better. That\u2019s the legislature\u2019s and the governor\u2019s responsibility. Our role there is really one more of education and support, so if we can help, for example, provide insight and analysis about how does Medicaid actually work; what have other states done; and what could we learn/adopt from the models of other states when they have gone about it; when other states have made those changes, what have the results been in terms of health outcomes; those are things we have a role in educating the state.\n\nThrough supporting the Cover Missouri coalition; working very much in partnership with several hundred partners now in that coalition \u2013 they are all working together and collaborating to really get as many people who are eligible signed up for insurance.\n\nThe third one is infant mortality and reducing infant mortality. There, we\u2019ve really zeroed in on two regions where the problem is the worst; and that\u2019s the St. Louis region and the Bootheel. So, in all of our programs, we really try to target the most underserved \u2013 sort of a common thread in all of our work is health equity and if we can really help the folks that are at the bottom of the curve, that\u2019s what we want to do so that\u2019s where we target our resources.\n\nThen last is oral health care and increasing access to basic oral health care. As a region and a state, we don\u2019t do as well compared to other states. We think there is some real progress and we are fortunate to have a new dental school in Missouri at A T Still, and we really focused on serving the underserved and partnering with Federally Qualified Health Centers. We think there is a really opportunity there to strengthen the system that provides care to the underserved.\u201d\n\nThe American: \u201cOut of these four areas, what are your shining star programs?\u201d\n\nHughes: \u201cEach one has a different change strategy and I think they are all doing well, in different ways. And the goals that they have, some of them are more easily measured in the short-term and then some of them are going to take a longer time.\n\nSo, if we look at insurance coverage and getting more people to have health insurance coverage, that\u2019s pretty clear, and as a region, we are doing well and we think we are contributing to that, but there are a lot of folks involved in that, but we are pleased with that work.\n\nI think the work on childhood obesity has been incredibly well-received by the communities we are working in and by the schools. They\u2019ve been very receptive; they\u2019ve stepped up and they are seeing changes \u2026 programmatic design is to work with them to develop their own plans, with advice and counsel from folks who have done this elsewhere. The actual on-the-ground work may be different in each school and community, but it\u2019s all toward the same goal.\n\nInfant mortality \u2013 in many ways, it\u2019s helping the communities be organized in a different way; working together; figuring out how the work that community organizations are already doing can reinforce each other\u2019s work \u2026 all in the interest of helping the new moms and their babies. In both places, the program design is to work with a key organization; and in the Bootheel, two key organizations, to be the backbone of the work \u2026 and strengthen their capacity and their ability to play a leadership role. Here, it\u2019s the Maternal Child Family Health Coalition; in the Bootheel, it\u2019s the Bootheel Consortium as well as the organization of the six health departments.\n\nOral health, there are two really important health issues that just for historical reasons have been treated separate. One is oral health and the other is behavioral health \u2013\n\nsubstance abuse and mental health.\n\nWith the coming of AT Still, that was really helpful and we, as well as a lot of other folks, have contributed to the new clinic that will be opening here and the training for the students, I think that\u2019s going to make a big difference. And, where those students go \u2013 we hope that when, because of the training and orientation, they will be much more likely to both stay in Missouri and also take care of the underserved. Another part of it is working with existing FQHCs around our region to both give them the capacity to provide oral health care. We\u2019ve also helped in bringing in experts in how to run and effective and efficient clinic and work with them, do an assessment and give them some advice in changes they can make so that they can be more efficient and see more patients and be more productive in their clinics.\n\nThe American: Where do you see things going for the MFH in the next few years?\n\nRobert Hughes: We feel it\u2019s really important that we listen to the communities and that we support the broader health issues that communities are wrestling with across our region.\n\nThose four issues are hugely important, but we recognized that health is a broad construct and we think of it as much more than just clinical care.\n\nBehavioral health is a part of that, but there are a number of other dimensions of health that we know are important, and we know communities think are important, and we have tried to set up programs and opportunities so that we can get the best ideas from across the region.\n\nAgain, what we are about is, how can we help make things better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robert Hughes, the president and CEO of the Missouri Foundation for Health is a public health strategist committed to partnering with organizations to reduce conditions and behaviors leading to poor health in communities \u2013 such as infant mortality, childhood obesity and smoking.
