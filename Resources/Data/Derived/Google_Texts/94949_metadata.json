I\u2019m one of those people who says \u2018never say never\u2019 and you never know where life will take me.\u201d\n\nPresident and screenwriter Jason Campbell of Morgantown-based JC Films said the drama explores the possible government takeover of churches.\n\nLynch was captured after her Army unit took a wrong turn and came under attack in Iraq in 2003. Eleven American soldiers were killed and six were captured, including Lynch. Her high-profile nighttime rescue from an Iraqi hospital made her an instant celebrity.\n\n\u201cI was kind of thrust into it,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have the option. It was \u2018here you go.\u2019 Like everything else that I\u2019ve done in life, I think perseverance is my life motto now, having that never give up attitude and going for it.\u201d\n\nLynch spends considerable time traveling to talk about her personal experiences along with her recent film work.\n\n\u201cIt gets easier with every appearance, with every speech,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of fun now. It\u2019s something I never thought I would ever do in my life.\u201d\n\nThe Palestine native suffered two spinal fractures, nerve damage and a shattered right arm, right foot and left leg when her Humvee crashed during the firefight.\n\nLynch continues to go to physical therapy, has a 7-year-old daughter and works part time as a substitute teacher in Wood County.\n\nShe met Campbell while he was in West Virginia promoting the 2013 film \u201cFinding Faith,\u201d which starred Erik Estrada of TV series \u201cCHiPs\u201d fame. Campbell offered Lynch a part in his next film, \u201cVirtuous,\u201d and she accepted. Lynch had a speaking part and her Iraq experience was loosely depicted in the film.\n\nWith Lynch taking a much bigger role in \u201cOne Church,\u201d Campbell said \u201cshe\u2019s a natural. She\u2019s very good in front of the camera. We\u2019re excited that she\u2019s a part of it.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a prime example of what a role model should be for our young people. The combination of the kind of movies that we\u2019re making fits right into who she is.\u201d\n\nThe movie is scheduled to be shown next year in churches across the country.\n\nCampbell said essentially the same group of actors are involved in all of his movies, and that fosters \u201can environment of fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat takes the edge off a lot more when you\u2019re with a group of people that are all like-minded in making this film that hopes to change the culture,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cEveryone there is your best cheerleader.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.onechurchfilm.com\n\nhttp://www.jcfilms.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former prisoner of war Jessica Lynch is enjoying her latest role, starring in a Christian movie currently in production.", "Author": "John Raby", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Former prisoner of war Jessica Lynch is enjoying her latest role, starring in a Christian movie currently in production.", "title": "Ex-POW Jessica Lynch starring in Christian film", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/16/ex-pow-jessica-lynch-starring-in-christian-film/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/16/214c65af7cf0e3245f0f6a706700746e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/16/214c65af7cf0e3245f0f6a706700746e.jpg", "title": "Ex-POW Jessica Lynch starring in Christian film", "description": "Former prisoner of war Jessica Lynch is enjoying her latest role, starring in a Christian movie currently in production.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Jessica Lynch, Jason Campbell"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf926\"", "article_summary": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 Former prisoner of war Jessica Lynch is enjoying her latest role, starring in a Christian movie currently in production.\nBut the West Virginia native is not sure if an acting career is in her future.\nShe met Campbell while he was in West Virginia promoting the 2013 film \u201cFinding Faith,\u201d which starred Erik Estrada of TV series \u201cCHiPs\u201d fame.\nCampbell offered Lynch a part in his next film, \u201cVirtuous,\u201d and she accepted.\nWith Lynch taking a much bigger role in \u201cOne Church,\u201d Campbell said \u201cshe\u2019s a natural."}
