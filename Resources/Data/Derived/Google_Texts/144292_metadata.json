(Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News)\n\nEllen Louise Fant was no fan of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to have anything shoved down my throat,\u201d said Fant, 60, referring to the law\u2019s requirement that most Americans carry health insurance.\n\nThen last fall, the former teacher\u2019s aide got a letter from the state of Arkansas telling her that because she got food stamps, she qualified for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, which is being expanded under the health-care law to cover those who make less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or up to $15,900 for an individual.\n\nShe signed a form, got back an insurance card Jan. 10 and, days later, underwent the knee replacement surgery that she had needed for years but couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nFant is one of more than 80,000 Arkansans who have gained Medicaid coverage under the heath-care law this year through a unique financing arrangement designed to win over Republicans who oppose expanding a government-run program they say doesn\u2019t work.\n\nView Graphic Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion\n\nArkansas\u2019s experiment, known as the \u201cprivate option,\u201d allows the state to use federal funds to buy private policies for residents who are newly eligible for Medicaid. It marks the first large-scale attempt to enroll Medicaid recipients in the same plans that any consumer might buy in the new online marketplaces.\n\nThat\u2019s different from how Medicaid usually works. Typically, enrollees must join state-operated programs or private managed-care plans designed exclusively for the poor. The new option allowed Fant to choose a surgeon from the same broad network of doctors available to anyone buying a private plan, rather than being restricted to a narrower choice of physicians paid directly by the state through traditional Medicaid.\n\nThe approach offers Republican lawmakers a politically palatable way to implement a key provision of the 2010 health-care law. It has been adopted on a smaller scale in Iowa and is gaining interest from governors and lawmakers in several Republican-led states including New Hampshire, Florida, Utah and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cIn crafting the \u2018private option,\u2019 Arkansas has provided a pathway for other states,\u201d said Deborah Bachrach, a partner with consulting firm Manatt Health. \u201cThey are truly trailblazers.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Arkansas\u2019s experiment could end June 30 unless its Republican-controlled legislature \u2014 which reconvened Monday \u2014 renews its support. And that is looking increasingly uncertain. Last month\u2019s election of a Republican state senator who opposes the deal, as well as the about-face of another GOP supporter, may have tipped the political balance.\n\n\u201cIf we lose one or two votes, it\u2019s critical,\u201d Gov. Mike Beebe (D) said in an interview, citing a state rule requiring that 75 percent of the members of both houses pass appropriations measures.\n\nA decision to halt the program in Arkansas could leave as many as 200,000 people who are believed eligible for the program without coverage and have a chilling effect on other states weighing similar efforts. Half the states have not expanded Medicaid since the U.S. Supreme Court made it optional.\n\nArkansas\u2019s model was crafted by Republican lawmakers who said they opposed the health-care law but were concerned that not expanding Medicaid would hurt the state\u2019s hospitals and businesses because so many patients would remain uninsured.\n\nBeebe, who is in his second term, became a big supporter, saying the plan would help save state taxpayers nearly $90 million this year, primarily from reduced costs for uncompensated care. The federal government is paying the bill for the expanded program through 2016, after which states pick up some costs but never more than 10 percent.\n\nThe Obama administration approved the Arkansas plan with two major conditions: that recipients\u2019 benefits and cost-sharing remain the same as in the public program and that total costs are no more than if the state had expanded traditional Medicaid.\n\nSome experts are not convinced they can meet the cost test because the government will have to cover the higher fees that private plans pay doctors and hospitals.\n\n\u201cWhether this will be cost-effective is an open question,\u201d said Joan Alker at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute.\n\nBut Arkansas officials believe any cost difference will be minimal because they would have had to increase payment rates to providers to entice more to participate in the traditional Medicaid program. They also hope to show that enrollees in private plans have better access to care and better outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf we are right . . . this is potentially a game changer nationally,\u201d said state Sen. David Sanders, a Republican who helped craft the plan.\n\nExpanding Medicaid is expected to have a big impact in a state where one in five people younger than 65 is uninsured. Until January, Arkansas had the second-most-restrictive Medicaid program in the nation, after Alabama. Single adults were ineligible and parents could qualify only if their incomes were below 17 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nDespite the roiling politics in Little Rock, most Arkansas stakeholders are enthusiastic.\n\nDoctors and hospitals like the plan because private insurers pay them more than Medicaid. Consumer advocates believe enrollees will have greater access to care because more doctors participate in private insurance. Insurers have embraced it because they would get premiums from many new members.\n\nSome conservatives, however, are still fighting the effort, noting the Medicaid expansion is part of a health-care law they say means bigger government.\n\nState Sen. John Cooper, the tea party Republican who won the special election last month, argued on the campaign trail that the private option won\u2019t save Arkansas money in the long term.\n\nLawmakers are also hearing complaints from medical specialists, angry that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arkansas, the dominant insurer, announced in November it was cutting reimbursement rates by 15 percent to those participating in the private plans.\n\nBut for Fant and many like her, the private option model means \u201cpeace of mind\u201d because they can get the same care as those with higher incomes.\n\n\u201cWhile I personally do not like Obama . . . I say, \u2018Thank you for doing this for me,\u2019 \u201d she said, showing her insurance card from Blue Cross.\n\nWhen told the legislature could end her newfound coverage July 1, her jaw dropped. \u201cAt least I had my knee done,\u201d she said.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, medicaid expansion, obamacare, health care, health-care law, arkansas, private option, health insurance", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The experimental \u201cprivate option\u201d ends June 30 without support from the GOP-controlled legislature.", "title": "Arkansas\u2019s \u2018private option\u2019 for expanding Medicaid has helped 80,000 people.
