Ted Cruz (R-TX) on his plan to rewrite the Constitution to remove U.S. Supreme Court justices who ruled in favor of Obamacare and marriage equality.\n\nCruz, a Republican presidential candidate, described the same-sex marriage ruling as \u201cone of the darkest days in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d and he proposed a constitutional amendment that would require Supreme Court justices to face re-election every eight years.\n\nKelly said dismissively that the majority had \u201cfound a constitutional right\u201d to marriage, but she confronted Cruz over his plan, reported Mediaite.\n\n\u201cAlexander Hamilton (wrote), \u2018The complete independence of the courts is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution,\u2019\u201d Kelly reminded the strict constitutionalist senator. \u201cNow you want to rewrite the constitution in response to a couple of decisions you don\u2019t like?\u201d\n\nCruz said last week\u2019s decisions were simply \u201cthe latest in a long line and, sadly, were the nadir of the Supreme Court,\u201d and he quoted talking points from Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dissent in Obergefell v. Hodges to describe the decision as an \u201cassault on our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was five unelected lawyers setting themselves up\u2019 \u2013 and these are Scalia\u2019s words \u2013 \u2018as the rulers of all 320 million Americans,\u2019\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt was illegitimate, and it was wrong.\u201d\n\nKelly assured the senator she understood his concerns, but she asked him to consider his plan\u2019s unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cI get that, but in response to a decision that you feel was politically motivated by the justices who are in the majority, you want to make the court more political?\u201d she said.\n\nCruz argued that the Constitution\u2019s framers had intended to limit the court\u2019s power through the threat of impeachment, but he said that hasn\u2019t even been a \u201cscarecrow\u201d for justices for two centuries.\n\n\u201cEven 200 years ago, the Supreme Court wasn\u2019t afraid of it,\u201d he said, but he conceded that impeachment would be nearly impossible in today\u2019s divided U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t even muster 50 votes to defeat Loretta Lynch, the attorney general who tells us she\u2019s not going to follow the law or the Constitution, (so) there\u2019s no universe in which there are 67 votes to remove Anthony Kennedy from the Supreme Court,\u201d Cruz said, revealing the target of his wrath.\n\nKelly reminded Cruz that American voters had twice elected President Barack Obama, so she wondered how the Tea Party senator could be sure he would like the results of his plan to put Supreme Court justices before voters.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d Cruz said, momentarily losing his footing. \u201cWhat I\u2019m talking about are judicial retention elections, which means you could have the same appointment, the same senate confirmation, but every eight years the people would have an up-or-down vote with the option to remove a justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what if the people bounced out Scalia and Alito and Thomas and we had a President Obama in the White House?\u201d Kelly said.\n\nCruz said 20 states had required judges to face retention elections, and he said voters in those states had only \u201csparingly\u201d replaced those jurists.\n\n\u201cBut the alternative is, who in their right mind would design a system where every major public policy issue of the day is decided not by the people, not by the Constitution, not by the elected representatives, but by nine elite lawyers in Washington, D.C., as Justice Scalia observed in dissent?\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAll nine of them \u2013 they either graduated from Harvard or Yale \u2013 eight or nine of them are from the east coast or the west coast.\u201d\n\nKelly smirked and reminded Cruz that he, too, had graduated from Harvard Law School and jokingly called him a \u201csmartypants.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I graduated from Harvard, as well,\u201d Cruz admitted. \u201cMy dad refers to my time up there as missionary work. I think the problem was that I didn\u2019t learn what they wanted me to learn there. I was a little too thick-headed to be indoctrinated when I was up there.\u201d\n\nWatch the entire segment posted online by Fox News:\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Megyn-Kelly-and-Ted-Cruz-Fox-News-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Megyn Kelly schools Ted Cruz on plan to rewrite the Constitution to punish Supreme Court"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Megyn Kelly and Ted Cruz (Fox News)Megyn Kelly grilled Sen.
