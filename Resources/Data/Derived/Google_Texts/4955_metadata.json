The state\u2019s effort to provide long-acting, reversible birth control to female inmates in state prisons is both an invasion of rights and a waste of taxpayer money.\n\nAccording to Jezebel, however, the program is actually \u201can attempt to respond to the epidemic of drug-dependent infants born in the state\u201d who suffer from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome. The disease is caused from a mother\u2019s exposure to opioids while the child is in the womb. While these babies don\u2019t suffer long-term health effects, the majority do need advanced medical treatment and are more likely to end up in foster care.\n\n\u201cA study published in May in the Journal of Perinatalogy found that the highest incidents of NAS \u2014 16.2 babies born with the condition in every 1,000 \u2014 happen in the southeastern United States, including Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi and Alabama,\u201d the Jezebel article read. \u201cThe Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention] found that\u2019s also where the highest rate of painkiller prescriptions are located. The math here isn\u2019t hard.\u201d\n\nJudge Duane Slone of the Fourth Circuit Court, however, says these women are not forcibly given birth control as the WSMV article suggests \u2014 rather, they are sent to local health centers where they view presentations that \u201cexplain the dangers of NAS,\u201d WSMV reported. Only then are they given the option to have an intrauterine device placed.\n\nThe issue lies in the fact that many in opposition don\u2019t believe that these prisons can prove the IUDs are being inserted voluntarily \u2014 they worry that women are being forced into taking birth control.\n\nThat being said, it seems to be only beneficial in the long run that these women are offered such access to important methods of protection. Even if these women only have six-month sentences, these forms of birth control last long enough that they will still be protected when they leave their cells and head back into the real world.\n\nWhat this news team and many other prominent Tennessee legislators fail to realize is that this access to birth control is important even beyond the prevention of pregnancy. By giving women access to sex education, we can inspire them to focus on it in ways that they most likely haven\u2019t been before. And, contrary to popular conservative belief, there are other benefits to birth control besides pregnancy prevention.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, birth control is free and available to all women, and these women should be no exception. In their everyday lives, though, it may be hard to receive access to the birth control that we can instead provide them during their time in prison.\n\nWith recent talk of defunding Planned Parenthood and taking away women\u2019s rights to birth control and abortion, it\u2019s understandable that people may feel outrage toward an issue such as this. The fact is, we should be focused on keeping women\u2019s bodies as free from control as possible. But this might be the compromise \u2014 we are keeping options open while providing education and stability to women who may not have had access to it previously.\n\nWe are not only helping these women, but we are also helping their children. Perhaps this will help us to prevent unwanted pregnancies in general for women whose babies may not be born with NAS, but who still remain unwanted by their parents. This implementation of IUDs and birth control in general serves a much greater purpose than we are realizing \u2014 this isn\u2019t about these women, it\u2019s about their children and what we can do as a society to ensure fewer children are forced to suffer through circumstances they have no intention of entering.\n\nSlone told WSMV, \u201cThe feedback I\u2019m hearing is great gratitude that they know there\u2019s this type of long-acting contraceptive \u2026 available to them at no cost.\u201d\n\nWe must understand, as WSMV implied, that we should never force anyone to go on birth control. But we don\u2019t see that happening here \u2014 it seems that Slone and others like him are confident that this program is beneficial to women and to the world they live in.\n\nPeople are always going to argue that we shouldn\u2019t be giving people in prison fantastic lives with our tax dollars. But that\u2019s a larger issue, for which the solution lies in placing less people in prison initially. In reality, it would be inhumane to deprive prison inmates of healthcare in any capacity.\n\nAccording to the same WSMV article, the Tennessee Department of Health estimates the price of the implants is approximately $632, while an IUD costs about $681. The cost to treat a baby with NAS? $44,000.\n\nIn essence, we should be treating this as an education and health issue, rather than an economics. Providing birth control for these women is a small step we can take to make a much bigger impact on society, improving women\u2019s rights and family health in the process.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This implementation of IUDs and birth control in general serves a much greater purpose than we are realizing.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Free Press", "description": "This implementation of IUDs and birth control in general serves a much greater purpose than we are realizing.", "title": "EDITORIAL: Birth control for female inmates an issue of education, not economics - The Daily Free Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1600, "identifier": "http://dailyfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/bc_edits.jpg", "height": 1200}, "updated_time": "2015-11-04T03:20:42-04:00", "url": "http://dailyfreepress.com/2015/11/04/editorial-birth-control-for-female-inmates-an-issue-of-education-not-economics/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This implementation of IUDs and birth control in general serves a much greater purpose than we are realizing.", "title": "EDITORIAL: Birth control for female inmates an issue of education, not economics - The Daily Free Press", "image": "http://dailyfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/bc_edits.jpg", "creator": "@dailyfreepress", "site": "@dailyfreepress", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://dailyfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-DFP_Lettering_Final-07-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailyfreepress/", "section": "Editorial", "tag": "WSMV 4", "published_time": "2015-11-04T03:19:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-04T03:20:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In essence, we should be treating this as an education and health issue, rather than an economics.\nThe state\u2019s effort to provide long-acting, reversible birth control to female inmates in state prisons is both an invasion of rights and a waste of taxpayer money.\nAnd, contrary to popular conservative belief, there are other benefits to birth control besides pregnancy prevention.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, birth control is free and available to all women, and these women should be no exception.\nBy giving women access to sex education, we can inspire them to focus on it in ways that they most likely haven\u2019t been before."}
