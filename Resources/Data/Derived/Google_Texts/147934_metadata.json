But with potentially close to two dozen candidates vying for spots, party officials are sure to ruffle feathers as they decide how to decide who makes it.\n\n\u201cUnless we really believe there is going to be a debate with 15 people, there is going to be a real controversy over where that line is drawn,\u201d said Iowa GOP chairman Jeff Kaufmann.\u201d If you don\u2019t think there are going to be 15, there is going to be a businessman, or a governor or a senator who is not on that list.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Donald Trump top \u2018can\u2019t support\u2019 lists in early primary states\n\nMr. Kaufmann added, \u201cI would still rather have this headache then be where the Democrats are: planning Hillary\u2019s throne for the coronation.\u201d\n\nThe discussions are certain to be part of the RNC\u2019s three-day spring meeting, which is kicking off Wednesday in Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nRNC members don\u2019t expect the decision to be made at the meeting, but are hoping they can put the issue to bed sooner rather than later in order so that GOP contenders know where they need to stand to take part the RNC\u2019s nine sanctioned debates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d said RNC spokesman Sean Spicer.\n\nSome of the presidential hopefuls are slated to speak to the RNC \u2014 former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Mrs. Fiorina, the former Hewlett Packard CEO.\n\nMr. Bush and Mr. Huckabee are polling well and are likely to make the cut to get on the debate stages, but Mr. Santorum and Ms. Fiorina, who is scheduled to appear at welcome reception on Wednesday night, are at the back of the pack.\n\nThe prospect of Ms Fiorina, the only major announced woman candidate in the field, and Mr. Carson, the only black candidate, being shut out is worrisome to Republicans.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t play well into the Republican narrative if those people are not on the stage,\u201d said Patrick Griffin, a GOP strategist with Purple Strategies. \u201cThe party needs to be reaching out to all kinds of constituencies.\u201d\n\nMrs. Fiorina supporters and Mr. Carson\u2019s camp say they are confident the former Hewlett Packard will be able to clear whatever threshold the RNC lays out.\n\n\u201cWe are completely confident that Dr. Carson\u2019s campaign and candidacy will \u2018qualify\u2019 him for the sanctioned debates,\u201d said Doug Watts, a Carson spokesman.\n\n\u201cwe believe that all serious candidates be included in the debates, regardless of their poll standing,\u201d Mr. Watts said. \u201cThe Party must be as inclusive as possible in order to move this country forward.\u201d\n\nSome political observers expect the RNC will tailor the rules to ensure that Mrs. Fiorina and Mr. Carson are on the stage when the debate season kicks off in August in Ohio. Others express concern about some governors, including Ohio\u2019s John Kasich and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, missing the cut, if they decide to run.\n\nThe RNC has announced nine sanctioned debates and left open the possibility of adding three more. Party officials are working with host news networks on establishing debate criteria, which traditionally requires candidates receive a certain percentage of support in presidential preference polls. There could be other criteria as well.\n\nBut the cold reality is some candidates will probably get snubbed.\n\nIn 2012, former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer was left out of all of the debates, despite being an announced candidate. And former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson was only allowed at two of the debates \u2014 though he left his mark, delivering one of he more memorable zingers of the debate season in saying his \u201cnext door neighbor\u2019s dogs have created more shovel ready jobs then this current president.\u201d\n\nThe debates can be a big equalizer for candidates who aren\u2019t able to match the fundraising of the top tier, but who are able to provide a compelling story.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich\u2019s performance during a debate in South Carolina in 2012 is credited with helping him win that state\u2019s primary days later.\n\nHeading into 2016, many say that former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is banking on the debates to put his widely panned 2012 performances behind him, and that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie sees the debates as key to reviving his presidential ambitions.\n\nThe RNC, while saying debates are important, wants to avoid a repeat of the 2012 experience when former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was the clear frontrunner, but was severely damaged by taking part in 19 debates against a weak field.\n\nThe last go-around, the largest debate had nine competitors. Debates this time could have as many as 20 candidates, depending on how the rules are drawn.\n\n\u201cI think 10 or 12 candidates just doesn\u2019t afford those top tier candidates to really have time to really give anything other then sound byte answers to questions,\u201d said Glenn McCall, a member of the Republican National Committee from South Carolina. \u201cWhat I hear weekly probably from folks, voters, is they want to know what we are going to do and they definitely don\u2019t want to see 10 or 15 candidates on the debate stage.\u201d\n\nMatt Strawn, former head of the Iowa GOP, said the bar should be low in the opening debates, requiring only officially declared candidates who at least register in the polls.\n\n\u201cThe more the merrier,\u201d he said,\n\nBut for later debates, he said, the threshold should be raised to help voters make choices among viable candidates.\n\n\u201cWhen the Iowa GOP co-hosted a December 2011 GOP debate with ABC news, we used as our threshold either a 5 percent national polling average or a 5 percent Iowa polling average for inclusion into the debate,\u201d he said. \u201c[Former Utah Gov. Jon] Huntsman was below 5 percent both nationally and in Iowa, so he was excluded. Santorum was below 5 percent nationally, but above 5 percent in Iowa, so he was included.\u201d\n\nRob Gleason, Pennsylvania GOP chairman and debate committee member, said trying to figure out who is going to be included in the debates is a \u201cpleasant problem\u201d to have, and said his goal is a nomination process that produces a candidate who can win the White House. He downplayed the idea that there is much anxiety over Mrs. Fiorina and Mr. Carson failing to qualify for debates.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for those people is to get in the game,\u201d Mr. Gleason said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they would run unless they thought they could get into the game.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans face a tough task in trying to craft rules making sure Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina, who are running well behind in the polls, find a place on the stage at presidential primary debates.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Republicans face a tough task in trying to craft rules making sure Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina, who are running well behind in the polls, find a place on the stage at presidential primary debates.", "title": "GOP explores special debate rules for Carson, Fiorina", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/13/gop-explores-special-debate-rules-carson-fiorina/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/09/07/debate_0526.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/09/07/debate_0526.jpg", "description": "Republicans face a tough task in trying to craft rules making sure Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina, who are running well behind in the polls, find a place on the stage at presidential primary debates.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP explores special debate rules for Carson, Fiorina"}, "Author": "Seth McLaughlin", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Republican National Committee, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen the Iowa GOP co-hosted a December 2011 GOP debate with ABC news, we used as our threshold either a 5 percent national polling average or a 5 percent Iowa polling average for inclusion into the debate,\u201d he said.\nHe downplayed the idea that there is much anxiety over Mrs. Fiorina and Mr. Carson failing to qualify for debates.\nThe RNC, while saying debates are important, wants to avoid a repeat of the 2012 experience when former Massachusetts Gov.\nMike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen.
