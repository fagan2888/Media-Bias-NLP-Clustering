An X-ray confirmed a broken index finger. He will see a hand specialist in Denver on Monday and is expected to be sidelined four to six weeks depending on how quickly the bone heals allowing him to grip the ball.\n\n\u201cI knew something was wrong,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. It\u2019s hard to believe. I have that shadow of the injury bug around me. But there was nothing I could do.\u201d\n\nHe suffered the injury in the third inning Saturday. Facing Matt Cain, Anderson, who has little experience as a hitter since he was drafted in 2006, flicked a 93 mph sinker off the end of the bat. He shook his hand as he jogged down the line and was unable to remain in the game after throwing a warm-up pitch.\n\n\u201cHe said it was like he had a foam finger on. He couldn\u2019t feel anything,\u201d reliever LaTroy Hawkins said.\n\nAcquired for Drew Pomeranz in December, Anderson owns a 3.60 ERA in three games, all Rockies losses. He was in the middle of his best performance with his new team when his finger snapped. This injury comes on the heels of missing nearly two years after elbow surgery and most of last season with a broken bone in his foot suffered while shagging flyballs.\n\n\u201cMy bat didn\u2019t break. I guess the wood head was too strong. I needed it to take the brunt of the blow,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nFranklin Morales, who lost his spot to Jordan Lyles, is expected to replace Anderson in the rotation. The Rockies could add a reliever Monday or just bring back infielder Charlie Culberson, who was optioned before Sunday\u2019s game to make room for Tyler Chatwood.\n\nMorales threw a scoreless inning Sunday.\n\nMorales\u2019 desire to start is well-known. He was disappointed that he lost his job this past weekend.\n\nSorry, Charlie. Drew Stubbs doesn\u2019t have much claim to a roster spot if he doesn\u2019t face left-handers. Yet, manager Walt Weiss took a gamble pinch-hitting Stubbs in the eighth for the scalding Charlie Blackmon. Blackmon is 4-for-10 against lefties. Weiss correctly played a matchup. Stubbs singled to left to tie the score off Javy Lopez, leaving him 3-for-7 off the sidearmer.\n\nFootnotes. Jhoulys Chacin (shoulder) will begin his rehab assignment Tuesday for Single-A Modesto. He\u2019s on track to return April 28 or May 3. \u2026 The Rockies\u2019 bullpen compiled 15 strikeouts in 12 innings in the series. \u201cWe pitched well. I really thought we were going to get them,\u201d reliever Adam Ottavino said. Troy E. Renck, The Denver Post\n\nLooking ahead\n\nRockies\u2019 Jordan Lyles (2-0, 3.86 ERA) at Padres\u2019 Eric Stults (0-2, 5.59)\n\n8:10 p.m., Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nJordan Lyles is like character Dante in \u201cClerks.\u201d He\u2019s not even supposed to be here today. Tyler Chatwood\u2019s injury forced Lyles into the rotation, and Lyles\u2019 effectiveness kept him there. He didn\u2019t win his third game last season with the Astros until June 2. He has taken seriously the mandate to throw lower strikes. Eric Stults had a layover with the Rockies after a brief career in Japan. With Charlie Blackmon 1-for-7 off the left-handed Stults, Drew Stubbs could start in center field. If not, it\u2019s time to wonder about his value on the roster if he can\u2019t play over Brandon Barnes or Blackmon.\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Juan Nicasio (1-0, 3.75) at Padres\u2019 Robbie Erlin (1-0, 1.35), 8:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (0-2, 9.69) at Padres\u2019 Andrew Cashner (1-1, 1.29), 8:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Rockies\u2019 Franklin Morales (0-1, 6.94) at Padres\u2019 Ian Kennedy (1-2, 4.24), 4:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nTroy E.
