There were a lot of reasons for it, and I\u2019m happy to take some of the blame,\u201d Mr. Obama told the assembled members, their families and their staffers. \u201cOne thing I\u2019m positive about is, when we\u2019re shy about what we care about, when we\u2019re defensive about what we\u2019ve accomplished, when we don\u2019t stand up straight and proud \u2026 \u201d\n\nHe then began to list, his voice rising to a campaign stump speech crescendo as members rose to their feet in wild applause, accomplishments in health insurance, in immigration legislation and in \u201cmiddle-class economics.\u201d\n\nHe said he would \u201chappily veto\u201d Republican legislation to undo the Affordable Care Act \u2014 not surprising, but a crowd pleaser nonetheless \u2014 along with legislation to roll back the financial regulatory overhaul bill known as Dodd-Frank and a measure targeting his executive orders on immigration.\n\nHe slammed Republicans for risking a Homeland Security Department shutdown over those executive actions: \u201cThese are the guys concerned about borders, about terrorism? Now you want to make a political point?\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. Obama crowed about proving the critics \u2014 namely, Republicans \u2014 wrong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare when you have two visions, a vigorous debate and then you test who\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd the record shows that we were right.\u201d\n\nIn a nod to the middle-class economics message, Mr. Obama said Republicans now seem to acknowledge \u2014 in rhetoric, at least \u2014 the need to help the middle class and address income stratification. He made specific mention to one \u201cformer presidential candidate\u201d on the Republican side, Mitt Romney, who \u201csuddenly is just deeply concerned about poverty.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Obama poked fun at Republicans, he said Democrats \u201cneed to stand up \u2026 and not be defensive about what we believe in.\u201d\n\nIn closing, he stepped back from the podium and took a drink of water. \u201cI\u2019m fired up!\u201d he said in a reference to a famous catch phrase of his 2008 presidential run.\n\nAn ensuing question-and-answer period was closed to reporters, so there\u2019s no telling what specific questions House Democrats planned to ask the president. The speech itself, however, was light on specific policy proposals, with no mention of issues like trade or a tax overhaul.\n\nIn the week since his State of the Union address, Democrats who have felt demoralized since the party\u2019s midterm drubbing have said they think their president has a renewed vigor to fight with them to win back seats in 2016. They say his speech touched on the important issues they want to focus on in the next cycle and feel there is a renewed partnership.\n\nThe honeymoon could be short-lived with substantial legislative challenges on the horizon, especially when it comes to giving the White House fast-track authority to enter into trade negotiations.\n\nBut at least on Thursday night, House Democrats seemed ready to believe that they and Mr. Obama were squarely on the same team.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be out there making the case every single day,\u201d he said, \u201cand I hope you join me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama laid out his opening offer to Congress during remarks in Philadelphia, where House Democrats were gathered for their annual retreat.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 A fiery President Barack Obama addressed House Democrats on Thursday night, making the case that, while there\u2019s more work to do in restoring the economy, Democrats can\u2019t be shy about what they\u2019ve already accomplished.
