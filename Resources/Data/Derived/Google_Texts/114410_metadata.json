The National Eating Disorder Association cites research estimating that nearly 30 million American men and women suffer from eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating.\n\nTreatment centers such as McCallum, categorized as behavioral health service providers, have benefited from the tailwinds of the Affordable Care Act and the updated Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which puts mental health coverage on par with that of physical maladies.\n\nSuch businesses may also benefit from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s extension of the amount of time children can stay on their parents\u2019 insurance, given that anorexia typically appears in early to mid-adolescence. Previously children were only eligible to stay on their parents\u2019 coverage until age 18, now the limit is 26.\n\nBut some PE firms ventured into the space long before those developments.\n\nTrinity Hunt Partners bought St. Louis-based Castlewood Treatment Center, which focuses on psychologically acute patients in eating disorder, in 2008 and was also an owner of Denver\u2019s Eating Recovery Center between 2010 and 2013 before selling it to Lee Equity Partners. Eating Recovery Center treats patients who are suffering physically from physical disorders like anorexia and bulimia.\n\nWebster Capital, meanwhile, in 2011 invested in Discovery Practice Management, a Los Alamitos, Cali.-based operator of residential treatment programs for adolescents and women suffering from eating disorders and substance abuse or emotional disorders.\n\nWrite to Amy Or at amy.or@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The lack of dominant businesses in eating disorder treatment has attracted private equity firms interested in acquiring small to mid-sized companies and building them up through acquisitions.", "title": "McCallum Pursues Sale Amid PE Interest in Eating Disorder Treatment", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/06/16/mccallum-pursues-sale-amid-pe-interest-in-eating-disorder-treatment/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "McCallum Pursues Sale Amid PE Interest in Eating Disorder Treatment", "description": "The lack of dominant businesses in eating disorder treatment has attracted private equity firms interested in acquiring small to mid-sized companies and building them up through acquisitions.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Amy Or", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "The lack of dominant businesses in eating disorder treatment has attracted private equity firms interested in acquiring small to mid-sized companies and building them up through acquisitions.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-06-16T18:34:16-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/06/16/mccallum-pursues-sale-amid-pe-interest-in-eating-disorder-treatment/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-16932", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The lack of dominant businesses in eating disorder treatment has attracted private equity firms interested in acquiring small to mid-sized companies and building them up through acquisitions.", "title": "McCallum Pursues Sale Amid PE Interest in Eating Disorder Treatment", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/06/16/mccallum-pursues-sale-amid-pe-interest-in-eating-disorder-treatment/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-16932", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-16T18:41:11-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ffb\"", "article_summary": "Described by market research firm IBIS World as \u201cfragmented,\u201d with a large number of small-scale establishments, the eating disorder treatment industry is estimated to have grown to $2.7 billion in 2013.\nThe lack of dominant businesses in eating disorder treatment has attracted private equity firms interested in acquiring small to mid-sized companies and building them up through acquisitions.\nThe National Eating Disorder Association cites research estimating that nearly 30 million American men and women suffer from eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating.\nWebster Capital, meanwhile, in 2011 invested in Discovery Practice Management, a Los Alamitos, Cali.-based operator of residential treatment programs for adolescents and women suffering from eating disorders and substance abuse or emotional disorders.\nEating Recovery Center treats patients who are suffering physically from physical disorders like anorexia and bulimia."}
