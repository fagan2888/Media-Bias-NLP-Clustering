Jeffords, who died Monday at age 80, built a three-decade career in Washington but cemented his place in history with one decision: fleeing the Republican Party and siding with Democrats, delivering them control of the Senate in 2001.\n\nAngered by sour relations with President George W. Bush and dismayed by the GOP\u2019s rightward tilt, Mr. Jeffords ditched his lifelong party and became an independent who caucused with Democrats, giving them control of the chamber and thus a veto on Mr. Bush just months into his tenure.\n\n\u201cHistory will remember Sen. Jeffords as a courageous man who listened to his conscience, and I will always respect him for doing so,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, who played a key role in getting Mr. Jeffords to leave the Republican Party.\n\nTrent Lott, the GOP leader in the Senate at the time, said Mr. Jeffords, who six months earlier was re-elected as a Republican, carried out a \u201ccoup of one.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Mr. Jeffords\u2018 switch mattered less than it otherwise might have if not for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks three months later. In the aftermath of the attacks, Mr. Bush got a huge boost of support. The president restocked his political capital and shifted the focus to terrorism and international issues, where he was able to forge bipartisan consensus on bold moves such as the Patriot Act and the Iraq War.\n\nMr. Jeffords ended his tenure in Congress quietly, failing to notch a single law to his name after his partisan switch. He decided against seeking re-election in 2006 and retired from the Senate at the end of his third term.\n\nHe was elected to the House in 1974 and won his Senate seat in 1988. He was part of the liberal wing of the Republican Party at a time when conservatives were ascendant.\n\nMr. Jeffords voted against President Reagan\u2019s signature tax cuts and against confirming Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court justice.\n\nOutside of politics, he made a name for himself as one of the four \u201csinging senators\u201d \u2014 a barbershop quartet led by Mr. Lott that included two other Republicans. Mr. Jeffords\u2018 party switch helped end that venture.\n\nHis chief legislative accomplishments were bills to assist the disabled and AIDS patients, as well as some bills specific to his native Vermont.\n\n\u201cJim was one of the most popular elected officials in the modern history of the state,\u201d said Sen. Bernard Sanders, another independent who won Mr. Jeffords\u2018 seat.\n\n\u201cVermonters admired him because of his low-key and down-to-earth qualities, and because of his obvious and strong love of the state and the Vermont way of life. He was an effective champion of education, disability rights, the environment and the arts \u2014 and millions of Americans have benefited from his efforts,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "James M.
