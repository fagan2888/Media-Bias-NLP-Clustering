When the gavel drops on the legislative session this week, House and Senate members will return to their home districts touting a state budget that raises the base pay of beginning teachers to $35,000 a year.

But the fact that North Carolina ranks 42nd in teacher pay (and 47th in per pupil spending) hurts the state’s overall ranking in a new survey, according to Wallethub.

North Carolina ranks 50th in the latest survey of the best and worst states for teachers.

WalletHub analyzed the 50 states and the District of Columbia across 13 key metrics, ranging from average starting salary to the unemployment rate.

Rodney Ellis, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, believes lawmakers failed to invest adequately in educators this legislative session.

Ellis sat down with NC Policy Watch last weekend to share his thoughts on teacher bonuses, the expansion of vouchers, and increased funding for charter schools.
