His latest book is: \u201c The Power of RELENTLESS! \u201d Dubbed by the media as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist,\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years. Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nSomeone is getting very nervous. President Barack Obama; Valerie Jarrett; Eric Holder; Hillary Clinton; Jon Corzine \u2026 to name just a few. And I know why.\n\nI wrote a book entitled \u201cThe Murder of the Middle Class\u201d about the unholy conspiracy between big government, big business and big media. They all benefit by the billions from this partnership and it\u2019s in all of their interests to protect one another. It\u2019s one for all, and all for one.\n\nIt\u2019s a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich. Everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We\u2019re the patsies.\n\nBut for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. I\u2019ve never seen them this outraged, this vicious, this motivated, this coordinated \u2013 NEVER in all my years in politics, have I seen anything like the way the mad dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump.\n\nWhen white extremist David Duke ran for governor of Louisiana he wasn\u2019t treated with this kind of outrage, vitriol and disrespect. When a known fraud, scam artist and tax cheat like Al Sharpton ran for president, I never saw anything remotely close to this. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened like never before.\n\nWhy? Because David Duke was never going to win. Al Sharpton was never going to win. Ron Paul was never going to win. Ross Perot was never going to win as a third-party candidate.\n\nNone of those candidates had the billion dollars it takes to win the presidency. But Donald Trump can self fund that amount tomorrow and still have another billion left over to pour into the last two-week stretch before election day.\n\nNo matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business and political elite understand that Donald Trump is no joke and could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy the Donald. No, this is a coordinated conspiracy led by President Obama himself. Obama is making the phone calls and giving the orders \u2013 the ultimate intimidator who plays by the rules of Chicago thug politics.\n\nWhy is this so important to Obama?\n\nBecause most of the other politicians are part of the \u201cold boys club.\u201d They talk big, but in the end they won\u2019t change a thing.\n\nWhy? Because they are all beholden to big money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, multi-national corporations like Big Pharma or Big Oil. Or they are owned lock stock and barrel by foreigners \u2013 like George Soros owns Obama, or foreign governments own Hillary with their Clinton Foundation donations.\n\nThese run-of-the-mill establishment politicians are all puppets owned by big money.\n\nBut one man \u2013 and only one man \u2013 isn\u2019t beholden to anyone. One man doesn\u2019t need foreigners, or foreign governments, or George Soros, or the United Autoworkers, or the Teachers Union, or the SEIU, or the Bar Association to fund his campaign.\n\nBillionaire tycoon and maverick Donald Trump doesn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help.\n\nThat means he doesn\u2019t care what the media says. He doesn\u2019t care what the corporate elites think. That makes him very dangerous to the entrenched interests. That makes Trump a huge threat. Trump can ruin everything for the bribed politicians and their spoiled slavemasters.\n\nDon\u2019t you ever wonder why the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama? Don\u2019t you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game, but never actually try to stop Obama? Don\u2019t you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet they\u2019ve never tried to defund Obamacare or Obama\u2019s clearly illegal Executive Action on amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right?\n\nWell first, I\u2019d guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are having affairs or are secretly gay or are stealing taxpayer money; the NSA knows everything.\n\nAsk former House Speaker Dennis Hastert about that. The government even knew Hastert was withdrawing large sums of his own money, from his own bank account. Trust me \u2013 the NSA, SEC, IRS and all the other three-letter government agencies are watching every Republican political leader. They know everything.\n\nThirdly, many Republicans are petrified of being called \u201cracists.\u201d So they are scared to ever criticize Obama, or call out his crimes, let alone demand his impeachment.\n\nFourth, why rock the boat? After defeat or retirement, if you\u2019re a \u201cgood boy\u201d you\u2019ve got a $5 million dollar per year lobbying job waiting.\n\nThe big money interests have the system gamed. Win or lose \u2026 they win.\n\nBut Donald Trump doesn\u2019t play by any of these rules. Trump breaks up this nice cozy relationship between big government, big media and big business. All the rules are out the window if Donald wins the presidency. The other politicians will protect Obama and his aides. But not Donald.\n\nRemember Trump was the only politician who publicly questioned Obama\u2019s college records and how a mediocre student got into an Ivy League university.\n\nNow he\u2019s doing something no Republican has the chutzpah to do \u2013 question our relationship with Mexico; question why the border is wide open; question why no wall has been built across the border; question if allowing millions of illegal aliens into America is in our best interests; question why so many illegal aliens commit violent crimes yet are not deported; question why our trade deals with Mexico, Russia and China are so bad.\n\nDonald Trump has the audacity to ask out loud why American workers always get the short end of the stick? Good question.\n\nI\u2019m certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michele Obama at foreign companies to build the defective Obamacare web sites. (By the way that tab is now up to $5 billion._\n\nTrump will ask if Obamacare\u2019s architects can be charged with fraud for selling it by lying. He will ask if Obama himself committed fraud when he said, \u201cIf you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it.\u201d\n\nTrump will investigate Obama\u2019s widespread IRS conspiracy, not to mention Obama\u2019s college records.\n\nTrump will prosecute Hillary Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover-up Benghazi before the election.\n\nTrump will no doubt investigate if Obama\u2019s Labor Department committed fraud by making up job report numbers to steal the 2012 election.\n\nObama, the multi-national corporations and the media need to stop this. They recognize this could get out of control. If left unchecked telling the raw truth and asking questions everyone else is afraid to ask, Donald could wake a sleeping giant.\n\nTrump\u2019s election would be a nightmare. Obama has committed many crimes. No one else but Donald would dare to prosecute. Donald Trump will not hesitate. Once Donald gets in and gets a look at \u201cthe cooked books\u201d and Obama\u2019s records, the game is over. The gig is up. The goose is cooked.\n\nEric Holder could wind up in prison. Valerie Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Jon Corzine could wind up in prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money.\n\nHillary Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails; or accepting bribes from foreign governments while serving as secretary of State; or for \u201cmisplacing\u201d $6 billion as head of State Department; or for the Benghazi coverup.\n\nThe entire upper level management of the IRS could wind up in prison for targeting and persecuting critics of the president and then purposely destroying evidence. Obamacare will be defunded and dismantled. The Obama Crime Family will be prosecuted for crimes against the American people. And Obama himself could wind up ruined, his legacy in tatters.\n\nTrump will investigate. Trump will prosecute. Trump will go after everyone involved\u2026just for fun. That will all happen on Trump\u2019s first day in the White House.\n\nWho knows what Donald will do on day two?\n\nThat\u2019s why the dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump. That\u2019s why we must all support Donald. This may be our only shot at saving America, uncovering the crimes committed against our nation and prosecuting all of those involved.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
