In this video from Tuesday's Market Checkup, Motley Fool health-care analyst David Williamson takes investors through the biggest investing stories in the health care space today.

In this segment, David takes a look at two of the day's losers from the world of health care. Animal health powerhouse Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) fell 5% today, after it reported fourth-quarter results that came in slightly ahead of analyst estimates, at $0.36 per share versus an estimate of $0.34. However, the news that had shares falling was the company's guidance for 2014. With a midpoint of $1.51 in per-share 2014 earnings, guidance was 10 cents lighter per share than analysts had hoped, and the stock took a haircut as a result.

Small-cap active pharmaceutical ingredient maker Cambrex (NYSE:CBM) is today's other loser. While there was no further clarity regarding rumors over the a possible deal for Cambrex regarding the hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, the more important factor today was that the company released guidance for 2014, which, like Zoetis, was also lower than estimates.
