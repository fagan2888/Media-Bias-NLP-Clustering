Normally on Christmas Eve people are preparing themselves for a long winter’s nap, but police say 35-year-old Kenneth Ray was not. The Neshoba County Sheriff’s Department says he broke into the Neshoba Baptist Church in Union. Sheriff’s deputies got a call Christmas morning about a suspicious person. On their way they found the Neshoba Baptist Church van crashed. From there, deputies went to the church where they found a broken window

“Items were missing. The church had been heavily vandalized. Found that there was a small amount of money, twenty to thirty dollars was taken. There was a computer system that had been taken,” Sheriff Tommy Waddell says.

After crawling through the window, he began to vandalize the inside of the church, and even wrote a message on a chalkboard.

“In one of the Sunday school rooms the perpetrator entered, he left a message to law enforcement,” Sheriff Waddell explains. "It wasn’t a pleasant message, but he did leave us a message that was directed to the law enforcement agency.”

The church was equipped with security cameras and caught the burglar in the act. The sheriff's department was able to identify the man on surveillance as Kenneth Ray. After a dead end tip led them to Newton County, they went back to Neshoba County.

“We received information that Mr. Ray had returned back to Neshoba County and we took him into custody at a residence on county road 488,” Sheriff Waddell says.

While inside the church Ray also acquired a set of keys to the church van, which he took on a joyride and wrecked on county road 317. Sheriff Waddell says he does not yet know a motive for the break-in, and can’t understand why someone would do such a thing.

“Anybody that would break into the Lord’s house on Jesus’ birthday, taking from the church, you know, this is holiday season, this is the time to be giving not taking,” Sheriff Waddell says.
