John Kasich has not formally announced a run for higher office, but his travel schedule suggests his likely presidential campaign is a poorly kept secret.\n\nIn the latest sign that he will likely launch his presidential bid later this month, Kasich visited South Carolina on Monday, and will visit Michigan today before heading to New Hampshire Wednesday.\n\nKasich, who traveled to Nevada and Mitt Romney's Summit in Utah late last week, appears to be canvassing the country to meet voters nationwide as opposed to focusing on any one of the Republican Party's early nominating contests.\n\nLater this week, he will come to Washington, D.C., for the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to the Majority event. The event begins Wednesday and runs through Saturday, and allows many social conservatives to see the presidential candidates in action.

His recent hire of veteran GOP consultants that tried to unseat South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley could also hurt him, especially in the Palmetto State's primary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
