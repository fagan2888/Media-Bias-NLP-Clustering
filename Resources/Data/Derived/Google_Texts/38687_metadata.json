Coloradans can register to vote or update their address through Election Day.\n\nThe Colorado County Clerks Association gave the new law high marks for the November 2013 election, saying in a letter to legislators: \u201cColorado saw improved consistency, enhanced services and options, and an easier system overall for voters. And as a result, the voters responded with a record turnout.\u201d\n\nRecently, much has been made of Jon Caldara\u2019s \u201cstunt\u201d to vote during the September recall election. He lives in Boulder County but misled officials in order to vote in El Paso County. To do this, he went online to change his address with the DMV, signed a \u201clease\u201d in a friend\u2019s home, hired an attorney, swore he had moved (although he hadn\u2019t), and then did not mark the ballot.\n\nCaldara blamed the new election law, but the reality is that he could have done this under the old law. Our democracy relies on people telling the truth; it is the strength of our election system. His cavalier attitude toward voting has dealt a blow to integrity and trust in elections by his carnival showmanship.\n\nThere will always be disagreement about voting because it is intertwined with power and politics. But the bottom line is that our elections are the most representative when all eligible voters are allowed to cast a ballot. We shouldn\u2019t revert to a less consistent, more expensive, less secure system because of extreme political agendas.\n\nElena Nunez is executive director of Colorado Common Cause.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado\u2019s voting system is safe, sound", "title": "Colorado\u2019s voting system is safe, sound", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/17/colorados-voting-system-is-safe-sound/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140117__Colorado-electionsp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140117__Colorado-electionsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-17T10:58:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T03:25:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdadb5\"", "article_summary": "Caldara blamed the new election law, but the reality is that he could have done this under the old law.\nOur democracy relies on people telling the truth; it is the strength of our election system.\nColorado is a national model for our new election law that allows better access to voting, gives voters choices, decreases the cost of elections, and prevents voter fraud through technology.\nUnder the new law, every registered voter receives a mail ballot and the choice to vote in person or by mail.\nHis cavalier attitude toward voting has dealt a blow to integrity and trust in elections by his carnival showmanship."}
