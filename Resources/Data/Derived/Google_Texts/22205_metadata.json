Scott Applewhite Speaker of the House Paul Ryan laughs with Majority Whip Steve Scalise, just after Ryan signed H.R. 3762, designed to eliminate key parts of President Barack Obama's health care law.\n\nRepublicans representatives in the House will vote Tuesday to override President Obama\u2019s veto on their January bill seeking to repeal Obamacare. But without enough GOP votes to seal an override, the bill is expected to fail.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nRepublicans in Congress have attempted to repeal Obamacare more than 60 times since the landmark health care reform act was signed into law in 2012. None of them have been successful. By now, the endless cycle of these repeal bills has become a routine fixture in Congress.\n\nThis most recent bill was deemed a success by many GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, simply because it made it to the president\u2019s desk \u2014 a little further than usual. It was immediately vetoed.\n\nMedia outlets have been quick to link this expected repetitiveness to the date of Tuesday\u2019s vote: Groundhog Day. Just like the 1993 film, the public will watch Congress try to bring down the health care bill \u2014 while already knowing its fate \u2014 again, and again, and again.\n\nWhat comes after today's Obamacare repeal vote, which is \"appropriately scheduled for Groundhog Day.\" https://t.co/3PgCvo6zLj \u2014 Dave Shaw (@daveshaw00) February 2, 2016\n\nYa can't make it up: the House will be voting to repeal ObamaCare on Groundhog Day tomorrow.

We\u2019ve all lived through this charade before and we all know how it\u2019s going to end \u2014 in a failed effort to take health care away from millions of Americans,\u201d wrote Senator Chris Murphy in a morning press release. \u201cBut unlike Bill Murray\u2019s character, who eventually learned from his mistakes and became a better person, Republican leaders are either willfully ignorant or intentionally wasting everyone\u2019s time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"But unlike Bill Murray\u2019s character...Republican leaders are either willfully ignorant or intentionally wasting everyone\u2019s time.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"But unlike Bill Murray\u2019s character...Republican leaders are either willfully ignorant or intentionally wasting everyone\u2019s time.\"", "title": "GOP Lawmakers Vote To Repeal Obamacare, Again, On Groundhog Day", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/02/02/3745209/groundhog-day-obamacare-repeal/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02102626/AP_659387478108-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"But unlike Bill Murray\u2019s character...Republican leaders are either willfully ignorant or intentionally wasting everyone\u2019s time.\"", "creator": "@alex_zee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02102626/AP_659387478108-321x214.jpg", "title": "GOP Lawmakers Vote To Repeal Obamacare, Again, On Groundhog Day", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02102626/AP_659387478108-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02102626/AP_659387478108-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-02T10:50:47+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/alexzielinskireporter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5031\"", "article_summary": "What comes after today's Obamacare repeal vote, which is \"appropriately scheduled for Groundhog Day.\"\nMedia outlets have been quick to link this expected repetitiveness to the date of Tuesday\u2019s vote: Groundhog Day.\nHealth GOP Lawmakers Vote To Repeal Obamacare, Again, On Groundhog Day CREDIT: AP Photo, J.
