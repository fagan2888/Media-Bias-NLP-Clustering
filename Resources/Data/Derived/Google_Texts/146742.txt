The Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund said it would commit less to private equity this year, as stock market selloffs have shrunk the amount of available capital to put to work.

The pension fund plans to make $235 million in private market commitments in the 12 months ending Jan. 25, 2017. In the previous year, it targeted $325 million in commitments and wound up pledging up to $380 million.

Ohio Police & Fire is tapping the brakes on its investment pace as its portfolio has grown smaller amid a rout in the broader equity and commodity markets. The pension fund’s total assets fell to $13.1 billion as of Feb. 23, from $14.65 billion as of Feb. 24, 2015.

Private equity now makes up a slightly larger share-about 6%-of the portfolio, bringing the pension fund closer to its goal of allocating 8% to the asset class by 2020.

“We are conscious of the denominator effect in our plans going forward,” said David Graham, a pension spokesman. “We’re not just going to make commitments to meet a target.”

The pension fund’s move come as some investors, sensing the market hit its peak last year, are deploying capital into private equity at a more measured pace. That is a reversal of the heady days of 2014, when pensions got rich from cash distributions and the stock market surge, fueling a record fundraising year. The market has since cooled while fears of slower global growth are mounting.

Private capital funds amassed $551 billion in 2015, down from $589 billon in 2014, the last fundraising peak after the 2008 financial crisis, according to research provider Preqin Ltd.
