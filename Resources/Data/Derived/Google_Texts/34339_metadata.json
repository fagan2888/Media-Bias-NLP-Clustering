The tax would start at $10 per ton, increasing at $10 per ton each year. Revenue from the tax would be returned to households in equal shares as direct payments. Under this approach, the REMI study found that recycling the revenue back into the economy would add 2.1 million jobs over ten years. Improvements in air quality would save 13,000 lives a year. Emissions would decline by 33%.\n\n\u201cDetractors have said that a carbon tax will kill jobs,\u201d stated Mark Reynolds, executive director of Citizens Climate Lobby, which commissioned the study. \u201cThe REMI study turns that assumption on its head.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the fact that the impacts of climate change are already beginning to be felt, such a move has been a long time coming. On that note, last week the Obama administration revealed new regulations from the EPA that aim to limit carbon emissions from power plants.\n\n\u201cIf Republicans don\u2019t want more EPA regulations, their best recourse is to deliver a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which is supported by conservatives from George Shultz to Greg Mankiw,\u201d Reynolds continued. \u201cWith the REMI study showing a carbon tax that returns revenue to households will add millions of jobs, this is the option everyone can embrace.\u201d\n\nThose interested in reading the study can find it here.\n\nIn related news, a new report published by the World Energy Council is warning that the energy sector is going to be facing more and more difficulties caused by climate change in the coming years. The general takeaway of the report is summed up rather nicely by this quote here: \u201cThe energy sector is facing increasing pressure from climate change \u2026 all segments of the industry will be affected by the changing global climate and the policy responses to it.\u201d\n\nNot really news to anyone already familiar with the topic of course, but interesting to hear on such a big stage nonetheless. The next couple of decades certainly look like they are going to be interesting, don\u2019t they?\n\n\n\n\n\nGet CleanTechnica\u2019s 1st (completely free) electric car report \u2192 \u201cElectric Cars: What Early Adopters & First Followers Want.\u201d\n\n\n\nKeep up to date with all the hottest cleantech news by subscribing to our (free) cleantech newsletter, or keep an eye on sector-specific news by getting our (also free) solar energy newsletter, electric vehicle newsletter, or wind energy newsletter.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carbon tax jobs", "og": {"site_name": "CleanTechnica", "description": "While the argument is often (incorrectly) made that the actions needed to adequately address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change are too expensive to realistically be taken, the reality app\u2026", "title": "Study: Carbon Tax Would Create Jobs If Refunded To Households", "url": "http://cleantechnica.com/2014/06/22/study-carbon-tax-create-jobs-refunded-households/", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://cleantechnica.com/files/2013/02/coal-power-plant-pollution.jpg", "height": 667}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cleantechnica.com/files/2013/02/coal-power-plant-pollution.jpg?w=640", "site": "@cleantechnica", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 107162296009995}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-22T07:00:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-21T21:46:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee9c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDetractors have said that a carbon tax will kill jobs,\u201d stated Mark Reynolds, executive director of Citizens Climate Lobby, which commissioned the study.\n\u201cWith the REMI study showing a carbon tax that returns revenue to households will add millions of jobs, this is the option everyone can embrace.\u201dThose interested in reading the study can find it here.\nOn that note, last week the Obama administration revealed new regulations from the EPA that aim to limit carbon emissions from power plants.\n\u201cIf Republicans don\u2019t want more EPA regulations, their best recourse is to deliver a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which is supported by conservatives from George Shultz to Greg Mankiw,\u201d Reynolds continued.\nUnder this approach, the REMI study found that recycling the revenue back into the economy would add 2.1 million jobs over ten years."}
