JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A man has been sentenced to life in prison with a 10-year minimum mandatory for one count of armed burglary, state attorneys said.

Ronnie Stookey, 57, also received 15 years for attempted manslaughter and 15 years with a three-year minimum mandatory for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, according to state attorneys.

The victims were outside their home on 110th Street in August 2014 when Stookey and another person approached them. State attorneys said the two claimed to be Drug Enforcement Administration agents and pulled out a gun.

When the victims ran into the house, Stookey followed behind them with his gun, state attorneys said. After a struggle, the victims managed to disarm Stookey.

Stookey fled, leaving behind his gun and his DNA, according to state attorneys.

Stookey was found guilty of the charges last week, state attorneys said.
