And both Clinton and husband Bill have earned millions in speaking fees from pharmaceuticals, health care providers and health care insurers in recent years. Clinton, who has come under withering fire during this campaign for a series of paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, earned $225,000 in 2014 for a speech to the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, an industry group for PBMs.\n\nTuesday\u2019s big-ticket event \u2014 the price of admission ranges from $500 to $2,700 \u2014 comes on the heels of the former secretary of State\u2019s most ambitious fundraising blitz since announcing her campaign: 21 meet-and-greets last week and an additional 19 (so far) set for this week, according to Political Party Time, a website that tracks fundraisers.\n\nThe full-court press comes despite ongoing charges of \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d from rival Bernie Sanders, as Clinton has continued to raise cash from multibillion dollar industries, many of which, if not all, will have business before the next president.\n\nClinton met late last month with financial managers at Franklin Square Capital in Philadelphia, and followed that up with a Feb. 16 appearance at the home of Matt Mallow, managing director of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm, with over $4.5 trillion under its control. The firm has ties to the Clintons (founder Larry Fink is considered a contender for Treasury secretary in a potential Clinton administration) and has lobbied Congress and government regulators on financial regulations.\n\nVirtually no details have emerged from the event with Mallow, as news organizations focused on the much more widely covered meeting with Rev. Al Sharpton.\n\nClinton held a fundraiser later the same day at the McLean, Va., home of Anthony Welters, executive chairman of the BlackIvy Group, an investment firm founded by longtime Clinton aide Cheryl Mills.\n\nClinton followed up the next day with a luncheon in Chicago hosted by Antonio Gracias, head of Valor Equity, (an early Tesla and Uber investor ), a private equity firm with substantial regulatory interests before the federal government.\n\nClinton surrogates have also hit the fundraiser circuit in recent days, with Bill Clinton joining Best Express Foods CEO Allan Berliant in Cincinnati on Friday, and Chelsea Clinton in Columbus, Ohio, recently for an event at the home of Susan Tomasky, a board member of Public Service Enterprise Group, one of the nation\u2019s largest utilities. Best Express Foods ran afoul of the FDA in 2011, and PSEG has lobbied the federal government on nuclear regulations.\n\nOn the campaign stump, Clinton has promised, if elected, to crack down on price increases from drug companies, a move that could mean bigger profits for the PBM industry and its allies in attendance at Tuesday\u2019s fundraiser. But whether the price controls proposed by Clinton would result in lower costs or better services for consumers is open to question.\n\nSome health care professionals and watchdogs \u2014 even Clinton herself \u2014 have questioned whether PBMs are passing savings through to health plan customers or are working quietly with drug manufacturers to keep prices artificially high to maximize profits.\n\nIn Iowa last year, Clinton, citing the spike in drug prices under Obamacare, accused pharmaceuticals of \u201cprice gouging\u201d and \u201cprofiteering,\u201d and took a swipe at the insurance industry as well, saying: \u201cI think the insurance companies need to be put on notice that they need to help people afford the medical care they need, not make it increasingly expensive and difficult to access.\u201d\n\nAnd other than in New Hampshire, voters in the early Democratic Party nominating contests seem to have bought into Clinton\u2019s argument that she can be tough on the health care industry, Wall Street or any of the other economic sectors that have made her and her family multimillionaires since Bill Clinton left office. (She and Bill came out of the White House \u201cdead broke,\u201d she famously said two years ago.)\n\nAfter soundly defeating Sanders over the weekend in Nevada, Clinton holds a commanding lead in the polls going into this week\u2019s primary in South Carolina and seems to be in control as the Southern primaries loom.\n\nBut if Clinton emerges to face Donald Trump, Marco Rubio \u2014 or whomever the Republican standard-bearer is next fall \u2014 look for the \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d charges to follow the Democratic nominee.\n\nJeff Bechdel, communications director for America Rising, a conservative super PAC, said the the cozy relationships between the Clintons and the country\u2019s most powerful elites continue to raise legitimate questions of trustworthiness\n\n\u201cFor decades, the Clintons have lived at the intersection of money and politics, so it\u2019s no surprise to hear the groups benefiting from Clinton\u2019s attacks are also donating to her campaign. It\u2019s this kind of unethical behavior that voters point to when they say they believe Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy,\u201d Bechdel told InsideSources.\n\nUpdate: An earlier version of this post incorrectly indicated Hillary Clinton would take part in Tuesday\u2019s Washington, D.C., fund-raiser.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Hillary Clinton firmly re-established as the party's presidential\u00a0front-runner, the former first lady's campaign\u00a0cranked up fundraising in recent days", "og": {"site_name": "InsideSources", "description": "With Hillary Clinton firmly re-established as the party's presidential\u00a0front-runner, the former first lady's campaign\u00a0cranked up fundraising in recent days", "title": "Clinton Fundraisers Target Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Health Industry \u2013 InsideSources", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.insidesources.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AP_922982695693.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-23T00:12:48+00:00", "url": "http://www.insidesources.com/clinton-fundraiser-target/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With Hillary Clinton firmly re-established as the party's presidential\u00a0front-runner, the former first lady's campaign\u00a0cranked up fundraising in recent days", "creator": "@InsideSourcesDC", "image": "http://www.insidesources.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AP_922982695693.jpg", "title": "Clinton Fundraisers Target Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Health Industry \u2013 InsideSources", "site": "@InsideSourcesDC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.insidesources.com", "section": "Politics", "tag": "Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2016-02-22T21:33:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-23T00:12:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And both Clinton and husband Bill have earned millions in speaking fees from pharmaceuticals, health care providers and health care insurers in recent years.\nClinton has a longstanding relationship with the health care industry\u2019s powerful PBM segment, which negotiates prescription prices for insurers and consumers.\nUpdate: An earlier version of this post incorrectly indicated Hillary Clinton would take part in Tuesday\u2019s Washington, D.C., fund-raiser.\nIt\u2019s this kind of unethical behavior that voters point to when they say they believe Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy,\u201d Bechdel told InsideSources.\nSome health care professionals and watchdogs \u2014 even Clinton herself \u2014 have questioned whether PBMs are passing savings through to health plan customers or are working quietly with drug manufacturers to keep prices artificially high to maximize profits."}
