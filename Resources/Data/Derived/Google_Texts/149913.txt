COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — Colorado Springs police are investigating after finding chemical bottle bombs in the Garden of the Gods parking lot on Saturday.

Police and the fire department responded to reports of a chemical spill and that’s when they found bottles filled with chemicals that can produce enough pressure to burst and cause damage.

The bottles were safely disposed of by the bomb squad.

Police are asking the public to report anything suspicious and not go near it.
