Ricardo Lara, Dem-Bell Gardens, urged undocumented parents to set their fears aside and enroll their children in the program. The legislation would expand the state\u2019s health insurance program for low-income people.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a misconception among immigrants,\u201d Lara said, that asking for government help could land them in trouble. He made this observation during a May 12 media presentation at San Francisco\u2019s Mission Neighborhood Health Center.\n\nMindful of this, the Health for All Kids program \u2013 set to launch May 16 \u2014 was designed so children who currently have limited access to health care through the Emergency Medi-Cal, Healthy San Francisco or Healthy Kids programs would \u201cseamlessly transition\u201d into full-scope Medi-Cal (California\u2019s version of Medicaid), said Lara.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe was flanked on the podium by State Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, and Democrat Assemblymembers Phil Tang and David Chiu. Representatives of such health advocacy groups as Children Now, Health Access, California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, Asians Advancing Justice and California Immigrant Policy Center also spoke at the media briefing.\n\n170,000 California Children Eligible\n\nAn estimated 170,000 undocumented children are eligible to enroll in the state-funded program, expected to cost $40 million in the first year of its operation, and $137 million annually \u201cin perpetuity,\u201d Lara said.\n\nLara drew on his experience growing up in the United States as the child of poor undocumented immigrants from Mexico to emphasize why it\u2019s important to have children enrolled in health insurance.\n\n\u201cChildren shouldn\u2019t have to worry about how their parents are going to pay for a broken arm or for a dentist,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nLeno, who chairs the Senate Budget Committee, said the importance of the Health For All Kids program can not be overemphasized because illnesses make no distinction between documented and undocumented people.\n\n\u201cOur bodies, viruses, bacteria don\u2019t know what our immigration status is,\u201d Leno said. He noted that dental problems alone results in around 500,000 children in California missing school each year.\n\nHe also observed, \u201cWithout a high school diploma, a child is more likely to find his way into the criminal justice system.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018Get a Clue, Donald Trump\u2019\n\nLeno\u2019s elicited laughter when he quipped, \u201cGet a clue, Donald Trump.\u201d He was referring to the Republican presidential presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s vow to upend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) should he become president.\n\nUndocumented Bay Area resident Teresa Lopez, a mother of four children, said she would be relieved to see her Mexico-born daughter, Litzy, age 15, enroll in the full-scope Medi-Cal program and enjoy accessing health care the way her two U.S.-born children currently do.\n\n\u201cHaving to make copayments for every visit, and for medications is taking a toll on my family,\u201d said Lopez, speaking in Spanish, through an interpreter. \u201cIt will be nice when all my children have the same kind of health care benefits.\u201d\n\nLara noted earlier this week that the California Department of Health Care Services, which operates Medi-Cal, has said it is ready for the influx of thousands of children when the Health For All Kids program begins next week.\n\nLara is hopeful that Gov. Jerry Brown will sign his second bill, SB 10, which is currently making its way through the Legislature. It would allow the state\u2019s undocumented adults to buy unsubsidized health insurance on Covered California, the online marketplace set up under ACA, with their own money. More than 2 million people currently have no access to health care, Lara said.\n\nCalifornia has sought a federal waiver to allow its undocumented population to purchase health insurance on the marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe hope we get the waiver before the administration in Washington changes,\u201d Lara said, suggesting that the next U.S. president might either dismantle ACA or make drastic changes to it.\n\nMedi-Cal Provider Shortage\n\nIn the wake of the new Health For All Kids program, Lara was asked how the state could cope with the large influx of new Medi-Cal enrollees when there is already a shortage of doctors and dentists in the Medi-Cal network.\n\nHe said that said he hopes lawmakers would make the program more attractive to health care providers by increasing reimbursement rates, currently among the lowest in the nation.\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep pushing for this,\u201d Lara said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "news_keywords": "world, headlines, religion, politics, legal, philippine daily inquirer, inquirer news, philippine news, inquirer.net, filipino news, ofw news", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2001-2016 INQUIRER.net", "author": "INQUIRER.net", "og": {"url": "http://globalnation.inquirer.net/139470/undocumented-urged-dont-be-afraid-enroll-kids-in-health-program", "image": "http://globalnation.inquirer.net/files/2016/05/v_sundaram_lara_500x279.jpg", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO--Kicking off his statewide tour to promote California\u2019s Health for All Kids program, the new law\u2019s author, State Sen.
