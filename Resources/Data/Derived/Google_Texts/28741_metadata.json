The countywide plan is updated every five years, and elements of this update include continued financial support for residential curbside recycling programs; expansion of commercial waste reduction and recycling opportunities for businesses; and a countywide recycling education campaign, according to Walker. The agency must ask Summit County communities to approve or disapprove of the plan, she said.\n\nFollowing her presentation, trustees approved the plan.\n\nIn other action, trustees:\n\nadopted a resolution for temporary appropriations for 2014 totaling nearly $13 million. Fiscal Officer Janice Marshall said the amount is an increase of 0.63 percent over last year\u2019s temporary appropriations;\n\napproved paying approximately $550,000 for Copley\u2019s share of expenses for 2014 for its joint dispatch center with Norton and Barberton;\n\napproved a memorandum of understanding with Teamsters Local 348 to settle six grievances filed in November 2012 and January and March 2013. Marshall said the matters were mostly regarding assignment of overtime;\n\nauthorized Life Force Management to write off approximately $16,600 in uncollectable ambulance billing;\n\napproved purchasing a server and miscellaneous associated features for storage of police cruiser camera video, for $3,400;\n\naccepted anonymous donations to the police department totaling $3,001;\n\nnoted residents may recycle Christmas trees through the Service Department, which is offering a free pickup Jan. 6. Township officials request trees be placed curbside unbagged prior to 7 a.m. the day of pickup, with all decorations removed. For more information, call the Service Department at 330-666-0365; and\n\napproved an annual organization resolution for the township and its employees, stating, among other routine items, that trustees will continue to meet twice a month for regular meetings on the first and third Wednesdays of each month.\n\nTrustees also cleared up an item of old business as they approved a resolution supporting the formation of the Wolf Creek Watershed Conservancy District, subject to approval of funding by all three communities involved \u2014 Copley, Barberton and Norton. Creating the district is an effort to mitigate storm water problems in the three communities, according to township officials.\n\nFollowing an executive session, trustees confirmed the hiring of Brett McShane as part-time patrol officer, who successfully completed prehire testing.\n\nAlso, the following day, Dec. 19, trustees hosted a special meeting, a discussion with U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci (R-District-16), which brought a full house of about 30 residents to the trustees\u2019 meeting room. Trustee Helen Humphrys said the discussion was very informal and mostly focused on the Affordable Care Act. Renacci would like to hold a Town Hall meeting in Copley once a year, she added.\n\nThe Copley Board of Trustees\u2019 next regular meeting will take place a day later than usual since New Year\u2019s Day falls on the board\u2019s usual meeting date. The meeting will be Jan. 2 at 6 p.m. at the Copley Township offices, 1540 S. Cleveland-Massillon Road.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Akron,Ohio,", "description": "Akron, Ohio Summit County Common Pleas Court Judge Tammy O\u0092Brien administered oaths of office at the Copley Township Board of Trustees..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb603\"", "article_summary": "Two Copley trustees sworn in12/26/2013 - West Side LeaderBy Ariel HakimSummit County Common Pleas Court Judge Tammy O\u2019Brien administered oaths of office at the Copley Township Board of Trustees meeting Dec. 18 to Trustee Dale Panovich and Trustee Scott Dressler, who both won re-election in the November General Election.\nThe Copley Board of Trustees\u2019 next regular meeting will take place a day later than usual since New Year\u2019s Day falls on the board\u2019s usual meeting date.\nAlso at the meeting, trustees heard from Yolanda Walker, executive director of ReWorks, on Summit County\u2019s solid waste management plan.\nAlso, the following day, Dec. 19, trustees hosted a special meeting, a discussion with U.S. Rep.
