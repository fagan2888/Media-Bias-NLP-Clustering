Both inpatient and outpatient surgeries increased in volume, by 20 percent and 25 percent respectively. Emergency care visits have also been up considerably, by 22 percent in total and almost 9 percent on a same-hospital basis.\n\n[Also: Fitch Ratings bullish on for-profit healthcare]\n\nHealthcare reform contributed $13 million to the company\u2019s pre-adjusted earnings, with more commercial payers and high reimbursement. Another driver of growth has been LifePoint\u2019s ongoing takeovers and joint venture deals.\n\nFounded in 1999 with 23 rural hospitals, LifePoint today operates 65 hospital campuses across greater Appalachia, the South and parts of West. The company is vying with the other for-profit giants and to a greater extent Community Health Systems, another growing for-profit rural health system. Like others, particularly Tenet, LifePoint is leaning towards a joint venture strategy over traditional mergers and acquisitions.\n\nAmong recent deals, LifePoint\u2019s joint venture with Norton Healthcare in Indiana is set to acquire the Clark Memorial Hospital, in Jeffersonville, a small city across the Ohio River from Louisville. LifePoint is also set to acquire the Watertown Regional Medical Center in central Wisconsin.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cWhat we have accomplished in Western and Central Pennsylvania demonstrates how rapidly and effectively we can build these networks,\u201d said Carpenter, referring to the work of the company\u2019s 12 hospital joint venture with Duke University Health System, Duke LifePoint Healthcare. \u201cIn the third quarter of 2014, Duke LifePoint acquired Conemaugh Health System, the tertiary provider in Western and Central Pennsylvania. Conemaugh is performing well and our recent acquisition of Nason Hospital is the fourth hospital in the network.\u201d\n\nThe company is eyeing more facilities, especially ambulatory surgery centers and oncology clinics, said president and CEO David Dill.\n\nLifePoint is also making a major foray into quality improvement at its 65 hospital campuses though the Duke partnership. LifePoint is a participant in Medicare\u2019s 2011 Hospital Engagement Network focused on reducing healthcare-acquired conditions; with Duke, the company is crafting a national program to implement best practices in hospital safety developed at the academic medical system.\n\nIn another financial realm, LifePoint is cooperating with a federal investigation and dealing with more than a dozen lawsuits stemming from inappropriate interventional cardiology practices. In February, the company told investors that it had discovered and self-reported evidence of improper use of cardiac stents by two now-former cardiologists at the Vaughan Regional Medical Center in Selma, Alabama.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/lifepoint-profit-rises-new-hospitals-spikes-admissions-and-insured", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Lifepoint%20hospital-google%20plus-featured.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Net income for Brentwood, Tennessee-based LifePoint increased 5 percent year-over-year to $38.9 million, as revenue surged 25 percent to $1.2 billion.", "title": "LifePoint profit rises on new hospitals, spikes in admissions and insured"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Lifepoint%20hospital-google%20plus-featured.png"}, "description": "Net income for Brentwood, Tennessee-based LifePoint increased 5 percent year-over-year to $38.9 million, as revenue surged 25 percent to $1.2 billion.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "LifePoint profit rises on new hospitals, spikes in admissions and insured"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "For-profit rural health system LifePoint Hospitals said its profit grew 5 percent in the first quarter of 2015, on a boost from newly-insured patients in middle America&#13; .Net income for Brentwood, Tennessee-based LifePoint increased 5 percent year-over-year to $38.9 million, as revenue surged 25 percent to $1.2 billion.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0361\"", "article_summary": "Photo of LifePoint Hospitals from Google PlusFor-profit rural health system LifePoint Hospitals said its profit grew 5 percent in the first quarter of 2015, on a boost from newly-insured patients in middle America.Net income for Brentwood, Tennessee-based LifePoint increased 5 percent year-over-year to $38.9 million, as revenue surged 25 percent to $1.2 billion.\n\u201cIn the third quarter of 2014, Duke LifePoint acquired Conemaugh Health System, the tertiary provider in Western and Central Pennsylvania.\nFounded in 1999 with 23 rural hospitals, LifePoint today operates 65 hospital campuses across greater Appalachia, the South and parts of West.\nLike others, particularly Tenet, LifePoint is leaning towards a joint venture strategy over traditional mergers and acquisitions.\nAnother driver of growth has been LifePoint\u2019s ongoing takeovers and joint venture deals."}
