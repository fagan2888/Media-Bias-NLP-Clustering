A retail store opening in late September in Oakwood is looking for 60 employees for setting up.

Prospective employees can find assistance through the Georgia Department of Labor’s recruitment session Thursday at the Gainesville Career Center.

Ollie’s Bargain Outlet, an overstock retail store, is opening Sept. 28.

Applications can be filled out in person or online. The main duties for setting up the store will be “building fixtures, putting in shelves, unloading trucks, sorting and ticketing merchandise and displaying it on the sales floor,” according to a Georgia Department of Labor news release.

The positions are part-time temporary for setting up and have the potential of becoming full-time positions in cashiers and sales associates. The hourly wage is $8.50.

Store Manager Zach Shields did not have any specifics on the likelihood of part-time positions becoming full-time employment.

“I would like to see retail background, obviously, but other than that, I’m just looking for the right attitude,” Shields said.

Ollie’s will also hire for a variety of positions that coincide with the store’s opening.

“We’re looking for cashiers, head cashiers, sales associates, department supervisors, assistant managers, store managers, all of that,” said Shields.

The recruitment session will be from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Thursday at the Georgia Department of Labor’s Gainesville Career Center, 2756 Atlanta Highway.

Prospective applicants must pass a background check and be at least 18 years old.
