America is now over $19 trillion in debt, and the Congressional Budget Office projects that the debt will rise to $26.3 trillion by 2020. How did we get to this point?\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve turned the postwar economy that made America prosperous and rich inside out,\u201d Hudson explained. \u201cSomehow most people believed they could get rich by going into debt to borrow assets that were going to rise in price. But you can\u2019t get rich, ultimately, by going into debt. In the end, the creditors always win. That\u2019s why every society since Sumer and Babylonia has had to either cancel the debts, or you come to a society like Rome that didn\u2019t cancel the debts, and then you have a dark age. Everything collapses.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\nWatch Part I of the interview, posted by The Real News, below.\n\n\u2014Posted by Eric Ortiz", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "babylonia, big banking system, chris hedges, classical economics, days of revolt, economics, europe, federal debt, feudalism, karl marx, michael hudson, sumer, telesur, the real news, united states, university of missouri-kansas city, wall street", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "The federal debt has exceeded $19 trillion.
