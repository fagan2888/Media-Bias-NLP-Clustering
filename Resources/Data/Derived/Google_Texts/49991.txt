Pope Francis kicked off his Monday with a swing through the Dome of the Rock, a holy spot for three religions — Christianity, Judaism and Islam — and a call for universal peace, his signature message.

He also deviated a bit from script when speaking to Muslims in Jerusalem, calling them “dear brothers” rather than the expected “dear friends,” The Associated Press reported.

“May we respect and love one another as brothers and sisters,” he said, AP reported. “May we learn to understand the suffering of others. May no one abuse the name of God through violence.”

The pope appeared healthy, despite talk of his whirlwind pace bringing on ailments.

After the Dome of the Rock, he traveled to the Western Wall and to Mount Herzi, the Israeli national cemetery named after the father of modern Zionism, AP reported. He was also scheduled to meet with several Israeli chiefs of state and local priests before heading to Mass in the Room of the Last Supper, where Catholics believe Jesus had his final meal with disciples before he was crucified.
