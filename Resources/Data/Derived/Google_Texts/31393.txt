A new report released by New Jersey authorities shows that taxpayers are being socked with a $6.5 million legal bill in part for Gov. Chris Christie’s (R) defense over allegations of political corruption in what came to be known as the “Bridgegate” probe.

The New Jersey state attorney general released the documents on Friday, revealing the fees from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, the firm Gov. Christie retained for his defense against charges of political corruption for the temporary shutting down of the George Washington Bridge near Fort Lee, New Jersey in September of 2013.

This final tally is less than it might have been. Earlier this year the law firm agreed to lower its fee from $650 per hour to $350.

In May, Gibson Dunn attorney Alexander Southwell said the fees the firm charged were “barely half the amount” they would normally have charged.

In March of this year, though, Christie was cleared of charges of corruption in the scandal.

Some of the $6.5 million paid to the law firm included services rendered in 2013, when the firm represented Christie when he attempted to overturn a federal ban on sports gambling.
