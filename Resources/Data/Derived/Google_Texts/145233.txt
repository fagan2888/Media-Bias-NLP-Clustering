Some veterinarians say the Affordable Care Act’s 2.3-percent tax on medical devices is unfair.

That’s because the tax applies to a lot of the same equipment used on humans and animals, but animals don’t benefit from the health care law.



Dr. Sally Foote, who’s a veterinarian in Tuscola, says because of the tax, she’s going to have to either see a lot more clients or raise the cost of service.



“You’ve just knocked two-point-three percent out of what I take home in pay, just because of buying this piece of equipment to put into the money to the government for the health care for everybody else in the human side that’s got nothing to do with animals. And my cliental then are really, are paying for that, which doesn’t bring any direct benefit back.”



Foote notes that she’s also concerned about the added cost of her existing health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.



The medical device tax is intended to bring in roughly $29 billion over the next decade to help pay for the health care law. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have supported repealing the tax, but an effort last year to do so failed in the Senate after passing in the House.
