A new bill proposed by a Shawnee state senator is aimed at providing a new system for student discipline while keeping students in school.\n\nThe new bill titled \u201cSenate Bill 911\u201d was introduced by Sen. Ron Sharp (R-Shawnee). Sharp said he taught civics and history classes for 38 years at Shawnee High School before joining the state legislature.\n\n\u201cThis is the number one problem in education.\u201d he said.\n\nSB911 would give teachers a way control their classrooms without suspending or expelling students, which has become a more common tool for dealing with bullies and unruly students. Oklahoma is one of 19 states that still have corporal punishment as a resource for educators, according to the Center for Effective Discipline, although fewer teachers use it on students.\n\nThe bill would allow districts to hire volunteer judges that would be able to hand down punishments and fines. According to the bill\u2019s text, districts can decide how large the fines would be for each offense but they could not exceed $50. Students under the age of eight and those in special education classes would be exempt from the \u201ccourt.\u201d\n\nMoney collected from the fines could be used for increasing campus security through updated systems and paid guards. It could also be used for small \u201ccharacter scholarships,\u201d Sharp said.\n\nSharp also suggested the judge would be able to require community service, counseling or other punishments in lieu of a fine or suspension. But he said one thing was clear; classroom discipline was the number one problem facing Oklahoma schools.\n\n\u201cNow teachers are at a difficult situation in the classroom. They're facing adversarial and hostile conditions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn every single class you're going to have 3 to 5 kids that are going to make your life a nightmare every single day,\u201d said Nick Cowan. Cowan is the senior class principal at Shawnee High School. He said most of the time teachers don\u2019t want to suspend students because it often creates more problems and doesn\u2019t solve the problem\n\n\u201cIf they're suspended they still have the right to an education. It just means more work for the teachers and the parents and if they're suspended the student's not learning,\u201d He said.\n\nBut for Sharp, who taught civics, history and US government, teaching kids discipline goes beyond the classroom.\n\n\u201cWe have to get control. We are losing our schools and of course if we lose our schools we lose our society,\u201d he said.\n\nIf passed, SB 911 would take effect July 1 and would start during the 2016-2017 school year.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "More teachers across the state are saying students are becoming harder to discipline and that they have less recourse to address disruptions in class.", "author": "Grant Hermes", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/30788308/state-senator-proposes-bill-to-fine-students-for-breaking-school-rules", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9489830_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "More teachers across the state are saying students are becoming harder to discipline and that they have less recourse to address disruptions in class.", "title": "State Senator Proposes Bill To Fine Students For Breaking School Rules"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9489830_G.jpg", "description": "More teachers across the state are saying students are becoming harder to discipline and that they have less recourse to address disruptions in class.", "card": "summary", "title": "State Senator Proposes Bill To Fine Students For Breaking School Rules"}, "wnreadableurl": "state-senator-proposes-bill-to-fine-students-for-breaking-school-rules", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2015/12/18", "KEYWORDS": "Senate, Bill, school, discipline, fine, okc, news 9, kwtv, Shawnee, Sharp", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS17", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "Senate, Bill, school, discipline, fine, okc, news 9, kwtv, Shawnee, Sharp"}, "article_summary": "A new bill proposed by a Shawnee state senator is aimed at providing a new system for student discipline while keeping students in school.\nSharp said he taught civics and history classes for 38 years at Shawnee High School before joining the state legislature.\nThe new bill titled \u201cSenate Bill 911\u201d was introduced by Sen.
