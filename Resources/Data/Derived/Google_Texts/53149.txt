Yeah, this is a thing.

GOP gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott’s team released a “Star Wars”-themed ad Thursday attacking Democrat opponent Wendy Davis for her Hollywood fundraising ties. It begins with the classic “Star Wars” scroll, with the words “Star Wars” changed to “Wendy Davis” and text identifying her as a candidate who “conspired with Big Government Empire’s sinister agents.”

“A candidate for Texas governor rubbing elbows with gun-grabbing, ObamaCare-promoting, tax-raising Hollywood elites? It sounds like the plot of a sci-fi fantasy film, but when it comes to Sen. Wendy Davis, it’s a reality show,” a description of the ad reads. “As she heads to a glitzy fundraiser in Los Angeles with celebrities tonight, it’s official; Sen. Davis has gone Hollywood.”

Multiple entertainment-industry bigwigs are scheduled to host a fundraiser for Davis Thursday evening; humorously, one of the top-billed hosts is J.J. Abrams, who is directing the upcoming “Star Wars” film.
