Fewer Iowans lack health care coverage, and the Affordable Care Act is the reason.

New numbers form the National Health Interview Survey show five percent of all Iowans don't have health insurance. That's the ninth lowest number of all 50 states.

The same report shows 7.1 percent of Iowans age 18 to 64 didn't have health insurance in 2015.

That number is down from 8.4 percent in 2014 and 11.3 percent in 2013.

The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, expanded Medicaid and requires people in the US to have health insurance or pay a penalty.
