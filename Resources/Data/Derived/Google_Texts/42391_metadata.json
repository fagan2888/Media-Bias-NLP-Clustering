\u201cabnormally high traffic\u201d that crippled New York\u2019s ObamaCare Web site for two days may have resulted from a malicious attack by hackers, computer-security experts said Wednesday.\n\nThe NY State of Health site recorded an astounding 10 million visits after opening for business Tuesday \u2014 although there are only about 1.1 million state residents without health insurance and just 330,000 are expected to buy ObamaCare for next year.\n\nBy comparison, the federal government\u2019s heavily promoted HealthCare.gov site \u2014 a portal to the sites for all 50 states, the District of Columbia and America\u2019s territories and commonwealths \u2014 drew just 4.7 million visitors the first day.\n\nLate Tuesday, NY State of Health Executive Director Donna Frescatore said technicians were \u201clooking into the cause of this abnormally high traffic.\u201d\n\nDarien Kindlund, manager of threat intelligence for the FireEye network-security company, said \u201cthe sheer volume\u201d of visits to New York\u2019s site pointed to a possible \u201cdistributed denial of service,\u201d or DDoS attack, in which virus-infected computers bombard a site with traffic.\n\n\u201cThe numbers are fairly compelling,\u201d Kindlund said.\n\nHemant Jain, vice president of engineering for Fortinet, a network-security firm, said that \u201cbecause [ObamaCare] is such a political issue, it could very well be a DDoS attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, you don\u2019t expect everyone to wake up and access a Web site like that, so I have a feeling it may be an attack,\u201d he said.\n\nMatthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of CloudFlare, another security firm, said that while there wasn\u2019t yet enough evidence to prove an attack, \u201cit does not take a lot of technical resources\u201d and hackers can be hired to disrupt a site for just a couple thousand dollars a day.\n\n\u201cThere have to be people who disagree with [ObamaCare] enough to do that,\u201d he added.\n\nThroughout the day, the Web site displayed a banner message telling users to return later.\n\nFreelance writer Cristina Gibson, 29, of Union Square, wanted to see how ObamaCare premiums compare to the $345 a month she currently pays for health insurance, but gave up in frustration after spending 40 minutes trying to navigate the site during a lunch break from jury duty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in this, but not interested enough to be behind on stuff in my life,\u201d she said.\n\nLawyer Greg Crawford, 50, of suburban Katonah, said he has Crohn\u2019s disease and is hoping that ObamaCare will slash the \u201cburdensome\u201d cost of his current coverage.\n\nBut after creating an account Tuesday, Crawford got booted off the site and was unable to log in during a half-dozen attempts Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of the government taking over all this stuff politically, but I\u2019m going to benefit from it tremendously as an individual, and I just wish it would work,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tara Palmeri and Lorena Mongelli", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter":
