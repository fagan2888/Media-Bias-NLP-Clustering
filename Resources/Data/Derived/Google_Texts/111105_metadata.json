More insurance carriers are also offering plans in the exchanges \u2013 and in many states, premiums are decreasing.\n\n\n\nThat's all great news, but it does mean that ACA's second open enrollment \u2013 which starts November 15 \u2013 will likely be a flurry of activity as millions of already enrolled Americans re-enroll and millions more enroll in qualified health plans for the first time.\n\n\n\nNever fear; health reform expert Louise Norris, who has authored more than 120 articles about the health reform law for healthinsurance.org, has written a 38-page guide designed to make enrollment a breeze.\n\n\n\nThe Insider's Guide to Obamacare's Open Enrollment (2014-2015) is filled with insider information designed to give consumers a head start on health plan shopping before November 15 \u2013 and then shorten the time they spend in the application process. Readers can download the guide FREE simply by providing a valid email address, where they'll receive a download link.\n\n\n\nIt's definitely time to enroll \u2013 or re-enroll\n\n\n\nNorris, a licensed agent for more than a decade, has been studying the Affordable Care Act and its provisions for years \u2013 and has been closely monitoring private plan enrollment for the past year. This fall, the author also personally interviewed representatives of each state-run marketplace and HealthCare.gov to assess exchange improvement efforts that will make enrollment more consumer friendly.\n\n\n\nBased on those interviews, Norris is optimistic as \"Round Two\" of open enrollment draws near. In fact, the concerted effort to improve the exchanges is one of \"10 reasons why it's time to enroll\" \u2013 the introductory chapter of her new guide.\n\n\n\nDifferent avenues to coverage\n\n\n\nThere's no question in the author's mind that all Americans should have affordable, comprehensive medical insurance, but as she points out in her book, there are different routes to coverage.\n\n\n\nFor instance, in \"Do you have to enroll in an exchange,\" she dispels the misconception that consumers have to purchase a qualified health plan through the marketplaces. And, in the chapter, \"Re-enrolling: Should I stay or should I go?\" she notes that consumers already enrolled will have re-enrollment requirements that vary depending on the state where they're enrolled.\n\n\n\nNorris says that many Americans will likely be surprised when they read, \"Can you keep your grandmothered plan?\" In that chapter, she reveals that \u2013 again, depending on their state \u2013 people who are enrolled in a \"grandmothered,\" non-compliant plan may be able to re-enroll in the same plan.\n\n\n\nSaving money, saving time\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether they plan to enroll or re-enroll, Norris says readers will want to read the chapters with tips for \"shopping\" carefully \u2013 and beating the enrollment crush.\n\n\n\n\"Looking beyond the lowest premium,\" gives readers a step-by-step process for selecting a plan that's not based solely on the lowest premium, but on all coverage costs \u2013 from deductibles to co-pays and co-insurance. The chapter, \"5 ways to beat the open enrollment crush\" advises readers to \"work ahead\" on research that doesn't have to wait \u2013 such as comparing premiums, benefits and provider networks.\n\n\n\nHer chapter, \"How to spend less time enrolling\" lists time-saving enrollment strategies \u2013 some as obvious as asking for help by phone or in-person. And, if readers do decide to seek personal assistance, \"Agents and brokers and navigators \u2026 Oh my!\" will help them decide which way to turn.\n\n\n\nNo reason to wait\n\n\n\nNorris says that as an agent, she doesn't find it unusual for individuals and families to be concerned about choosing a health insurance policy with the benefits they need ... or to worry that decent coverage will be too expensive.\n\n\n\n\"My hope is that readers will gain reassurance that the health law is actually going to give them more options \u2013 and more affordable options \u2013 for solid coverage,\" Norris says, \"but also that the enrollment process doesn't have to be long and frustrating.\"\n\n\n\nAbout healthinsurance.org\n\n\n\nCreated in 1994, healthinsurance.org is one of the longest running sources of in-depth information about health insurance.
