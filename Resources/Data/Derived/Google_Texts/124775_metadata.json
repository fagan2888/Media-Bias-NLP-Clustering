At first glance, nursing aide Ihor Krutovskyi seemed like a good fit, since he spoke fluent Russian, but Murakhovsky\u2019s family still decided to take certain precautions. Shocking nanny cam footage released by the NY Daily News shows Krutovskyi abusing the 115-pound elderly patient he was tasked with caring for.\n\nMurakhovsky\u2019s granddaughter Gabrielle and wife Valentina were concerned that a previous at-home health care aide sent by the Personal-Touch Home Care agency had mistreated their loved one, who also suffers from Parkinson\u2019s disease. On Krutovskyi\u2019s first day of work, Gabrielle informed her grandfather\u2019s nursing aide that he would be on camera and that she would be watching the footage via her iPad. Although Krutovskyi thought he had disabled the camera by removing a wire connected to the TV, he only managed to disable the sound.\n\nSix days after Krutovskyi began \u201ccaring for\u201d Murakhovsky, Gabrielle was horrified to find out the aide had been shaking, smacking, and violently pulling her defenseless grandfather while feeding him. Krutovskyi was promptly arrested and charged with two felonies, which included endangering the welfare of an incompetent person and endangering the welfare of a vulnerable elderly/incompetent/disabled person. While he was released on bail on April 12, Gabrielle says she would like to see him in jail.\n\n\u201cIf you know that somebody\u2019s watching you, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to do something bad,\u201d Gabrielle told the Daily News. \u201cHe\u2019s completely paralyzed and bed-bound. Why would you do that? He\u2019s sick as it is. He doesn\u2019t deserve more pain.\u201d\n\nClick here for the video.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nurse, aide, abuse, nanny, cam", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Surveillance video captured a nursing aide tasked with caring for an elderly stroke victim abusing him instead.", "title": "At-Home Aide Caught Abusing Elderly Stroke Victim On Nanny Cam [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/shocking-nanny-cam-footage-shows-home-health-care-aide-abusing-elderly-stroke-victim-298868", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/20/bentsion-murakhovsky.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Surveillance video captured a nursing aide tasked with caring for an elderly stroke victim abusing him instead.", "title": "At-Home Aide Caught Abusing Elderly Stroke Victim On Nanny Cam [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/shocking-nanny-cam-footage-shows-home-health-care-aide-abusing-elderly-stroke-victim-298868", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/20/bentsion-murakhovsky.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/20/bentsion-murakhovsky.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-20T12:01:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-20T12:01:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Surveillance video captured a nursing aide tasked with caring for an elderly stroke victim abusing him instead."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeea2\"", "article_summary": "Shocking nanny cam footage released by the NY Daily News shows Krutovskyi abusing the 115-pound elderly patient he was tasked with caring for.\nAt first glance, nursing aide Ihor Krutovskyi seemed like a good fit, since he spoke fluent Russian, but Murakhovsky\u2019s family still decided to take certain precautions.\nOn Krutovskyi\u2019s first day of work, Gabrielle informed her grandfather\u2019s nursing aide that he would be on camera and that she would be watching the footage via her iPad.\nWhile he was released on bail on April 12, Gabrielle says she would like to see him in jail.\nMurakhovsky\u2019s granddaughter Gabrielle and wife Valentina were concerned that a previous at-home health care aide sent by the Personal-Touch Home Care agency had mistreated their loved one, who also suffers from Parkinson\u2019s disease."}
