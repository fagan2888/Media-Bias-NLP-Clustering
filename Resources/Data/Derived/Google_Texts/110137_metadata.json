Any reform effort should eliminate this cruel tax.\n\nThere are other obstacles that our system creates for business owners as well. Obamacare made covering the health insurance for my 12 employees far too difficult, so I was forced to simply pay my staff more and leave them to find their own health plans. I have prided myself on trying to do the right thing, like providing health insurance, but it is not feasible given how our system operates now.\n\nEveryone I encounter, regardless of their political affiliation or stances on any number of issues, all believe that something has to be done to improve our tax code.\n\nI am willing to pay my fair share, but we need a system that supports businesses of all sizes, rather than the current one that is at odds with our success.\n\nPennsylvania needs our representatives in Washington to go all in for comprehensive tax reform to create an environment where our businesses can thrive.\n\nWhile we may disagree over some issues and candidates, we all agree that tax reform needs to happen now.\n\nRobert Brett is the owner of Dublin Woods Family Dentistry in Abington, Montgomery County.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "PennLive Op-Ed", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "America, Robert Brett, Pennsylvania, health insurance, Dublin Woods Family Dentistry, presidential campaign, small-business, tax-reform, opinion", "title": "Want to really help small businesses?
