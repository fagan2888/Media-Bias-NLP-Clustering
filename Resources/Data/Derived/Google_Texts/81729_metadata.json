They didn\u2019t take parents into account. The fact that they passed a motion like this and created an additional protected class in the policy and then they are going to let people see later what this means, that\u2019s ridiculous. That\u2019s exactly what this happened with Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAlthough the affects of the new policy are unclear, many of the parents who attended the meeting are sure of one thing, the board\u2019s lack of respect for their voices will determine who is re-elected in November.\n\n\u201cWe will remember in November!\u201d audience members shouted as they stormed out of the auditorium.\n\nOnly 10 speakers were allowed a few minutes to debate the amendment, prompting frustrated parents to shout their disapproval. Board Chairwoman Tamara Derenak Kaufax threatened to empty the auditorium if rowdy audience member did not keep quiet.\n\nElizabeth Shultz, the only board member to vote against the amendment, said that the vote went exactly as she expected it to go and blasted her colleagues for pushing a political agenda without considering parents\u2019 rights to be a part of the conversation.\n\n\u201cI think it is a sad statement that we can allow those decisions to be entrenched in political ideology or vague understandings of the implications of such policies,\u201d Ms. Schultz said. \u201cWe are an education system, and we didn\u2019t do our homework. We took the final exam and signed our name at the bottom and took some guesses.\u201d\n\nMs. Schultz filed a motion to delay the vote until October to give the board time to review studies and answer questions about the specific implications of the change. However, her motion was defeated over lots of shouted objections from the audience.\n\nIn a statement released shortly after the vote, Ms. Kaufax applauded the measure, calling it a way to \u201cprovide an environment which promotes equality where every student and employee is treated with dignity and respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe School Board has taken this proactive step to protect our students and staff from discrimination,\u201d Ms. Kaufax wrote.\n\nBut Ms. Schultz said that adding more and more protected classes to the policy would only create more problems.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s change the non-discrimination policy to two words: \u2018Don\u2019t discriminate,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Schultz said during her remarks before the vote to roaring applause.\n\nBoard member Megan McLaughlin defended the motion during the meeting, saying it was not a policy change but simply a policy update and said that school operations would not be affected.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re children are safe today, they were safe yesterday, and they will be safe tomorrow,\u201d she said.\n\nBoard member Ryan McElveen, who introduced the amendment, said that the amendment would simply set in stone the non-discrimination practices that are already being carried out by FCPS.\n\n\u201cThe truth is we already do not discriminate against gender identity in practice,\u201d Mr. McElveen said, adding that the amendment would reaffirm that practice.\n\n\u201cThen why change it?\u201d audience member shouted repeatedly.\n\nSome of the board members admitted that the district was mandated by the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights to add \u201cgender identity\u201d to the policy \u2014 or else risk losing federal funding.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has been very clear that they expect local schools to amend their policies,\u201d said John Foster, division counsel for FCPS.\n\nAlthough attendees overwhelming opposed the measure, some audience members supported the amendment and lauded it as a crucial first step towards protecting transgender students and faculty.\n\n\u201cWhat happened here tonight may be a big step in making sure that a whole other population doesn\u2019t have to get up in the morning fearing facing harassment,\u201d said Gordon Baer, a former FCPS student and current co-chairman of the Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) of Virginia.\n\nMr. Baer said that he understood that most people at the meeting were opposed to the board\u2019s sweeping implementation of the amendment but argued that setting firm gender identity language in the policy would provide a backing for the policy in practice.\n\nHowever, along with a multitude of other questions surround the amendment, the language itself isn\u2019t clear.\n\n\u201cThey did not even define gender identity. What does it mean?\u201d said Virginia Delegate Bob Marshall, who spoke against the measure in April.\n\nMs. Kaufax said FCPS will now hire a consultant to help develop regulations for the policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hundreds of parents and northern Virginia residents were outraged Thursday night when the Fairfax County Public School Board voted 10-1 with one abstaining to amend its nondiscrimination policy to include \"gender identity\" without consulting the parents and against the wishes of an overwhelming majority of audience members.", "Author": "Kellan Howell", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hundreds of parents and northern Virginia residents were outraged Thursday night when the Fairfax County Public School Board voted 10-1 with one abstaining to amend its nondiscrimination policy to include \u201cgender identity\u201d without consulting the parents and against the wishes of an overwhelming majority of audience members.", "title": "Outraged parents vow to take down school board over gender identity: \u2018We will remember in November\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/8/outraged-parents-vow-to-take-down-school-board-ove/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/07/transgender.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/07/transgender.jpg", "title": "Outraged parents vow to take down school board over gender identity: &", "description": "Hundreds of parents and northern Virginia residents were outraged Thursday night when the Fairfax County Public School Board voted 10-1 with one abstaining to amend its nondiscrimination policy to inc", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Tamara Derenak Kaufax, Fairfax County Public School Board"}, "article_summary": "SEE ALSO: School transgender rights bill passes in Fairfax County, Virginia\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d said Mychele Brickner, a former FCPS board member.\n\u201cThey did not even define gender identity.\n\u201cThe truth is we already do not discriminate against gender identity in practice,\u201d Mr. McElveen said, adding that the amendment would reaffirm that practice.\nThose who opposed the policy amendment said the board made the sweeping change too quickly without consulting parents and without studying the implications of such a change.\nHundreds of parents and northern Virginia residents were outraged Thursday night when the Fairfax County Public School Board voted 10-1 with one abstaining to amend its nondiscrimination policy to include \u201cgender identity\u201d without consulting the parents and against the wishes of an overwhelming majority of audience members."}
