Patients, meanwhile, are often not used to speaking up during the care process and tend to assume the doctor knows best. Recently, however, KHN reports that providers in several states, such as Massachusetts, Washington and Minnesota, have implemented programs to further two-way doctor-patient communication, according to the article.\n\nFor example, UC San Francisco (UCSF) distributes DVDs, pamphlets or links to patients explaining available treatment options, and doctors explain the benefits and risks of such options during appointments as well as soliciting information about patients' goals and priorities. The article said UCSF assigns college students or recent graduates to help patients compose lists of questions for their doctors, record the visits and take notes for the patients, ensuring they have an objective account of a visit that may leave them nervous or anxious, such as a cancer diagnosis.\n\n\"It's a massive cultural change,\" Glyn Elwyn, who researches shared decision-making at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, told Kaiser Health News. \"It's going from 'I'm the expert, take my recommendation' to 'I am going to inform you and respect your wishes.'\"\n\nIn an increasingly value-based healthcare industry, shared decision-making is an essential feature for hospitals hoping to make it to the \"second curve\" of healthcare, according to Paul Keckley, managing director at the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis, FierceHealthcare previously reported. Healthcare experts say mandatory remedial patient engagement training for doctors could improve patient engagement and encourage shared decision-making.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nShared decision-making, long-term goals essential to hospital success\n\nPatient engagement: Docs need more training on how to talk to patients\n\nHow providers can engage, empower patients\n\n4 pillars for physician engagement\n\nHealthcare systems fall short in physician engagement, docs report", "article_metadata": {"description": "More providers are open to\u00a0shared decision-making\u00a0after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which provides incentives for the practice,\u00a0according to\u00a0Kaiser Health News.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "More providers are open to\u00a0shared decision-making\u00a0after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which provides incentives for the practice,\u00a0according to\u00a0Kaiser Health News.", "title": "Post-ACA, more hospitals explore shared decision-making", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/post-aca-more-hospitals-explore-shared-decision-making/2015-03-16", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,communication,Kaiser Health News,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient engagement,patient-centered care,shared decision-making", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ff8\"", "article_summary": "Healthcare experts say mandatory remedial patient engagement training for doctors could improve patient engagement and encourage shared decision-making.\n\"It's a massive cultural change,\" Glyn Elwyn, who researches shared decision-making at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, told Kaiser Health News.\nMore providers are open to shared decision-making after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which provides incentives for the practice, according to Kaiser Health News.\nIn an increasingly value-based healthcare industry, shared decision-making is an essential feature for hospitals hoping to make it to the \"second curve\" of healthcare, according to Paul Keckley, managing director at the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\nHistorically, there has been reluctance among healthcare providers to cede control of the care process to patients without medical training and who may have obtained their information from dubious sources."}
