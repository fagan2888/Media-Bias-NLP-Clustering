But it turned out that he was throwing one deliberately deflated ball after another.\n\nThe president portrayed the economy in rosy terms \u2013 \u201cgrowing\u201d with \u201cbustling industry.\u201d This is based on the 11 million new private sector jobs created in the last five years. But wait a minute \u2013 hasn\u2019t Obama been president for six years? When we total his record, America has created fewer than 6.5 million new jobs, with a labor force participation of just over 62 percent \u2013 the lowest since the dog days of President Jimmy Carter.\n\n\u201cAt every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,\u201d the president said. \u201cInstead, we\u2019ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two thirds, a stock market that has doubled and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years.\u201d\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Barack Obama]\n\nYes, after years of anemic recovery, the last quarter finally registered strong growth. This year will probably (can you hear me knocking on my desk now?) be a good one for the economy. But we\u2019ll see what happens to health care inflation as more provisions of Obamacare take effect this year, and consumers are hit with explosive increases in insurance premiums. And cutting the deficit? It is still close to half a trillion dollars, on top of a total federal debt of almost $18 trillion, topping current U.S. annual gross domestic product.\n\nWhen one considers the deep structural problems our economy faces \u2013 unsustainable entitlement programs, a hideously complex tax code, a reliance on quantitative easing \u2013 it is clear that future growth is anything but guaranteed. That is, perhaps, the biggest problem with the president\u2019s speech. Some recent good numbers don\u2019t counter the pervasive sense that there is still something deeply, fundamentally not right with this economy.\n\nObama also took credit for things that he actively opposed. Take the domestic boom in oil and gas production that has created \u2013 along with energy gamesmanship from Saudi Arabia \u2013 astonishing levels of cheap energy. In Austin, Texas, where I live, it is not uncommon to see gasoline at $1.79 a gallon. In all, Obama noted, Americans are saving an average of $750 a year at the pump. The rise of cheap energy has also led to a manufacturing renaissance in much of America. All of which is welcome. But the president failed to spell out which of his policies brought about these benefits from an industry he regularly demonizes as \u201cdirty.\u201d\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nThe president was gimmicky at best \u2013 delusional at worst \u2013 on domestic policy. Consider his prime proposal, to make community college free to students. He offered few details, but such an Obama proposal would undoubtedly create yet another entitlement program, federalizing an educational sector that currently is mostly funded by counties and states. Such a program would eventually require its own bureau and federal seal, a building and a staff of government workers drafting more top-down rules for American education. In short, this administration seems poised to do for community colleges what it has achieved in the care of America\u2019s veterans.\n\nThe president was equally delusional on foreign policy, from Russia to the Middle East. Under his watch, the alienation of long-standing allies like Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia represents a huge reversal in America's clout in this dangerous region. On the Islamic State group, the president made it sound as if we\u2019re now in the last phase of a mopping up operation. Even as Obama spoke, Iranian-backed rebels were overrunning the presidential palace in Yemen, creating a new power vacuum with unforeseeable consequences.\n\n\n\n[MORE: Political Cartoons on Congress]\n\nTo be fair, every president cherry picks good numbers and touts limited successes. What was most painful about hearing this speech is what it could have been. Obama could have offered to give Republicans something they crave \u2013 a simplified tax code to spur productivity \u2013 in exchange for something you would think he\u2019d want, like a carbon tax. Obama could have promised to sign a bill authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline if Republicans would send him a measure on, say, sick leave. That would be the normal give-and-take of a president actively engaged in wringing everything he could get out of his last two years in office.\n\nInstead, this president began his relationship with a new Congress with one veto threat after another. He did, of course, promise to reach out to Republicans, to hear their ideas. But when has he ever listened to anyone? The most common complaint on Capitol Hill is how distant and unresponsive this president is \u2013 and that\u2019s from Democrats.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "The State of the Union Isn't What Barack Obama Says It Is", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "In his State of the Union address, the president demonstrated a disconnect with reality.", "title": "Obama's Imaginary World", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/mark-davis/2015/01/22/the-state-of-the-union-isnt-what-barack-obama-says-it-is", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/a4/2957504052f797f31c403810453808/media:aad1054086854970b90cbbaed2894796StateofUnion.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The State of the Union Isn't What Barack Obama Says It Is", "description": "In his State of the Union address, the president demonstrated a disconnect with reality.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Jan. 22, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Mark W.
