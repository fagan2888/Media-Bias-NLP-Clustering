Thousands of troops and tanks have been sent to crush pockets of resistance across mainly Kurdish districts, where PKK fighters and youth have set up trenches to keep them at bay. Flashpoints have been under a 24-hour curfew since mid-December.\n\nWhile there have been repeated clashes and long curfews since the collapse of peace talks in July, many in the region had hoped the talks would resume after a November election gave a decisive majority to the Justice and Development Party founded by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nInstead, the fighting has gotten worse.\n\n\u201cIf things continue like this, we will become just like Syria,\u201d says Mehmet Salih Bagata, a lawyer in the southeastern town of Cizre, the scene of the heaviest clashes and the highest reported fatalities since authorities stepped up military operations.\n\nThe leader of the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party, which made history when it entered parliament in June but lost seats in the November vote, has attempted to mediate the conflict with the PKK, repeatedly urging both sides to \u201csilence their arms.\u201d\n\nResidents of Cizre say they are fast running out of food and water, and rights abuses have been rife. Shops have been shuttered for 11 days as a result of the government curfew. The fighting means many are stranded at home or in basements and those in need of medical attention cannot reach hospitals.\n\n\u201cPeople are waiting and hoping for the peace process,\u201d said Cihan Sariyildiz, a pharmacist in Cizre.\n\nThe situation is similar in the southeastern town of Silopi, near the border with Syria and Iraq, where residents are struggling to survive the round-the-clock curfew, fighting and power cuts. One lawmaker said more than 11 civilians have been killed in Silopi since Dec. 14, when the curfew was imposed to aid security operations. She says the fighting is so intense that families are unable to bury their dead.\n\n\u201cThere are military tanks everywhere in Silopi but people are still living here,\u201d says Aycan Irmez, a lawmaker with the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party. \u201cWe cannot sleep day or night because of the constant shelling or gunfire.\u201d\n\nAnkara \u2014 along with the European Union and the United States \u2014 considers the PKK a terrorist organization. It fought a three-decade conflict with the rebels that killed tens of thousands of people and traumatized the nation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Turkish civilians stuck in urban war zone in southeast", "author": "Dominique Soguel and Suzan Fraser", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Turkish civilians stuck in urban war zone in southeast", "title": "Turkish civilians stuck in urban war zone in southeast", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/26/turkish_civilians_stuck_in_urban_war_zone_in_southeast/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/turkey-kurds.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Turkish civilians stuck in urban war zone in southeast", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/turkey-kurds.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Turkish civilians stuck in urban war zone in southeast", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Turkish civilians stuck in urban war zone in southeast", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It fought a three-decade conflict with the rebels that killed tens of thousands of people and traumatized the nation.\nOne lawmaker said more than 11 civilians have been killed in Silopi since Dec. 14, when the curfew was imposed to aid security operations.\nThe situation is similar in the southeastern town of Silopi, near the border with Syria and Iraq, where residents are struggling to survive the round-the-clock curfew, fighting and power cuts.\nTurkish security forces launched a large-scale operation last week hoping to rout militants linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Worker\u2019s Party, or PKK, and say more than 180 of them have been killed.\nThe fighting means many are stranded at home or in basements and those in need of medical attention cannot reach hospitals."}
