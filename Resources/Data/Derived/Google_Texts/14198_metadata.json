(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)\n\nSince he joined Twitter nearly a year and a half ago, horror novelist Stephen King has tweeted just more than 600 times. He tweets mostly about movies and TV shows and his dog, Molly. But every so often, he sounds off on politics.\n\nAbout 5 percent of King's tweets are political, ranging from the 2016 election to gun control. He has gone so political, in fact, that he felt the need to rule out a run for governor of Maine (his home state) a few weeks back.\n\nHere's some of his thoughts, many of which earned thousands of re-tweets:\n\nThe 2016 Republican field so far\n\nCruz, Paul and Rubio, all running for President. Hey, I thought I was supposed to write the horror stories. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) April 16, 2015\n\nIndiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act\n\nIndiana's Religious Freedom Restoration act is gay discrimination, pure and simple. You can frost a dog turd, but it's still a dog turd. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 31, 2015\n\nMaine taxes\n\nMaine Gov. Paul LePage (R) in March accused King, as well as former governor Ken Curtis (D) and Burt's Bees founder Roxanne Quimby, of leaving the state to avoid paying taxes. King said he did not and called for LePage to apologize. LePage did not apologize.\n\nGovernor Paul LePage implied that I don't pay my taxes. I do. Every cent. I think he needs to man up and apologize. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 20, 2015\n\nNo apology from Governor LePage. Some guys are a lot better at dishing it out than taking it back. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 22, 2015\n\nBrian Williams's suspension\n\nLittle lie? Brian Williams suspended. Big lie? G. Dubya gets his own presidential library. Moral: go big or go home. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) February 10, 2015\n\nBrian Williams: Suspended 6 months. George Dubya (\"Chemical weapons in Iraq--EEK!\") $200,000 per year in pension benefits. America, kids. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) February 11, 2015\n\nSexism in politics\n\nCould a woman of Chris Christie's size be taken seriously as a presidential candidate? Just asking, although I think I know the answer. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) January 16, 2014\n\nTed Cruz's appearance\n\nTo me, Ted Cruz looks like a revival preacher on late night cable. I guess they like that in Texas. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) February 9, 2015\n\nHe (Cruz) also has this SAD look, like those big-eyed waifs in the velvet paintings. Don't mean to rap on him, but it's a little weird. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) February 9, 2015\n\nThat thing where politicians put on coats or fleeces when giving press conferences on big winter storms\n\nI love it when politicians put on their \"storm clothes,\" like they're going to fire up a plow and work all night on the turnpike. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) January 27, 2015\n\nThe 114th Congress\n\n\"AMERICA'S NEW CONGRESS looks like the same old (expletive) to me.\"\n\nNegative ads\n\nBefore voting next week, why not make a list of the vilest negative ads and vote against those people, no matter what party. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) October 29, 2014\n\nIf a candidate approves or refuses to repudiate a vile negative ad, what kind of rep would he/she make, anyway? Smack 'em down. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) October 29, 2014\n\nThe tea party\n\nRevised Tea Party Gospel: \"Suffer the little children come unto me. Unless they're undocumented kids from Central America.\" \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) July 22, 2014\n\nGun control\n\nMultiple gunshot wounds last night at Red Rocks. We regulator booze and tobacco; it's time to regulate firearms. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) June 20, 2014\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\n\nHe doesn't seem to think Republicans have an actual alternative.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The increasingly political author mixes it up.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/hunter.schwarz?fref=ts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The increasingly political author mixes it up.", "title": "The scariest thing Stephen King tweets about is politics", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/21/the-scariest-thing-stephen-king-tweets-about-is-politics/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/31/Production/Daily/Style/Images/Maine_Governor_Stephen_King-03c27.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hunterschwarz"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/21/the-scariest-thing-stephen-king-tweets-about-is-politics/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Stephen King,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/hunter.schwarz?fref=ts"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Stephen King,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca02f\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) April 16, 2015Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration ActIndiana's Religious Freedom Restoration act is gay discrimination, pure and simple.\n\u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) October 29, 2014The tea partyRevised Tea Party Gospel: \"Suffer the little children come unto me.\n\u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) February 9, 2015He (Cruz) also has this SAD look, like those big-eyed waifs in the velvet paintings.\n\u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) February 11, 2015Sexism in politicsCould a woman of Chris Christie's size be taken seriously as a presidential candidate?\n\u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) January 27, 2015The 114th Congress\"AMERICA'S NEW CONGRESS looks like the same old (expletive) to me.\""}
