She called her daughter by name and told her she loved her. It was all caught on camera.\n\n\u201cMy 87-year-old mother with Alzheimer's knew who I was, even if it was for just a moment,\" Gunderson wrote in the YouTube video description. In the heart-warming video, Gunderson is lying beside her white-haired mother and tries to help her recognize her. \u201cDo you know you\u2019re my momma?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d the elderly woman replies. Gunderson, shocked, asks again, \u201cYou do? A while ago you said you didn\u2019t know you were my momma.\" For a little while, Gunderson\u2019s mom sounds confused. She tells her daughter that she acted like her mother, not appearing to comprehend that she was actually Gunderson\u2019s mother.\n\nGunderson goes on to explain that she was her momma and told her she would only lie down beside someone that she loved. Her mother seems to have understood her daughter, but her language is still a little unclear. Then, suddenly, the unexpected occurs: Gunderson\u2019s mother tells her daughter she loves her.\n\nGunderson was shocked and began to stutter and ask her mother, \u201cBut do you know who I am, though?\u201d And her mother responds, \"Uh-huh. Well, I love Kelly, and didn't I name you Kelly? Well, I love you, Kelly.\" Gunderson is an identical twin, so for her mother to remember her was very special, she wrote on YouTube.\n\nGunderson said she shared her video to encourage others who have loved ones battling Alzheimer's. It\u2019s the most common form of dementia and affects five million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWatch the miraculous moment below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alzheimer's, recognize, dementia, gift, miracle", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Kelly Gunderson witnessed a miracle: Her mother affected by Alzheimer's suddenly recognized her and told her she loved her.", "title": "The Moment A Mother With Alzheimer's Recognizes Her Daughter [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mother-alzheimers-disease-suddenly-remembers-her-daughter-again-i-love-you-kelly-300990", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/moment-mother-alzheimers-recognizes-her-daughter-video.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kelly Gunderson witnessed a miracle: Her mother affected by Alzheimer's suddenly recognized her and told her she loved her.", "title": "The Moment A Mother With Alzheimer's Recognizes Her Daughter [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mother-alzheimers-disease-suddenly-remembers-her-daughter-again-i-love-you-kelly-300990", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/moment-mother-alzheimers-recognizes-her-daughter-video.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/moment-mother-alzheimers-recognizes-her-daughter-video.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-03T16:18:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-03T16:18:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Kelly Gunderson witnessed a miracle: Her mother affected by Alzheimer's suddenly recognized her and told her she loved her."}, "article_summary": "She tells her daughter that she acted like her mother, not appearing to comprehend that she was actually Gunderson\u2019s mother.\nThen, suddenly, the unexpected occurs: Gunderson\u2019s mother tells her daughter she loves her.\n\u201cMy 87-year-old mother with Alzheimer's knew who I was, even if it was for just a moment,\" Gunderson wrote in the YouTube video description.\nIn the heart-warming video, Gunderson is lying beside her white-haired mother and tries to help her recognize her.\nA Georgia woman calls a precious moment with her mother \"God\u2019s gift.\u201d Kelly Gunderson\u2019s 87-year-old mother has Alzheimer's and couldn't remember who her daughter was, but miraculously, her memory was restored for a few minutes."}
