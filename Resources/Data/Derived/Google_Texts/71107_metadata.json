Most recently, he pledged to save Carroll County from an influx of small Guatemalans.\n\nAn even better nickname for Harris is Dr. Dolittle, because little of what he does is of consequence. He opposes the Affordable Care Act, though an estimated 70,000 people in his district will benefit from it. He even voted against emergency funding for the federal flood insurance program in the aftermath of superstorm Sandy, which caused flood damage to parts of his district on the Eastern Shore.\n\nHarris is a doctor, but apparently not a compassionate one. Maybe he should start his own organization as a conservative counterweight to rampant humanitarianism. He could call it Doctors With Borders, Medecins Avec Frontieres.\n\nHumanity faces its biggest refugee crisis since World War II, and Rep. Andy Harris, the Republican congressman from Maryland's 1st District, pledges to do everything in his power to keep a tiny fraction of Central American children out of a shelter in Carroll County.\n\nOf course, this idea never got off the ground. Federal officials had briefly considered using an abandoned Army Reserve Center outside Westminster to house some of the thousands of kids who have crossed the border to escape poverty, gang violence and human trafficking or to be reunited with their parents. Had this happened, the kids would have been confined for a time to the military facility, as far as we know, and would not have been playing futbol in the streets of the charming Carroll seat.\n\nEven so, there was Harris, pledging to keep the little people out, even though the Army Reserve Center is not within his district. \"These unaccompanied minors who have entered our nation illegally must not be brought to Carroll County,\" he said.\n\nDr. Dolittle wasn't alone in his opposition to the use of the Westminster facility. Some local officials joined him, and an unidentified hater spray-painted \"NO ILLEAGLES HERE NO UNDOCUMENTED DEMOCRATS\" on the wall of the center.\n\nGiven this, I suppose it made sense that Gov. Martin O'Malley advised the Obama administration against using the facility. Why introduce the children to another hostile environment?\n\nBut at the same time, I have to question the Obama administration's skittishness and its eager deference to disapproving Democrats more concerned about \"local reaction\" and the next election than about doing the right thing.\n\nThe Westminster Army Reserve Center is listed as \"available excess property\" by the General Services Administration. If this isn't good use of a vacant federal building, what is? And who cares that some local residents don't like it? They didn't pay for these places, we all did.\n\nOther proposed sites for shelters for the border kids have been rejected, too. In Michigan last week, some men carried rifles and handguns during a protest of a proposal to house Central American teenagers through a nonprofit that serves abused or neglected boys.\n\nToo many Americans are myopic and too quick to hate.\n\nThe world has its biggest refugee crisis in decades, and the sixth-wealthiest nation in the world can't muster enough political will and popular empathy to shelter even a fraction of them.\n\nThe United Nations reported Friday that the number of refugees, asylum-seekers and displaced people worldwide climbed again last year and exceeded 50 million. Such a level has not been seen since World War II.\n\nThe crisis is being driven mainly by war \u2014 the one in Syria, for example, where three years of civil violence has led to 2.5 million refugees and another 6.5 million people who have been \"internally displaced.\" Major new displacements are happening in Central African Republic, South Sudan and, most recently, in Iraq. As violence escalates in Gaza, Palestinian displacement has soared, and most of the besieged refugees cannot access asylum in another country.\n\nThe U.N. report said half of all refugees worldwide came from three countries: Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia.\n\nHalf of all refugees are children under 18 \u2014 not surprising, considering what we're seeing at the border of Mexico and the U.S.\n\nAre the children and young adults from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador refugees from dangerous conditions? Do they deserve asylum in the U.S.? One of the reasons for holding them here is to determine, by law, why they came.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-baltimoresun", "description": "Humanity faces its biggest refugee crisis since World War II, and Rep.
