From cheesy crab dip to juicy burgers, this list features what the serious football fans on Delmarva are eating on game day.\n\nSo if you plan on indulging in fruits and salads on NFL Sundays, this isn\u2019t the article for you.\n\nWings\n\nSome of the foods on this list are arguable. But chicken wings set the standard for football munchies.\n\nThey come in a variety of flavors and pair extremely well with an ice cold beer.\n\nWings are usually available at any restaurant with the game on. And any wing-lover knows the more you order, the cheaper they are. They\u2019re even simple enough to make at home \u2014 just soak them in your favorite marinating sauce and toss them on the grill.\n\nBut just like the Cleveland Browns\u2019 offense, chicken wings are often sloppy, so have plenty of wet naps available.\n\nNachos\n\nLoaded chicken nachos.

Something thick and hearty.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrab dip, however, is always a solid choice \u2014 no matter the season.\u201d\n\nFrom rich and creamy to thick and meaty \u2014 even decadent and cheesy \u2014 dips are a must-have for game time fare. Just be sure you don\u2019t double dip; at least not when people are watching.\n\nPizza\n\nBuy Photo Cheesesteak pie from Taste of South Philly.

And fancier bars and sports dives will usually offer different sizes: individual, medium or large enough to split with all of your buddies.\n\nBurgers\n\nA double American cheeseburger topped with bacon and a fried egg.

It\u2019s the ultimate hand-held food \u2014 it doesn\u2019t even require a paper plate, let alone cutlery.\n\nThe sheer density of the meat ensures a full stomach, while the veggies are stuffed right in there with everything else, saving you precious time so you can get back to cheering on your team.\n\nhcarroll2@dmg.gannett.com\n\n302-537-1881, ext. 209\n\nOn Twitter @hcarroll_1\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/entertainment/2015/09/20/popular-football-eats/72522652/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Some serious football fans share their most favorite game-time munchies.", "og": {"site_name": "Delmarva Daily Times", "description": "Some serious football fans share their most favorite game-time munchies.", "title": "Top 5 football foods", "url": "http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/entertainment/2015/09/20/popular-football-eats/72522652/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delmarvanow.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some serious football fans share their most favorite game-time munchies.", "title": "Top 5 football foods", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/db89d2e4e5f6ae4d02b209f672016f56bf05e9af/c=598-0-2977-2379&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/20/Salisbury/B9318860383Z.1_20150920141936_000_GC4BVH5E6.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyDelmarvaNow", "site": "@MyDelmarvaNow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=858745131", "fb": {"app_id": 179822335370394}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "football eats, football food, foodie, burgers, nachos, pizza, wings, chips and dips, crab dip, ocean city, maryland, delaware, sussex"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35f9\"", "article_summary": "Watching football while eating delicious, calorie-packed foods, of course.\nBut chicken wings set the standard for football munchies.\nFrom cheesy crab dip to juicy burgers, this list features what the serious football fans on Delmarva are eating on game day.\nBut just like the Cleveland Browns\u2019 offense, chicken wings are often sloppy, so have plenty of wet naps available.\n\u201cAnd pizza is delicious.\u201dPractically every pizza joint on game day features football deals and specials."}
