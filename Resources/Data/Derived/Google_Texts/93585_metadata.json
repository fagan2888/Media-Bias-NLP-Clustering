Kirkpatrick/Getty Images\n\nFive years ago, when Sen. Barack Obama was running for president, he\u2019d occasionally be confronted with the media\u2019s all-purpose stumper for liberals. What, a host or moderator would ask, would you do to tackle entitlements? Obama would say whatever he needed to say.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cWe're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly,\u201d he promised in his second debate with Sen. John McCain. \u201cWe're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do it in my first term as president.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s first two years in office were defined by the Affordable Care Act, which actually did cut the rate of growth in Medicare spending. (Democrats were reminded of that in countless campaign ads.) But \u201centitlement reform,\u201d as defined in Washington, meant much more. After Republicans won the House of Representatives, with polls showing voters panicking about the national debt, the president used his 2011 State of the Union address to endorse \u201ca bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations.\u201d During the long, hot, pathetic summer of the debt limit, the president proposed a change in the formula that determined Social Security benefits. Just this year, his budget offered up that tweak\u2014one that would shrink checks for millions of people\u2014as a sop to Republicans. Even Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he was \u201cencouraged.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut now, look at the Budget Conference Committee\u2019s two-year plan\u2014or \u201cthe Murray\u2013Ryan plan,\u201d as the gods of brief headlines have dubbed it. It restores some of the money cut by sequestration, and it makes federal employees put up more of their own money for their pensions. It doesn\u2019t even scratch entitlements. Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan has made a chipper (and seemingly successful) pitch to conservatives about how the deal tackles \u201cautomatic spending,\u201d but that\u2019s rhetorical taekwondo, an attempt to put $12 billion of pension savings on the level of trillion-dollar entitlements.\n\nOn Wednesday, as Ryan sold the plan to Republicans, the old \u201cdebt crisis\u201d rhetoric that defined 2011 and 2012 had vanished completely. Republicans had spent most of 2013 calling sequestration a win for the party, something that cut the deficit and gave them \u201cleverage\u201d for the next rounds of talks. That was the point of sequestration, that its general offensiveness would force both parties back to long-term spending negotiations, and that the entitlement state would take a hit.\n\nAnd then the budget negotiated by Ryan actually blew through the $967 billion sequestration spending cap for the next fiscal year. Oh, well.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to go in with a scalpel than it is cutting across the board,\u201d suggested Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, a class of 2010 Tea Partier who often votes against bipartisan deals. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what people are starting to realize. If what you\u2019re doing actually gets to a better means of cutting spending down the road, that\u2019s something to consider.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIf, then, maybe later\u2014but didn\u2019t Republicans get a chance at actual entitlement cuts, then blow it? Back in 2011, when they had Obama on the ropes, couldn\u2019t they have gotten a Democratic president to swing the ax at Social Security? Remember how S&P downgraded America\u2019s credit rating because \u201cthe fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the Administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics\u201d? Couldn\u2019t they have gotten more than that?\n\nThey choose not to think so. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the White House ever agreed to that,\u201d said Louisiana Rep. John Fleming, after being pitched on the Ryan\u2013Murray budget. \u201cI believe that was a bait and switch. [Obama\u2019s] famous for this\u2014remember how the discussion with Boehner broke down? He would throw things on the table, and then, when we would grab them, he\u2019d back away from them.\u201d\n\nTennessee Rep. Diane Black, another class of 2010 member, was one of the more conservative Republicans in the Ryan\u2013Murray budget conference. Social Security cuts, she said, were indeed, sort of, \u201con the table\u201d before the talks started.\n\n\u201cBut you probably saw that even before we had our first meeting, Democrats were saying they wouldn\u2019t even support their own president and consider it,\u201d said an exasperated Black. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Democrats out there saying there\u2019s a nuclear option here\u2014they wouldn\u2019t even talk about it!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBlack wasn\u2019t saying it explicitly, but in this version of the story the parties had reversed their roles in the \u201cnarrative.\u201d The Republicans\u2014Paul Ryan especially\u2014were bravely compromising to keep the government running and end the era of Dec. 31 kludge-o-matic deals. The Democrats, they were the intransigent ones, the short-sighted deal-killers.\n\nThe Democrats will proudly wear that label, at least when it comes to Social Security. Yes, the most progressive members of the party had sworn not to support a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d or sequestration fix that cut Social Security. They\u2019ll tell you they were proven right.\n\n\u201cThe people that say \u2018we need to deal with entitlements\u2019 are the ones who want to cut Social Security,\u201d said Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who\u2019s been arguing that Social Security needs to be expanded. \u201cI just think there\u2019s no appetite to do that on the Democratic side. Fundamentally, the debate should be on retirement security, not on how we use retirement security to deal with budget issues. I know Social Security can be fixed long term, pretty easily, because we can predict the costs. A lot of Democrats are now understanding that we should have a debate about Social Security, not the budget. If the debate\u2019s about Social Security, we win.\u201d\n\nAnd they did win. At a Wednesday forum put on by the Heritage Foundation, eight conservative members of Boehner\u2019s conference took turns explaining why the Democrats had crushed them. \u201cUntil today, I thought Republicans were going to hold the line on the sequester,\u201d said Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador. \u201cDemocrats realized they were right all along, that we were never going to hold the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, we got beat,\u201d said South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the votes. Our opening position was the law [of sequestration caps]. Their opening position is to break the law. When those are the two starting positions, the compromise will be to break the law.\u201d\n\nNow that they\u2019ve lost, what\u2019s the future of that entitlement reform President Obama keeps saying he\u2019s ready for?
