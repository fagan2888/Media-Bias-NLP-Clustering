That\u2019s a drop of five percentage points since February.\n\n\u201cIt is too early to know if this modest decline is an anomaly or the beginning of a reversal or leveling off in attitudes towards gay marriage after years of steadily increasing public acceptance,\u201d Pew noted.\n\nForty-seven percent of respondents said that businesses should be allowed to refuse to provide wedding services for same-sex couples for religious reasons, while 49 percent believe they should be required to provide these services.\n\nAlso, 62 percent of Democrats said their party had done a \u201cgood job\u201d on the issue of gay marriage, compared to 34 percent of Republicans.\n\nAnd 65 percent said they thought hat gays and lesbians \u201cface a lot of discrimination in the U.S. today.\u201d\n\nRyan Anderson, the William E. Simon Fellow in Religion and a Free Society at The Heritage Foundation, is not surprised by the results of the poll.\n\n\u201cThe argument in support of marriage as the union of a man and woman hasn\u2019t been heard and rejected; it simply hasn\u2019t been heard,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cBut when it is heard, people respond accordingly.
