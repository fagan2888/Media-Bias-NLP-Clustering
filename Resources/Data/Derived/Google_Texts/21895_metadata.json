Of eight people involved, only one had to be transported to the hospital, and that person has non-life-threatening injuries, according to officials.\n\nAt the Cortaro off ramp, for a short time traffic was being routed off the freeway, down the frontage road, and back on again via the Cortaro on ramp, according to Capt. Brian Keeley, spokesman for the Northwest Fire District.\n\nThe first crash involved three cars and five people, he said. Of those, three were not injured, one was treated at the scene but declined transport, and one was transported with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe second crash, which according to the Department of Public Safety information office happened in the backup from the first crash, also involved three vehicles and included a rolled vehicle and three people, none of whom were injured, according to Keeley.\n\nThe two crashes happened around 10 a.m., according to DPS.\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
