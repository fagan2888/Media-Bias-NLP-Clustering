(Photo: Courtesy photo)\n\nA woman came into the Council on Aging office last May requesting assistance with paying for medical bills totaling in excess of $50,000. How did this happen?\n\nShe was enrolled in Medicare Part A (which pays hospital bills) but never signed up for Part B coverage, which pays doctor\u2019s services, lab work and X-rays as well as other benefits. She did not expect she would ever need those services as she was always healthy and never smoked or drank alcoholic beverages.\n\nThen the unexpected happened when she was diagnosed with cancer and began the long road to recovery and expensive treatments. She needed additional coverage immediately but the rules did not care \u2014 she would have to wait for the general enrollment period next January, and coverage would not begin until the next July, 14 months away.\n\nMeanwhile, she would continue to incur tens of thousands of dollars of medical expenses for which she will be responsible. In addition to the medical bills, there will be a large late enrollment penalty which she will have to pay every month for the rest of her life.\n\nUnusual situation? Unfortunately, no. As Medicare counselors through the NC Seniors\u2019 Health Insurance Information Program (SHIIP), we often see situations like this, as well as those where beneficiaries fail to sign up for prescription drug coverage with similar consequences. Individuals who seldom needed a prescription drug suddenly find themselves having to pay $3,000-$5,000 or more for medications per month. There is often a waiting period to sign up for coverage and they will have to pay a penalty every month for the rest of their lives.\n\nMedicare provides good coverage for medical expenses and prescription drugs. It is important to remember that Medicare is an insurance program and, like any insurance, there are rules that must be followed to participate in the program. Failure to follow the rules can result in a loss of coverage or permanent penalties with significant out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe SHIIP program, sponsored by the NC Department of Insurance, is one of the most robust Medicare information programs in the nation. This program is designed to help people through the Medicare enrollment process and assist them with the many decisions that must be made in an unbiased way and at no cost to the consumer. It also provides follow-up services to help seniors use their benefits effectively and review their choices annually. SHIIP counselors can help beneficiaries avoid these costly mistakes and penalties.\n\nMedicare is not a free program. Most beneficiaries paid into the Medicare Trust Fund while they were working, which means they prepaid their health insurance premium over 30-40 years for hospital coverage. They also pay income tax as well as a premium for the Part B (physician services) and Part D (prescription drugs) coverage, which means they continue to pay, in part, for the Medicare insurance coverage. For beneficiaries who cannot afford the premiums, financial assistance is available.\n\nThe Council on Aging of Buncombe County is a designated agency helping people navigate the complex rules of both Medicare and health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trained volunteers and staff provide this service in both Buncombe and Henderson counties through contracts with the Department of Insurance and a navigator grant through Legal Aid of North Carolina. The information provided is free, confidential and unbiased, as no insurance policies are sold or companies, agents or brokers endorsed.\n\nMedicare information classes are offered frequently in Buncombe and Henderson counties at various locations (see box). The classes are free and open to the public. Registration is requested and can be done easily at the Council on Aging of Buncombe County website or by calling our office at 828-277-8288.\n\nIndividual appointments can be made in Buncombe County by calling this same number and in Henderson County by calling the Pardee Signature Care Center at 828-692-4600.\n\nJohn Wingerter is director of Health Insurance Information Services at the Council on Aging of Buncombe County.
