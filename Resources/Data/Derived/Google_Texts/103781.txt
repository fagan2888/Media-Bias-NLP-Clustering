The Nigerian government is chiding Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for joking that the country’s email scammers are perpetrating Obamacare website difficulties.

Cruz said Monday at a town hall meeting in his home state that the online fraudsters could be behind the widespread tech problems.

“The comment was totally uncalled for,” Nigerian Ambassador to the U.S. Prof. Ade Adefuye told the Daily News by phone from his office in Nigeria.

“Nigerians feel insulted by that sort of comment,” he continued, adding that the embassy has received calls from Nigerian residents in the U.S. and from other African embassies appalled by the perceived cultural insensitivity.

The Nigerian government has “nothing to do with Obamacare,” the diplomat added.

Adefuye has mailed a letter to Cruz’s Capitol Hill office, demanding the Texas firebrand apologize for the remark.

He is hopeful Cruz will be a “gentleman” and comply.

Cruz’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

The ambassador added that online fraud schemes attributed to the country have greatly decreased thanks to enhanced online security measures undertaken by his government.

He added that he is happy that the congressional showdown that shut down the government and launched vitriol from both sides of the aisle is now over.

“We wish America well,” he added.
