PHOENIXVILLE, Pa., (CBS) – An open house was held in Phoenixville at a facility that offers free medical care to those who need it.

The Clinic, a freestanding facility for uninsured and underinsured individuals in Phoenixville, hosted an open house to let folks know about their wide array of free medical services.

“There’s people who really need our help in the medical community. People who obviously can’t afford to buy insurance even with the Affordable Care Act; people who are down in the dumps or are literally just having a bad time in their life. It strikes at my cord because these are the people who need us the most,” said Dr. George Spyropoulos, medical director of the clinic.

He says statistics show there are 40,000 uninsured people in Chester County alone.

“And people who are served by our clinic specifically, we may be able to help those people who fall through the cracks,” said Dr. Spyropoulos.
