Ashley is not her real name. We are protecting her identity for her security.\n\nShe\u2019s come a long way from when she and a few other women traveled to many states with a sex trafficker who controlled their every move.\n\n\u201cPretty much been all over the east coast mainly Washington DC, and the Atlanta area. I\u2019ve been to Virginia, and Maryland, Delaware, and Philadelphia, New Jersey, New York, all over Georgia, Birmingham, New Orleans,\u201d Ashley said.\n\nShe said human trafficking is not a third world issue, not a poverty issue. She came from a good home with two parents and had everything she needed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it could happen, nobody did. This is something they don\u2019t talk about to us in school and my parents didn\u2019t really pay attention to what I was doing they didn\u2019t track my every movement, they trusted me,\u201d she said.\n\nAshley says she met her trafficker one day while skipping school at a fast food place just a block from campus. He made small talk, asked for directions. She said it was like he smelled her vulnerability. She has two parents, but they weren\u2019t always emotionally present and he had the right clothes, the right car, everything she thought she wanted; she felt wanted and became infatuated.\n\nAshley says she was groomed by the man, and before she knew it he controlled everything: her phone, what she wore, what she ate, where she went. He drugged her when she didn\u2019t behave.\n\nAshley said she lived this life for about two years. She remembers the exact moment nine months ago when enough was enough. She had just arrived to Orlando.\n\n\u201cI just felt drained I felt depressed, like who am I? I\u2019m standing out on the balcony of a hotel and I was like if I jump would I die right now? Who would care, who would even notice I was gone? I got down on my knees and I prayed, I prayed to God. I said I cannot do this anymore something has got to give,\u201d Ashley said.\n\nShe had a card in her bag with a number to a human trafficking hotline. She called and within 30 minutes, help arrived. Ashley now has a safe place to stay through ConnectCity, a program that partners with Northland Church and provides residential space for up to 10 women at a time at an undisclosed location. Ashley is now getting trauma therapy, buying her own groceries, and calls her family once a week.\n\nAccording to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline, Florida ranks third in the number of calls, trailing just California and Texas.\n\nBut officials say it can be hard to prosecute cases for adult women where proof of force, fraud or coercion is needed. Abigail Mills manages 121 Hope, an anti-trafficking ministry at Northland Church. She said more safe homes are needed for women transitioning out of human trafficking in central Florida.\n\n\u201cIn Seminole County, ConnectCity is the only residential program for survivors of trafficking, so there\u2019s a huge need for more of these residential facilities that have proper training and trauma-informed care, how to specifically care for trafficking victims,\u201d said Mills.\n\nAshley said the program changed her life. She said she wants to go to school, get a job, to become a productive member of society. She has a message for anyone going through what she went through.\n\n\u201cThere is hope. There are people out there that care, there are people out there that are ready to love you the right way. God does love you, you\u2019ve made a mistake, you\u2019re not a bad person and it will be OK,\u201d Ashley said.\n\nShe wants to go to beauty school and one day, she says, she would like to take over this very program that saved her life.\n\nCrystal Chavez is a reporter for WMFE in Orlando.
