Jeb Bush (R) faced a competitive election was literally 20 years ago. After winning an easy primary in 1994, Jeb took on incumbent Gov. Lawton Chiles (D) and lost \u2013 in a year when nearly every Republican in America won big.\n\nBush tried again four years later, and he won two terms without much trouble, but in campaign politics, politicians who hone their skills on the trail and on the stump have an advantage over those who don\u2019t. In Jeb\u2019s case, the former governor simply doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to persevere through a tough primary \u2013 or eke out a win in a spirited general election \u2013 because he\u2019s never had to do it.\n\nClose video Jeb Bush caught in conflict over Cuba embargo Rachel Maddow reports on how Jeb Bush, fresh off the starting line of a presidential bid, suffered embarrassment after grandstanding in support of the embargo of Cuba when it was revealed that he was being paid by a bank that violated that embargo. embed like save share group out of his presidential stumbling blocks. stumbles a little out of his presidential stumbling blocks.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush blasted the Obama administration\u2019s decision to normalize relations with Cuba in a Facebook post Wednesday, but in an example of why Bush\u2019s ties to private equity and Barclays could provide fodder for opponents and critics, Barclays (which reportedly pays Bush more than a million dollars a year) had to settle criminal charges for violating sanctions that included Cuba.\n\nSoon after, reports indicated that Bush will abandon his paid advisory position at Barclays in two weeks.\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s good to get problems like these out of the way now, and it\u2019s wise for Bush to take steps to address pitfalls before the campaign begins in earnest, but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s fully prepared to defend himself against controversies like these. Didn\u2019t he and his team see this coming before going after President Obama\u2019s breakthrough announcement?\n\nIn related news, Nate Silver asked a question the other day that\u2019s on the mind of many campaign watchers.\n\n[I]s Bush in the mold of Jon Huntsman and Rudy Giuliani \u2013 candidates who generated lots of buzz among the East Coast media elite but proved too moderate for the Republican base? Or is he more like the past two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, who also were accused of being too moderate but won their party\u2019s nomination?\n\nLike Nate, I think it\u2019ll be easier to answer that question in the coming months, when we get a better sense of Bush\u2019s platform and rivals, but it\u2019s probably worth pausing to note that Bush is a climate denier who opposes marriage equality and wants to destroy the Affordable Care Act \u2013 and when it comes to the contemporary Republican Party, he\u2019s the \u201cmoderate\u201d of the GOP field.\n\nWhether or not that derails his chances remains to be seen, but again, I think it may very well matter that Jeb Bush has no practical experience winning a competitive Republican primary.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A candidate who doesn't know what it's like to persevere through a tough primary - or eke out a general election win - is at a disadvantage.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/jeb-bushs-challenges-quickly-becoming-apparent", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "A candidate who doesn't know what it's like to persevere through a tough primary - or eke out a general election win - is at a disadvantage.", "title": "Jeb Bush's challenges quickly becoming apparent", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/jeb-bushs-challenges-quickly-becoming-apparent", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/was8881626_copy.jpg?itok=leTKQbeZ", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/jeb-bushs-challenges-quickly-becoming-apparent", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/was8881626_copy.jpg?itok=sNgJfJZP", "title": "Jeb Bush's challenges quickly becoming apparent", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A candidate who doesn't know what it's like to persevere through a tough primary - or eke out a general election win - is at a disadvantage."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-18T11:38:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Jeb Bush's challenges quickly becoming apparent", "tags": "election-2016,elections,jeb-bush,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "12/18/2014 11:38:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/jeb-bushs-challenges-quickly-becoming-apparent"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "A candidate who doesn't know what it's like to persevere through a tough primary - or eke out a general election win - is at a disadvantage.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Elections, Election 2016, Jeb Bush"}, "article_summary": "Jeb Bush (R) faced a competitive election was literally 20 years ago.\nWhether or not that derails his chances remains to be seen, but again, I think it may very well matter that Jeb Bush has no practical experience winning a competitive Republican primary.\nAfter winning an easy primary in 1994, Jeb took on incumbent Gov.\nLawton Chiles (D) and lost \u2013 in a year when nearly every Republican in America won big.\nIn related news, Nate Silver asked a question the other day that\u2019s on the mind of many campaign watchers."}
