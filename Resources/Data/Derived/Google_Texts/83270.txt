Five people were injured, two critically, after someone opened fire on a party bus in Tennessee on New Year's Day.

Police told WMC-TV (http://bit.ly/1wGQsGE) the bus was parked at a club early Thursday in Memphis when someone on the bus got into a verbal altercation with someone at the club. The bus driver got everyone back on the bus and left the club, but the bus was followed by two vehicles.

The driver told police he was on Interstate 240 when one of the vehicles pulled up beside the bus. A second vehicle then pulled in front of the bus and started slowing down.

When the bus changed lanes, someone in the first vehicle started shooting.

There were 19 people on the bus, and five were hit by the gunfire.
