The technical problems in the MNSure system have been so constant and intractable that even Governor Mark Dayton, an enthusiastic backer of ObamaCare, has been forced to publicly criticize the agency for its performance. Unlike the Obama administration, where the same people who produced the failure are in charge of fixing it, MNSure\u2019s leadership got forced out \u2026 after returning from vacation:\n\nThe embattled director of the state\u2019s fledgling health insurance exchange resigned Tuesday amid mounting criticism of her leadership and the troubled rollout of the new health care program. MNsure executive director April Todd-Malmlov left her $136,000-a-year post during a closed-door meeting with the program\u2019s executive committee. The board named Scott Leitz, the state\u2019s assistant commissioner of health care, to the newly created position of interim CEO while it conducts a national search for a permanent chief executive. \u2026 The outrage over Todd-Malmlov intensified following revelations that she and state Medicaid director James Golden took a nearly two-week tropical vacation late last month, even as the program was swamped with problems. According to Star Tribune records, the two live together and have had worked closely on the implementation of the new exchange.\n\nIf that arrangement sounds a little questionable, then Scott Leitz\u2019 appointment should raise eyebrows, too. KSTP reported in October that the state opened an investigation into Leitz after issuing an illegal exemption in a backroom deal with a major health care provider:\n\nFairview\u2019s Amplatz Children\u2019s Hospital was facing Medicaid cuts as part of a plan to save money in the program. But, according to the investigation, DHS employees grew concerned when Assistant Commissioner Leitz met with Fairview officials and agreed to exempt Amplatz from the Medicaid cuts because it is a children\u2019s hospital. Investigative notes from the complaint indicate that over four years Amplatz could receive as much as $17.9 million from the State and Feds for a combined $35.8 million. The DHS investigation says \u201cit does not appear that DHS\u2019 decision to give Amplatz retroactive exemption from the 10 percent (Medicaid) rate reduction was consistent with the law.\u201d The whistle blowers contend in the complaint that Amplatz doesn\u2019t qualify for the exemption from the Medicaid rate cut because it is not a licensed, stand-alone children\u2019s hospital and it does not meet minimum requirements for treating a certain percentage of patients from low-income families. Duluth\u2019s St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital and Mayo\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital are similar to Amplatz and do not receive the Medicaid exemption, according the complaint.\n\nThe initial investigation\u2019s conclusions recommended immediate action on two allegations and a deeper investigation on three more. So far, there\u2019s no word on whether MDHS has done anything about Leitz, but MNSure\u2019s endorsement isn\u2019t exactly a ringing clarion call for excellence and judgment, to say the least.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Replaced by a target of an investigation?", "title": "MNSure director forced out after taking vacation while ObamaCare burned", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/18/mnsure-director-forced-out-after-taking-vacation-while-obamacare-burned/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-18T15:41:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-18T15:53:09+00:00"}, "keywords": "corruption, Minnesota, MNSure, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb25c\"", "article_summary": "Duluth\u2019s St. Mary\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital and Mayo\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital are similar to Amplatz and do not receive the Medicaid exemption, according the complaint.\nMNSure director forced out after taking vacation while ObamaCare burnedposted at 10:41 am on December 18, 2013 by Ed MorrisseyMinnesota\u2019s ObamaCare exchange hasn\u2019t attracted a lot of attention, except for its strange ad campaign and a jaw-dropping security breach this autumn, but MNSure hasn\u2019t exactly distinguished itself as a success, either.\n\u2026 The outrage over Todd-Malmlov intensified following revelations that she and state Medicaid director James Golden took a nearly two-week tropical vacation late last month, even as the program was swamped with problems.\nMNsure executive director April Todd-Malmlov left her $136,000-a-year post during a closed-door meeting with the program\u2019s executive committee.\nThe technical problems in the MNSure system have been so constant and intractable that even Governor Mark Dayton, an enthusiastic backer of ObamaCare, has been forced to publicly criticize the agency for its performance."}
