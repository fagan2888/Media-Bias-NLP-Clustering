Wednesday at the White House press briefing press secretary Josh Earnest laughed as he denied reports that a particularly large order of the specific green paper only used to print print green cards by the Department of Homeland Security is to increase the number of green cards printed.

CBS chief White House correspondent Major Garrett replied, “Don’t be absurd with us,” as he broke down Earnest laughing attempt to claim the estimated order for raw material to produce as many as 34,000,000 cards is irrelevant to the President’s planed executive order granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants already living in the Untied States.

When Earnest tried to claim the story was “crazy,” Garrett insisted, “No it’s not,” adding, “It’s not unconnected to the underlying policy, OK. If the president has said that I’m going to do this and there is a mechanism by which it can be achieved once the executive order can be put in commission, suddenly there is a contract to print more of them, why is it not just obvious, that seems to be related.”
