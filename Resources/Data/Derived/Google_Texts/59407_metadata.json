By the time the public becomes aware of it, the Internet will already belong to Obama.\n\n\u201cQuickly and quietly\u201d, high-handed Barack Obama and the Democrats are working on hijacking the Information Highway. ( Canada Free Press , Feb. 12, 2015)\n\nObama calls his takeover of the public\u2019s most reliable means of communication, \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d. But in reality, it\u2019s an overnight Hijacking of the common man\u2019s Information Highway.\n\nIn fact, when all regulations from Obama\u2019s 332-page book of \u2018Net Neutrality\u2019 are in place, only governments and terrorists will be free to blog and post.\n\nAverage citizens who depend on the Internet to get their message out will be \u2018regulated\u2019 off beginning three days from now, but ISIS which recruits new members from off the \u2018Net will continue to send its threats and gruesome YouTubes online.\n\nBarack Obama is knocking all little people in civil society off the Information Highway\u2014but leaving the coast clear for all Islamic terrorists.\n\n\u201cSuffering in silence with no means of communication to others is exactly what Obama wants on his mission for his ever-expanding \u2018Fundamental Transformation of the Free West\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn fact, after Feb. 26, stories such as this one will never be able to find their way to you.\n\n\u201cThis is a massive power grab and government at its worst,\u201d FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai told talk show host Mark Levin last week.\n\nFCC members like Pai have been ordered to stay mum on the 332-page Obama plan that changes forever the average Joe\u2019s access to the Worldwide Net.\n\n\u201cIf I get in trouble, so be it,\u201d Pai told Levin. \u201cCommunity organizers running governments always hide their dirty tricks behind innocuous sounding names. ObamaCare was first the Affordable Health Care Act. Hijacking the Information Highway sounds so much less lethal when it\u2019s introduced to the masses as \u2018Net Neutrality\u2019. (CFP) \u201cThe Federal Elections Commission (FEC) getting to regulate every word by popular major news outlets like Drudge is only one side of the government grab. \u201cNot everybody who tweets, blogs or shares their views on social media is a potential enemy of the state. Millions use the \u2018Net to keep in touch with loved ones stationed at lonely military posts; to stay up to date with children living on college campuses away from home and for keeping distant grandparents in the family loop. \u201cObama\u2019s takeover of the Internet will keep families from reaching out online to loved ones by making internet access unaffordable to them. Pai warns, \u201cFirst, the claim that President Obama\u2019s plan to regulate the Internet does not include rate regulation is flat-out false.\u201d\n\nYou never did get to keep the doctor you liked, or the health care insurance you chose.\n\nYou can apply the same outcome for your internet server.\n\nEver since being elected president, Obama\u2019s style has been one of neutralizing and neutering.\n\n\u2018Neutralizing\u2019 is the polite description Obama counts on the mainstream media to get across to the public at large on his patent refusal to identify Islamic terrorism for what it is.\n\n\u2018Neutralize\u2019 is what Marxist Obama has tried to do to all resisters to his destructive policies.\n\n\u2018Neutralization\u2019 is the ultimate state he intends for all Christians, TEA Party members, constitution lovers, second amendment advocates after they\u2019ve been thoroughly smeared as bible thumpers, domestic terrorists, bigots and racists by his friends in the mainstream media.\n\n\u2018Neutering\u2019 is what Obama is now trying to do to legions of civilians who depend on the Internet as their main means of communication. This kind of neutering, in effect, \u2018neuters\u2019 the typing fingers of all Internet users.\n\nForget NSA, the FBI the CIA, and all warnings sent by Edward Snowden. They\u2019ve got nothing on how Net Neutrality will silence you\n\nSome day in the near future when you type in the words \u201cIslamic terrorists\u201d in an Internet post, you will be knocked off the Net and find it all but impossible to climb back on again.\n\nForget NSA, the FBI the CIA, and all warnings sent by Edward Snowden. They\u2019ve got nothing on how Net Neutrality will silence you.\n\nInundate your senators, congressmen and representatives with messages demanding to keep Internet access free to the masses.\n\nOut-twitter and out-Facebook ISIS. The public at large, who outnumber the terrorists, should find this an easy mission.\n\nFight Obama\u2019s dangerous Net Neutrality with every ounce of energy you have.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Neutralize Obama\u2019s  Hijacking of the Internet, ISIS, Net Neutrality, FCC, Obama,", "og": {"description": "Neutralize Obama\u2019s  Hijacking of the Internet, ISIS, Net Neutrality, FCC, Obama,", "title": "Neutralize Obama\u2019s  Hijacking of the Internet"}, "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "7 days", "keywords": "Neutralize Obama\u2019s  Hijacking of the Internet, ISIS, Net Neutrality, FCC, Obama,", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce34e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cObama\u2019s takeover of the Internet will keep families from reaching out online to loved ones by making internet access unaffordable to them.\nFight Obama\u2019s dangerous Net Neutrality with every ounce of energy you have.\nHijacking the Information Highway sounds so much less lethal when it\u2019s introduced to the masses as \u2018Net Neutrality\u2019.\n( Canada Free Press , Feb. 12, 2015)Obama calls his takeover of the public\u2019s most reliable means of communication, \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d.\nIn fact, when all regulations from Obama\u2019s 332-page book of \u2018Net Neutrality\u2019 are in place, only governments and terrorists will be free to blog and post."}
