Once the study began, it would then have 15 months to turn in its findings. S.134 has been approved by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which not coincidentally Rockefeller chairs, and it is currently waiting to be brought to the Senate floor for a vote.\n\nThe legislation sounds reasonable enough, but there is a reason Activision Blizzard, the Entertainment Consumers Association, and the Entertainment Software Association have all decided to get involved.\n\nPoliticians have this thing when it comes to introducing bills. When they tie their name to a piece of legislation, it sticks with them like an anchor. That legislation can be used as a platform for re-election, or a weapon against them depending on how the bill is received. A bill may say that it wants to feed a thousand puppies. Who doesn\u2019t want to save puppies, right? The politician that introduced the bill may have a kid in the puppy food business making it a corrupt bill, but if someone votes against it, then you can expect an ad come election time with a deep, ominous voice saying something like \u201cSenator Throatwobbler Mangrove voted against puppies. \u2026 Are your children next?\u201d It\u2019s like a game, just with stakes that kind of define our lives.\n\nTake the horrible/hilarious (horriblearious?) case of Senator David Vetter (R-LA), the target of a bill so fantastically spiteful, and yet so easy for the people that introduced it to defend, that its dickishness borders on genius.\n\nVitter has been a longtime opponent of Obamacare, and recently attempted to attach an unrelated rider to an energy efficiency bill that would prohibit federal funds for lawmakers to help with their personal healthcare costs. In retaliation, Democrats introduced legislation of their own that would block lawmakers from access to healthcare if there is \u201cprobable cause to determine [that person] has engaged in the solicitation of prostitution.\u201d Vitter, you see, had a wee prostitution scandal back in 2007, when his phone number was found in a book of client names for a D.C. Madam.\n\nThat leaves the GOP in the odd position of being forced to argue against a bill that only effects Johns. It\u2019s sort of like they are tacitly endorsing prostitution by fighting it \u2013 at least that\u2019s what their opponents will say. That deserves a slow clap. It\u2019s like being a prick became a team sport.\n\nWith S.134, the bill itself is innocuous for the most part, but the cracks between the words hide a few problems. The bill calls for all new research. This research will take place over a 15 month period \u2013 less when you consider the time for pragmatic things like writing the paper, determining research methods, etc. It will ignore the mountains of research that already exist, including the most current and relevant info that was recently presented to the Supreme Court during the Brown v. the Entertainment Merchants Association case. The new study would ignore years of research in favor of what is essentially a short term study.\n\nSince this would be the first real government research dedicated to the subject of violent gaming\u2019s effect on kids, it also means that any future legislation would rely on it primarily. The Federal Government loves to justify its expenses. There have been dozens of major research projects dedicated to the effects of gaming on people, but none of them will matter. The fate of a multibillion dollar industry may come down to one single study.\n\nThe National Academy of Science has a reputation for impartiality, but Rockefeller himself has repeatedly shown a bias against video games. Following the Sandy Hook shootings, while the nation was mourning and the topic of gun control raged, Rockefeller blamed violent video games. He didn\u2019t suggest that there may be a correlation, he flat out blamed violent media and seemed to think it was obvious to everyone. \u201cAs parents, research confirms what we already know \u2013 these violent images have a negative impact on our children\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d he stated without pointing to any specific evidence.\n\nHe then attempted to introduce a version of S.134, but it didn\u2019t go anywhere at the time. Following the Supreme Court case in 2011, he also claimed that the Courts were flat out wrong, even it spent after months reading studies, something Rockefeller doesn\u2019t seem to have done.\n\n\u201cRecent court decisions demonstrate that some people still do not get it,\u201d Rockefeller claimed. \u201cThey believe that violent video games are no more dangerous to young minds than classic literature or Saturday morning cartoons. Parents, pediatricians, and psychologists know better.\u201d\n\nThis is the guy championing the research into whether or not violent media can effect behavior. He\u2019s not looking for a scientific study to determine an answer, he\u2019s looking for a justification for his beliefs \u2013 scientifically unconfirmed and frequently disputed beliefs. Rockefeller is so certain that violent games and programming cause violent tendencies, that this study is, to him, just a formality.\n\nThe point of the bill, to research violent video games and violent programming\u2019s effects on behavior, is understandable. For as certain as Rockefeller is of what the study will conclude, there are those on the other side that welcome the discussion and think there will be no correlation found. Just like all the other studies on the subject. It just needs a more impartial sponsor.\n\nHot Coffee and News\n\nPS4 Strong like bull\n\nAccording to a report from Edge, several devs have claimed that the PlayStation 4 is up to 50 percent more powerful than the Xbox One. That power difference is further described as \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cobvious.\u201d One example the report gives is in the HD frame rates. The PS4 can run 30FPS at 1920\u00d71080 resolution, while the Xbox One runs around 20FPS at 1600\u00d7900 resolution. Microsoft has disputed this and claims other aspects of the hardware, like using memory writes instead of ALU, favors the Xbox One. PC developers, in reply, said \u201cboth systems are adorable\u201d before bursting into fits of laughter.\n\nJ.J. Abrams throws dev under bus\n\nThe Star Trek game wasn\u2019t what most people would classically consider \u201cgood,\u201d or \u201cwell made\u201d by, ya know, human standards. It was poorly conceived and filled with glitches, and it hurt J.J. Abrams\u2019 feelings. In a recent interview with GamerHub, the director of the two recent Star Trek films (who just announced that he will not direct the third film due to commitments to some other, indie franchise about some wars out in the stars or something) said that his team was initially involved with the game\u2019s development, but dropped out because they were unhappy about it, and the finished product disappointed him. Digital Extremes continued their development, and have since blamed Paramount for its interference. Abrams further suggested that the game was so bad it may have hurt the box office of Star Trek Into Darkness. I would make a joke here about either the quality of the film or the typically strong reaction from fans toward any Star Trek property, but Trekkers are not to be trifled with.\n\nMicrosoft registers Xbone\n\nMicrosoft is not a fan of the nickname \u201cXbone\u201d for its Xbox One console. Microsoft spokesman Larry Hyrb even claimed it was a bit of an insult, which made everyone on the Internet stop and consider that their words could actually hurt, and so they all immediately wrote a heartfelt and thoughtful apology on comment boards across the digital landscape. Ok, you can stop laughing now. In an attempt to stop the spread of the nickname, or at least to prevent it from hitting ridiculous heights, Microsoft registered the domain name Xbone.com. It currently redirects to a Bing search page for the phrase and will probably never be used, thus permanently ending the spread of the nickname forever. Stop laughing!", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.ratio_4_3": "http://icdn7.digitaltrends.com/image/mw2_washington-480x360-c.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://icdn5.digitaltrends.com/image/mw2_washington-50x50.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Ryan Fleming", "description": "In this week\u2019s Gamed, West Virginia Senator Jay Rockefeller\u2019s bill to study violent video games may not be what it seems, J.J.
