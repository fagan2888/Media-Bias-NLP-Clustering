HOMESTEAD (CBSMiami) — A new trolley system provides free transportation and free access to Everglades and Biscayne National parks.It’s the first of its kind nationally to offer public transportation to two national parks.

By taking the trolley, visitors will be granted free access to both Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park. The system also transports passengers to Homestead Bayfront Park.

The trolley makes about five trips every Saturday and Sunday from Historic Downtown Homestead. Pick up is at Losner Park located at 104 N. Krome Ave.

The trolley will run from January through April.

According to our news partners at the Miami Herald, the program is a partnership between the city of Homestead, the National Parks Conservation Association and the National Park Service.

The service is an expansion of the route of the existing free trolley in Homestead which added another trolley to its fleet thanks to federal grant money. As for the program’s operational costs of $36,000 a year, that’s funded by Miami-Dade County’s half-penny sales tax for transportation.
