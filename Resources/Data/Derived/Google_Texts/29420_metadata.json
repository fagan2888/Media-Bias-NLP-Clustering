Similarly pill counts are also unreliable if patients failed to return the bottle or packaging material used.\n\nTwo types of medical non-adherence are found in the healthcare industry, unintentional and intentional. In unintentional medical non-adherence, patients are intended to take medicine but fail to do so for some unobvious reason; whereas, in intentional medical non-adherence patents are making an articulate decision about avoiding the medication and clinical trials based solely of their perceptions, and feelings.\n\nBased on the various disease types, the global medical adherence market can be segmented as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia (high cholesterol), and depression. Patients suffering from depression had the lower adherence rates, whereas, patients suffering from hypertension have the highest adherence rate.\n\nThere are basically two types of approaches used in the medical adherence market, hardware centric offerings and software-only offerings. Further, hardware centric offering can be segmented as devices and packaging. The devices segment includes smart pill bottle, automated pill dispenser, electronic tray, smart cap and others.
