The privileged white folks running for president (and one crazy-ass black dude who literally said, \u201c\u2026Obamacare is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery. And it is in a way, it is slavery\u2026\u201d) are gonna have a hard enough time keeping this ridiculously fractured nation together to focus on building Native nations.But that\u2019s cool\u2014Native people don\u2019t need saviors. We survived before \u201cAmerica\u201d was a thing and, if we reconnect with our homelands and ancestral ways, we will be here long after.If the US simply lived up to its treaty obligations like an honorable nation/dealmaker, tribes could navigate our own ways. Obama spoiled tribes and actually largely dealt with tribes as Nations in a way that no president has never done before; imagine that\u2014a leader of the US actually honoring its agreements. No other US president has honored its obligations to the degree Obama has done it and there\u2019s no sign that any of the 2016 candidates have Obama\u2019s sort of pedigree (although I think Bernie Sanders could get it, with proper training). The best of the presidential candidates from both parties are folks who have never taken a leadership role in helping Native communities. The worst?Ew.That\u2019s right: there is one singularly bad candidate for Native people who shows an ugly hate toward Native people and just shows a nastiness towards brown people in general. That\u2019s right: Donald Trump. He\u2019s kind of a scumbag. I laughed about it early on, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even believe what he\u2019s saying.\u201d And I still don\u2019t think that he believes 90% of what he says\u2014but it doesn\u2019t matter. If you rile up enough racist/xenophobic/misogynistic energy\u2014as he has done\u2014things get dangerous. It changes the tone; America already struggles getting past it\u2019s racist past. It certainly doesn\u2019t need new bigots stirring the pot.And even if Trump doesn\u2019t believe the racist garbage that he spews, it still has a hateful effect and stirs up the genuinely racist folks within America. And it\u2019s not just the toothless, uneducated masses that have latched onto Trump\u2019s prejudiced dog-whistles (they have); the neo-conservative bigots who utilize passive aggressive race-neutral language to antagonize people of color also have heeded his call.Of course his hate speech toward brown skinned migrants is epic; he seems to despise our brothers and sisters to the south (who have more right to be on this continent than he does). Yet, he says that the Mexicans who come here \u201c\u2026 have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists.\u201dWell damn. It\u2019s no surprise that his hate speech inspired hate crimes by some Neanderthals in Boston against a homeless Latino man. When the men were arrested they said, \u201cDonald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported.\u201dIdiots call this type of racism \u201cNativist,\u201d but that\u2019s an evil lie. Donald Trump is not Native to this land and it\u2019s not Native people carrying out this hate. It\u2019s other immigrants. White immigrants who don\u2019t like brown immigrants.He\u2019s kinda equal opportunity in his hate of people of color. When speaking about the Black Lives Matter movement, a movement dedicated to securing basic human rights for black folks in this nation, Trump said, \u201cI think they\u2019re trouble. I think they\u2019re looking for trouble\u2026And I think it\u2019s a disgrace that they\u2019re getting away with it.\u201dBut even with his obvious distaste of Mexican folks and Black folks, he has the longest history of antagonizing Native people.Obviously, there\u2019s the history of Trump crying to Congress that American Indian casinos should be shut down because Indian casinos are going to create \u201c\u2026the biggest organized crime problem in the history of this country. Al Capone is going to look like a baby.\u201d Then, there was Trump playing racial police about mixed members of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe saying \"They don't look like Indians to me.\u201d Additionally, recently Trump was kind enough to speak for Native people about the Washington Redskins franchise, saying , \"I know Indians that are extremely proud of that name.\" (in fairness, Jeb Bush did this same thing\u2014these over-privileged and rich white men love to speak for Native people).Trump also recently went on record to say that if he were elected President, \u201cI will immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline...\u201d that tramples on the sacred sites and water supplies of many, many Native people.Bad news.There are plenty more examples. And while we don\u2019t have absolute certainty as to who will be best for Native people in this upcoming election cycle, we do know who will be the worst for Native people, Mexicans and black folks.Thank you Donald Trump for making that clear.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
