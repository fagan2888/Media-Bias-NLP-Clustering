I wish them congratulations, they won the election, but there was no wave of approval for anybody. There was an ebbing, an ebb tide, for us.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs for whether she would consider stepping down as minority leader, Pelosi said she\u2019s needed now more than ever.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Read the transcript of the Pelosi interview )\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, if we would have won, I would have thought about leaving,\u201d Pelosi declared, a remark that will likely surprise both admirers and detractors.\n\nPelosi\u2019s take on the midterms is this: It wasn\u2019t a Republican wave, her party\u2019s message is fine and while President Barack Obama thinks Democrats need to play better politics, she believes Democrats just need to better engage voters.\n\nAs Pelosi prepares to run for another term as House minority leader, a position she\u2019s expected to win unchallenged next week, the powerful Californian is unrepentant about a brutal election night.\n\nSeated in her Capitol Hill office on Friday, the 74-year-old Pelosi offered her thoughts on the state of her caucus in a Republican-controlled Congress, revealing a leader who is standing by her principles, policies and strategies.\n\nFrom plans to harness her power among fellow Democrats to keep her job as minority leader, to digging in on Obamacare and the party\u2019s economic messaging, Pelosi is setting up her party to fight to take back the House in 2016 on similar grounds as this year, apparently without a dramatic shakeup of the Democratic leadership team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always time for fresh leadership, but my members have asked me to stay,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they want me to stay, I stay. If they don\u2019t want me to stay, I won\u2019t stay.\u201d\n\nSome of this is the spin that any party leader uses. Some of it is vintage Pelosi \u2014 she shrugs off defeats as lessons learned, and never overplays her victories. She is an experienced enough pol to know that both happen routinely in a political career that has spanned nearly four decades.\n\nIt\u2019s also a reflection of her own power inside the House Democratic Caucus. She\u2019s built loyalty around her incredible fundraising prowess, raising more money than anyone else for House Democrats \u2014 $65 million for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and another $35 million for members this cycle alone, her office said. She hit 750 fundraisers and events in the past two years, spending 200 days on the road this year raising money.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The GOP plan for Lynch)\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t often rebuke her publicly, but since the election, a number of younger members and staffers have begun to say privately it\u2019s time for new blood in leadership to energize the party ahead of the 2016 elections \u2014 they don\u2019t want Pelosi gone but want her to cast a wider net within the party for advice.\n\nOn a conference call with members last Thursday, just two days after the election, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said Democrats need to \u201crethink\u201d their message after a number of young people voted for Sen.-elect Cory Gardner, a Republican, over Sen. Mark Udall, a Democrat.\n\nPelosi cut her off, sources on the call said.\n\nOther Democratic aides and insiders have grumbled privately, too, that they want more dramatic moves on the policy and messaging front.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we need to change,\u201d a senior Democratic aide said. \u201c[Voters] like our policies. All this leftie [talk], the country likes, but somehow the message about us as individual members of the conference isn\u2019t breaking through. There is great unrest.\u201d\n\nPelosi is giving ground that Democrats need to do a better job at bringing young people to the polls \u2014 suggesting that Democrats launch an aggressive voter engagement drive for 2016 just one day after the election.\n\n\u201cWe have to engage people in voting again. Two-thirds of the electorate did not vote in this election the other night,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThat\u2019s shameful.\u201d\n\nPelosi suggested the new effort has to go far beyond just registering likely Democratic voters \u2014 the party needs to provide an \u201cinspiration\u201d to get people to the polls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just registration. You can\u2019t just go up to someone and say, \u2018Will you register to vote?\u2019 You have to have an inspiration. It\u2019s not just registration, it\u2019s the whole engagement of it,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Red-state Dems rise in Senate)\n\nOn Nov. 4, as the Election Day drubbing for Democrats unfolded, Pelosi gathered with a small group of supporters and staffers at Rep. Chellie Pingree\u2019s (D-Maine) home on Capitol Hill to watch the results. Attendees described the event as \u201csomber\u201d and \u201cdownbeat.\u201d Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel of New York talked about turnout and the party\u2019s effort to defend all incumbents \u2014 unlike when in 2010 the DCCC had to cut off some vulnerable members because of stretched resources.\n\nBy the time she left the event at 11 p.m., a number of high-profile Democrats in California and New York were in tight \u2014 and unexpected \u2014 battles for their careers.\n\nFlanked by Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), her husband and Democratic staffers, Pelosi went back to the DCCC\u2019s Capitol Hill headquarters. By 1 a.m., when races across the country were still turning against Democrats, Pelosi began drafting a letter to colleagues, asking for their support as minority leader. At the center of her pitch was the voter engagement drive.\n\nPelosi argues that House Democrats aren\u2019t getting enough credit for preventing a total rout. Compared with losses in the Senate, the losses among incumbent House Democrats were better than expected, she says.\n\nShe also disputes that the White House had a \u201cfailure of politics\u201d \u2014 a term Obama used after POLITICO\u2019s interview with Pelosi \u2014 during the midterm that hurt Democrats.\n\nPelosi on the record On the 2014 midterms: We controlled the damage enormously. They were coming endlessly without one fact. endless money, no commitment to truth. They will say anything. And if that\u2019s the arena you are in, my motto is don\u2019t agonize, organize. And that\u2019s what we ended up doing and we saved a lot of seats. On whether 2014 was a wave: We have to get it back to a place and I do believe that what happened the other night was not a wave. There was no wave of approval for Republicans. I wish them congratulations, they won the election, but there was no wave of approval for anybody. But there was an ebbing; there was an ebb tide, for us. On staying on as minority leader: I\u2019m honestly here to protect the Affordable Care Act from the clutches of those who well, nonetheless, from whatever. On losing: Quite frankly, if we would have won, I would have thought about leaving. It\u2019s the complete reverse. On the Democrats' messaging problem: I think there was so much going on in the world. But the point is it\u2019s not a failure of his message, it was the extent of his success. Let\u2019s say it in a more positive way. This president has accomplished many great things. Maybe people have a feeling that people know that, I don\u2019t know but you know there is always the October eclipse. And we couldn\u2019t catch a break. On winning back the House: We can win the majority without winning in the South, if that\u2019s your point. The message that is important for everybody is financial stability and that\u2019s not just catering to white male voters. Our message was about that: Jumpstart the middle class, stop tax breaks that send jobs overseas, keep the jobs here and build the infrastructure, when women succeed America succeeds, equal pay for equal work and invest in education. READ: More excerpts from POLITICO's exclusive interview with Pelosi\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a failure of his message; it was the extent of his success. Let\u2019s say it in a more positive way. This president has accomplished many great things,\u201d Pelosi said of the president. \u201cYou know there is always an October eclipse. We couldn\u2019t catch a break.\u201d\n\nInstead, Pelosi faulted a series of international crises \u2014 fighting in Ukraine, the terrorist group ISIL and the deadly outbreak of Ebola \u2014 for distracting the media and voters from Democrats\u2019 economic message.\n\nPelosi\u2019s outlook was wildly optimistic running into the homestretch. She insisted in July that Democrats were going to win 25 seats and take back the House. As Congress adjourned in September, Pelosi was still claiming that Democrats had a \u201c60 percent\u201d chance of winning the House, even when all the polls said the exact opposite. \u201cThe momentum is coming our way,\u201d Pelosi said at the time. In private, members-only conference calls before Nov. 4, Pelosi was predicting Democrats would break even on Election Day.\n\nPelosi isn\u2019t backing away from the liberal economic message that House Democrats based their campaign on, such as their focus on equal pay for women and an increased minimum wage. Those messages were poll tested, Pelosi said, and did well in districts that weren\u2019t distracted by higher-profile statewide races.\n\n\u201cThe message that is important for everybody is financial stability \u2026 our message was about that,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201c[It was] jump-start the middle class, stop tax breaks that send jobs overseas \u2026 [the idea that] when women succeed, America succeeds, equal pay for equal work and investments in education.\u201d\n\nDemocrats were also hit by an onslaught of outside money, Pelosi said. Even in the minority, the DCCC had a huge fundraising advantage over the GOP, buoyed by Pelosi\u2019s network of deep-pocketed donors. Yet despite outraising the National Republican Congressional Committee, Democrats couldn\u2019t compete with a torrent of late spending by Republican super PACs.\n\n\u201cWe controlled the damage enormously. They were coming endlessly without one fact. Endless money, no commitment to truth. They will say anything,\u201d she said.\n\nPelosi isn\u2019t nearly ready to give up on her tenure as the House Democrat\u2019s top fundraiser and leader. The veteran lawmaker said she has no plans to leave or stay past 2016, but she said that to win back the House, Democrats will need access to her expansive donor network.\n\nAs for leaving after a tough loss, Pelosi said she is committed to helping Democrats regain the majority. In fact, Pelosi insisted that she would have only considered stepping down had Democrats won the House, returning her to the speaker\u2019s chair.\n\nMany expect her to serve until at least Obama leaves office in 2017 \u2014 in part to defend the 2010 Affordable Care Act from a Republican-led Congress.\n\nPelosi adamantly declined to say what she would do if Hillary Clinton won the White House in 2016, turning into a joke about her relationship with a presidential front-runner.\n\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019ve read? I\u2019ve read that my lifelong dream is to serve as speaker with Hillary Clinton as president. So what? My lifelong dream \u2026\u201d Pelosi deadpanned.\n\nHouse Democrats remain intensely loyal to Pelosi. She\u2019s known for impressing donors with handwritten \u201cthank you\u201d notes and personal phone calls. Members say she pushes them not with threats or strong-arming but by asking them what they need from certain legislation or votes.\n\nThat bond with her rank and file explains why Pelosi has been able to stave off any challenge to her leadership post. It helps that no current Democrat could take up her fundraising network. Pelosi has raised more than $400 million since 2002.\n\nShe does it by attending roughly 750 fundraising and campaign events in the past two years, her office said.\n\n\u201cWe would have lost more than 15 [seats] without Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Israel said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who raised the money that gave us the resources to build the firewall that mitigated against even worse losses.\u201d\n\nWith Republicans in the majority in both sides of the Capitol, Pelosi now faces a new Congress that will be more conservative than in the past four years of just a GOP-controlled House. Already, GOP hard-liners are demanding a series of votes on Republican-friendly legislation that will anger Democrats. Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), poised as the next Senate majority leader, already pledged to hold an Obamacare repeal vote early in the new session.\n\nThe 2010 health care law is one of the cornerstones of Pelosi\u2019s legacy in the House \u2014 and the California Democrat said she would remain in leadership to defend the law at least for another term.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honestly here to protect the Affordable Care Act from the clutches of \u2026 whatever,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nAnna Palmer contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "An exclusive interview with an unbowed Nancy Pelosi.", "title": "Pelosi: 'It wasn't a wave'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/nancy-pelosi-112799.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/11/140612_nancy_pelosi_js_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Nancy Pelosi,2014 Elections,House Democrats", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "An exclusive interview with an unbowed Nancy Pelosi.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16bc\"", "article_summary": "House Democrats ended Election Day controlling fewer seats than they have in nearly 80 years, but Nancy Pelosi isn\u2019t conceding anything.\nThere was an ebbing, an ebb tide, for us.\u201dStory Continued BelowAs for whether she would consider stepping down as minority leader, Pelosi said she\u2019s needed now more than ever.\n\u201cI do not believe what happened the other night is a wave,\u201d Pelosi said in her first sit-down interview since Democrats lost a dozen House seats to Republicans on Nov. 4.\nPelosi argues that House Democrats aren\u2019t getting enough credit for preventing a total rout.\nPelosi isn\u2019t nearly ready to give up on her tenure as the House Democrat\u2019s top fundraiser and leader."}
