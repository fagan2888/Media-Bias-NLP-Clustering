But signing on that line to accept the government\u2019s cash also means you\u2019re making a deal with the devil.\n\nThe government hasn\u2019t told you this subsidy comes with a price \u2014 even more intrusion into your everyday life, said Joshua Archambault, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Government Accountability.\n\n\u201cWhat people don\u2019t know is that their potential for being audited goes up dramatically,\u201d Archambault said. \u201cYou have to release twice as much personal information than an applicant for private insurance and, depending on your income, you could actually end up owing upwards of $10,000 or more.\u201d\n\nArchambault has studied Obamacare extensively and his findings can be found on website his foundation created, UncoverObamaCare.org. In a report co-written with a tax attorney, ObamaCare Tax Credits and the IRS, Archambault said President Obama has asked for $440 million and 2,000 more agents for the Internal Revenue Service, ostensibly to stem an increase in tax-credit fraud.\n\nBut many of these new agents presumably will be auditing people if past history is any indicator. A 2012 congressional report by the IRS\u2019 taxpayer advocate revealed that 69 percent of the people who claimed tax credits for an adoption were audited. Of those taxpayers, 55 percent were found innocent of wrongdoing and were even owed money, the report said.\n\n\u201cThe IRS\u2019 misguided procedures and its failure to adequately adjust these processes when it learned its approach was seriously flawed, has caused significant economic harm to thousands of families,\u201d taxpayer advocate Nina Olson wrote in her report. \u201cUnless the IRS changes its approach to refundable credits \u2026 it will continue to cause problems for eligible taxpayers, including those eligible for \u2026 the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAccording to the President\u2019s fiscal year 2014 budget, the IRS will \u201cincrease audit coverage to address tax compliance issues,\u201d employing 797 agents with this task alone. An additional 573 agents will be employed to \u201cincrease collection coverage.\u201d\n\nIf being audited isn\u2019t bad enough, how about a surprise $8,061 tax bill at the end of the year? This very well could happen to a married couple with a combined yearly income of $60,000, Archambault laid out in his report.\n\nObamacare subsidies are tied to how much money a person makes over the federal poverty level and family size. It has a cap before some or all of the money must be repaid. People who work in industries with fluctuating incomes such as sales, food service or hospitality, could easily find themselves going over the allotted amount.\n\nThis has to be reported immediately to the Obamacare exchange and the IRS so the subsidy can be adjusted. Lower income individuals who don\u2019t do this will have a maximum payback amount of either $600 or $1,500 at the end of the year.\n\nFor people who are in the middle-income range \u2014 making more than $45,960 a year for one person and up to at least $94,200 for a family of four \u2014 going over those set totals by just $10 would mean the taxpayer has to return every cent of the subsidy during the months income exceeded the allowance.\n\nAt first, Congress had limited the payback to the government at $3,500, but the most recent tinkering of the Affordable Care Act shows that it\u2019s now unlimited.\n\nIn Archambault\u2019s hypothetical example, one of the couple receives a small promotion and doesn\u2019t remember to notify the IRS. Although the couple has paid $5,700 for insurance during the year, they are still required to pay back the $8,061 tax credit and are billed for interest and penalties. If the couple is unable to pay, the IRS can, as it often does, resort to wage garnishments, bank account seizures and liens, Archambault wrote.\n\nReceiving an Obamacare subsidy also means parting with personal information that even your own family members might not possess.\n\nA standard insurance application asks for basic facts: name, age, gender, address, whether you are a college student or have an employer offer of insurance, Social Security number and a list of family members.\n\nBut apply for an Obamacare tax credit and the government wants to know:\n\nPension and retirement account information\n\nSocial Security payments\n\nAlimony payments\n\nInvestment information\n\nFamily structure and living arrangement\n\nFoster care information\n\nAnd, if you are self-employed:\n\nVehicle expenses\n\nProperty or business insurance\n\nInterest collected\n\nRent or lease of business property\n\nContract labor\n\nBusiness activity such as commissions, licenses and fees\n\nBusiness travel and meals\n\nLegal and professional services\n\n\u201cThe potential for abuse is staggering,\u201d Stephen Parente and Paul Howard wrote in a recent USA Today opinion piece. Parente is a professor with the University of Minnesota and Howard, a director with the Manhattan Institute.\n\nSome of this abuse may have started already as thousands of Social Security numbers and other data have been released inadvertently by the IRS during the past few years, according to media reports.\n\n\u201cConsumers should fully understand the relationship they are entering into with the IRS when they sign up for an Obamacare tax credit,\u201d Archambault advised.\n\nContact Tori Richards at tori@watchdog.org and on twitter @newswriter2.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Signing up for Obamacare subsidies means making a deal with the devil.", "title": "Obamacare: A welcome mat for IRS horrors - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/01/IRS-building-sign.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-13T12:48:07+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/124465/obamacare-welcome-mat-irs-horrors/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "National", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,Foundation for Government Accountability,insurance,Internal Revenue Service,IRS,Joshua Archambault,Manhattan Institute,ObamaCare,Tori Richards", "published_time": "2014-01-21T04:00:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-13T12:48:07+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Signing up for Obamacare subsidies means making a deal with the devil.", "title": "Obamacare: A welcome mat for IRS horrors - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/01/IRS-building-sign.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Signing up for Obamacare subsidies means making a deal with the devil."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1fa0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cConsumers should fully understand the relationship they are entering into with the IRS when they sign up for an Obamacare tax credit,\u201d Archambault advised.\nReceiving an Obamacare subsidy also means parting with personal information that even your own family members might not possess.\nThis has to be reported immediately to the Obamacare exchange and the IRS so the subsidy can be adjusted.\nIn a report co-written with a tax attorney, ObamaCare Tax Credits and the IRS, Archambault said President Obama has asked for $440 million and 2,000 more agents for the Internal Revenue Service, ostensibly to stem an increase in tax-credit fraud.\nBy Tori Richards | Watchdog.orgSo you\u2019ve maneuvered the Obamacare website, plugged in your top-secret information and found out how much you are paying."}
