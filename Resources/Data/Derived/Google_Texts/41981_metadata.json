First, there was a local CBS News crew catching de Blasio\u2019s caravan speeding well over the limit and blowing through two stop signs on Thursday afternoon (there was no emergency at the time). This wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal, except\u2026Mr. de Blasio had very publicly unveiled a huge traffic safety initiative just days earlier.\n\nThe hits kept coming on Friday morning during the Mayor\u2019s trip to Brooklyn, where a New York Post reporter photographed him jaywalking. Again, this wouldn\u2019t even remotely be a big deal if not for the new mayor relentlessly going after jaywalkers by increasing tickets from a mere 27 through February 9th of last year (under then-Mayor Mike Bloomberg) to 215 this year under his administration. Know this: An 8-fold increase in tickets is no accident.\n\nThis rollercoaster 36 hours\u2014where de Blasio has been getting absolutely pummeled by the New York media\u2014is simply a continuation of a comedy of errors not seen out of New York since the Mets ended their season.\n\nFirst it was not removing snow from Manhattan\u2019s wealthy Upper East Side, which some residents charged was the lowest form of class warfare one could embark on\u2026particularly during the one of the most brutal winter\u2019s the city has ever seen. For those not in the know, six inches of snow fell on the city on January 20th, but wasn\u2019t cleared between 59th and 79th Street on New York\u2019s east side for days. Consequently, buses were stranded, traffic was miserable and getting around the area\u2014even by foot\u2014was extremely difficult until the plows finally came. Of course, de Blasio denied anything was done intentionally to make a political statement. For those who watch MSNBC, does any of this sound familiar?\n\nThen there was the debacle just ten days ago when the mayor decided to send New York City students to school despite blizzard conditions outside. The choice was so ridiculous it even got the attention of Today Show weatherman/personality Al Roker, who was 5200 miles away in Sochi at the Winter Olympics.\n\nOuch.\n\nEven fellow Democrats\u2014both in the political arena and in the media\u2014slammed the Mayor for making such an ill-advised call. But instead of apologizing\u2014which apparently isn\u2019t in de Blasio\u2019s DNA\u2014he doubled down\u2026citing a National Weather Service report that apparently stated the snow wasn\u2019t supposed to come as fast and heavy as it did. Not sure what the mayor was reading, as every weather report the night before the storm hit basically called for white death. And it came as advertised.\n\nBut mistakes will be made, especially in the early moments of anyone\u2019s first term. The trick is how to address those mistakes in transparent fashion to assure the public things are under control. But de Blasio isn\u2019t even getting this part of the equation right. Just check out his \u201cpress conference\u201d Friday afternoon, where the mayor said this to reporters earlier in the day:\n\n\u201cYou can ask all the questions you want. You can ask any other questions you like\u2026You can ask any and all questions.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, after making a brief statement where he took zero responsibility for the speeding incident, he proceeded to take zero questions from reporters before storming off. The press reaction was both harsh and hilarious. Here are three Tweets from reporters who were there that pretty much sum it up:\n\nDid anyone clock de Blasio's speed as he dashed out of the Blue Room? @MKramerTV? \u2014 Andrew J. Hawkins (@andyjayhawk) February 21, 2014\n\nBdB's press strategy seems to be to go out of his way, not even 2 mos. into his term, to smugly alienate those covering him. \u2014 Clyde Haberman (@ClydeHaberman) February 21, 2014\n\nI don't get the press strategy. Does he think reporters won't have the same questions on Monday? Isn't it better to bury it on a Friday eve? \u2014 Dana Rubinstein (@danarubinstein) February 21, 2014\n\nDe Blasio won by a landslide after surviving the likes of Carlos Danger as a primary opponent.\n\nDanger\u2014whom some refer to as Anthony Weiner\u2014once led him in the polls.\n\nAfter seeing his opponent in action over his first 50 days in office, it\u2019s now easy to see why.\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Joe Concha on Twitter @ConchaMedia", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s hard to find anyone getting off to a more brutal start to any job than New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has in the first seven weeks of his term.
