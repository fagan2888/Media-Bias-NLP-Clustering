The proposal calls for doctors to offer non-drug therapies, prioritize Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medication for use on children, and minimize dosage. The synchronous use of two or more drugs would also be forbidden, and medical professionals would be encouraged to wean children off of mind-altering medications.\n\nThe guidelines come on the heels of legislation that, if passed, would support the aforementioned rules by requiring counties within the state to form partnerships with their community child health and disability program. Public health nurses would also be on call to monitor and limit a child\u2019s use of mind-altering medication when they\u2019re in California\u2019s foster care system.\n\n\u201cThe guidelines aren\u2019t going to solve all the problems,\u201d Linette Scott, chief medical information officer for the California Department of Health Care Services, the agency that oversees the state\u2019s public health system, told the San Jose Mercury News last week. \u201c[But] they set expectations and create a common language for offices and clinics treating California\u2019s 63,000 foster children.\u201d\n\nAn investigation by San Jose Mercury News last August revealed that 25 percent of children in California\u2019s foster care system received mind-altering medication, some of which wasn\u2019t approved by the FDA. The rates of abuse in the state\u2019s system more than tripled that the national average, the report said. California\u2019s foster care system has carried on these practices on 15 percent of the wards for a decade, mainly doling out psychotropics \u2014 tablets that alter the mood, perceptions, or consciousness of those who use them.\n\nUpon further analysis of state data, reporters at the San Jose Mercury News found that 60 percent of children prescribed psychotropics in the last 10 years received the class of medication with the highest health risks. In some cases, doctors doled out up to four medications at a time to more than 10 percent of youngsters in the foster care system without any knowledge of how it would affect brain function. Reporters also discovered that the juvenile courts authorized the distribution of drugs to children in group homes, places that house 3,800 children annually.\n\nState officials acknowledged that while they intended the medication to calm down the children, mood swings soon followed in many cases. Additionally, the lasting effects have been found to be devastating, with many children experiencing long-term weight gain, lethargy, lack of focus, an increased risk of suicide, and a shrinking brain.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one substantive thing that we can point to that has ensured that foster children in California today are only receiving psychotropic medications appropriately,\u201d Bill Grimm, an attorney with the Oakland-based National Center for Youth Law, told the San Jose Mercury News.\n\nThis issue isn\u2019t endemic to California. An Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services report showed that children in foster care systems across the United States face similar fates, particularly with drugs touted as second-generation antipsychotics. While these medications \u2014 which include aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine fumarate, and risperidone \u2014 have been approved by the FDA, the government agency contends that foster care officials have used them inappropriately, with its report citing quality-of-care concerns in 67 percent of the cases they examined. Those who defend the procedures say that they don\u2019t have many other options to \u201ccontain\u201d the behaviors that get youngsters shipped from foster home to foster home.\n\n\u201cWhat the experts tell us is\u2026 not enough resources are really directed at taking care of these kids and giving them the therapies and the intensive treatment that they need \u2014 not drugs,\u201d CBS News Correspondent Werner said last month. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of time, that\u2019s a lot of people to do that \u2014 therapists and counselors and doctors \u2014 and that of course all costs money.\u201d\n\nBut lawmakers across the United States aren\u2019t buying that explanation. Last year, the federal government issued a call to all states to reduce the use of psychotropic medication in foster care, with President Barack Obama including money in his 2015 and 2016 budget proposals to assist in those efforts. Some states have also taken concrete steps to reduce prescription of mind-altering drugs to children. For example, Washington, Wyoming, New Jersey, and Illinois require that children prescribed psychotropics receive second opinions. Child welfare workers, foster parents, and residential providers in Texas and Connecticut are trained on psychotropics\u2019 effects and side effects. They also receive guidance about what questions they should ask doctors and when to seek non-drug therapies.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Here's how California is trying to fix it.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Here's how California is trying to fix it.", "title": "California\u2019s Foster Care System Doles Out A Shocking Amount Of Drugs", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/04/17/3648470/california-foster-care-system/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_child-mental-health-e1393335093729.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's how California is trying to fix it.", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_child-mental-health-321x214.jpg", "title": "California\u2019s Foster Care System Doles Out A Shocking Amount Of Drugs", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_child-mental-health-e1393335093729.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_child-mental-health-e1393335093729.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-17T13:19:28+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce1c\"", "article_summary": "Public health nurses would also be on call to monitor and limit a child\u2019s use of mind-altering medication when they\u2019re in California\u2019s foster care system.\nCalifornia\u2019s foster care system has carried on these practices on 15 percent of the wards for a decade, mainly doling out psychotropics \u2014 tablets that alter the mood, perceptions, or consciousness of those who use them.\nHealth California\u2019s Foster Care System Doles Out A Shocking Amount Of Drugs CREDIT: ShutterstockNearly a year after a five-part news investigation shone light on the alarming rate of prescription drug use among children in California\u2019s foster care system, lawmakers in the Golden State may soon be on their way to approving and implementing legislation that limits the psychotropic medication intake of those under state supervision.\nThe rates of abuse in the state\u2019s system more than tripled that the national average, the report said.\n\u201c[But] they set expectations and create a common language for offices and clinics treating California\u2019s 63,000 foster children.\u201dAn investigation by San Jose Mercury News last August revealed that 25 percent of children in California\u2019s foster care system received mind-altering medication, some of which wasn\u2019t approved by the FDA."}
