The Weld County District Attorney's Office on Friday filed additional charges against a Lafayette man accused of embarking on a crime spree in Weld and Boulder counties earlier this month.

Frank Richard Duran, 29, has been charged with two counts of second-degree burglary, first-degree arson, criminal mischief, attempted cruelty to animals, theft and second-degree trespassing.

The charges reflect the Boulder County leg of Duran's alleged crime spree, during which police say he threatened to kill a small child and tried to drown a small dog.

Boulder County Sheriff's deputies arrested Duran on Feb. 4 outside of a Niwot home, where police say he ditched a stolen car, broke in, set a fire and attempted to drown a Pomeranian named Cujo. Cujo was not injured.

The Weld County DA already has filed charges against Duran for felony child abuse, burglary, felony menacing, felony robbery, first-degree aggravated motor vehicle theft, felony trespassing and theft. Those charges reflect the Weld County portion of the alleged crime spree.

Weld County authorities said Duran ditched a stolen car in Longview estates and tried to break into two houses before threatening to kill a man's young child before taking the man's car at knifepoint.

Police found the car outside of the Niwot home about an hour later and began a search for Duran, who was taken into custody when he returned to the car, apparently to work on the engine.

At roughly the same time Boulder County sheriff's deputies took Duran into custody, a fire was reported at the Niwot home he is accused of breaking into.

Duran remained in custody on Friday at the Weld County Jail on a $150,000 cash or surety bond. He is due back in Weld County District Court for an advisement hearing on Feb. 23.
