Our politically correct politicians, bought and paid for by big donors, have lost their will to balance the budget and live within their means. The show of greed from all parties is leaving a burden of debt to the next generations.\n\nOur politicians live in the fantasy Washington world where everything is great. They all become millionaires; their families are set for life; they give themselves great pensions and Cadillac health insurance. Obamacare is good for Americans, but not good enough for them.\n\nGreedy, in-your-face politics makes one sick, and it\u2019s never ending. They live by their rules and the taxpayer pays. There is no leadership, no integrity and no responsibility for their decisions. They have no vision or plan for America and no shame. Ignoring the facts and reality does not change the facts and reality.\n\nHow can they think out-of-control spending creating an astronomical debt and not closing our borders is good for America. What do they find wrong with having a balanced budget or closing our borders, other than votes. What is coming across our borders is the future of America and do they think ISIS does not know how easy it is to enter America?\n\nBeing politically correct is committing financial suicide, changing our culture and does not have the capability of doing the right thing for America. The upcoming election for president will decide the future of America and, if things don\u2019t change, it could be the end of the America we know and grew up in.\n\nCharles Coons\n\nRavena", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Observation Deck", "description": "We hear all the talk from people running for the president, campaigning against everything that big government created.
