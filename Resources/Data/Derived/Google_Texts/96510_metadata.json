Especially those working in local bakeries, pouring not just pumpkin puree into pie crusts, but also long hours and late nights into preparations for the holidays.\n\nDespite the stress of the season, though, many are happy to devote their time to the tradition.\n\nKathy's Pies\n\nIn 30 years of business, Kathy\u2019s Pies co-owners Kathy McCauley and Terri Weyland-Henecke have learned the importance of preparing early for the holidays.\n\n\u201cYou can never be too prepared,\u201d Henecke said.\n\nExtensive notes from previous years have helped them learn from their mistakes, and the No. 1 lesson they\u2019ve learned, McCauley said, is simply having enough product on hand.\n\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019ve got too much of something, you\u2019re probably wrong,\u201d Henecke added.\n\nIt all begins in August, when they forecast their output and begin making and freezing product \u2014 to the tune of 2,000 pie crusts, for example.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get enough product built up that it\u2019s ready for us to use the week of Thanksgiving, because we don\u2019t have time to make everything from scratch,\u201d Henecke said.\n\nOn an average day, Kathy\u2019s typically sells about 100 pies. But for the week of Thanksgiving, they\u2019ll sell 6,000 \u2014 a month\u2019s worth \u2014 in one week.\n\n\u201cThe week of Thanksgiving, our oven will not turn off for four days,\u201d Henecke said. \u201cWe wear shorts that whole week, because it gets hot in here.\u201d\n\nTwo days before Thanksgiving, they\u2019ll work 18-hour shifts, churning out hundreds of pies by the hour.\n\n\u201cYou go home at 7 o\u2019clock at night, sleep for a couple hours and then come back at midnight,\u201d Henecke said.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll actually sleep, she added. Usually, you\u2019re up all night \u201cthinking about all the stuff you\u2019ve got to do when you get back, and you just know it\u2019s not going to get done.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge is decorated sugar cookies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very labor intensive and time consuming,\u201d Henecke explained. \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing 900 to 1,200 cookies a day for the next day, it\u2019s painful.\u201d\n\nShe said people don\u2019t realize how tough it is to work at a bakery.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks it\u2019s fun,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you\u2019re kicking butt the whole time you\u2019re here \u2014 especially this time of year.\u201d\n\nMcCauley agreed, it\u2019s a love-hate relationship.\n\n\u201cHave there been years where I\u2019ve said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this anymore?\u2019 Yes,\u201d she said.\n\nBut sometimes, she admitted, it\u2019s not so bad.\n\nSometimes, the anticipation is worse than the actual work, Henecke agreed.\n\nRegardless, the holidays are their biggest moneymaker all year, so they don\u2019t have much of a choice.\n\n\u201cWithout the holidays, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019d be here,\u201d McCauley said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be the same, at least.\u201d\n\nJules Bakery\n\nLike Kathy\u2019s, Jules Bakery in Marion also has been preparing their \u201cplan of action\u201d since August.\n\nOwner Juli Hardin said that after 15 years in the business, it\u2019s not too difficult to anticipate what customers will order because many order the same thing every year.\n\n\u201cHolidays are about traditions,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this for so many years and not know your customers.\u201d\n\nOne of the bakery\u2019s most popular item is the decorated sugar cookie with signature buttercream frosting.\n\nThe bakery usually sells about 100 cookies each week, but that number quadruples for Thanksgiving and Christmas \u2014 typically 20,000 to 30,000 cookies from Halloween to Christmas.\n\nAlthough planning ahead helps alleviate some of the stress, sometimes the biggest hurdle is making sure ingredients are available and at an affordable price.\n\nA shortage of pumpkin three years ago had Hardin scrambling for fresh puree, and this year she\u2019s concerned about rising egg prices because of the recent bout of bird flu.\n\nDespite what\u2019s going on behind the scenes, Hardin strives to create a relaxed environment for her customers.\n\n\u201cThe holiday time is stressful enough,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen our customers come in here, we don\u2019t want them to be stressed. We want them to be able to smile.\u201d\n\nThis year, Hardin is just happy to be back in the kitchen after a lung cancer diagnosis last year kept her in the hospital.\n\nBaking during the holidays is \u201cthe best job in the whole world,\u201d Hardin said.\n\n\u201cYou know those memories you have with your parents making Christmas cookies? Being able to do that for a job is great.\u201d\n\nDeluxe Cakes and Pastries\n\nTwo weeks before Thanksgiving, in the crammed kitchen at Deluxe Cakes and Pastries in Iowa City, you\u2019ll find owner Jamie Powers and her three employees \u2014 Mary Simmons, Heather Hughes and Gabby Cardenas \u2014 already logging many hours, trying to get \u201cahead of the game.\u201d\n\nEven on days off, \u201cwhen you\u2019re not physically in the shop, you\u2019re mentally in the shop,\u201d Powers said.\n\nAt least 150 pumpkins need to be cut, gutted, roasted and pureed for pies, breads, cakes and other baked goods.\n\nDeluxe also makes at least 500 white chocolate-dipped gingerbread turkeys. It\u2019s a Deluxe Thanksgiving tradition that customers crave each year.\n\n\u201cThe bakery is a holiday tradition,\u201d Powers said, which is why she tries to create a \u201cunique experience\u201d for her customers that maintains a \u201csmall shop feel\u201d focused on fresh, local ingredients in treats that \u201ctaste amazing and look darling.\u201d\n\nEverything is made by hand \u2014 including croissants, cakes and cookies. It\u2019s that sort of care that Powers said she thinks brings the holiday spirit to her customers.\n\n\u201cIf you work in a true bakery around the holidays, if you can catch a glimmer of that spirit of serving other people in such a delicate, decadent way, it\u2019s truly intoxicating,\u201d she said.\n\nMaking everything by hand also means you have to be extremely efficient, which can be stressful. But stress doesn\u2019t scare her.\n\n\u201cSome bakeries take for granted they\u2019re going to be busy around the holidays,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSure, it gets \u201ca bit monotonous,\u201d she said. But \u201cit doesn\u2019t get old.\u201d\n\nEven things that seem like a chore aren\u2019t so bad when you\u2019re fast on your feet, said Simmons, who\u2019s been working at Deluxe for more than 10 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this dance for a long time and have seen ups and downs ... it gets fast and intense, and sometimes, when you\u2019re moving quickly, mistakes are made,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we also have an esprit de corps (sense of unity) here that\u2019s good.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s great, crazy humor that helps.\u201d\n\nPlus, Powers said, \u201cit\u2019s pretty easy to keep your spirits up when there\u2019s gingerbread constantly coming out of the oven.\u201d\n\nNew Pioneer Food Co-op\n\nMiriam Alarcon Avila, a prepared foods coordinator at New Pioneer Co-op, said the holiday season is no doubt the most difficult season of the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of stress, a lot of physical work,\u201d Avila said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a big responsibility to make sure that the food you are cooking is incredible and perfect.\u201d\n\nThis year, the co-op is trying to take the stress out of the holidays for its customers by offering a take-home box that contains everything needed for a Thanksgiving meal \u2014 including a turkey, side dishes and dessert.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a great way to save time,\u201d said prepared foods manager and chef Matt Steigerwald. \u201cThey solve your whole day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about anything except heating it up,\u201d Avila said.\n\nThat means a lot of behind-the-scenes work at New Pi\u2019s hub in North Liberty.\n\nIn addition to making its regular supply of food to be sent to its three locations in the corridor, New Pi also will bake hundreds of bread loaves, pies and more to fill orders for holiday take-home boxes.\n\nAt the end of the day, you go home and \u201cyour tired body feels like it\u2019s going to collapse,\u201d Avila said.\n\nBut, \u201cit\u2019s really a magical time,\u201d because in the end, when you receive customers\u2019 thank-yous, it all becomes worth it, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s when you realize that all the work you started months ago in preparation ... it\u2019s invaluable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | When it comes to the holidays - particularly Thanksgiving - many people have food on the brain.
