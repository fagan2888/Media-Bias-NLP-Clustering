It is the language of the marketplace, of the tradesman, and of the cost accountant. It is a language that depersonalizes both patients and physicians and describes medical care as just another commodity. It is a language that is dangerous.\n\nUnfortunately, Fein\u2019s view has infected much of health care policy in the last 30-plus years. That type of wrongheaded thinking leads to removing health care from the discipline of market processes and into the control of government.\n\nBut the fact is, health care is a commodity. Health care, like all commodities, is a marketable item produced to satisfy wants or needs.\n\nGiven that, the only question is in what type of system will a commodity be produced and consumed? Do we want health care to be bought and sold via markets or via government?\n\nFein also urged physicians to \u201cbe more vigorous spokesmen for the human values in medicine.\u201d Medical care, he claimed, wasn\u2019t measured just by the number of treatments administered \u201cbut also by the amount of comfort, concern, and compassion provided.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how treating health care like a commodity is inhumane. Subjecting health care to markets is what will reduce its cost while improving its quality. Making health care more affordable and better for everyone is indeed a very humane result.\n\nFinally, Fein complained that physicians had adopted the language of \u201ca narrow economics the emphasizes efficiency more than equity,\u201d and encouraged them to \u201cspeak the language that addresses the unfinished agenda of equity and decency in the distribution of health care.\u201d\n\nClearly Fein favored equity over efficiency.\n\nBut to crib a little from Milton Friedman (at 28:09), a system that emphasizes equity over efficiency will end up with neither, while a system that emphasizes efficiency over equity will end up with a good deal of both.\n\nAre there examples of this? Yes, but that will be tomorrow\u2019s blog post.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/hccommodity2.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1411573276838", "description": "Rashi Fein, one of the most important people in the development of Medicare and Medicaid, passed a...", "title": "Health Care IS A\u00a0Commodity - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "article_summary": "That type of wrongheaded thinking leads to removing health care from the discipline of market processes and into the control of government.\nUnfortunately, Fein\u2019s view has infected much of health care policy in the last 30-plus years.\nDo we want health care to be bought and sold via markets or via government?\nHealth care, like all commodities, is a marketable item produced to satisfy wants or needs.\nMaking health care more affordable and better for everyone is indeed a very humane result."}
