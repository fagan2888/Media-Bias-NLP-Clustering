Keeping it funny on "Chelsea Lately"

Comedian Jo Koy credits his regular round table appearances on E!’s late-night “Chelsea Lately Show” with helping expose him to a broad audience.

Koy was part of a group of some five dozen comedians, including Whitney Cummings, Heather McDonald, Brad Wollack and Loni Love, who were regulars at the round table with host Chelsea Handler, left. The show ended its seven-year run last August.

“Chelsea was like the old-school Johnny Carson show,” Koy says. “You go on 'The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.' If you were funny, it showed on the road, it showed in Hollywood.

“That's what Chelsea was all about. If you killed on that show, it changed your life — it changed mine. What she did for my career was unbelievable. She took me to that next level.”
