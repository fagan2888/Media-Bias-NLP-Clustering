James, a senior in Fauquier County, Virginia, uses them outside at lunch with friends who do smoke tricks. Joe, a senior in Jackson, Mississippi, uses them in the morning before class as a coffee-flavored way to pass the time.\n\nE-cigarettes have arrived in the life of the American teenager.\n\nUse of the devices among middle- and high-school students tripled from 2013 to 2014, according to federal data released Thursday, bringing the share of high school students who use them to 13 percent \u2014 more than smoke traditional cigarettes.\n\nAbout a quarter of all high-school students and 8 percent of middle-school students \u2014 4.6 million young people altogether \u2014 used tobacco in some form last year. The sharp rise of e-cigarettes, together with a substantial increase in the use of hookah pipes, led to 400,000 additional young people using a tobacco product in 2014, the first increase in years, though researchers pointed out the percentage of the rise fell within the report\u2019s margin of error.\n\nBut the report also told another story. From 2011 to 2014, the share of high school students who smoked traditional cigarettes declined substantially, to 9 percent from 16 percent, and use of cigars and pipes ebbed too. The shift suggested that some teenage smokers may be using e-cigarettes to quit.\n\nSmoking is still the single-biggest cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 Americans a year, and most scientists agree that e-cigarettes, which deliver the nicotine but not the dangerous tar and other chemicals, are likely to be far less harmful than traditional cigarettes.\n\nThe numbers came as a surprise and seemed to put policymakers into uncharted territory. The Food and Drug Administration took its first tentative step toward regulating e-cigarettes last year, but the process is slow and many experts worry that habits are forming far faster than rules are being written.\n\nBecause e-cigarettes are so new, scientists are still gathering evidence on their long-term health effects, leaving regulators scrambling to gather data.\n\nSKITTLE FLAVORS\n\nIn interviews, teenagers said that e-cigarettes had become almost as common at school as laptops, a change from several years ago, when few had seen them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the healthy alternative taking over my school,\u201d said a 15-year-old sophomore at a school in Westchester County, New York, who started vaping \u2014 the term for puffing on an e-cigarette \u2014 to kick a smoking habit. He said about 70 percent of his friends now vaped.\n\nBut opinions were mixed on why the devices had caught on.\n\nA significant share said they were using the devices to quit smoking cigarettes or marijuana, while others said they had never smoked but liked being part of the trend and enjoyed the taste . Two favorite flavors of teenagers interviewed were Sweet Tart and Unicorn Puke, which one student described as \u201cevery flavor Skittle compressed into one.\u201d\n\nJoe Stevonson, 18, the senior at a high school in Jackson, Mississippi, said he used e-cigarettes to quit smoking, after the habit started affecting his ability to play sports. He prefers a flavor called Courtroom, endorsed by the rapper Lil Ugly Mane, which is described on websites where it is sold as \u201ca medley of things you might want while waiting for the jury to convict.\u201d\n\nAs for whether he still craved cigarettes, \u201cthe only thing that\u2019s really missing is feeling like your entire mouth is coated in dirt,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people who don\u2019t smoke pick them up because it looks cool. But for every person I\u2019ve met like that, I\u2019ve met another using it like it\u2019s a medicine against cigarettes.\u201d\n\nJames, the senior in Virginia, said he and his friends started using e-cigarettes when he was 13, after his father abandoned the devices in a failed effort to quit smoking.\n\n\u201cIt was something for us to do that was edgy and exciting,\u201d said James, who asked that his last name not be used because he did not want his smoking habits to be on public display.\n\nHe liked the smoke tricks that his friends had become good at, like blowing out the vapor so that it spun like a tornado. His favorite flavor is called Hawk Sauce, which he described as \u201ca berry menthol kind of thing.\u201d He has never smoked cigarettes and said he could not imagine ever starting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a harshness to cigarettes,\u201d he said. \u201cGirls think they\u2019re gross.\u201d\n\nA GATEWAY OUT?\n\nE-cigarette use had grown exponentially in previous years, but from such a low base that the numbers had been relatively small. But last year\u2019s rise, which was captured in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s annual youth tobacco survey of about 20,000 schoolchildren, lifted e-cigarette use above that of traditional cigarettes, prompting an outcry from anti-tobacco advocates.\n\nThey warned that e-cigarettes were undoing years of progress among the country\u2019s most vulnerable citizens by making the act of puffing on a tobacco product normal again, and by introducing nicotine, an addictive substance, to a broad population of teenagers.\n\n\u201cThis is a really bad thing,\u201d said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the CDC, who noted that research had found that nicotine harms the developing brain. \u201cThis is another generation being hooked by the tobacco industry. It makes me angry.\u201d\n\nBut the numbers had a bright side. The decline in cigarette use among teenagers accelerated substantially from 2013 to 2014, dropping by 25 percent, the fastest pace in years.\n\nThe pattern seemed to go against the dire predictions of anti-tobacco advocates that e-cigarettes would become a gateway to cigarettes among youths, and suggested they might actually be helping, not hurting. The pattern resembled those in Sweden and Norway, where a rise in the use of snus, a smokeless tobacco product, was followed by a sharp decline in cigarette use.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not a gateway in, and they might be accelerating the gateway out,\u201d said David B. Abrams, executive director of the Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies, an anti-tobacco group.\n\nSome teenagers described vaping as an entirely different culture from cigarette smoking, and scoffed at the idea that it could be a way into cigarettes. Kenny, the senior from Florida, said students liked the mix-and-match accessories that a user could \u201cpersonalize and call your own.\u201d\n\n\u201cE-cigarettes appeal less towards the stereotypical longhaired stoners, and more towards sweatshirt-blue-jeans Silicon Valley programmer,\u201d said Kenny, who asked that his last name not be published to keep his vaping habits private. \u201cYou can compare them to Apple computers.\u201d\n\nSelling e-cigarettes to minors is banned in many states, and the rule the FDA proposed last year would ban it nationally.\n\nBut the proliferation of vape shops and equipment for sale online has made access easy, and some teenagers said they simply clicked a button to indicate they were over 18 to be able to order a starter kit. (E-cigarette equipment includes batteries that can be shaped like cigarettes or a cellphone; liquid reservoirs, known as tanks; cartridges; and battery chargers.) Ethan deLehman, 17, a junior at a private school in Pennsylvania, said he used to ask seniors who were 18 to buy him e-cigarettes at convenience stores, but now he has equipment and buys his liquids on the Internet.\n\n\u201cYou can just go online and click yes,\u201d he said. He has used e-cigarettes to quit smoking, a habit he picked up to relieve the pressure over getting into college. His favorite flavors are Caramel Tobacco and Creamsicle.\n\nA starter e-cigarette kit can begin around $40 and go up to $200 or more, with the fluid costing from $7 to $20 a bottle. That can be less expensive than smoking over the long run, particularly in states like New York where the cost of a pack of cigarettes is high, young people said.\n\nAlexander Wilson started smoking cigarettes when he was 15. He said that e-cigarettes helped him cut down and save money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper overall for how much I smoke,\u201d said Wilson, who lives in Frederick, Maryland.\n\nHe recalled seeing one of the e-cigarette devices for the first time.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Dude, why do you have a light saber?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd he was like, \u2018No, that\u2019s my e-cigarette.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people who don\u2019t smoke pick them up because it looks cool. But for every person I\u2019ve met like that, I\u2019ve met another using it like it\u2019s a medicine against cigarettes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/04/E_CIGARETTES_YOUTH.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9832\"", "article_summary": "By SABRINA TAVERNISEKenny, a high school senior in Weston, likes to puff e-cigarettes during study sessions with friends after school.\nSome teenagers described vaping as an entirely different culture from cigarette smoking, and scoffed at the idea that it could be a way into cigarettes.\nThe shift suggested that some teenage smokers may be using e-cigarettes to quit.\nAlexander Wilson started smoking cigarettes when he was 15.\nThe decline in cigarette use among teenagers accelerated substantially from 2013 to 2014, dropping by 25 percent, the fastest pace in years."}
