The state House met Friday for budget negotiations; it approved the bill 68-46.\n\nBefore the budget can go into effect, it still needs Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s signature. At this point, no more amendments can be made to the budget; the governor can only sign it or veto it.\n\nAccording to the Senate-approved bill, the budget for fiscal 2014-15 will include increases to fees for Standard Commercial Fishing Licenses, Retired Standard Commercial Fishing Licenses, shellfish license, land or sell licenses for out-of-state vessels, Recreational Commercial Gear Licenses and fish dealer licenses. These increases are to support the creation of a N.C. Commercial Fishing Resource Fund.\n\nThe N.C. Fisheries Association \u2013 a nonprofit dedicated to promoting the state seafood industry \u2013 came up with the idea for this fund, including the fee increases. Jerry Schill, NCFA executive director, gave the proposal to the N.C. Marine Fisheries Commission at its regular meeting Feb. 21. The MFC recommended it to the General Assembly and the Senate added it to the Appropriations Act in May.\n\nThe fund will be a non-reverting, special revenue fund in the office of the State Treasurer. It will provide funding for developing sustainable commercial fishing, including funding the state\u2019s incidental take permits for the commercial fishing industry.\n\nThe National Marine Fisheries Service issues these permits to allow a certain number of interactions between fishing gear and species protected by the Endangered Species Act, including sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon. North Carolina needs such permits in order to allow its commercial gill net fishery to operate, and one of the requirements of the permits is an observer program for the gill net fishery.\n\nMoney from the fund will be distributed by the state treasurer. The treasurer will only disperse funds on written direction by the MFC and a funding committee made up of six representatives from six fishing industry organizations:\n\n\u2022The NCFA.\n\n\u2022N.C. Watermen United.\n\n\u2022The Ocracoke Working Watermen\u2019s Association.\n\n\u2022The Brunswick County Fishermen\u2019s Association.\n\n\u2022The Carteret County Fishermen\u2019s Association.\n\n\u2022The Albemarle Fishermen\u2019s Association.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the DMF director, or a designee of the director, to enter into a joint enforcement agreement with the NMFS. This will allow DMF inspectors to accept delegation of law enforcement powers over matters within the NMFS\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nPatricia Smith, DMF public information officer, said the division supports creating such an agreement.\n\n\u201cIt helps with funding,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s usually an amount of money the federal government gives for joining into a JEA.\u201d\n\nMs. Smith said the agreement would require state officers to help with federal regulation enforcement, but she said many federal regulations have already been adopted into state regulations.\n\nCommercial fishermen at public MFC meetings have been opposed to the division making such an agreement with the NMFS. NCWU sent a general letter in April to state senators, in which it opposed creating a \u201cJoint Enforcement Agency,\u201d saying the federal fisheries service already has law enforcement personnel in the state.\n\n\u201cAdopting the Joint Enforcement Agency would affect the sovereignty of the State of North Carolina provided by the state constitution and the U.S. Constitution,\u201d NCWU said. \u201cThe Joint Enforcement Agency would bring in federal money to the state, but much of it would be used for training N.C. Marine Patrol officers about the countless federal laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\n\nMs. Smith said the DMF already gets funding from several federal sources.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a matter of giving up our sovereignty,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything, it may mean fewer federal officers (in the state) because it will be us enforcing things while they concentrate on other matters.\u201d\n\nBrent Fulcher, owner and operator of Beaufort Inlet Seafood and NCFA chairman of the board, said the association thanks the legislators for the coastal counties \u2013 particularly Rep. Pat McElraft, R-Carteret; Sen. Norm Sanderson, R-Carteret; Rep. Christ Millis, R-Pender, and Rep. Michael Speciale, R-Craven.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the Senate for helping us be proactive and have a sustainable fishery without being a burden to the taxpayers,\u201d Mr. Fulcher said, talking about the new fund. \u201cHowever, we\u2019re opposed to a JEA because we feel N.C. sovereignty is worth way more than what the state will be asked to do. We think that in the long run, they\u2019ll be asked to do more than they\u2019ll be paid for.\u201d\n\nContact Mike Shutak at 252-726-7081 ext. 206, email mike@thenewstimes.com; or follow on Twitter at @mikesccnt.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Carolina Coast Online", "description": "RALEIGH \u2014 The legislature is pushing forward with a budget that will create a new fund for an At-Sea Observer Program for commercial fisheries and allow the state Division of Marine Fisheries to make a joint enforcement agreement with the National Marine Fisheries Service.", "title": "Observer funds, JEA clear state", "url": "http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/article_e642239c-1a8f-11e4-8a62-001a4bcf887a.html", "image": "http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/facebook_share_img-2.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "RALEIGH \u2014 The legislature is pushing forward with a budget that will create a new fund for an At-Sea Observer Program for commercial fisheries and allow the state Division of Marine Fisheries to make a joint enforcement agreement with the National Marine Fisheries Service.", "keywords": "at-sea observer program,division of marine fisheries,appropriations act,fishing license fees,dealer licesnes,recreational commercial gear licenses,commercial fishing resource fund,fisheries association,schill,marine fisheries commission", "news_keywords": "at-sea observer program,division of marine fisheries,appropriations act,fishing license fees,dealer licesnes,recreational commercial gear licenses,commercial fishing resource fund,fisheries association,schill,marine fisheries commission"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f3a\"", "article_summary": "It will provide funding for developing sustainable commercial fishing, including funding the state\u2019s incidental take permits for the commercial fishing industry.\nJerry Schill, NCFA executive director, gave the proposal to the N.C.
