While Gov. Rick Scott’s re-election campaign and the GOP are focusing on his role in creating jobs, the first Democratic TV ad of the 2014 governor’s race is set to bring up an old weakness: Columbia/HCA’s Medicare fraud.

The ad says the largest Medicare fraud in history was committed by the hospital chain when Scott was its CEO, according to the Miami Herald. It mentions how Scott invoked his Fifth Amendment right during a federal investigation of Columbia/HCA, and shows footage of Scott testifying during another deposition from another lawsuit involving Florida hospitals.
