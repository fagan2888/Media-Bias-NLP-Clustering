Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to defund the Affordable Care Act in an interview that aired on TheBlaze TV Tuesday evening.\n\nGlenn Beck confronted Fiorina with comments she made about Cruz\u2019s 2013 strategy to defund President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law. Many have contended the Texas senator\u2019s efforts were largely responsible for the government shutdown.\n\n\u201cWhen Ted Cruz, a lot of people have pointed this out, when Ted Cruz, who didn\u2019t shut the government down \u2014 when that happened, you said, \u2018Everyone could see this train wreck coming. I actually feel bad for John Boehner. And I think Ted Cruz\u2019s tactics were wrong. There is no honor charging a hill that you know you can\u2019t take \u2014 only casualties. Although Ted Cruz may have gotten name recognition and money along the way, President Obama wanted a shutdown and Ted Cruz played right into his hands.\u2019 You felt bad for John Boehner?\u201d Beck asked.\n\nFiorina responded, saying she stands by her statement.\n\n\u201cWe all want to repeal Obamacare. But here was different then. We did not have a majority. We did not have a majority,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe second thing that was different \u2014 Obamacare is President Obama\u2019s signature piece of legislation. There is no way.\u201d\n\nFiorina, however, said the recent Planned Parenthood sting videos that purport to show the sale of fetal tissue parts for profit are \u201can abomination\u201d and something she now would be willing to shut down the government over.\n\n\u201cI would force President Obama to explain why he is willing, over $600 million, to permit taxpayer funding of the butchering of babies,\u201d she said.\n\nIt should be noted that while Planned Parenthood does receive federal funding, existing law prohibits the funds from directly funding abortions.\n\nComplimentary Clip From TheBlaze TV:\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
