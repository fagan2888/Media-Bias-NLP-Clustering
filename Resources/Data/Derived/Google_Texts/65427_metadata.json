Some agencies reduced how many senior execs received bonuses in fiscal 2013, but increased the amount on average of performance awards handed out (U.S. Agency for International Development). Others decreased the individual bonus size on average, spreading the wealth around to more people (Education Department).\n\nRelated: 5 Federal Agencies in the GOP's Crosshairs\n\nRegardless of how agencies decided to divvy up the performance awards, they all had to comply with the cap the Office of Management and Budget mandated in 2011. Performance awards to those in the Senior Executive Service and senior-level scientific and professional employees can be no more than 5 percent of employees\u2019 aggregate salaries.\n\nThe average award for employees rated \u201coutstanding\u201d on their performance evaluation was $11,139 in fiscal 2013, while those rated \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d and \u201cfully successful\u201d received $8,756 and $8,208 on average in bonus money, respectively.\n\nHere are the top five most generous agencies when it came to individual performance awards in fiscal 2013. We\u2019ve defined \u201cmost generous\u201d as those agencies that provided bonuses that were more than the average individual award of $10,212 governmentwide. Again, these are averages; some senior executives might have received more money, and others less than the amount listed in parentheses.\n\nUSAID ($14,545) Justice ($13,453) Treasury ($12,498) National Science Foundation ($12,159) Education ($11,765)\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that some of the agencies on our \u201cmost generous\u201d list for fiscal 2013 actually decreased the amount of their average senior executive bonus between fiscal year 2012 and 2013.\n\nRelated: Reality Bites During Week One of New Congress\n\nHere\u2019s the list of agencies in alphabetical order that reported reducing the amount of their average career SES performance award between fiscal years 2012 and 2013:\n\nDefense\n\nEducation\n\nEnergy\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\nGeneral Services Administration\n\nHomeland Security Department\n\nInterior\n\nJustice\n\nLabor\n\nNASA\n\nOMB\n\nSmall Business Administration\n\nState\n\nTreasury\n\nVeterans Affairs\n\nAll others\n\nAnd for good measure, here\u2019s the list of agencies (in alphabetical order) that reported increasing the amount of their average career SES performance award between fiscal years 2012 and 2013:\n\nUSAID\n\nCommerce\n\nHealth and Human Services\n\nHousing and Urban Development\n\nNSF\n\nNuclear Regulatory Commission\n\nOPM\n\nSocial Security Administration\n\nTransportation\n\nThe Agriculture Department handed out the same amount on average in both fiscal years 2012 and 2013: $9,122.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Government Executive.\n\nRead more in Government Executive:\n\nFewer Senior Execs Got Bonuses in Fiscal 2013\n\nA Holiday Gift of Transformational Leadership\n\nThe Biggest Reason We Steal People's Ideas", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Some federal agencies were more generous than others when it came to", "title": "These 5 Federal Agencies Doled Out the Biggest Bonuses", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/12/These-5-Federal-Agencies-Doled-Out-Biggest-Bonuses", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03252014_Woman_Throwing_Money.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/12/These-5-Federal-Agencies-Doled-Out-Biggest-Bonuses", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03252014_Woman_Throwing_Money.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Some federal agencies were more generous than others when it came to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Here are the top five most generous agencies when it came to individual performance awards in fiscal 2013.\nWe\u2019ve defined \u201cmost generous\u201d as those agencies that provided bonuses that were more than the average individual award of $10,212 governmentwide.\nSome federal agencies were more generous than others when it came to bonuses in fiscal 2013, according to the latest data from the Office of Personnel Management.\nRead more in Government Executive:Fewer Senior Execs Got Bonuses in Fiscal 2013A Holiday Gift of Transformational LeadershipThe Biggest Reason We Steal People's Ideas\nRelated: 5 Federal Agencies in the GOP's CrosshairsRegardless of how agencies decided to divvy up the performance awards, they all had to comply with the cap the Office of Management and Budget mandated in 2011."}
