As a part of its efforts to make certain federal transportation infrastructure investments provide safe travel for all, AARP fully supports this important, bipartisan legislation and urges Congress to include it in its rewrite of the surface transportation bill.\n\n\u201cEvery two hours, a pedestrian gets killed in a traffic crash, and one in five is someone age 65 or older,\u201d said Jo Ann Jenkins, AARP CEO. \u201cThe Safe Streets Act would save lives by ensuring that the design of roads and crosswalks allow American families, especially older drivers and pedestrians, to travel to and arrive at their destination in a safer manner.\u201d\n\nThe Safe Streets approach ensures that projects are built right the first time and would require minimal or no additional spending. State and regional planners and traffic engineers would consider the needs of all users, so that roadways and intersections include features to improve safety\u2014such as sidewalks, proper crosswalk signal timing and bicycle lanes\u2014as is found appropriate for each community. More than 700 jurisdictions, including 30 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have adopted Safe Streets policies.\n\nPlanners would have two years to adopt \u201cComplete Streets\u201d policies that take the safety needs of all roadway users into account during the design, planning, construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, maintenance and operating phases of transportation projects. The policy would apply to federally-funded new and reconstructed projects.\n\n\u201cAARP is thankful that Representatives Matsui and Joyce (and supporters) are leading the fight to give our communities the tools they need to keep our streets safe for people of all ages,\u201d added Jenkins.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.aarp.org.\n\n###\n\nAbout AARP\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
