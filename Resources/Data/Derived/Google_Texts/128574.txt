Hill City, SD

A documentary about the battle over a dino discovered in the Black Hills over two decades ago has won an Emmy.



"Dinosaur 13" earned the Emmy for Outstanding Science and Technology Programming Monday at the 36th Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards. The film premiered on CNN in December.



The documentary details the discovery of "Sue," a Tyrannosaurus rex that was more than 90 percent complete when it was discovered in 1990 near Faith. Federal agents seized the fossil in 1992, alleging paleontologist Pete Larson and his Black Hills Institute of Geological Research took it from federal trust land.



Larson was later charged on four unrelated counts and sentenced to two years in federal prison.



The documentary spurred South Dakota lawmakers to pass a resolution pushing for a presidential pardon.
