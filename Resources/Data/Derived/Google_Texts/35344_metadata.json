It is a period of time long enough that I\u2019m convinced you can Google \u201cJoe Biden [random noun]\u201d and have at least a 50-50 shot of finding a humorous mix of news and satire: anecdotes, gems from The Onion, memes, and perhaps the occasional quote.\n\nIn honor of IHOP\u2019s National Pancake Day this Tuesday, March 3, 2015, I present to you An Abbreviated History of Joe Biden and Pancakes.\n\n\u2014\n\nGoogle result: 151,000 results in 0.5 seconds.\n\nBiden tries selling Obamacare to a Canadian\n\nOur first link result is a Facebook post from Butterfield\u2019s Pancake House & Restaurant in Scottdale, Ariz.\n\nBiden visited the establishment in late February last year to try \u201cselling Obamacare to customers, including a young woman sitting outside the restaurant,\u201d KTVK reported. Red Alert continued:\n\n\u201cEverybody young signs up for health care,\u201d Biden told the young lady. \u201cIt\u2019s affordable, you can get subsidies to do it, and it\u2019s in your interest. And if you don\u2019t even want to do it for yourself, do it for your parents. Give \u2018em peace of mind.\u201d\n\nThe problem was, Biden was barking up the wrong tree, inadvertently trying to sell the new healthcare to a Canadian visitor named Jackie.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t know if I should say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, [I\u2019m] Canadian, don\u2019t know if I can help you out,\u201d she told the news camera after Biden moved on.\n\nNavigate to 1:30 of the video below:\n\n\u2018Guess those pancakes didn\u2019t soak up the tequila\u2019\n\nOur next stop on the search page is an Onion classic from campaign season, 2012, when Biden had to pause in the middle of a debate with Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan.\n\n\u201d \u2018Hurrrrck, hurrrck, huhhhgluahh!\u2019 retched the doubled-over Biden, who dazedly wiped his mouth and eyes with a leather sleeve before regaining his composure. \u2018Phew! Sorry, folks, just needed to shoot that out of the system. Guess those pancakes didn\u2019t soak up the tequila as well as I thought.\u2018 \u201c\n\n\u2018The Painter of Pancakes\u2019\n\nBiden has received the pancake treatment from Dan Lacey, \u201cThe Painter Of Pancakes.\u201d The artist is known to take \u201cpolitical figures and put pancakes on their heads,\u201d he told The Huffington Post in a 2013 interview, and he said this of his inspiration for the \u201cgimmick:\u201d\n\n\u201d \u2026 there was a fellow in Japan who trained his pet bunny rabbit named Oolong to balance food items on his head. One of the things he balanced were dorayaki, Japanese pancakes that hold bean paste. The image of this rabbit balancing the pancake became an Internet meme for I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.People would say, I don\u2019t have a response so here is a rabbit balancing a pancake on its head.\u201d\n\n\u2018Is this a jeep? That\u2019s a pancake! Damn!\u2019\n\nIf ever there was a political figure who didn\u2019t need the Bad Lip Reading treatment, it\u2019s the VP.
