Indian country itself is a land of rezzes. There are big ones, little ones and even rezzes that border-wise, look a bit like checkerboards. But this is just geography. What else signifies that we as Native people, or anyone for that matter – is actually on reservation land?

We are going to be putting out our feelers on this one because we at ICTMN KNOW our readers will have some good ones as far as just ways to tell … You Know You Are Probably On the Rez When.
