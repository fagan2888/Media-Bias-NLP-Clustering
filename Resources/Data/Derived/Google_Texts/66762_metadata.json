Then there\u2019s the next step: figuring out where to go, a task that can feel daunting when you\u2019re already overwhelmed.\n\nThe best way to find a provider is through a referral, says Beverly Palmer, a clinical psychologist in Torrance, Calif. If possible, ask your regular doctor, or seek a recommendation from someone you know.\n\nAt www.mentalhealth.gov, a site run by the federal government, you can type in your Zip code to get a list of providers in your area. The National Alliance on Mental Illness is another resource. NAMI chapters offer peer support groups, special programs for veterans and support for family members.\n\nSome mental health conditions have organizations that can direct you to a qualified provider, Palmer says. For instance, Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance offer lists of providers who treat those conditions.\n\nAnother good resource, especially if you don\u2019t have insurance, is your county health clinic, Palmer says. You can also search on the Internet or in a phone book for \u201cmental health\u201d services in your city or county. Be careful, though: Anyone can call himself a counselor, Palmer says, but you want someone who is licensed so you know they\u2019re properly trained.\n\nThere are several types of licensed professionals. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who have done a three-year residency in psychiatry. They prescribe medications and are trained to manage psychiatric medications, Palmer says. Psychologists have four-year doctoral degrees in psychology, plus two years of internship. \u201cIn some states, psychologists can prescribe if they go through additional training,\u201d Palmer says.\n\nLicensed clinical social workers have a master\u2019s degree plus 3,000 hours of internship training. \u201cThey\u2019re not only trained in psychotherapy, but they\u2019re also good at understanding community resources and working with families,\u201d Palmer says. Marriage and family therapists also have master\u2019s degrees and internship training, and while the training emphasizes issues relating to marriage and family, some also have extra training to work with children or adolescents, Palmer says. Finally, a licensed mental health counselor or professional clinical counselor has a two-year degree and 3,000 hours of supervised training.\n\nAs long as you choose someone who is licensed, the type of degree the person has is probably less important than whether he or she has training in the type of problem you\u2019re experiencing and feels like a good fit, Palmer says. (And you don\u2019t necessarily need a psychiatrist if your treatment includes medication, because other professionals can arrange for a doctor to prescribe it, Palmer says.)\n\nBefore you start, ask questions so you know what to expect, says Ken Duckworth, medical director at NAMI. It\u2019s okay to ask, \u201cDo you think you can help me?\u201d he says. Good questions, Duckworth says, include: What\u2019s your approach? How will you communicate with my other medical providers? How many people with my condition have you treated, and how have they fared? Do you have measures so we can see if I\u2019m getting better?\n\n\u201cBe an educated consumer,\u201d says Paolo del Vecchio, director of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s Center for Mental Health Services in Rockville. \u201cDo your shopping and ask questions: \u2018What is your therapeutic approach? What\u2019s your specialty? What is the cost?\u2019 \u201d The cost usually increases with the amount of training the provider has, but it can vary greatly.\n\nBefore you make an appointment, contact your health insurer to make sure the provider you\u2019ve chosen is covered in your plan. The Affordable Care Act requires parity for mental health coverage, which means that insurers must provide the same level of coverage (including rates, co-pays and deductibles) for mental health as for physical disorders, Palmer says. For instance, plans must cover preventive services such as depression screening and behavioral assessments without cost, and they can\u2019t deny you insurance or increase your rates due to preexisting mental health conditions.\n\nWhomever you choose, you should feel comfortable with the person. Trust your instincts, del Vecchio says. You want someone who really listens and has a plan for how your treatment will proceed.\n\nA task force commissioned by the American Psychological Association concluded in 2011 that \u201cThe therapy relationship accounts for why clients improve (or fail to improve) at least as much as the particular treatment method.\u201d\n\nThe group also found that certain factors seemed particularly valuable. An alliance between the therapist and client, a sense of collaboration and an active solicitation of feedback from the client seem to improve the chances of success, Palmer says. There should be a consensus about the goals of therapy. \u201cThe goals are stated,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just talk, talk, talk. There are specific goals you create together.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re working with a licensed professional, you can be assured that your privacy will be protected, del Vecchio says.\n\n\u201cRecovery is possible,\u201d del Vecchio says. Mental illness is not a life sentence, he says. \u201cPeople overcome these issues to lead happy, productive lives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, mental health help, finding mental health help, mental illness help, mental health doctor, mental health oranizations", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Try to get a recommendation, and keep in mind you need someone experienced with your condition.", "title": "Here\u2019s how to find help with mental health problems", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/looking-for-help-with-mental-health-problems-here-are-tips-for-the-search/2014/08/18/5f698c40-2226-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/08/18/Health-Environment-Science/Images/Mhealth.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Try to get a recommendation, and keep in mind you need someone experienced with your condition.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/looking-for-help-with-mental-health-problems-here-are-tips-for-the-search/2014/08/18/5f698c40-2226-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health, mental health help, finding mental health help, mental illness help, mental health doctor, mental health oranizations", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "5f698c40-2226-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec98\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBe an educated consumer,\u201d says Paolo del Vecchio, director of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s Center for Mental Health Services in Rockville.\nThe Affordable Care Act requires parity for mental health coverage, which means that insurers must provide the same level of coverage (including rates, co-pays and deductibles) for mental health as for physical disorders, Palmer says.\nWhen you\u2019re in the throes of a mental health problem, making the decision to seek help is hard enough.\nYou can also search on the Internet or in a phone book for \u201cmental health\u201d services in your city or county.\nSome mental health conditions have organizations that can direct you to a qualified provider, Palmer says."}
