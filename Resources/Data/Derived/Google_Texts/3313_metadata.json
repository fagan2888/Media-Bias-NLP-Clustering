SHUTDOWN SHOWDOWN\n\nWatch your head with that low ceiling: We\u2019re T-minus two days until we hit the debt ceiling, which means the U.S. is getting closer and closer to not being able to pay all its bills.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s Democratic and Republican leaders say they\u2019re optimistic we might actually avoid default and get out of the partial government shutdown in the coming days.\n\nBut the main sticking points come down to how long an agreement would fund the government (to end the shutdown) and how long to extend the debt limit.\n\nGoing to call my bank tomorrow and ask them to raise my debt ceiling. Apparently that's all you have to do when you owe money and have none \u2014 Anonymoose (@RumBraker) October 15, 2013\n\nWhile plans for a deal are still squishy as a blobfish, Democratic sources say the latest plan involves:\n\n\u2013 Funding the government through January 15, but requiring budget negotiators to come up with a funding deal in December;\n\n\u2013 Increasing the debt ceiling through February 15;\n\n\u2013 Adding a way to verify incomes for Obamacare subsidies;\n\n\u2013 And Delaying Obamacare\u2019s \u201ctransitional reinsurance fee,\u201d which would cost employers about $65 per employee per year for three years.\n\n(Yes, you read that right \u2013 there may be a few Obamacare concessions.)\n\nNow we\u2019ll wait and see what Senate Republicans think after they meet at 9 a.m. today. House Republicans will meet at the same time to figure out what they want to do.\n\nAnd if everyone agrees, we may finally have fiscal kumbayah.\n\nI predict my days end tomorrow they will have a plan in place to open the government as well as raise the debt ceiling. \u2014 Uncle Sam Daily (@unclesamdaily) October 15, 2013\n\nWe\u2019ll have a team of reporters at the top of the 6, 7 and 8 o\u2019clock hours to tell us how close we are (or aren\u2019t) to ending the shutdown and reaching a debt ceiling deal.\n\n2. AL LIBI IN NEW YORK\n\nThe long arm of the law: So a team of U.S. special operations forces swooped into Libya and nabbed a suspected al Qaeda operative accused in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.\n\nThat made a lot of U.S. officials happy. But now, some are peeved that Abu Anas al Libi, who was held for days and interrogated aboard a Navy ship, is now in New York.\n\nRep. Peter King, R-New York, said it\u2019s \"unfortunate that al Libi is on American soil.\u201d\n\n\"It shows the inherent flaws in the U.S. policy decision to try (terror suspects) in the U.S. because once you arrive on U.S. soil, that ends the interrogation of these high-value detainees,\" he said, adding that would not have happened if al Libi had been sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and faced a military commission there.\n\nBut State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said last week that there was no chance that al Libi would end up at Guantanamo.\n\n\"The administration's position on Guantanamo is clear. Our goal is not to add to the population, it's to reduce it, which we've done,\u201d she said.\n\nA U.S. official said al Libi received care at a medical facility in New York for a pre-existing medical condition and is \"doing better.\"\n\n@DonteStallworth Even suspected terrorist get free healthcare? Thoughts? http://t.co/vQMQj1J5z9 \u2014 pam grimes (@pambelina35) October 15, 2013\n\nAl Libi is expected to appear in a New York federal court today.\n\nDeborah Feyerick will be live from Lower Manhattan's federal courthouse in the 6 and 8 o\u2019clock hours to tell us what's next for al Libi.\n\n3. MISSOURI ALLEGED RAPE\n\nRetaliation for rape claim? It\u2019s a horrible tale we\u2019ve heard before \u2013 a teen girl drinks too much in the company of an older boy, passes out and may have gotten raped.\n\nBut Daisy Coleman\u2019s story is different. Even though the 17-year-old boy she was with was arrested, the sexual assault charge against him was dropped. And his friend, who was charged with recording part of the incident on an iPhone, was also cleared.\n\nThe local prosecutor told The Kansas City Star there wasn\u2019t enough evidence.\n\nThe local sheriff said authorities couldn\u2019t move forward because the Coleman family\u2019s stories have changed.\n\nThe Colemans say that\u2019s not true. What\u2019s worse, the family says, is the cyberbullying and threats they\u2019ve received. Mom Melinda Coleman said she was fired from her job. The Colemans said they had to move out of Maryville, Missouri.\n\nNow the hacker-activist group Anonymous is getting involved, calling on authorities to reopen the case.\n\nSome small-town Sheriff isn't just going down this. The state politicians who can do something, but refuse, will be named. #OpMaryville \u2014 Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) October 15, 2013\n\nMelinda Coleman says on @CNN other girls have come forward to her, admitting rape occurred, involving the same men. #Justice4Daisy \u2014 Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) October 14, 2013\n\nThe boy Daisy was with was a high school football player, stirring memories of the rape case in Steubenville, Ohio, in which two high school football players were convicted of raping a drunk 16-year-old girl.\n\nAna Cabrera will be live in the 8 o\u2019clock hour to tell us more about Daisy\u2019s case and how the family says it was driven out of town.\n\n4. CARNIVAL CRUISE DROWNING\n\nTragedy on a ship: A 6-year-old boy drowned on a Carnival cruise ship pool, even though plenty of other vacationers were nearby.\n\nRevelers were dancing to music by the mid-ship pool when a DJ noticed the boy struggle, passenger Deshaun Christian said.\n\nA guest then jumped into the pool with his clothes on and pulled the boy out, followed by a crew member who tried to revive him, Christian said. But the boy was pronounced dead shortly later.\n\nThe question is, why wasn\u2019t anyone watching over the young boy? The Miami-Dade Police Department said it is still investigating the drowning, which appeared to be accidental. Police said the boy was in the pool with his 10-year-old brother when he was found submerged.\n\nA Carnival spokeswoman said the company does not have lifeguards on duty at its pools, and parental supervision is required for children under 13.\n\nFlorida boy, 6, drowns in Carnival cruise pool http://t.co/PedrCObGm7 Terrible! Where were his parents? Why are 80% of drown victims male? \u2014 Marita La Palm \u0645\u0631\u064a\u062a\u0627 (@maritalp) October 14, 2013\n\nIn the 6 o\u2019clock hour, hear from a passenger who helped pull the boy out of the water.\n\n5. MEDAL OF HONOR\n\nFinally, some good news out of Washington: Four years after he was outnumbered and outgunned in a brutal battle in Afghanistan, retired U.S. Army Capt. William Swenson will be awarded the highest military honor in a presidential ceremony Tuesday.\n\nSwenson risked his life to recover the bodies of his fellow soldiers in the Battle of Ganjgal Valley, where five Americans died.\n\n\"In seven hours of continuous fighting, Swenson braved intense enemy fire, and willfully put his life in danger against the enemy's main effort, multiple times in service of his fallen and wounded comrades, his unit, his country, and his endangered Afghan partners,\u201d the nomination statement reads.\n\nSwenson spoke out after the 2009 battle, criticizing his leadership for failing to provide him with adequate air support after multiple radio requests. The Army later backed up his claims.\n\nCaptain William D. Swenson exemplified the highest ideals of an American Soldier http://t.co/aKVHC01TFU \u2014 Guinevere Pherson (@guinpherson) October 15, 2013\n\nThose are your five biggies for the day. Here are a few others that are brewing and have the Internet buzzing:\n\n- Gold is the new black: Remember that terrible but unforgettable song \u201cFriday\u201d by pop star wannabe Rebecca Black? Nothing could be worse, right? Try \"Chinese Food\u201d by Alison Gold. Gold teamed up with same production team that assaulted our ears with \"Friday.\" This sadly-destined-to-be-viral video gives us a new buffet of cringe-worthy moments: A teen girl frolicking with a grown man in a panda suit; that same man rapping at a teen slumber party; and Gold pointing at a giant bowl of \u201cchow ma, ma, ma, ma, mein\" in the sky. Enjoy.\n\n- Who\u2019s that turkey in the window?: That\u2019s what this turkey\u2019s probably thinking as it tries to peck its own reflection. Our guess? He realized for the first time that he\u2019s a turkey and knows all too well how close we are to Thanksgiving. So sad.\n\n- Cyrus gets schooled: Recent attempts to give Miley Cyrus advice have failed miserably. We\u2019re looking at you, Sinead O\u2019Connor. Now, here comes indie darling Sufjan Stevens with some grammar advice for the \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d singer. Stevens has a soft touch, so maybe this\u2019ll end nicely. \u201cDear Miley, I can\u2019t stop listening to #GetitRight (great song, great message, great body), but maybe you need a quick grammar lesson.\u201d For one thing, you \u201clie\u201d in your bed; not \u201clay,\u201d he tells her. And to add a special touch of irony, a Vice editor then pens an open letter correcting Sufjan's open letter to Miley. Isn't the Internet wonderful?\n\n- Cooler than 'Gravity': This new video gives us a first-person perspective of Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner\u2019s recent jump from the stratosphere. It also answers the question of what a man sees when he jumps from the edge of space. Spoiler alert: The answer is a big slice of awesome!\n\n- Clothed monkey grooms cat: The real question here is not why this monkey\u2019s wearing an oh-so-cool T-shirt. The burning question is not why this monkey\u2019s eating the stuff he\u2019s taking off of this cat. And while puzzling, the question\u2019s not how can this cat stay asleep while it\u2019s being manhandled by a trendy-T-shirt-wearing monkey. The real question here is: What in the hell is this monkey saying throughout this video? WHAT IS THE MONKEY SAYING!?\n\nThere you go.
