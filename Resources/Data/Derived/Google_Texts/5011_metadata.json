Obama's nominee is Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJuanita Duggan , president and CEO of the conservative business group, said before Garland\u2019s pick was announced that the next justice could determine the outcome of several cases in which NFIB is a plaintiff that could radically expand the federal government\u2019s control over the economy.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are far too high for small businesses to watch this process from the sidelines,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe NFIB is challenging the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s contentious Waters of the U.S. rule, which expands the federal government\u2019s authority over local bodies of waters, as well as the agency's Clean Power Plan, which forces states to phase out the use of coal as a source of energy.\n\nThe group is also expecting a case challenging the National Labor Relation Board\u2019s \u201cambush election\u201d rule to make it\u2019s way to the high court. Business groups argue the rule gives organized labor an unfair advantage over employers.\n\nAs a result, the NFIB is planning to carefully vet Obama\u2019s nominee. Duggan said the candidate\u2019s judicial record will be reviewed for decisions in past cases involving regulations that bear enormous costs to small businesses, as well as the candidate\u2019s public statements on business, labor issues, property rights or other topic that indicates his or her disposition.\n\nAfter Obama announced his nomination of Garland Wednesday morning, the NFIB called its initial review of the judge's record \u201cvery discouraging.\u201d\n\n\u201cA cursory examination of his record points to a judge who nearly always sides with regulators, labor unions and trial lawyers at the expense of small businesses,\u201d Duggan said in a statement.\n\nShe later added that, \u201csmall business has been under heavy pressure from the EPA, the DOL, the NLRB, and the rest of the alphabet soup of regulators that have expanded their power over the private sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudge Garland has an extensive record and based on our initial examination we have grave concerns,\u201d she said.\n\nNFIB has vowed to be heavily engaged in the nomination process.\n\n\u201cThis administration has pushed the boundaries of executive power over private enterprise and increasingly the Supreme Court is where these fights are decided,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit this one out.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The group is lead plaintiff in a number of upcoming cases.", "description": "The group is lead plaintiff in a number of upcoming cases.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The group is lead plaintiff in a number of upcoming cases.", "title": "Small business lobby to vet Supreme Court nominee", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/273211-nfib-to-vet-supreme-court-nominee", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/scotus_021916cl.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-16T12:10:59-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-16T12:10-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/273211-nfib-to-vet-supreme-court-nominee", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-16T10:10-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-16T10:10:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T12:10:59-04:00"}, "keywords": "National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, Antonin Scalia, Supreme Court of the United States,Juanita Duggan,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/273211-nfib-to-vet-supreme-court-nominee", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The group is lead plaintiff in a number of upcoming cases.", "card": "summary", "title": "Small business lobby to vet Supreme Court nominee"}, "dcterms.title": "Small business lobby to vet Supreme Court nominee"}, "article_summary": "The nation\u2019s small business lobby is entering the battle over filling the Supreme Court vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia.\nThe National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) announced plans Wednesday to, for the first time in the group\u2019s 73-year history, thoroughly analyze the record of a Supreme Court pick.\n\u201cThis administration has pushed the boundaries of executive power over private enterprise and increasingly the Supreme Court is where these fights are decided,\u201d Duggan said.\nObama's nominee is Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\u201cThe stakes are far too high for small businesses to watch this process from the sidelines,\u201d she said in a statement."}
