The dramatic reversal\u2014in both function and ideology of the Assembly Republican Caucus\u2014mirrors the California GOP\u2019s leftward shift, which has eschewed social conservatives as a \u201cfringe\u201d element.\n\nBy softening the party\u2019s stances on issues like illegal immigration, traditional marriage, Common Core, and ObamaCare, the GOP establishment both nationally and here in California believes the party will attract more voters from the center than the party loses from the right.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTime will tell, but I believe that that entire premise is flawed. When was the last time the country got excited about a \u201cmushy moderate\u201d?\n\nVoters are extremists when it comes to issues that affect them personally. Self-interest is one of the most powerful human forces because it stems from our own survival instinct.\n\nEvery election the \u201cconsultant class\u201d has some complicated explanation about why you should vote for someone who doesn\u2019t represent your views on virtually any issue. And every election, it fails.\n\nJust watch when Jeb Bush comes to California. The only enthusiasm he\u2019s likely to inspire is among the mega-donors who want to be part of the coronation, the consultants vying for his fat wallet, and the politicians hoping to help themselves by helping his campaign.\n\nAmericans love underdogs, not overlords. And the Assembly Republican Caucus minority leader might be wise to heed that simple truth.\n\nThis tectonic shift, which was portrayed by Olsen as \u201cmodernization\u201d in a recent speech at the Sacramento Press Club, is the final purge of movement conservatives from caucus staff. (By the way, the Sacramento Press Club only invites liberals, leftists and \u201ccaged conservatives\u201d, who talk a big game, but don\u2019t believe in anything.)\n\nBoth the liberal Sacramento Bee and Los Angeles Times gushed over the move.\n\n\u201cWith Republicans firmly in the minority, and unable to advance many of their policy priorities, the reorganization is an acknowledgment that no amount of internal budget or policy work is likely to help the party disseminate its message and grow its ranks,\u201d noted the Bee\u2018s Christopher Cadelago.\n\nBy dismissing some of the most veteran and most conservative policy staffers, Minority Leader Olsen has done a U-turn, altering the fundamental direction and purpose of the caucus. Rather than proposing real policy alternatives, the GOP will spend taxpayer dollars trying to \u201cbe liked.\u201d Call it the Sally Field strategy.\n\nInstead of receiving substantive analysis from seasoned, principled conservatives, who cut their teeth as activists and scholars, Republican Assembly members will likely receive watered-down analyses that reek of political correctness rather than correct principles. Principles have the power to unite when properly articulated, but no amount of public relations can overcome a lack of legitimate purpose.\n\nWhile Olsen\u2019s move may seem strategic and expedient to some, like the ever-pragmatic California GOP Chairman Jim Brulte, it is nothing less than the surrender of the loyal opposition party. Instead of engaging Democrats in battle, the California GOP and Assembly Republican Caucus have given in. If you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em. Now, there really will only be one political class instead of two distinct political philosophies in conflict.\n\nInstead of fighting public sector unions, and the never-ending tax increases they\u2019ve forced on working Californians, the state party has invited the unions to buy off the GOP just as they have the Democrats. And now, the caucus staffers, whose analysis is the strongest indicator of how most Republican Assembly members will vote, will be written by the same consultants who brought us Neel Kashkari, Meg Whitman and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nAnd how\u2019d that work out?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Purge: California GOP Kicks out Conservative Policy Staff", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Purge: California GOP Kicks out Conservative Policy Staff", "title": "Purge: California GOP Kicks out Conservative Policy Staff - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3202, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Breitbart-California-Joel-Pollak-Breitbart-News.jpg", "height": 2403}, "updated_time": "2015-03-27T12:52:48-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/27/purge-california-gop-kicks-out-conservative-policy-staff/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Purge: California GOP Kicks out Conservative Policy Staff", "title": "Purge: California GOP Kicks out Conservative Policy Staff - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Breitbart-California-Joel-Pollak-Breitbart-News.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "California Republican Party, GOP Establishment, kristin olsen, purge, Sacramento,Big Government, Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-03-27T12:37:40-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-03-27T12:52:48-07:00", "tag": "Sacramento", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf560\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn a little-noticed move this week, California State Assembly Minority Leader Kristin Olsen, completed a purge of \u201cconservative\u201d policy staffers.\nInstead of engaging Democrats in battle, the California GOP and Assembly Republican Caucus have given in.\nAnd the Assembly Republican Caucus minority leader might be wise to heed that simple truth.\nBy dismissing some of the most veteran and most conservative policy staffers, Minority Leader Olsen has done a U-turn, altering the fundamental direction and purpose of the caucus.\nThe dramatic reversal\u2014in both function and ideology of the Assembly Republican Caucus\u2014mirrors the California GOP\u2019s leftward shift, which has eschewed social conservatives as a \u201cfringe\u201d element."}
