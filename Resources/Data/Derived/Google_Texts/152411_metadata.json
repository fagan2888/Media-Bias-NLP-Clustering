As he looked at how the insurance sector was evolving, he thought United should start developing narrower products to help patients be more involved in their own healthcare. \u201cUltimately, it wasn\u2019t a perfect fit for United,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I raised my hand and said, \u2018I\u2019d like to give this a try\u2019 and went off and started SeeChange.\u201d\n\nAs Obamacare aims to change a broken healthcare system and more and more healthtech companies look to innovate, the insurance models consumers are used to are rapidly changing. For SeeChange, that means pivoting away from a system where patients head to the doctor when they\u2019re sick, pay their copays, and are responsible for following through on medication and follow-up care. The company is working to incentivize patients to commit to their own preventative care, dealing with issues like weight gain and chronic conditions like diabetes before they become an even bigger problem. The idea is to keep patients healthier\u2014and also to save money, both for insurance companies and employers.\n\nThough the idea of incentivized care has been kicked around by a lot of healthcare reform advocates, Watson has only seen a few direct competitors\u2014so far. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a unique model right now, but we expect several others to be saying the same thing pretty soon,\u201d he says. In New York, for example, Oscar Insurance has a similar model, but SeeChange has yet to see competitors in California.\n\nSeeChange creates incentives and reminders to help motivate patients to take care of themselves\u2014both through its own insurance company, and through the software solutions it builds for other companies, which integrate benefit plans with health data, claims, and action plans to give consumers a better view of their health and how they can improve it.\n\nSix years after Watson founded SeeChange, the 85-person company is actually two different businesses\u2014SeeChange Health Solutions, which provides software to other companies, and SeeChange Health Insurance. To date, the company has raised more than $80 million, with investors including Psilos Group and other institutional investors. Companies like UnitedHealthcare and Medica use its solutions products, while 4,000 employer groups with 35,000 employees between them have signed on for its insurance plans.\n\nOn the insurance side, the company offers fully insured plans for small to midsize employers, companies with between two and 200 or more employees, and self-insured plans for companies with 100 to 1,000 or more employees. \u201cThe idea was that typically, the really large, self-funded employers get the innovative designs, because they\u2019re demanding it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe smaller end of the employer segment, sometimes they just don\u2019t get those innovations, because the insurance companies have to pick up those costs.\u201d\n\nSeeChange\u2019s plans offer built in rewards; employees are given a six-month window to complete a biometric screening and a health risk questionnaire. When they do, they\u2019re rewarded with breaks like a $1,000 deductible reduction, or a shift in coinsurance payments from 30 percent of the overall bill to zero. In some plans, the company will kick patients a few hundred dollars into a rewards account that can be used to pay other medical expenses.\n\nWhen screenings find that patients do have health issues like high blood pressure or a high body-mass index, for example, SeeChange will \u2026 Next Page \u00bb\n\nTrending on Xconomy", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Xconomy", "description": "Before he founded SeeChange Health in 2008, CEO Martin Watson was working on new products for UnitedHealthcare Strategy, a wing of the giant healthcare net", "title": "At SeeChange, Giving Insured Patients Incentives to Stay Healthy | Xconomy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.xconomy.com/wordpress/wp-content/images/2014/07/Martin-Watson-Headshot.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-21T12:10:56+00:00", "url": "http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2014/07/21/at-seechange-giving-insured-patients-incentives-to-stay-healthy/", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "kB8sd1DYBBxgDN18IeVmM224YUBB03iZS3Z3kL6qXBw", "twitter": {"domain": "Xconomy", "description": "Before he founded SeeChange Health in 2008, CEO Martin Watson was working on new products for UnitedHealthcare Strategy, a wing of the giant healthcare net", "creator": "@xconomy", "image": {"src": "http://www.xconomy.com/wordpress/wp-content/images/2014/07/Martin-Watson-Headshot.jpg"}, "title": "At SeeChange, Giving Insured Patients Incentives to Stay Healthy | Xconomy", "site": "@xconomy", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Before he founded SeeChange Health in 2008, CEO Martin Watson was working on new products for UnitedHealthcare Strategy, a wing of the giant healthcare net", "article": {"section": "National blog main", "tag": "UnitedHealthcare", "published_time": "2014-07-21T06:30:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-21T12:10:56+00:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7023\"", "article_summary": "Six years after Watson founded SeeChange, the 85-person company is actually two different businesses\u2014SeeChange Health Solutions, which provides software to other companies, and SeeChange Health Insurance.\nThe idea is to keep patients healthier\u2014and also to save money, both for insurance companies and employers.\nBefore he founded SeeChange Health in 2008, CEO Martin Watson was working on new products for UnitedHealthcare Strategy, a wing of the giant healthcare network.\nIn some plans, the company will kick patients a few hundred dollars into a rewards account that can be used to pay other medical expenses.\nWhen screenings find that patients do have health issues like high blood pressure or a high body-mass index, for example, SeeChange will \u2026 Next Page \u00bbTrending on Xconomy"}
