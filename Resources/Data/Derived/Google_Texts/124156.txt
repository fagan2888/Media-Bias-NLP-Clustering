WOONSOCKET, R.I., June 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The first MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinic in Topeka opens today inside the CVS/pharmacy store at 3901 SW 21st St. Topeka Mayor Larry Wolgast will join CVS Health and MinuteClinic executives at the grand opening.

The clinic joins 11 other MinuteClinic locations in Kansas found inside select CVS/pharmacy stores in Lawrence, Leavenworth and the Kansas City metropolitan area. Nationwide, MinuteClinic, a division of CVS Health and the largest and fastest growing provider of walk-in medical clinics in the U.S., has nearly 1,000 locations in 31 states and the District of Columbia.

MinuteClinic is open seven days a week with no appointment necessary. Most major health insurance is accepted, including some of the plans offered through the Kansas State Employee Health Plan. For patients paying cash or credit, treatment prices are posted at each clinic and on www.minuteclinic.com. The cost for most services starts at $79.

"Targeted expansion into markets like Topeka brings high-quality, convenient and affordable health care services to community members," said Andrew Sussman, M.D., president, MinuteClinic and executive vice president/associate chief medical officer, CVS Health. "There is a need for more accessible and affordable health care in Kansas, and the demand for MinuteClinic services will continue to grow due, in part, to the shortage of primary care physicians, the aging Baby Boomer population and the influx of newly insured patients through the Affordable Care Act."

MinuteClinic nurse practitioners specialize in family health care and can diagnose, treat and write prescriptions for common family illnesses such as strep throat and ear, eye, sinus, bladder and bronchial infections. Minor wounds, abrasions, skin conditions and joint sprains are treated, and common vaccinations such as influenza, tetanus, pneumonia and Hepatitis A & B are available at most locations.

In addition, MinuteClinic administers a series of wellness services designed to help patients identify lifestyle changes needed to improve their current and future health. These include smoking cessation and weight loss management services and screenings and monitoring for diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

MinuteClinic practitioners use a software program that at the conclusion of each visit generates educational material and a prescription (when clinically appropriate) for the patient, as well as a diagnostic record that can be sent via electronic health record, fax or mail to a primary care provider with patient permission.

Nancy Zaner, MinuteClinic Midwest Area Director, says MinuteClinic is committed to helping patients find a medical home and believes it can play a complementary role in working with primary care providers.

"About 50 percent of MinuteClinic visits occur on evenings, weekends and holidays when patients may not be able to get an appointment with their primary care provider," Zaner said. "And about half of the patients seen at MinuteClinic are 'medically homeless' and do not have a personal physician."

Patients who visit MinuteClinic without a primary care provider are provided a list of physicians in the area who are accepting new patients, said Zaner.

The MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinic in Topeka operates from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Saturday; and 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Sunday.
