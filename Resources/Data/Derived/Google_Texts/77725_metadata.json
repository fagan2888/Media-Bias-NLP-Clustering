SB 10 passed the committee test yesterday on a 10-1 vote. Only Democrats were in favor, and most Republicans chose not to vote and abstained. Before being implemented, the state would need to receive approval from the federal government to offer the insurance. It was noted that the legislation would not allow people in the country illegally to receive subsidies available through the program.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Assemblyman Ricardo Lara, the author of the bill, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no rational reason, and frankly it\u2019s absurd, to deny anybody the opportunity to buy insurance through our state exchange.\u201d\n\nIllegal immigration continues to be a hot topic nationally, and the issue has been magnified during the current Presidential election cycle.\n\nWritten by BJ Hansen.
