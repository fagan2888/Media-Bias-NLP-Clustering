It is, like the article over which it appears, misleading. It misrepresents a new study from the left-leaning Urban Institute concerning projected health care spending in a way that suggests the nation has saved enormous amounts of money thanks to the \u201cAffordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThis is absurd, of course, but it highlights an underappreciated element of the health care reform debate\u2014the adversarial relationship that exists between Obamacare\u2019s partisans in the press and basic statistics. This running gun battle between math and the media manifests itself in two ways, depending on the limitations of individual journalists: Most just can\u2019t handle the numbers, and are thus easily taken in by specious studies and grifters like Jonathan Gruber. A far smaller group can manage the math but must ignore its implications in order to support \u201creform.\u201d\n\nA prominent member of the former cohort is Jonathan Cohn, who writes that the Urban Institute study is \u201cone more reason\u201d to feel good about PPACA: \u201cThe nation\u2019s total spending on medical care hasn\u2019t exploded, as legions of \u2018Obamacare\u2019 critics predicted.\u201d Noting that the government originally expected 2014-2019 health spending to be $23.6 trillion, he gleefully reports that the Urban Institute projects a mere $21 trillion: \u201cThe total will be $2.6 trillion less than the government\u2019s number crunchers thought it would be. That\u2019s a pretty big windfall.\u201d\n\nCohn seems confused about the definition of \u201cwindfall.\u201d Merriam-Webster defines the term thus: \u201cAn unexpected amount of money that you get as a gift.\u201d But the Urban Institute study is not about actual money. It simply provides projections based on a downward revision in the forecasts of Obama administration bureaucrats. Moreover, it uses \u201cinformation on actual health spending through 2012.\u201d In other words, the Urban Institute\u2019s rosy prognostications are built on data collected a year before the major provisions of Obamacare were implemented.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t stop Cohn from giving the law credit for the \u201cwindfall\u201d: \u201cDoes Obamacare have something to do with this? Probably.\u201d If he really believes this bilge, his parents should demand a refund from whatever university he attended. The study itself concedes that \u201cit is impossible to quantify how much ACA has truly contributed to reduced spending projections over time.\u201d Nonetheless, Cohn claims that the Urban Institute has provided \u201ca reason to think Obamacare\u2019s more sophisticated efforts at re-engineering medicine might just be working.\u201d\n\nNot all of Obamacare\u2019s media cheerleaders are as clueless as Cohn, of course. In addition to the \u201ccan\u2019t handle the numbers\u201d contingent to which he belongs, there is a far smaller group of journalists and pundits who can do the math but studiously ignore its implications for the health care law. The obvious leader of this cadre is Paul Krugman. Krugman is an economist and Nobel Laureate, so his routine misrepresentations of PPACA\u2019s \u201csuccesses\u201d cannot be written off to ignorance. He knows the truth but chooses to give his readers the mushroom treatment.\n\nKrugman has not, as of this writing, weighed in on the Urban Institute study but his claims about recent CBO projections for Obamacare make the point. For example, he recently wrote, \u201cRemember all the ridicule heaped on the spending projections in the Affordable Care Act? Actual spending is coming in well below expectations, and the Congressional Budget Office has marked its forecast for the next decade down by 20 percent.\u201d In this disingenuous passage, Krugman leaves out an important fact in order to make this sound like a success.\n\nWhen Krugman writes about \u201cactual spending\u201d coming in \u201cwell below expectations,\u201d he\u2019s referring to subsidies that aren\u2019t being paid because the number of Obamacare enrollees has been lower than initially projected. In other words, spending is down because Obamacare has failed to hit its goals. As Avik Roy points out in Forbes, \u201cThe CBO now thinks that 8 million fewer U.S. residents will gain coverage from the health law, compared to its original estimates.\u201d Krugman knows all this, yet he keeps his readers in the dark and feeds them\u2026 incomplete data.\n\nHe also feeds them Obama administration propaganda that doesn\u2019t even come close to passing the laugh test, In this column, for example, he complains that \u201cthe favorable experiences of the roughly 16 million Americans who have gained insurance so far have had little effect on public perceptions.\u201d This passage links directly to WhiteHouse.gov, though Krugman knows perfectly well that the numbers reported at that site were produced by HHS bureaucrats who have already been caught\u2014twice\u2014promulgating fraudulent Obamacare enrollment figures.\n\nHe compounds all this dishonesty by abusing anyone with the temerity to do the Obamacare math and arrive at the correct answer. But, like many progressive pundits, Krugman has a gift for unintentional irony. Ten days ago he churned out a blog post in which he bemoans the \u201ccheap, dishonest way\u201d that conservatives (here and abroad) discuss policy. As a particularly heinous example, he offers the following: \u201cIn the case of health reform, this amounts to the assertion that it has failed because many Americans continue to believe the opponents\u2019 lies.\u201d\n\nThis is a textbook example of projection, but not the type produced by the Urban Institute or the CBO. The irony is that Krugman\u2019s own lies, combined with the clumsy misrepresentations of math-challenged people like Cohn, have contributed heavily to the skepticism that most Americans feel about Obamacare. Most voters intuitively understand that the numbers don\u2019t add up. Sadly, the same cannot be said about most of the law\u2019s media cheerleaders.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In addition to the \u201ccan\u2019t handle the numbers\u201d contingent to which he belongs, there is a far smaller group of journalists and pundits who can do the math but studiously ignore its implications for the health care law.\nHe compounds all this dishonesty by abusing anyone with the temerity to do the Obamacare math and arrive at the correct answer.\nKrugman has not, as of this writing, weighed in on the Urban Institute study but his claims about recent CBO projections for Obamacare make the point.\nThat\u2019s a pretty big windfall.\u201dCohn seems confused about the definition of \u201cwindfall.\u201d Merriam-Webster defines the term thus: \u201cAn unexpected amount of money that you get as a gift.\u201d But the Urban Institute study is not about actual money.\nBut that doesn\u2019t stop Cohn from giving the law credit for the \u201cwindfall\u201d: \u201cDoes Obamacare have something to do with this?"}
