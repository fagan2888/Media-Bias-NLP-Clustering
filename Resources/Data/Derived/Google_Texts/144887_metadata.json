She was very modest. She didn't believe she was a very good artist.\n\n\"She just loved doing it.\"\n\nArt gallery and museum curator Jo Duke said: \"I'm beside myself with excitement. We're so privileged.\"\n\nThe value of the artworks is not yet known, but will be determined as part of the gallery's gift acceptance process.\n\nRuby has long been celebrated by the Gladstone art community.\n\nCampbell was born in 1888 and died in 1977.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Gladstone Observer", "description": "FAMED artist Ruby Campbell\u2019s family has donated her entire collection of works to Gladstone Regional Art Gallery and Museum.", "title": "Ruby Campbell art collection donated to Gladstone gallery", "url": "http://www.gladstoneobserver.com.au/news/ruby-campbell-art-collection-donated-gladstone/2228655/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2014/04/14/9-2288800-gla120414gall-9_fct905x682x48_ct300x300.jpg", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 142981949047780}, "viewport": "width=1020", "description": "FAMED artist Ruby Campbell\u2019s family has donated her entire collection of works to Gladstone Regional Art Gallery and Museum.", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"articleid": 2228655, "publishtime": "2014-04-14T09:16:25+1000"}, "pageclass": "article"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd636a\"", "article_summary": "Artist Ruby Campbell's niece Heather Stewart at the Gladstone Art Gallery and Museum.\nFAMED artist Ruby Campbell's family has donated her entire collection of works to Gladstone.\nMs Campbell's family made the announcement at the official opening of The Ruby Campbell Collection Exhibition.\nArt gallery and museum curator Jo Duke said: \"I'm beside myself with excitement.\nRuby has long been celebrated by the Gladstone art community."}
