Spokeswoman Wendy Zellner said hospital officials are reviewing the data and could not provide specific comment. She noted that the health system has \u201cbeen working vigorously to address these issues.\u201d\n\nOne of seven hospitals in rival health system Allegheny Health Network was penalized: St. Vincent in Erie.\n\nSpokesman Dan Laurent declined to comment.\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
