The barn reception and farmland scenery dovetailed perfectly with her vision.\n\n\u201cIn a barn, it's a lot easier to decorate the entire room in your style, and you don't have to worry about the character of the room clashing with your wedding,\u201d George said.\n\nThe wedding business in Butler County is strong, said Jack Cohen, president of the Butler County Tourism Bureau. Many traditional and non-traditional facilities are available to couples.\n\n\u201cIt's a big boost to our economy,\u201d said Cohen.\n\nThe average budget for a wedding in the United States last year was $28,427, according to a survey of 17,500 brides done by TheKnot.com, a popular wedding planning magazine and website. That's a $1,406 increase from the 2011 average of $27,021.\n\nJan McDonald, owner of the White Barn in Prospect, said it opened for weddings in May 2012 as another way to utilize the farmland.\n\nMcDonald hired local Amish to disassemble a 100-year-old barn in New Castle and reassemble it on the property, while adding modern conveniences such as heat, insulation and plumbing. The White Barn is already booked well into next year for weddings, McDonald said.\n\nThe Schmeiders, who own For All Family Farms in Butler, built a barn to accommodate activities related to their fall pumpkin patch and began booking it for weddings last year.\n\n\u201cWe started booking for next year, and we're already booked all the way through the summer,\u201d said Heather Schmeider. \u201cIt's been a wonderful outpouring of people.\u201d\n\nKathy Allen, co-owner of Armstrong Farms, might have started the trend in Butler County. She said the farm began hosting weddings 14 years ago after she restored three 1800s-era barns into wedding venues.\n\nAllen said the farm is about 95 percent reserved for 2014, as most brides book a year to year and a half in advance.\n\nJamie Miles, editor at TheKnot.com, said barn weddings are growing in popularity for the casual and personalized wedding experience they offer.\n\n\u201cThe standardized ballroom is going out of style,\u201d she said. \u201cThe open space and blank canvas of a barn lets them personalize however they'd like. And there's a big contrast element there that's appealing.\u201d\n\nBrides can style a barn with do-it-yourself elements for an informal affair or use elegant pieces \u201cto give a polished look to an otherwise casual location,\u201d Miles said.\n\n\u201cPeople want to put a personalized spin on wedding traditions,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don't want to do what the last bride did, they want to stand out.\u201d\n\nPersonalization is key at Armstrong Farms.\n\n\u201cWe don't do cookie-cutter weddings,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe don't just have one set-up. And we don't provide exclusivity for any vendors. We want brides and grooms to have autonomy.\u201d\n\nShe does, however, recommend that couples use local caterers, bakers, florists and overnight accommodations, to support local businesses.\n\n\u201cThat's really an important aspect \u2014 that everyone is involved in the community,\u201d Allen said.\n\nRachel Farkas is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
