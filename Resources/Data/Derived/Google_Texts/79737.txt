Demonstrator’s in New York have been going strong since a grand jury announced last week that no officers would be indicted over the death of Eric Garner and, thanks to John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, they will not go hungry.

New York Commissioner Bill Bratton predicted protests in the city would eventually “peter out,” but he was apparently wrong.

Legend and his supermodel wife, Teigen, hired food trucks on Sunday to feed protestors in Union Square.

Teigen, who deactivated her Twitter account in October following backlash from a joke she made about gun control in America, sent out a tweet to inform protestor’s of their contribution.

3-6pm. FREE food trucks by Trader Joe’s Union Sq. @ophelporhush #FergusontoNYC #NYC2Ferguson — ophelporhush (@ophelporhush) December 7, 2014

The general public was very receptive to the donation from the power couple, and many took to social media to thank them.
