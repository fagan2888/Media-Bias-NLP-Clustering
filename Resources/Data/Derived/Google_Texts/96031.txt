Patricio Garino and Tyler Cavanaugh each scored 18 points as George Washingtonstunned No. 6 Virginia 73-68 on Monday night.

The Colonials (2-0) took control with a 10-0 run that began with Garino’s three-point play for a 57-55 lead with 8:06 left. Garino added a tip-in and an assist on Cavanaugh’s layup. Cavanaugh hit two free throws to make it 64-55 with 5:24 remaining.

Virginia (1-1) was led by Malcolm Brogdon, who had 28 points and eight rebounds.

Brogdon was the only source of offense for the Cavaliers in the final minutes. After Evan Nolte hit a 3-pointer to give Virginia a 55-54 lead with 9½ minutes left, Brogdon scored 11 consecutive points for the Cavs. But after he stole the ball with 17 seconds to play and Virginia trailing by four, he missed a 3 with 10 seconds to play.

The Colonials had lost seven straight to the Cavaliers, and it was the biggest win for George Washington coach Mike Lonergan in his five seasons.

The game was played before a raucous crowd at the sold-out Smith Center, an arena that’s rarely full. Some of the students rushed the court after the final horn, but Virginia players were able to leave unharmed.

Big things are expected from the Cavaliers, who start three seniors and have lost twice in the last two years to Michigan State in the NCAA tournament.

The Colonials led most of the first half and had a 35-32 lead at halftime.
