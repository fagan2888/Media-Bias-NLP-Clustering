Washington, DC

Ahead of his South Dakota visit on Friday, President Barack Obama announced what he will be speaking about in Watertown.

During his weekly presidential address Sunday morning, the president discussed his desire to help everyone, both in urban and rural communities, to receive skills to land a good job.

"It's something I'll talk about in my commencement address next week at Lake Area Tech, in the small town of Watertown, South Dakota. It's a community college with a graduation rate that is nearly twice the national average. They're proving that a great education can be within everyone's reach," President Obama said.

Friday will be Obama's first presidential visit to the Mount Rushmore state.
