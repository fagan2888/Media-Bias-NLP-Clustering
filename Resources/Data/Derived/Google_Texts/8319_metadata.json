A new survey shows it's their top worry.\n\nResults of the National Small Business Association's 2014 Small Business Health Care Survey showed that 91 percent of small businesses in the study reported increases in their health plan at their most recent health insurance renewal with one in four being hit with increases exceeding 20 percent.\n\n\u201cCost is the number one driver of whether or not a small business will offer health insurance,\u201d stated NSBA President Todd McCracken. \u201cThese costs have real-world implications: one-third of small businesses held off on hiring a new employee and more than half say they held off on salary increases for employees.\u201d\n\nAmong the key findings of the NSBA survey: while the majority of employers think offering health insurance is very important to recruiting good employees, just 51 percent of the smallest firms offer health benefits. Among the 70 percent of small firms overall that do offer health insurance, the majority report paying for more than half of the cost of their employees\u2019 plans.\n\nToday the average monthly per-employee cost of health insurance premiums for a small firm is $1,121. When asked in 2009 for the estimated monthly cost of their health benefits package, per employee, it was just $590 per month.\n\n\u201cWidespread confusion over the Affordable Care Act still exists among the majority of small firms,\u201d said NSBA Chair Jeff Van Winkle of Clark Hill in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \u201cSmall businesses report spending on average 13 hours and $1,274 per month\u2014and that\u2019s just on the administrative side of understanding the law itself.\u201d\n\nThe 2014 Small Business Health Care Survey was conducted on-line Nov. 20 \u2013 Dec. 4, 2013 among more than 780 small-business owners.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How concerned are small businesses about the costs of implementing the new health care insurance laws?
