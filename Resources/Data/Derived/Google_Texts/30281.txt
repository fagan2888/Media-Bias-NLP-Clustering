Alabama State Troopers say a Graceville man was killed Saturday morning in a traffic crash in Dothan.

Troopers say 68 year old Henry Murrell was driving on US 84 just three miles west of Dothan at 10 a.m.. That's when he collided with another vehicle at the 196 mile marker.

Officials say Murrell was killed in the crash.

They're not releasing any further details as they continue to investigate.
