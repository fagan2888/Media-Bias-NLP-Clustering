The average rate hike for the first claim nationwide is 9%, but it's far worse in Wyoming (up 32% on average), Connecticut (21%), Arizona (20%), New Mexico (19%) and California (18%).\n\n\u201cInsurance is the only product we buy that we hope we're never going to have to use,\u201d says Laura Adams, insuranceQuotes.com\u2019s senior analyst. \"That 30% rate increase is for one claim. If you have a second claim, get really unlucky and have a problem in the next 12 months, that's just going to skyrocket.\u201d\n\nAnd not by a little. According to the report, the average nationwide premium increase for a second claim is 20%, with Michigan's insurers socking policyholders with a whopping 71% uptick if they file more than one claim within a brief span.\n\n\u201cThe home insurer looks at your past performance chart, and they're trying to price the policy according to the risk they're assuming on your behalf,\u201d says Michael Barry, spokesman for the nonprofit Insurance Information Institute. \u201cIf you file two policies in a short amount of time, I think insurers are going to take note.\u201d\n\nSo what should a homeowner do when considering a claim? Barry and Adams suggest weighing the cost of the claim against the deductible.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "article", "layout": "main", "description": "Homeowners insurance comes in handy, but making multiple small claims can cost policyholders almost a year's worth of extra payments.", "author": "Jason Notte", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Homeowners insurance comes in handy, but making multiple small claims can cost policyholders almost a year's worth of extra payments.", "title": "Why You Shouldn't Rush to File That Homeowners Insurance Claim", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/why-you-shouldnt-rush-to-file-that-homeowners-insurance-claim", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/treefallingonhouse.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/treefallingonhouse.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "date": "2015-04-21T08:30Z", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "keywords": "insurance, insurance claims, homeowners insurance, homeowners insurance claims, insurance deductible, homeowner's insurance deductible, CLUE report", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "CLUE report", "published_time": "2015-04-21T08:30Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1145802"}, "guid": 13102511, "twitter": {"description": "Homeowners insurance comes in handy, but making multiple small claims can cost policyholders almost a year's worth of extra payments.", "title": "Why You Shouldn't Rush to File That Homeowners Insurance Claim", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/why-you-shouldnt-rush-to-file-that-homeowners-insurance-claim", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/treefallingonhouse.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/treefallingonhouse.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "insurance, insurance claims, homeowners insurance, homeowners insurance claims, insurance deductible, homeowner's insurance deductible, CLUE report"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8de5\"", "article_summary": "According to a report from insuranceQuotes.com, filing a single homeowner\u2019s insurance claim can raise a policyholder's premiums by hundreds of dollars each year.\nADVERTISEMENTNEW YORK (MainStreet) \u2013 If a tree falls near your house, but doesn't hit a building and upends only one segment of your walkway, should you file an insurance claim?\nIf you have a second claim, get really unlucky and have a problem in the next 12 months, that's just going to skyrocket.\u201dAnd not by a little.\nThe average rate hike for the first claim nationwide is 9%, but it's far worse in Wyoming (up 32% on average), Connecticut (21%), Arizona (20%), New Mexico (19%) and California (18%).\nAccording to the report, the average nationwide premium increase for a second claim is 20%, with Michigan's insurers socking policyholders with a whopping 71% uptick if they file more than one claim within a brief span."}
