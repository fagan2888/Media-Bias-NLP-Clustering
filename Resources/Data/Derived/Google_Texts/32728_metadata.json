Ray Bourque skated off the ice in 2001 holding the Stanley Cup for the Avalanche. On Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway in south Florida, the Colorado team turned the tables and tried to ruin a retirement.\n\nMartin Truex Jr. and Denver-based Furniture Row Racing \u2014 longshots to even qualify for NASCAR\u2019s postseason, let alone race for a championship \u2014 were looking to upset Jeff Gordon in the final race of his career. Gordon was going for a fifth career season title.\n\nFour drivers \u2014 Truex, Gordon, Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick \u2014 bolted forward for the Sprint Cup championship. It was a race inside a race, with the top finisher among the four getting the trophy.\n\nDespite a broken leg and foot that kept him out of the first 11 races this season, Busch made up ground over the summer months in NASCAR\u2019s point standings and let more laps than any driver at Homestead to sprint to his first career Sprint Cup title. Busch, at 30 the youngest finalist, won the race and the season championship.\n\nHe held off Harvick, who finished second, over the final laps. Gordon heads into retirement after finishing third in the standings, sixth in the race.\n\nPHOTOS: Martin Truex Jr., Furniture Row at NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship\n\nTruex, in his second season piloting Denver\u2019s No. 78 car, propelled the outsider team \u2014 the Sprint Cup\u2019s only team based outside North Carolina \u2014 into a fourth-place finish overall, their best finish since debuting in 2005. He finished 12th in Sunday\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cWe just never really could get the car to react to what we wanted,\u201d Truex said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for lack of effort. The guys put a lot of work into this car in Denver.\u201d\n\nTruex and the 78 were attempting to become the first single-car team to win NASCAR\u2019s top-circuit title since Dale Earnhardt did it as a lone wolf with Richard Childress Racing in 1994.\n\nBut, with 32 laps to go, frustration settled in for Truex and his rookie crew chief, Cole Pearn. To that point, they spit-balled all options to get inject some speed in their 78 car. But they were fast running out of options. And Truex asked if they could inflate his right-side tires for more grip.\n\n\u201cFrustrating man, we\u2019re terrible,\u201d Truex said.\n\n\u201cJust keep clean,\u201d Pearn said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we got.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know bud, I\u2019m trying everything I can think of,\u201d Truex said.\n\nTruex gambled all day but his car didn\u2019t have enough speed. Before a nearly two-hour delay to start the race because of rain, the FRR team rejiggered the car\u2019s set-up, unhappy with how it handled in practice sessions Saturday.\n\nTruex, who has a history of running well at Homestead, started from the 11th spot, but quickly fell two spots and four seconds behind in the first three laps. But some aggressive decisions brought him back. On a yellow flag caution at Lap 172 of 267, Pearn hustled Truex off pit road on two fresh tires while the rest of the field took four. It worked. Truex took his first lead.\n\nBut after falling back again, Truex gambled again on Lap 215. Pearn pitted the 78 about 10 laps early, before needing fuel, in order to get fresh tires for more traction.\n\nBefore he could gain ground, Harvick and Gordon took his cue and copied the idea, pitting early and staying in front of Truex.\n\nTruex and Furniture Row each earned their best finish in the season standings but came away disappointed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come here saying we\u2019d be OK to finish fourth,\u201d Truex said. \u201cWe came here to do everything we could to win.\u201d\n\nBusch, the younger brother of FRR\u2019s former driver, Kurt Busch, topped his previous career-high fourth-place finish from 2013. He races for Joe Gibbs Racing, a team that will partner with Truex and FRR in a technical alliance starting next season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of my team,\u201d Truex said. \u201cWe have a lot to build on for the future.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke\n\nComing up short\n\nMartin Truex Jr. and Denver\u2019s Furniture Row Racing team tried to inject some speed in the 78 car Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway. But in a battle among four finalists, they fell short in NASCAR\u2019s Sprint Cup championship race. A look:\n\nHow it ended:\n\nKyle Busch used a favorable caution flag with 16 laps to go. His fast restart helped him take the lead from Brad Keselowski. And he held off hard-charging Kevin Harvick.\n\nTruex overcame a dangerous fire on pit road midway through after a lug nut sparked into the gas can.\n\nTruex gambled to pit early on Lap 168 and momentarily held the lead. But after replacing just two tires for a quicker pit stop, he lost his grip.\n\nStandings \u2026 Race finish \u2026 Laps led \u2026 Pole\n\n1. Kyle Busch \u2026 1st \u2026 41 \u2026 3\n\n2.
