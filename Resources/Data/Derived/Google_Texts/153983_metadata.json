The Pentagon is currently crafting a plan to reform the military hospital system, independent from efforts to revamp the Veterans Affairs (VA) system. The plan involves converting some hospitals into either birthing centers or outpatient clinics.\n\nHealthcare costs comprise nearly 10 percent of the defense budget and close to half of military hospital beds are apparently vacant--substantially more than those of civilian facilities, according to the article.\n\nThe hospitals also struggle with hierarchical problems, as more experienced clinicians often advance to administrative positions, leaving inexperienced doctors with overwhelming frontline responsibilities and concern that the frequent rotation of doctors, hospital commanders and patients is detrimental to continuity of care. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan exacerbate the problem, as personnel are called overseas and hospitals must relocate patients to the civilian healthcare system.\n\nThese problems have some veterans of military healthcare questioning whether the military should involve itself with healthcare at all.\n\n\"It's a dangerous game,\" John Schafer, former deputy commander for clinical operations at Reynolds Army Community Hospital in Oklahoma's Fort Sill, told the Times. \"It is crazy that the military doesn't say, 'Hey, we are really good at outpatient medicine and this inpatient thing is out of our league.'\"\n\nThe Pentagon began a systemwide review of care quality, patient safety and treatment access in late May, with the final report expected soon. The draft downsizing plan suggests the news is not good, according to the Times.\n\nThe latest investigation follows a Times report that found military hospitalslack clear patient safety standards and often don't complete required safety investigations after unexpected patient deaths or severe injuries, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMilitary hospitals lack patient safety standards, unexpected deaths go unchecked\n\nPatient load, lack of funding among the factors that led to the VA scandal\n\nMilitary hospitals bear brunt of sequester\n\nMilitary hospital closure racks up $2B tab\n\nAgencies call for standardization in military healthcare", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many military hospitals are too small with too few patients to produce quality outcomes for patients, according to a\u00a0New York Times investigation.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Many military hospitals are too small with too few patients to produce quality outcomes for patients, according to a\u00a0New York Times investigation.", "title": "Smaller military hospitals hurt patient outcomes", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/smaller-military-hospitals-hurt-patient-outcomes/2014-09-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Continuity Of Care,Empty Beds,inpatient care,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,military hospitals,New York Times,Patient Care & Outcomes,VA scandal", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "These problems have some veterans of military healthcare questioning whether the military should involve itself with healthcare at all.\nMany military hospitals are too small with too few patients to produce quality outcomes, according to a New York Times investigation.\nThe Pentagon began a systemwide review of care quality, patient safety and treatment access in late May, with the final report expected soon.\nLast year, two-thirds of military hospitals served no more than 30 inpatients a day and nine served no more than 10, according to the Times.\nThe Pentagon is currently crafting a plan to reform the military hospital system, independent from efforts to revamp the Veterans Affairs (VA) system."}
