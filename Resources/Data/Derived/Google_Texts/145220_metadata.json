Bush, Golf, Hillary Clinton, Iraq, Iraq war, Media Criticism, political pundits, Punditry, The Atlantic, Washington Post, Media News, Politics News\n\nFor your typical D.C. pundit, the month of August poses both a challenge and an opportunity. With no congressmen around to say stupid things and legislate poorly, it can sometimes be difficult to come up with the smart, fresh takes that your editors and legions of devoted fans require. One way to overcome this dearth of material is to move outside your comfort zone, find issues you don\u2019t normally cover and expand the breadth of your commentary. The other option is to just phone it in until September rolls around.\n\nIn that latter category we find Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank, who\u2019s written a piece this morning chastising President Obama for going golfing while things are happening in the world. This obsessive focus on Obama\u2019s golf habit has actually become a recreational activity in and of itself for D.C.\u2019s pundit class, who\u2019ve come to realize that the president\u2019s passion for the game \u2013 in an almost unbelievable coincidence \u2013 confirms every single criticism they\u2019ve lodged against him. What are the odds?\n\n\u201cObama vacations as the world burns,\u201d reads the headline to Milbank\u2019s column. The big, earth-shaking world event that Obama\u2019s blowing off to play golf is, per Milbank, Hillary Clinton\u2019s interview with the Atlantic in which she criticized Obama\u2019s foreign policy. Milbank apparently believes that Obama should have canceled his vacation and hunkered down in the Situation Room (the real one, not the Wolf Blitzer one) to deal with the devastation wrought by his former secretary of state chatting with a magazine:\n\nAs the criticism became public, Obama was doggedly sticking with his plans to go on vacation \u2014 a decision that, if not in the category of stupid stuff, could fit under the heading of \u201ctone deafness.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not readily apparent how canceling his vacation would have shown that Obama is in control of the Hillary-said-a-thing-in-public crisis. In fact, you could argue and not be wrong that an abrupt schedule change in response to a magazine interview would be the very definition of erratic. But whatever! This is August D.C.! Rules and logic are for wintertime pundits.\n\nWhich brings us to Milbank\u2019s larger point \u2013 it\u2019s all about the optics:\n\nEven presidents need down time, and Obama can handle his commander-in-chief duties wherever he is. But his decision to proceed with his getaway just 36 hours after announcing the military action in Iraq risks fueling the impression that he is detached as the world burns.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Milbank complains that the president is golfing too much, and offers a master class on lazy August punditry", "title": "Dana Milbank duffs it: Another D.C. pundit obsesses over Obama\u2019s golf game", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Milbank complains that the president is golfing too much, and offers a master class on lazy August punditry", "title": "Dana Milbank duffs it: Another D.C. pundit obsesses over Obama\u2019s golf game", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/12/dana_milbank_duffs_it_another_d_c_pundit_obsesses_over_obamas_golf_game/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/dana_milbank.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Milbank complains that the president is golfing too much, and offers a master class on lazy August punditry", "title": "Dana Milbank duffs it: Another D.C. pundit obsesses over Obama\u2019s golf game", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/dana_milbank.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Dana Milbank, Foreign policy, George W.
