Bass noted that \u201cSt. Louis isn\u2019t that big,\u201d and people who live in the community usually just refer to Ferguson as St. Louis.\n\n\u201cAs a community, Ferguson isn\u2019t a bad place to grow up. It\u2019s not the east side, with the gang violence and the killing.\u201d\n\nBass added that Ferguson and surrounding areas were once \u201call white.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut blacks from all over town started moving out of poorer neighborhoods into north county areas like Ferguson. There\u2019s a lot of diversity now, with white and black people living side by side.\u201d\n\nBut the police in Ferguson and surrounding areas \u201cstayed white,\u201d he added.\n\nGrowing up near Ferguson, Bass recalled that police were \u201chated\u201d before the whole Michael Brown incident. He even mentioned how, when he visits his hometown, police will harass him.\n\n\u201cWhen I go home, I get pulled over just because. They\u2019ll say, \u2018We\u2019re doing random checks,\u2019 which is against the law. Or they say there was a theft, and the getaway car was my black Durango.\u201d\n\nBass first heard about the Ferguson story on his Instagram feed, and saw images and videos of places being robbed and friends getting arrested. But he mentioned that he \u201ccan\u2019t justify Michael Brown\u2019s actions,\u201d since he doesn\u2019t know anything about the kid before he was shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.\n\n\u201cBut I know that police cannot shoot unarmed men, and the reason you have the violent reaction from the community is the violent, aggressive, and disrespectful way policing is done in the St. Louis area.\u201d\n\nBass noted that he is \u201call for the peaceful demonstrations\u201d taking place in Ferguson, but he doesn\u2019t agree with the looting.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re robbing people like it\u2019s a way out in this time of crisis, but it\u2019s really a sign of weakness and impatience and for a lot of people, it justifies the way we\u2019re being harassed and profiled.\u201d\n\nBass noted that he is uncertain when the riots in Ferguson will stop.\n\n\u201cAs far as I can see, there\u2019s no end to it.\u201d\n\nProtests are still taking place in Ferguson, and many have been updating via Twitter. One of those is St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Robert Cohen, who documented last night\u2019s protests in Ferguson.\n\nProtesters are coming in all sizes in Ferguson. #MikeBrown #Ferguson pic.twitter.com/rsY99rRG7G \u2014 Robert Cohen (@kodacohen) August 16, 2014\n\nRain doesn\u2019t seem to damper the spirits in Ferguson. #MikeBrown #Ferguson pic.twitter.com/mjsfJ2Lk9z \u2014 Robert Cohen (@kodacohen) August 16, 2014\n\nProtestors refuse to leave the street in Ferguson. #MikeBrown#Fergusonpic.twitter.com/K5xev4W2No \u2014 Robert Cohen (@kodacohen) August 16, 2014\n\nOthers have posted their opinions on the Ferguson story:\n\nWhen tax payers have to stand guard with guns to protect their property, it means anarchy.

But some Twitter users took a closer look and saw that the time stamp says the footage that the Ferguson police released is from June, not August.\n\n[Featured image via Fansided]\n\n[Inline image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images via Lake County News-Sun]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chicago Bears defensive end David Bass said the relationship between Ferguson police and its residents was bad before the Michael Brown killing.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Chicago Bears defensive end David Bass said the relationship between Ferguson police and its residents was bad before the Michael Brown killing.", "title": "Chicago Bears Player From Ferguson: \u2018I Get Pulled Over Just Because\u2019", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1415334/chicago-bears-player-from-ferguson-i-get-pulled-over-just-because/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/davidbass0816.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-16T14:04:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-16T14:31:50+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/davidbass0816.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-08-16T14:04:15+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "ferguson,ferguson missouri,michael brown,david bass,chicago bears,missouri,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/davidbass0816.jpg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Chicago Bears defensive end David Bass said the relationship between Ferguson police and its residents was bad before the Michael Brown killing."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe196e\"", "article_summary": "#MikeBrown #Ferguson pic.twitter.com/rsY99rRG7G \u2014 Robert Cohen (@kodacohen) August 16, 2014Rain doesn\u2019t seem to damper the spirits in Ferguson.\n#MikeBrown #Ferguson pic.twitter.com/mjsfJ2Lk9z \u2014 Robert Cohen (@kodacohen) August 16, 2014Protestors refuse to leave the street in Ferguson.\nAccording to a report from The MMQB, Chicago Bears defensive end David Bass grew up in University City, Missouri, which is six miles from Ferguson.\nAs the drama in Ferguson, Missouri, continues to unfold, a football player who grew up near Ferguson revealed that before the Michael Brown killing, citizens feared the law enforcement.\nOne of those is St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Robert Cohen, who documented last night\u2019s protests in Ferguson."}
