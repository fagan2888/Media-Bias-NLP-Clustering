Palin was asked President Obama\u2019s apology for the website, and said, \u201cWhat apology? He kind of acknowledged a bit that there\u2019s a broken website. The broken website is the least of America\u2019s worries. This broken website I think is symbolic of a broken administration. Take over one-sixth of our economy and the socialized medicine that\u2019s being crammed down our throat, that\u2019s what\u2019s broken.\u201d\n\nShe falsely claimed that most Americans will be losing their health insurance, \u201c\u201dWhere do you get this five percent? It\u2019s not five percent. It\u2019s most Americans will not be able to keep the healthcare policy and programs that they had desired. The new programs that are being forced down our throat are unaffordable. Some of them are still being told, \u2018Well if you like that insurance policy and that coverage, you still will be able to keep it, it\u2019s just going to cost you a little bit more.\u2019 That\u2019s the point. If it\u2019s going to cost you more, then it\u2019s not the same policy.\u201d\n\nSarah Palin was lying on all counts. The ACA is not socialized medicine. It is a change that allows people to participate in the free market so that they can have access to affordable healthcare. The 5% number is a fact. Sarah Palin came up with a very unique and untrue definition of losing your health insurance. She claimed that if your policy changes in any way, you\u2019ve lost your health insurance.\n\nAs anyone who has health insurance knows, policies change every year. New things are no longer covered. Co-pays change. This happened every single year before the ACA. The difference is that the changes that are happening now are adding services and lowering costs, which is the opposite of the past.\n\nDuring the course of the six minute interview, Lauer and Palin spent a little more than one minute talking about her book. Sarah Palin\u2019s appearance on Today that was supposed to be about promoting her book was really a national morning show platform to lie about the ACA.\n\nNBC should be ashamed to have given Sarah Palin a platform to tell her lies about the ACA to a national morning show audience that isn\u2019t the most politically knowledgable. Matt Lauer didn\u2019t bother to correct Palin, or pushback against her obvious lies. He let her continue to misinform and deceive the American people about a new that will be beneficial to the vast majority to them.\n\nWhat happened on Today was another example of the \u201cliberal\u201d media helping Republicans promote their lies about the ACA. NBC should be held accountable for helping Palin mislead America. It\u2019s stunts like this that should make every American who cares about facts and truth turn off Today.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The corporate media helped to spread more lies about the ACA, when NBC gave Sarah Palin an unchallenged platform for her Obamacare lies on Today.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The corporate media helped to spread more lies about the ACA, when NBC gave Sarah Palin an unchallenged platform for her Obamacare lies on Today.", "title": "NBC Gives Sarah Palin a Disgraceful Platform to Lie About Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/11/11/nbc-sarah-palin-disgraceful-platform-lie-obamacare.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/palin-today-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-11T11:51:12+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Sarah Palin,sarah palin obamacare lies today,today show sarah palin,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-11-11T11:51:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-11T11:51:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Sarah Palin, sarah palin obamacare lies today, today show sarah palin"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab38\"", "article_summary": "The corporate media helped to spread more lies about the ACA, when NBC gave Sarah Palin an unchallenged platform for her Obamacare lies on Today.\nSarah Palin came up with a very unique and untrue definition of losing your health insurance.\nThis broken website I think is symbolic of a broken administration.\nNBC should be ashamed to have given Sarah Palin a platform to tell her lies about the ACA to a national morning show audience that isn\u2019t the most politically knowledgable.\nHe kind of acknowledged a bit that there\u2019s a broken website."}
