He explained that because more services are outpatient and technology has changed healthcare, fewer people are needed for inpatient care.\n\nMeyer said they're eliminating 100 positions from vice presidents and directors to its employees and couriers because of the growing costs. He also says that includes a number of unfilled positions, but couldn't elaborate.\n\nHe also said employees who are qualified can transfer to other open positions. He also made it clear that doctors and nurses are not included in these cuts.\n\nMeyer said these tough decisions have to be made in order to make sure they aren't forced to deal with an even more significant problem in the future.\n\n\"I fully understand that Holzer is to Gallia County, for example what the auto industry was to Detroit,\" Meyer said. \"We're that type of employer. We take the steps we take, as painful and emotional as they are, for everybody involved, to right-size our workforce, to accommodate it to the book of business -- the volume of patients we currently see so that Holzer's here forever.\"\n\nMeyer said employees affected will be notified through Friday. He adds they're giving employees let go a month's pay and help with job placement services.\n\nMeyer added that he does not expect more cuts in the future, but he says the eliminated jobs will not return.\n\nGALLIPOLIS, Ohio (WSAZ) -- Holzer Health System says it's cutting some 100 jobs at its locations in southern Ohio and western West Virginia.\n\nAccording to a press release, the cuts are mostly non-direct patient care position.\n\nOfficials say the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has caused dramatic change in healthcare service delivery models. The say inpatient volumes continue to shrink while outpatient volumes are rising.\n\nOfficials also say that reduced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements further complicate the issue.\n\nHolzer says approximately 65 percent of its patients are covered by government insurance.\n\nThe shift in service delivery and funding cuts are realities for hospitals across the United States. The situation is uniquely more challenging for health systems in rural communities.\n\nThe release also says that prior to this announcement, Holzer Health System was actively reducing operational expenditures, eliminating duplication of services resulting from a merger in 2012, divesting excess property holdings, and renegotiating supply contracts.\n\n\u201cOur entire staff works tirelessly to reduce operational costs and to streamline operations while continuing to provide excellent care to our patients,\u201d said Holzer Health System CEO, Christopher T. Meyer, D.O. \u201cWhile these efforts helped us to maintain our not-for-profit community hospital system, unfortunately, it has not been enough to address the sweeping changes in the healthcare environment. This national situation placed us in a regrettable position. We must now take additional action to ensure the long-term financial health and stability of Holzer so that we may continue providing the excellent health care our patients deserve for many years to come.\u201d\n\nOfficials say the the delivery of high quality, patient-centered care remains its top priority.
