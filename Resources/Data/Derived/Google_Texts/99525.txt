I am supporting Dave Larsen for Congress in New Jersey's 7th District. I see Leonard Lance's actions and his record as the embodiment of a perpetual, feckless establishment politician who will bend the truth, his knowledge and past votes to win the next election.

Since graduating law school in 1977, Lance has been a public employee 38 years! He collects a state pension in addition to a congressional salary of $174,000, and has a congressional pension and medical plan for life and is exempt from Obamacare.

Lance's public service has been very lucrative. According to OpenSecrets.org Lance's 2015 net worth is estimated at $3.7 million. How did he become worth so much on a public servant's wage? What has he done as a state legislator or congressman to fix double-dippers and the mindset of "elected office is a career?"

He espouses his experience and legislative abilities, yet according to InsideGov.com he is ranked fifth least effective out of 435 House members! Every first-term member of Congress each is ranked higher than Lance. How does Lance reconcile this lack of value-for-the voter with his "fiscal conservatism"?

Larsen promotes a smaller, less-regulated, more effective government. He has been consistent and respectful in his statements, thoughtful and explanatory of his values, is fiscally responsible in his decision-making and, as most successful business-owners live and prove to be, practices compromise based on principled beliefs. If you live in the 7th District, which includes parts of Hunterdon and Warren counties, I ask that you vote for him as well.
