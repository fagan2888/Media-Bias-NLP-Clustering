When his friends come over to hang in our basement, Liam might be watching Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. When her show ends, his conservative pals insist on another perspective from, say, Bill O\u2019Reilly, on Fox.\n\nUpstairs, I sometimes hear these kids I\u2019ve watched grow from tykes debating issues \u2014 immigration, Iran, Obamacare, jobs, abortion. It\u2019s like watching saplings of democracy starting to leaf.\n\nAfter I wrote about these kids commenting on the recent debate, Donald Trump sent me back a copy of my column with a handwritten comment: \u201cSmart kids.\u201d It was signed by the billionaire reality TV star turned presidential candidate.\n\nI made copies for each kid who was excited that Trump had read their words.\n\nWhen Donald Trump announced his candidacy for President, the election suddenly became a new reality show. Pure entertainment.\n\nListen, if you\u2019re happy that kids are reading again, thank J.K. Rowling and her Harry Potter books. If you\u2019re happy that more kids are interested in politics this year, thank Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.\n\nWhen my son told me that his friend Sam, 18, was undecided between Trump and Sanders in his very first presidential vote, I said that Sam, a sophomore at Washington University in St. Louis , might not get to vote for either.\n\nLiam seemed confused. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Sam just vote for the guy he likes?\u201d\n\nDonald Trump turned the GOP race for the nomination into a reality show, but that has gotten some younger people interested in the election, so maybe it's not all bad. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nI explained that in the primary, Sam could only vote for the candidate running for the nomination of the party to which he\u2019s registered.\n\n\u201cSanders is a Democrat and Trump is a Republican,\u201d I said. \u201cWhich party is Sam registered with?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Green Party,\u201d Liam said.\n\n\u201cThen Sam can\u2019t vote in the Democratic or Republican primaries,\u201d I said. \u201cIf Trump and Sanders both win their party\u2019s nominations \u2014 which is unlikely \u2014 or if just one of them wins his primary, Sam can vote for one of \u2019em in the general election in November.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d said my kid, frowning. \u201cBut if Trump and Sanders both lose their primaries, then Sam can\u2019t vote for either one?\u201d\n\n\u201cDepends,\u201d I said. \u201cRemember, Trump was the only guy who wouldn\u2019t pledge to support whoever becomes the Republican Party nominee.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that was the first question the candidates were asked,\u201d said Liam.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d I said. \u201cWhich means if Trump doesn\u2019t win the Republican nomination, he might run as a third-party candidate. That would really hurt the Republicans.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, along with Trump, has garnered a great deal of excitement from young voters, and even from some people too young to vote still. (Troy Wayrynen/AP) Young supporters of Bernie Sanders hold signs that read 'Bernie For People' after a march from City Hall Park in Burlington, Vermont, earlier this year. (Scott Eisen/Bloomberg)\n\n\u201cAnd Sanders would be out?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, the Green Party has been after Sanders to run as their party\u2019s nominee. If he does, Sam might be able to vote for him on the Green Party line. Or he can always do a write-in vote for Sanders. Or Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitics gets pretty confusing, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gets more confusing once politicians get elected,\u201d I said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between campaigning and governing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can vote in local elections in two years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my first presidential election in 2020. Can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nI know the feeling.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Denis Hamill", "twitter": {"description": "If you\u2019re happy that more kids are interested in politics this year, thank Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.", "title": "Hamill: Watching son and friends debate politics is great", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/hamill-watching-son-friends-debate-politics-great-article-1.2328903", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2328901.1439861732!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hamill18n-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, young voters 2016", "parsely-author": "Denis Hamill", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, young voters 2016", "nydn_tags": "donald trump, bernie sanders, 2016 election", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, young voters 2016", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/hamill-watching-son-friends-debate-politics-great-article-1.2328903", "parsely-title": "Hamill: Watching son and friends debate politics is great", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-17T21:43:09-0400", "sailthru.title": "Hamill: Watching son and friends debate politics is great", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-18T01:43:09", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2328901.1439861732!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hamill18n-1-web.jpg", "description": "If you\u2019re happy that more kids are interested in politics this year, thank Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "If you\u2019re happy that more kids are interested in politics this year, thank Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "If you\u2019re happy that more kids are interested in politics this year, thank Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.", "title": "Hamill: Watching son and friends debate politics is great", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/hamill-watching-son-friends-debate-politics-great-article-1.2328903", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2328901.1439861732!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hamill18n-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "donald trump, bernie sanders, 2016 election", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2328901.1439861732!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hamill18n-1-web.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Denis Hamill", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "Since the recent Republican presidential debate, I\u2019ve become excited watching my son Liam, who turns 16 next month, become excited about politics.\n\u201cBut if Trump and Sanders both lose their primaries, then Sam can\u2019t vote for either one?\u201d\u201cDepends,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThen Sam can\u2019t vote in the Democratic or Republican primaries,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIn my first presidential election in 2020.\nWhen his friends come over to hang in our basement, Liam might be watching Rachel Maddow on MSNBC."}
