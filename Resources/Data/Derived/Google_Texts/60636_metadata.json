According to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, those are a state\u2019s only options.\n\nThe Republican presidential hopeful said as much Wednesday during his unofficial campaign\u2019s first visit to Iowa.\n\nKasich asked at a Des Moines event, \u201cDo you think we should take schizophrenics and people who are bipolar who get in a scuffle because they hear voices or get confused? Do you think we should lock them up in prison?\u201d\n\nAudience members said \u201cno,\u201d and Kasich continued, \u201cWell, I agree with you. So we brought a lot of our money back from Washington to begin to treat these people.\u201d\n\nKasich seldom mentions Obamacare when defending his Obamacare Medicaid expansion, but that\u2019s what his line about bringing \u201cour money back from Washington\u201d references.\n\nBACKGROUND: Seen the light? Ohio Gov. Kasich says Bible supports Obamacare\n\nDespite what Kasich says, Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is paid for with new federal spending, not state dollars. It\u2019s not exactly a popular policy with Republican voters in Iowa.\n\nRepublican respondents to a January poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers expressed overwhelming support for repealing Obamacare, with 80 percent favoring repeal and 45 percent listing repeal as one of their top priorities.\n\nIn an email to Ohio Watchdog, Americans for Prosperity-Iowa state director Drew Klein said his organization \u201chas consistently taken a stance against Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nThe limited-government advocacy group opposes Medicaid expansion \u201cboth on the spending front, and possibly more importantly because Medicaid is another poorly run program that doesn\u2019t improve the lives of those it seeks to serve.\u201d\n\nKlein pointed to an Oregon study that found that Medicaid coverage had little impact on the health of the previously uninsured.\n\nPreparing for a 2016 presidential run, Kasich routinely spins his Obamacare expansion as a program defined and paid for by the state of Ohio.\n\nEarlier at Wednesday\u2019s event in Des Moines, Kasich said, \u201cWhen we do better, that gives us the opportunity to do things for other people. People that I have been saying live in the shadows.\u201d\n\nBut Obamacare expansion doesn\u2019t work that way. Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion uses Obamacare eligibility rules and funding and is in no way a byproduct of Ohio\u2019s economic growth.\n\nThe tab for Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion topped $3.7 billion in its first 17 months \u2014 more than $1 billion more than Kasich projected, funded entirely by federal taxpayers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Embrace Obamacare, or throw the mentally ill in prison.
