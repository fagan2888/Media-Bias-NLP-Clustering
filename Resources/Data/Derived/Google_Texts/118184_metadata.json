This study could be a step in that point moving up to 22 weeks.\n\nDr. Edward Bell, a University of Iowa professor who led the study, told The New York Times that he thinks 22 weeks is the new point of viability.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we think, but this is a pretty controversial area,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess we would say that these babies deserve a chance.\u201d\n\nThe point of viability is used by the Supreme Court in protecting the right to an abortion. The majority opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, upholding much of Roe v. Wade, recognized \u201cthe right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State.\u201d\n\nAnd according to the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute, 20 states ban abortions after viability, except in cases involving the life or health of the mother.\n\nTen states put the ban even earlier, at 20 weeks. However, those bans could be open to legal challenge.\n\nA 20-week abortion ban in Arizona was struck down by a federal court in 2013 for unconstitutionally violating the Supreme Court ruling protecting abortions up to the point of viability.\n\nRepublicans in Congress also tried to pass a 20-week abortion ban but had to drop the effort in January after a revolt from female members and centrists.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The study raises questions for the abortion debate.", "description": "The study raises questions for the abortion debate.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The study raises questions for the abortion debate.", "title": "Study: Premature babies can survive at 22 weeks", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/241313-premature-babies-can-survive-at-22-weeks-study-finds", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/newborn_021114thinkstock.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/241313-premature-babies-can-survive-at-22-weeks-study-finds", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-07T10:12-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-07T10:12:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/241313-premature-babies-can-survive-at-22-weeks-study-finds", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The study raises questions for the abortion debate.", "card": "summary", "title": "Study: Premature babies can survive at 22 weeks"}, "dcterms.title": "Study: Premature babies can survive at 22 weeks"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe203c\"", "article_summary": "A new study finds that babies are sometimes able to survive when born at just 22 weeks, raising questions for the abortion debate.\nADVERTISEMENTThe study released Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine finds that 5.1 percent of babies born at 22 weeks were able to survive, and 3.4 percent were able to survive without severe impairments.\nThis study could be a step in that point moving up to 22 weeks.\nDr. Edward Bell, a University of Iowa professor who led the study, told The New York Times that he thinks 22 weeks is the new point of viability.\nRepublicans in Congress also tried to pass a 20-week abortion ban but had to drop the effort in January after a revolt from female members and centrists."}
