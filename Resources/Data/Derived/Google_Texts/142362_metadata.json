Obama and his team made matters worse, suggesting they had been misunderstood all along. The stunning political uproar led to this: a rare presidential apology.\u201d\n\nAfter the cancellation letters began pouring in and the administration found itself on the defense, Mr. Obama apologized to anybody who felt misled by his statement.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t as clear as we needed to be in terms of the changes that were taking place, and I want to do everything we can to make sure that people are finding themselves in a good position, a better position than they were before this law happened,\u201d he told NBC News in an interview last month. \u201cAnd I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill, the administration has insisted that nothing in the health care law explicitly forces insurance companies to cancel plans or shift customers to a new plan. But the law\u2019s stringent grandfather clause, intended to preserve existing insurance plans, only applied to plans that were in place before the law was passed and received only minimal changes since then. Any substantial alteration to a grandfathered plan would subject that plan would to the minimum coverage requirements stipulated by Obamacare. If a plan did not meet those requirements, it would be canceled.\n\n\n\nThose complicated policy mechanics, PolitiFact argued, were not adequately captured by the president\u2019s glib declaration, which he repeated throughout the 2012 presidential election.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s ideas on health care were first offered as general outlines then grew into specific legislation over the course of his presidency,\u201d the organization noted. \u201cYet Obama never adjusted his rhetoric to give people a more accurate sense of the law\u2019s real-world repercussions, even as fact-checkers flagged his statements as exaggerated at best. Instead, he fought back against inaccurate attacks with his own oversimplifications, which he repeated even as it became clear his promise was too sweeping.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeveral of PolitiFact\u2019s recent \u201cLie of the Year\u201d rulings have focused on the president\u2019s health care law, which has become the subject of misinformation from all sides. In 2010, the fact-checking organization condemned Republicans\u2019 claim that Democrats were proposing a \u201cgovernment takeover\u201d of health care, noting that the Democrats\u2019 were merely proposing a system that \u201cat its heart\u2026relies on private companies and the free market.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd in 2009, the organization called out former Gov. Sarah Palin, R-Alaska, who warned that Democrats\u2019 health care reform plans would create \u201cdeath panels\u201d to ration care provided to the elderly and infirm.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "PolitiFact accuses the president of oversimplifying his plan&#039;s effect on the insurance market to &quot;calm nerves&quot;", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamas-keep-your-plan-promise-labeled-lie-of-the-year/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/05/8a1c2571-484c-4548-a182-81ada6926a24/thumbnail/1200x630/489402d8ad5ad082309efd92a261add3/healthcare_generic.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "PolitiFact accuses the president of oversimplifying his plan's effect on the insurance market to \"calm nerves\"", "title": "Obama's \"keep your plan\" promise labeled \"Lie of the Year\""}, "twitter": {"description": "PolitiFact accuses the president of oversimplifying his plan's effect on the insurance market to \"calm nerves\"", "title": "Obama's \"keep your plan\" promise labeled \"Lie of the Year\"", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamas-keep-your-plan-promise-labeled-lie-of-the-year/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamas-keep-your-plan-promise-labeled-lie-of-the-year/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamas-keep-your-plan-promise-labeled-lie-of-the-year/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/05/8a1c2571-484c-4548-a182-81ada6926a24/thumbnail/1200x630/489402d8ad5ad082309efd92a261add3/healthcare_generic.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamas-keep-your-plan-promise-labeled-lie-of-the-year/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamas-keep-your-plan-promise-labeled-lie-of-the-year/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5eec\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBoiling down the complicated health care law to a soundbite proved treacherous, even for its promoter-in-chief.\nMr. Obama\u2019s promise, repeated ad infinitum during and after the health care bill\u2019s passage through Congress, was a \u201ccatchy political pitch and a chance to calm nerves about his dramatic and complicated plan\u201d to overhaul the country\u2019s health care system, PolitiFact argued.\nAny substantial alteration to a grandfathered plan would subject that plan would to the minimum coverage requirements stipulated by Obamacare.\nSarah Palin, R-Alaska, who warned that Democrats\u2019 health care reform plans would create \u201cdeath panels\u201d to ration care provided to the elderly and infirm.\nPresident Obama\u2019s assurance that \u201cIf you like your health plan, you can keep it\u201d was named the \u201cLie of the Year\u201d on Thursday by PolitiFact, a fact-checking organization spun off of the Tampa Bay Times."}
