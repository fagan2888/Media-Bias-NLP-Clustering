Burwell.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the case, the question being debated is whether tax subsidies can be extended to people who bought insurance on a federal exchange, rather than one set up by the individual states.\n\nObamacare supporters argue that a ruling for the plaintiff would be at the expense of millions of newly-insured Americans. They suggest that the overall goal of expanding coverage would be completely undermined, and cost millions of people their coverage, drive up the cost of health insurance premiums and insurers will suffer major financial losses.\n\nWhile there is much at stake for the future of Obamacare, it\u2019s effects so far are also worth examining. Daily Signal has created an infographic detailing Obamacare\u2019s cost and impact:\n\nWhile the case that may determine if Obamacare continues to exist is being debated, most of America has already decided.\n\nA Gallup poll shows that currently only 37% of Americans say they approve of the law, while 56% disapprove \u2014 the highest disapproval rate since the law was first set in motion.\n\nAnother Gallup poll from this past August shows how people feel about Obamacare is widely based from state-to-state:\n\nWhile the Obama administration argues to push forward with Obamacare, despite popular opinion and impact, only time, and the Supreme Court, will tell if it will be around much longer.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The public is not happy.", "published_at": "2015-03-06T15:14:40+00:00", "tags": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "The public is not happy.", "title": "With Obamacare Back On Trial, This Graphic Shows It May Be Hurting Americans More Than It Is Helping", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 747, "identifier": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-06-at-3.18.08-PM.jpg", "height": 401}, "updated_time": "2015-03-06T15:19:11-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/03/263887-obamacare-back-trial-info-graphic-shows-may-hurting-americans-helping/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The public is not happy.", "creator": "@injo", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-06-at-3.18.08-PM.jpg", "title": "With Obamacare Back On Trial, This Graphic Shows It May Be Hurting Americans More Than It Is Helping", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Reid Mene", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-06T15:14:40-04:00", "wp-categories": "687 4889 482 1471", "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/03/263887-obamacare-back-trial-info-graphic-shows-may-hurting-americans-helping/", "wp-category-slugs": "culture, legal, nation, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-03-06T15:14:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-06T15:19:11-04:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-06-at-3.18.08-PM.jpg", "post_id": 263887, "is_https": 0}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe246b\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare supporters argue that a ruling for the plaintiff would be at the expense of millions of newly-insured Americans.\nA Gallup poll shows that currently only 37% of Americans say they approve of the law, while 56% disapprove \u2014 the highest disapproval rate since the law was first set in motion.\nWhile there is much at stake for the future of Obamacare, it\u2019s effects so far are also worth examining.\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Obamacare is once again in the news as the Supreme Court has began to hear oral arguments in the case of King v.
