The Friendship Centers board, she says, spent a full year trying to ascertain what sort of outreach program could generate new income while fulfilling the centers' core mission.\n\nThe result of this head-scratching is the Friendship Center for Aging Studies. After years of hosting delegations from all parts of the world that came to study Sarasota's pioneering methods of meeting elders' needs for sustenance and companionship, the Friendship Centers will use its expertise to educate service professionals about the special characteristics of an aging population.\n\nMcLeod says the idea of offering continuing education credits for licensed social workers, therapists and counselors felt like a natural fit.\n\n\"We said, Hold on a minute: There are people who have never had any professional training in and around the aging world, who really need some,\" she says. \"They\u2019re very capable trained professionals. They\u2019re starting to see more and more of their clientele aging, and this will bring unique issues, unique challenges and unique solutions.\"\n\nThe budding Center for Aging Studies will host its first official session on Tuesday, April 5, as a sort of soft opening for local professionals -- and anyone else in the community with an interest in cognitive health. Nationally regarded geriatrician Kevin O'Neill, who serves as chief medical officer for Brookdale Senior Living, will present a talk called \"Cross-Train Your Brain.\" The course fee is $15, for one continuing education credit, and will start with a light breakfast at 7:30 a.m. To register, visit the website or call (941) 556-3263.\n\nWhat's nice about the new center's focus is how well it complements the outreach-plus-income effort of another respected aging nonprofit: Pines of Sarasota's Education Institute. This program, which harnesses the practices and philosophies of the Pines to train professional and family caregivers, has grown steadily and is now attracting an international audience.\n\nMcLeod says a global profile is also part of the new center's three-year plan.\n\n\"First we're putting our toe in the water locally,\" she says, \"and ultimately our courses will be promoted regionally and nationally. We are selling the idea of a vacation/education, with up to 15 hours of continuing education credits.\"\n\nThe vision also has in common an element that was behind the generation of Sarasota's Institute for the Ages, which flamed out after trying to turn a profit quickly -- the idea that this region is savvy enough about what it takes to age well, that folks should be traveling here from all over to watch us do it.\n\nFollow Barbara Peters Smith on Twitter @BarbaraPSmith.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd664\"", "article_summary": "\"We said, Hold on a minute: There are people who have never had any professional training in and around the aging world, who really need some,\" she says.\nThe Friendship Centers board, she says, spent a full year trying to ascertain what sort of outreach program could generate new income while fulfilling the centers' core mission.\nThe result of this head-scratching is the Friendship Center for Aging Studies.\nMcLeod says the idea of offering continuing education credits for licensed social workers, therapists and counselors felt like a natural fit.\nThey\u2019re starting to see more and more of their clientele aging, and this will bring unique issues, unique challenges and unique solutions.\""}
