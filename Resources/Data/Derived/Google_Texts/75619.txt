Some folks were up early at the Bay Point Marina Thursday morning.

Some came for fun, and others came to maybe try to feel less guilty about some extra pie at dinner.

Thanksgiving morning's inaugural Turkey Trot 5K in Bay Point Marina brought out runners who are doing more good than just burning calories.

Proceeds from the race go to the Wesley Burnham Foundation to bring musical education to young children.

Organizers only expected a little more than a hundred participants, but close to 400 showed up to run.

The Seiler family came all the way from Cincinnati, Ohio to celebrate the holiday and burn calories together.

"Just to get everybody together," Randy Seiler, the father, said. "These guys live near Columbus, Georgia now. He's stationed at Fort Benning and so to get the family together we kind of came down here and we met down here."

Race director, Amy Mann said they raised close to $4,000 for the Wesley Burnham Foundation. She said they hope to make next year's race bigger and better.
