Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee caused a bit of blushing across the debate stage Thursday night.

The 2016 presidential hopeful told the Fox News hosts his fair tax system would transform the funding process of Social Security and Medicare “because the money paid at consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people that are freeloading off the system now.”

ADVERTISEMENT In response to his remarks, host Megyn Kelly said “it’s getting a little R-rated” and moderator Chris Wallace put up his hand and said “all right, enough.”

Huckabee argued one of the reasons why Social Security is in trouble is because the funding stream is only from people who get a wage.

“The people who get wages is declining dramatically," Huckabee said in an exchange with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

"Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and capital gains,” he said.

Huckabee aimed to contrast his stance with Christie on reforming entitlements, arguing that changes should be made in the budget, as compared to Christie's stance to cut benefits to seniors earning more than $200,000.
