Last week, the website FantasySCOTUS correctly predicted the outcome \u2014 and the vote count \u2014 of the court\u2019s decisions on Obamacare subsidies and gay marriage. It was incorrect, however, in predicting the court\u2019s fair housing decision.\n\nOn June 28, 2012, opponents of the Affordable Care Act celebrated on the steps of the Supreme Court. They had just learned that the law\u2019s individual mandate was struck down. Both CNN and Fox News broke the news. The celebrants chanted, \u201cThe Constitution won, the Constitution won.\u201d Across the street from the court, Rep. Jean Schmidt, staunchly averse to the law, fell into joyful histrionics.\n\nMore Politics\n\nBut of course the individual mandate was not struck down. While it was found invalid under the Commerce Clause, it was upheld under Congress\u2019s taxing power. Both the revelers and the news networks would learn that minutes later.\n\nThis story epitomizes two Supreme Court truths: The business of the court matters a lot to a lot of people, and it is extremely complex.\n\nWe\u2019re quite good at predicting election outcomes. But if a Supreme Court opinion is tough to decipher when held in one\u2019s hands, can we ever hope to predict decisions before they happen? The issues are complex and diverse, and justices have unique and evolving ideologies, outlooks and interpretations \u2014 and they don\u2019t provide polling data.\n\nStill, many political scientists, legal scholars, practitioners, physicists, engineers and hobbyists are trying.\n\nSupreme Court predictors have emptied their toolboxes to tackle this problem. They\u2019ve used statistical models, machine learning, expert opinion and \u2014 recently \u2014 the wisdom of the crowd.\n\nThe job got started in earnest about 10 years ago. Theodore Ruger, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 along with Pauline Kim (a legal scholar), Andrew Martin and Kevin Quinn (political scientists) \u2014 undertook a seminal study, the results of which were published in 2004. They studied the Supreme Court \u201cprospectively.\u201d Rather than looking back, as most scholarship had, they looked forward.\n\nThe authors employed two parallel methods to predict the 2002-2003 Supreme Court term. Ruger and Kim polled expert law professors for their predictions. Meanwhile, Martin and Quinn, using data from 10 years of the Rehnquist court, ran statistical, \u201cclassification tree\u201d prediction models. These \u201ctrees\u201d are basically vote-predicting flow charts, fitted with data. (Predictions were made, importantly, before oral arguments. More on that later.)\n\nThis is their classification tree for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg:\n\nThe interdisciplinary nature of their work is key. Political scientists tend to view the court in terms of a left-right ideological spectrum, as they would Congress. Legal scholars may be more interested in precedent, the circuit court a case came from, and so on. Both views are important.\n\n\u201cIdeological preferences matter, but that\u2019s not all that matters,\u201d Ruger told me. \u201cYou have a host of things like institutional setting, and who the parties are, and, yes, even what the law says \u2014 the content or the specificity of the legal rules or the precedent.\u201d\n\nRuger highlighted another reason Supreme Court cases are so difficult to predict: selection bias.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re cases where the law is unusually vague or indeterminate,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cThe Supreme Court takes the hardest cases, where the law is the least clear.\u201d\n\nIn this instance, the statistical model beat the experts. The Martin-Quinn classification trees scored a 75 percent success rate, while Ruger\u2019s and Kim\u2019s legal scholars clocked in at about 59 percent. Ruger told me, however, that he\u2019s sure that those who have argued before the Supreme Court would have done better than the legal academics.\n\nJosh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law, has recently taken up the predicting mantle. Blackman and his partners, Michael Bommarito and Daniel Martin Katz, have built a second-generation computer model, called {Marshall}+, after former Chief Justice John Marshall. While it may be slightly less accurate than the Martin-Quinn model, it\u2019s far more robust. It\u2019s built on data going back more than 60 years, and doesn\u2019t rely on a given composition of the court, as the Martin-Quinn model did. The model goes beyond Martin\u2019s and Quinn\u2019s classification trees, employing what the authors call a \u201crandom forest approach.\u201d They can even \u201ctime travel,\u201d testing their model on historical cases, using only the information they would have had at the time. It correctly predicts 70 percent of cases since 1953. And it\u2019s public \u2014 the source code for {Marshall}+ is available on GitHub.\n\nWhile the model has impressed many, Blackman still believes in human reasoning. \u201cWe expect the humans to win, they\u2019re better,\u201d he told me. \u201cThis is not like \u2018The Terminator\u2019 where machines will rise.\u201d\n\nBlackman also launched the website FantasySCOTUS in 2009 \u2014 as a joke. Like fantasy sports, human players log on, pick justices to vote this way or that, and score points once the decisions come down. To Blackman\u2019s surprise, it took off, and thousands of people now participate.\n\nThe real promise of FantasySCOTUS isn\u2019t entertainment, but prediction. Like the Iowa Electronic Markets, or the sadly defunct Intrade, FantasySCOTUS can harness the wisdom of the crowd \u2014 incentivizing its participants to make accurate predictions, and then observing those decisions in the aggregate. This year there is a $10,000 first prize put up by the media firm Thomson Reuters.\n\n\u201cI had no idea whether it\u2019d be accurate or not \u2014 I did this entirely on a whim. And then by the end of the year I found out that this is actually pretty good,\u201d Blackman said. The serious FantasySCOTUS players generate predictions cracking 70 percent accuracy.\n\nBlackman is excited to find out what sort of cases the humans are good at predicting, and what sort the machines are good at. With that information, he can begin to craft an \u201censemble\u201d prediction, using the best of both worlds.\n\nSo there are the scholars and the machines and the crowd. Composing the crowd are the hobbyists \u2014 the intrepid, rugged individualists of the predicting world.\n\nJacob Berlove, 30, of Queens, is the best human Supreme Court predictor in the world. Actually, forget the qualifier. He\u2019s the best Supreme Court predictor in the world. He won FantasySCOTUS three years running. He correctly predicts cases more than 80 percent of the time. He plays under the name \u201cMelech\u201d \u2014 \u201cking\u201d in Hebrew.\n\nBerlove has no formal legal training. Nor does he use statistical analyses to aid his predictions. He got interested in the Supreme Court in elementary school, reading his local paper, the Cincinnati Enquirer. In high school, he stumbled upon a constitutional law textbook.\n\n\u201cI read through huge chunks of it and I had a great time,\u201d he told me. \u201cI learned a lot over that weekend.\u201d\n\nBerlove has a prodigious memory for justices\u2019 past decisions and opinions, and relies heavily on their colloquies in oral arguments. When we spoke, he had strong feelings about certain justices\u2019 oratorical styles and how they affected his predictions.\n\nSome justices are easy to predict. \u201cI really appreciate Justice Scalia\u2019s candor,\u201d he said. \u201cIn oral arguments, 90 percent of the time he makes it very clear what he is thinking.\u201d\n\nSome are not. \u201cTo some extent, Justice Thomas might be the hardest, because he never speaks in oral arguments, ever.\u201d That fact is mitigated, though, by Thomas\u2019s rather predictable ideology. Justices Kennedy and Breyer can be tricky, too. Kennedy doesn\u2019t tip his hand too much in oral arguments. And Breyer, Berlove says, plays coy.\n\n\u201cHe expresses this deep-seated, what I would argue is a phony humility at oral arguments. \u2018No, I really don\u2019t know. This is a difficult question. I have to think about it. It\u2019s very close.\u2019 And then all of sudden he writes the opinion and he makes it seem like it was never a question in the first place. I find that to be very annoying.\u201d\n\nI told Ruger about Berlove. He said it made a certain amount of sense that the best Supreme Court predictor in the world should be some random guy in Queens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that too much thinking or knowledge about the law could hurt you. If you make your career writing law review articles, like we do, you come up with your own normative baggage and your own preconceptions,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be as dispassionate as this guy.\u201d\n\nBerlove also referenced the current supremacy of the best humans over the machines. \u201cThere\u2019ll probably be a few top-notch players up there who can do better\u201d than the computer model, he said. But he added, \u201cWith time, they might be able to do what they did to Garry Kasparov, or what they did to Ken Jennings,\u201d referring to IBM\u2019s Deep Blue and Watson supercomputers.\n\nLinda Greenhouse, the former New York Times Supreme Court reporter, now at Yale, is also a notable human predictor. In a paper responding to the work of Ruger, Kim, Martin and Quinn, she lays out an eloquent critique of the computer models. She also describes how \u201cthe Supreme Court press corps often indulges in predictions \u2026 usually made during the walk down the stairs from the courtroom following an oral argument session.\u201d\n\nShe goes on to estimate her success rate at around 75 percent, and probably actually higher, as the cases she covered tended to be closely fought and thus less predictable. She, too, stresses the importance of oral arguments to prediction.\n\nSo how about some actual predictions? Here they are, as I write, for the Supreme Court\u2019s October sitting \u2014 from the FantasySCOTUS crowd, super-predictor Berlove and the {Marshall}+ algorithm. The predicted votes shown are those for and against affirming the lower-court decision, respectively. (You can find a useful summary of the cases at SCOTUSblog.)\n\nThe disagreement among the predictions for the October cases is remarkable. In fact, for only one case \u2014 Holt v. Hobbs \u2014 do all three predictors agree on the outcome. This case, about the right of an inmate to grow a beard in accordance with his religious beliefs, is also remarkable because the inmate filed a handwritten petition to the Supreme Court. All three predictors guess he will win.\n\nThere is considerably more agreement between the crowd and Berlove for the cases being heard in the court\u2019s November sitting. (The {Marshall}+ predictions are being run as I write.) Again, here are the predicted votes for and against affirming:\n\nIn two of this term\u2019s high-stakes cases, tackling racial gerrymandering \u2014 Alabama Democratic Conference v. Alabama and Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama \u2014 oral argument was heard Wednesday. (My colleagues at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law, where I am a fellow, filed an amicus brief in the latter case.) As I write, the crowd predicts close decisions in both cases. The predictions may shift \u2014 and improve \u2014 after predictors analyze the oral arguments\u2019 tea leaves.\n\nLast week, the court agreed to hear another challenge to the Affordable Care Act, in a case called King v. Burwell, which will almost certainly be the most-watched of the term. It is not yet scheduled for argument, and it remains to be seen how the predictors will come down on the case. And, of course, it\u2019ll be summer before we know how the justices will.\n\nMachine predictors are bound to improve. Blackman hopes to host a machine competition next year, encouraging others to work off {Marshall}+ and develop their own, better algorithms that can crack 70 percent. And in the long run, the real impact of this work may not have much at all to do with the Supreme Court. With an accurate algorithm in hand, predictions could be generated for the tens of thousands of cases argued every year in lower courts.\n\n\u201cThere are roughly 80 cases argued in the Supreme Court every year. That\u2019s a drop in the bucket,\u201d Blackman said.\n\nThis could have dramatic, efficiency-boosting effects. Lawyers could better decide when to go to trial, when to settle and how to settle, for example. But there\u2019s a long way to go.\n\nMaybe the real difficulty is as simple as Ruger put it: \u201cThe justices are intelligent human beings and, as such, are very complex human beings.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Editors Note: This article on predicting decisions by the Supreme Court first ran on Nov. 17, 2014.
