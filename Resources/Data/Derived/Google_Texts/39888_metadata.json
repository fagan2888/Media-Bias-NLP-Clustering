And by the Kaiser wellness program that a number of employees we represent are covered by, I'm two pounds from being overweight,\" said John Borsos.\n\nKaiser said in a statement late Tuesday that its program is voluntary and does not penalize those who don't meet the program's goals, although that is not true for other programs.\n\nBorsos says even the extremely fit, such as Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III, would be considered overweight by wellness programs.\n\nThe rules for such a program, put out in May as a regulation, say, \"The program must be reasonably designed to promote health or prevent disease.\"\n\nBorsos criticizes what he calls \"a lack of precision in what's going on out there. It\u2019s kind of troubling,\" he says, \"that this was so heavily incorporated into the Affordable Care Act in the way that it was.\u201d\n\n\"Wellness is very, very popular in the corporate world,\" says John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas. \"Companies are just beginning to impose pretty severe penalties.\"\n\nIf workers do not participate, for instance, they can be charged up to 20 percent of their health insurance premium, and that is going up to 30 percent in January.\n\nEmployers like wellness programs because they think they help create a healthier workforce.\n\nFor instance, CVS drug stores imposed a $50 fine per month -- $600 a year-- on those who refuse to disclose their weight, body fat, and other health measures.\n\nWalmart penalizes smokers by as much as $2300 a year if they want coverage.\n\nGoodman notes that the 50 percent penalty for smoking permitted by ObamaCare is assessed against the entire cost of the plan.\n\n\"It's 50 percent more of the total cost of the insurance,\" he explains. \"So if you have a plan that costs $6,000, a typical employee would pay $1500.\"\n\nBut Goodman says the \"50 percent penalty is for the full $6,000. That would be a $3,000 premium increase. His premium out of his pocket will triple if he's a smoker.\"\n\nUnion leader Borsos also argues wellness plans can be very intrusive, asking a series of very personal questions.\n\nHe pointed to one, for instance, that asks such questions as \"Have you ever had a total hysterectomy? How much do you weigh?... In the last month, have you ever felt nervous or stressed? In the last month, how often have you been angered because of things beyond your control? \"\n\nAnd finally, \"During the past week, I have felt lonely-- yes or no? During the past week, I have felt sad, yes or no?\"\n\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
