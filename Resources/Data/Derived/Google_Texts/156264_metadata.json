Ezekiel J. Emanuel, brother of Rahm, is a former senior health care adviser to President Obama. Now he writes a piece in The New York Times telling people to skip their annual physical. It says, \u201cMost think of it as the human equivalent of a 15,000-mile checkup and fluid change, which can uncover hidden problems and ensure longer engine life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is only one problem: From a health perspective, the annual physical exam is basically worthless.\u201d\n\nEzekiel Emanuel\n\nRemember the 2008 sales pitch about how universal health care would mean regular doctor visits that would keep people healthier and hence out of the pricey emergency room? That\u2019s how Obamacare would cover more people without driving up costs \u2014 that was the con-job argument anyway. In that spirit, the Affordable Care Act considers the annual physical to be an \u201cessential benefit\u201d for which there is no co-payment.\n\nPresident Obama said in a 2009 talk:\n\nBut one of the areas where we can potentially see some saving is a lot of those patients are being seen in the emergency room anyway, and if we are increasing prevention, if we are increasing wellness programs, we\u2019re reducing the amount of emergency room care, then that frees up doctors and resources to provide the kind of primary care that will keep people healthier, but also allow them to see more patients and hopefully give more time to patients, as well.\n\nAnd:\n\nThey know how to manage chronic diseases in an effective way, so that we have people who are getting regular checkups, if they\u2019re trying to manage diabetes, as opposed to us paying for a $30,000 foot amputation because we didn\u2019t manage the disease properly.\n\nNow that the annual physical is free, Emanuel says it\u2019s worthless. So do the taxpayers a favor and forget about it.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://blog.sfgate.com/djsaunders/files/2015/01/Health-Care-Costs-.JPEG-0d3d9-350x250.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Debra J.
