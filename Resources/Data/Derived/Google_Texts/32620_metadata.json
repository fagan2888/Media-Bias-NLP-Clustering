It\u2019s a decision that\u2019s especially important this year, because federal money that reimburses some hospitals that treat the poor through the low income pool program is probably going away this summer.\n\nThe Senate is open to taking the Obamacare money and setting up A Healthy Florida Works, a program that would make insurance affordable for nearly a million people who are just above the poverty line but don\u2019t qualify for subsidies under the ACA.\n\nThe House is not having it, and neither is Scott.\n\nCue the looming state government shutdown.\n\nIf this were to happen, the Tampa Bay Times reports, a number of things could happen \u2014 or not happen, as it were. The state could lag on upgrades to roads and other infrastructure. A pre-kindergarten program could go unfunded. State workers could get furloughed. Child abuse investigations could slow down or come to a halt. Some highways, illuminated at night with help from Florida Department of Transportation dollars, could go dark.\n\nSo it sounds like a potential mess for many Floridians, except Scott and his ilk, who love the idea of government so small it can\u2019t begin to do things like regulate industries or help the poor meet their basic needs.\n\nIn light of what could be a very trying time starting July 1, here\u2019s our not-so-serious look at what a government shutdown could mean for us.\n\n\u2022 With a barebones budget and staff, Florida Fish and Wildlife will be unable to carry out its controversial bear hunts slated for October. The bears, emboldened by the state\u2019s inability to cull their supposedly burgeoning numbers, start wandering toward the coast, where a large bear family sets up camp in a luxury hotel.\n\n\u2022 The state Department of Environmental Protection won\u2019t have the equipment or manpower to clean up the toxic river sludge left behind by corporate polluters, and said sludge seeps into the groundwater. Among the tens of thousands who lose their health coverage because the state will no longer be able to participate in Medicaid, one drinks the contaminated mystery-sludge water and becomes Patient Zero. Zombies ensue.\n\n\u2022 Child support payments, which are processed through a state-run system, come to a grinding halt. Would-be deadbeat dads become actual deadbeat dads and head to the nearest convenience store for a 30-pack, a carton of smokes and some lotto tickets. However, because the state-run Florida Lottery program has also come to a halt, the deadbeat dads can\u2019t buy their lotto tickets and riot out of frustration.\n\n\u2022 Since the state is no longer able to respond to emergencies, Tampa Bay is overrun with zombies and rioting deadbeat dads. Our only hope is the bears.\n\nAnd the most unlikely scenario of all...\n\n\u2022 Within a few weeks, the general public starts to notice something is amiss. Teachers have stopped showing up to work because they\u2019ve stopped getting paychecks. Fish and Wildlife isn\u2019t issuing fishing permits. The DMV is closed, like, every day. There are zombies, and no one is cleaning up after them. Collectively the general public begins to do some digging to find out what\u2019s going on. They realize that not long ago, there was a day on which the people who caused this mess were elected (or re-elected) with the help of millions of dollars and slick advertising. Disgusted, nearly every single eligible voter vows to engage in the electoral process from here on out and vote in the next election, and each one thereafter. More candidates with integrity begin winning elections and making laws that actually help more people than they hurt, and we\u2019re all better off for it.\n\nNah. Never happen.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ahead of the June special legislative session in which the state House and Senate plan to fulfill their constitutional duty of passing a budget by the end...", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "http://r1.cltampa.com/files/base/scomm/cltampa/image/2015/05/960w/news_shutdown_florida_black_bear_052115.jpg", "site_name": "Creative Loafing: Tampa Bay", "description": "Ahead of the June special legislative session in which the state House and Senate plan to fulfill their constitutional duty of passing a budget by the end...", "title": "Impending doom: Florida's possible government shutdown and you"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "7ehqC5TVlujj_KkCw_cMXSyKukkqxKv9SOkcxE1CbCI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3e55\"", "article_summary": "Would-be deadbeat dads become actual deadbeat dads and head to the nearest convenience store for a 30-pack, a carton of smokes and some lotto tickets.\n\u2022 Since the state is no longer able to respond to emergencies, Tampa Bay is overrun with zombies and rioting deadbeat dads.\nIf this were to happen, the Tampa Bay Times reports, a number of things could happen \u2014 or not happen, as it were.\nHowever, because the state-run Florida Lottery program has also come to a halt, the deadbeat dads can\u2019t buy their lotto tickets and riot out of frustration.\nSome highways, illuminated at night with help from Florida Department of Transportation dollars, could go dark."}
