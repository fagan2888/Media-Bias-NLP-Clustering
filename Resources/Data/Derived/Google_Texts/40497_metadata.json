Those who are already covered can also make changes to their plans.\n\nDuring the first enrollment period from October 1, 2013, to March 31, more than 733,000 Texans selected an insurance plan, exceeding enrollment projections of about 629,000.\n\nThe enrollment period runs this time around from Saturday to Feb. 15, half the amount of time given last year.\n\n\u201cYou have only three months this time, so you want to make sure you apply early,\u201d said Mario Castillo, Texas organizing director for the nonprofit group Get Covered America.\n\nApplying early gives people a chance to look into subsidies they might qualify for that help with the cost of premiums. Castillo said 84 percent of Texans who enrolled last year qualified for some type of financial assistance.\n\n\u201cThe average cost of a plan was $72, so it was a lot more affordable than people realized,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that you can get quality, affordable health care for about what you pay for your cellphone monthly, or a cable bill.\u201d\n\nAll of the plans on the marketplace are required by law to cover 10 benefits the ACA deemed essential.\n\nThe required benefits include ambulatory services; emergency service; hospital stays; pregnancy, maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services; prescriptions; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management and pediatric services.\n\nNavigating the plans can be overwhelming, advocates and insurance agents said. But Castillo said there\u2019s help available to those who need it.\n\n\u201cIn-person assistance is available in their communities for free and they can obtain that to help with the application process and the enrollment process,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t done this before and it\u2019s something that you don\u2019t really understand or it\u2019s confusing, absolutely seek out the assistance.\u201d\n\nCastillo said those who seek the help are more likely to follow through and complete the process of obtaining coverage. They\u2019re able to ask questions about premiums, deductibles and co-pays and have a better understanding of their plan, he said.\n\nKim Sanford, an operations manager with Insurance Professionals, agreed.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing about using an agent is that plan choices are sometimes not self-explanatory,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to apply for a subsidy, it\u2019s definitely worthwhile to go through an agent. They don\u2019t have to be online and get overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nAgents can explain the difference between plans, as some plans provide more coverage and cost more than others. There are additional benefits of going through an agent, she said, including help with plans and claims once a plan is used.\n\nWhile three months might seem like a lot of time to find and pick coverage, many said it\u2019s better to enroll sooner as it takes some time after enrolling for coverage to actually go into effect.\n\n\u201cFor a Jan. 1 effective date, they have to enroll before Dec. 15. If it\u2019s after Dec. 15, their effective date is Feb. 1. After Jan. 15, it\u2019s March 1,\u201d Sanford said.\n\nLater effective dates could mean penalties down the road, something many of those uninsured in 2014 will soon face.\n\n\u201cThe last year, if you didn\u2019t end up obtaining coverage and were not covered for (at least) nine months of the year, the penalty is going to be enforced when you file your taxes for 2014,\u201d Castillo said.\n\nThe penalty is either $95 per person in 2014, or 1 percent of household income above the threshold for filing taxes, whichever is higher.\n\nFor example, a single woman who makes $25,000 a year as a call center operator and was uninsured for all of 2014 would owe a penalty of $148.50. That\u2019s 1 percent of $14,850, her income above the 2014 tax-filing threshold of $10,150.\n\nFor 2015, the penalty will rise to either 2 percent of income, or $325, whichever is higher.\n\nMany of the people facing fines are low-\n\nincome workers, a group the law was intended to help, though some will qualify for exemptions.\n\n\u201cYou can get a hardship exemption if you demonstrate a hardship in paying the premium for the insurance,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cIf you fall in the Medicaid gap, you can get an exemption so that you\u2019re not penalized for not having coverage.\u201d\n\nThe Medicaid gap, he said, is a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow states to opt out of expanding the Medicaid program. Texas was one of those states.\n\nThe expansion was designed to cover those people who could not afford to obtain marketplace coverage and did not qualify for financial assistance, but also did not qualify for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThose individuals are not penalized because the way the law was designed, they should have qualified for Medicaid,\u201d Castillo said.\n\nThe waivers were designed to ease the impact of the penalties. But while some exemptions seem simple, others will require math calculations.\n\nSome involve sending in the application by mail with supporting documents, such as copies of medical bills, police reports, obituaries, utility shut-off notices, even news articles. Applicants will have to dig up the documentation themselves \u2014 it won\u2019t be like filing the W-2s they get from employers.\n\nTwo federal agencies have roles in the waiver process, each with its own time schedule. Some people will apply directly to the Internal Revenue Service when they file their 2014 tax returns next year, or they can apply for the waiver now on the ACA enrollment website, healthcare.gov.\n\nThe forms are accompanied by worksheets to calculate the penalties and waivers, if they qualify. But the paperwork could overwhelm people who are used to completing their own tax documents.\n\n\u201cIf you are a do-it-\n\nyourself person who is going to try it on pen and paper, all I can say is, \u2018God be with you,\u2019\u201d said Mark Ciaramitaro, vice president of health care services at tax giant H&R Block.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Latest News, Local News, News, AMANDA CASTRO-CRIST, Insurance Professionals, Kim Sanford, Mario Castillo", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "The marketplace is ready for business as the second year of open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act gets underway this weekend.", "title": "Affordable Care Act reopens enrollment", "url": "http://amarillo.com/news/latest-news/2014-11-15/affordable-care-act-reopens-enrollment", "image": "http://amarillo.com/sites/default/files/13890933.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "The marketplace is ready for business as the second year of open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act gets underway this weekend.
