The proceeds help Trooper Jacqueline Kline, who was badly injured when she was hit by a car last month during a traffic stop on Route 100.\n\nTop News Photos of the Week\n\nAnother trooper was administering field sobriety tests to a driver on the shoulder around 1 a.m. Oct. 6 when Kline stopped at the scene to provide backup.\n\nBoth troopers had their overhead lights activated, but as Kline walked toward the other trooper, she was struck by a Nissan, hitting the hood of the car. She was then propelled into the back of the State Police K-9 car, where she hit the back windshield and metal K-9 cage inside the car before landing in a ditch.\n\nKline sustained head injuries, a broken arm, cuts and contusions. She spent several weeks at the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, and is now in a rehab hospital.\n\nHer mother, Amy Reed, says she expects her daughter to leave the hospital in about a week, but she'll continue physical therapy.\n\nShe says Kline is determined to return to work.\n\nThe crash sparked a boost in enforcement of the Move Over law, which requires drivers to switch lanes away from emergency vehicles. Despite the efforts, another trooper's car was destroyed during a traffic stop Oct. 12, and a third trooper was injured in a crash in late October while stopped.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE:\n\nCopyright Associated Press / NBC4 Washington", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jacqueline Kline was badly injured when she was hit by a car last month during a traffic stop.", "title": "Hundreds Race to Raise Money for Maryland State Trooper Badly Hurt During Traffic Stop", "og": {"site_name": "NBC4 Washington", "description": "Jacqueline Kline was badly injured when she was hit by a car last month during a traffic stop.", "title": "Hundreds Race to Raise Money for Injured Trooper", "url": "http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Hundreds-Race-to-Raise-Money-for-Maryland-State-Trooper-Badly-Hurt-During-Traffic-Stop-231451331.html", "image": "http://media.nbcwashington.com/images/1200*675/maryland-state-police.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jacqueline Kline was badly injured when she was hit by a car last month during a traffic stop.", "creator": "@nbcwashington", "url": "http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Hundreds-Race-to-Raise-Money-for-Maryland-State-Trooper-Badly-Hurt-During-Traffic-Stop-231451331.html", "image": "http://media.nbcwashington.com/images/1200*675/maryland-state-police.jpg?ak=bc", "title": "Hundreds Race to Raise Money for Injured Trooper", "site": "@nbcwashington", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 168641655540}, "keywords": "Jacqueline Kline, Jacqueline A.
