A 21-year-old landscaper is expected to be charged in connection with four shootings along Phoenix-area freeways that have kept drivers on edge for weeks.

Maricopa County Superior Court officials say Leslie Allen Merritt Jr. is scheduled to make an initial court appearance Saturday, a day after his arrest related to shootings on Aug. 29 and Aug. 31.

A spokesman for Gov. Doug Ducey says Merritt was taken into custody around 7 p.m. Friday at a Wal-Mart in Glendale, a suburb west of Phoenix.

Arizona Department of Public Safety director Col. Frank Milstead says Merritt is in custody because the weapon he owns is forensically linked to the crimes.
