BOSTON (AP) â€” The drinks are always cold at Boston's first ice bar.

The Frost Ice Bar, constructed and furnished entirely with blocks of ice kept at a chilly 21 degrees, opened Aug. 30 at Faneuil Hall.

It is New England's first permanent, year-round, indoor ice bar. New York's first ice bar open in July at the Hilton Hotel.

Visitors don insulated capes and gloves to keep warm while enjoying alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, in a unique interior that features an elaborately carved bar, chandelier, sculptures, seating and even paintings, all made of ice. The bar also features sculptures of Boston landmarks and historical figures, such the Swan Boats, The Zakim Memorial Bridge and Paul Revere.

Even the drinks are served in ice glasses.

Don't worry about frostbite. Visitors are limited to 45-minutes per visit.
