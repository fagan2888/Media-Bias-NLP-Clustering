In this reconfiguration and re-engineering of services, which is prompted by Affordable Care Act, the Loma Linda Health organization wants to \u201ccontinue its position of leadership,\u201d Heinrich said.\n\nThe future CEO of Loma Linda Healthcare said he is excited to be working with the SAC Health Systems, which spun off from Loma Linda University Health in order to qualify for federal programs under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSAC Health Systems, a safety net provider, plans a 150,000-square-foot downtown campus on 215 Freeway frontage property west of San Manuel Stadium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough legally separate, Loma Linda Health remains intertwined with SAC Health in regards to resident training and other aspects, Heinrich said.\n\n\u201cThey are part of our core mission,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LOMA LINDA >> The newly appointed interim chief executive of Loma Linda University Medical Center said his key objective will be to \u201creconfigure and focus on the new paradigm created by the Affordable Care Act.\u201dKerry Heinric", "title": "New Loma Linda healthcare chief to focus on health care reform planning", "og": {"url": "http://www.sbsun.com/health/20140521/new-loma-linda-healthcare-chief-to-focus-on-health-care-reform-planning", "image": {"width": "430px", "identifier": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20140521/NEWS/140529894/AR/0/AR-140529894.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "471px"}, "type": "article", "title": "New Loma Linda healthcare chief to focus on health care reform planning"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sbsun.com", "description": "LOMA LINDA >> The newly appointed interim chief executive of Loma Linda University Medical Center said his key objective will be to \u201creconfigure and focus on the new paradigm created by the Affordable Care Act.\u201dKerry Heinric", "title": "New Loma Linda healthcare chief to focus on health care reform planning", "url": "http://www.sbsun.com/health/20140521/new-loma-linda-healthcare-chief-to-focus-on-health-care-reform-planning", "image": {"src": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20140521/NEWS/140529894/AR/0/AR-140529894.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@sbsun", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563372734", "iphone": "id503662617", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sanbernardinosun"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Loma Linda,Loma Linda University Medical Center, Access to health care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Loma Linda,Loma Linda University Medical Center, Access to health care"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33e3\"", "article_summary": "Loma Linda University Health includes eight professional schools, Loma Linda University Medical Center\u2019s six hospitals and more than 800 faculty physicians.\nHeinrich, a Loma Linda attorney, has done legal work for the organizations that comprise Loma Linda University Health for 30 years.\nAdvertisementAlthough legally separate, Loma Linda Health remains intertwined with SAC Health in regards to resident training and other aspects, Heinrich said.\nThe future CEO of Loma Linda Healthcare said he is excited to be working with the SAC Health Systems, which spun off from Loma Linda University Health in order to qualify for federal programs under the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cLoma Linda (University Health) is not operating in the red,\u201d Heinrich said."}
