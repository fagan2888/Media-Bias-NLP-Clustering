The organization was formed five years ago, but never could quite find its niche within the homophobic Republican Party. GOProud founder Jimmy LaSalvia quit the organization and left the Republican Party last year, blasting party officials for their intolerant views on his way out. Co-founder Chris Barron also exited the GOProud organization in 2013 after a dispute regarding the group initially being denied participation in the CPAC convention.\n\nThe troubled organization has always seemed a bit slow to recognize that the Republican Party is not welcoming to gays and lesbians, regardless of how conservative they may be on economic issues. No matter how much the GOP leadership talks about personal liberty and individual rights, they ultimately bow to social conservatives. Anti-gay discrimination is enshrined in the GOP\u2019s national platform, and many state party platforms also explicitly support anti-gay discrimination.\n\nAs long as Republicans running for office continue to pander to the socially reactionary Christian Right, gays in the GOP will be treated as second class citizens. While some LGBT conservatives may hope that the party will embrace them as long as they hate Obamacare, love guns, and despise capital gains taxes as much as they do, the truth is the religious conservative base has no use for gays and lesbians period. Bigotry is like that. No matter how much LGBT Americans seek acceptance within the Republican ranks, that acceptance will not be forthcoming until the Republican Party purges itself of the intolerant social conservatives who control much of the party machinery.\n\nGOProud was simply never a viable group within a party that is all to eager to ratchet up antipathy towards gays to win over the support of social conservatives. Apparently the organization has figured out after five years of existence that they really have no home inside the Republican Party. GOProud is proud to be GOP no more, as they are disbanding.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The organization GOProud which was formed in 2009, is closing up shop and ceasing operations as an entity within the Republican Party.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Keith Brekhus", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The organization GOProud which was formed in 2009, is closing up shop and ceasing operations as an entity within the Republican Party.", "title": "Gay Republican Organization GOProud Is Throwing In The Towel And Calling it Quits", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/06/04/gay-republican-organization-goproud-throwing-towel-calling-quits.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/goproud.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-04T22:21:37+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,Chris Barron,Christian right,Conservative Political Action Conference,GOProud,homophobia,Jimmy LaSalvia,LGBT,LGBT conservatism,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2014-06-04T22:21:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-04T22:21:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Chris Barron, Christian right, Conservative Political Action Conference, GOProud, homophobia, Jimmy LaSalvia, LGBT, LGBT conservatism, Republican Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcacfc\"", "article_summary": "Advocate.com reports that the conservative LGBT organization GOProud is closing up shop.\nCo-founder Chris Barron also exited the GOProud organization in 2013 after a dispute regarding the group initially being denied participation in the CPAC convention.\nThe organization was formed five years ago, but never could quite find its niche within the homophobic Republican Party.\nApparently the organization has figured out after five years of existence that they really have no home inside the Republican Party.\nGOProud founder Jimmy LaSalvia quit the organization and left the Republican Party last year, blasting party officials for their intolerant views on his way out."}
