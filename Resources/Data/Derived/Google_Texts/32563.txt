PITTSBURGH (AP) - Notre Dame senior running back C.J. Prosise left Saturday’s win over Pittsburgh in the first half with a neck and shoulder injury and did not return.

Coach Brian Kelly says Prosise was injured while making contact with the ground following a 10-yard pass reception late in the first quarter. Kelly said Prosise was “doing pretty good” after the eighth-ranked Irish rolled to a 42-30 victory but will need further evaluation and is “day to day.”

Prosise finished with 28 yards rushing and 29 yards receiving before getting hurt. Freshman Josh Adams filled in capably in Prosise’s absence, running for 173 yards as Notre Dame won its fourth straight game.
