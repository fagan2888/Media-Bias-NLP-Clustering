Cathy Morris Rodgers, R-Wash., instead found her Facebook page filled with testimonials to the benefits of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA member of the House Republican leadership, McMorris Rodgers wanted a replenishment of anecdotes, such as the stories of questionable accuracy she told when giving the GOP response to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech.\n\n\u201cThis week marks the fifth anniversary of Obamacare being signed into law,\u201d wrote McMorris Rodgers.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s turning your tax filing into a nightmare, you\u2019re facing skyrocketing premiums, or your employer had reduced your work hours, I want to hear about it. Please share your story with me so I can better understand the challenge you\u2019re facing.\u201d\n\nA lot of folks shared stories. They were of a kind CMR didn\u2019t want to hear \u2014 and is largely insulated from hearing on trips home to by-invitation \u201cCoffees with Cathy\u201d in her Eastern Washington district.\n\nWhat did she hear? A sampling from McMorris Rodgers\u2019 Facebook page:\n\n\u2014 \u201cI work for Cancer Care Northwest. We actually have more patients with insurance and fewer having to choose treatment over bankruptcy. Cathy, I\u2019m a diehard conservative and I\u2019m asking you to just stop slamming Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cMy daughter is fighting for her life with Stage 3 breast cancer. We are about to enter a second go-round of diagnostic procedures and possibly more treatment after two full years of treatment. So yah, the Affordable Care Act is more than helping. I resent that our rep thinks the only problems involve her personal story.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cObamacare saved us when my husband was unemployed and we couldn\u2019t afford coverage. We might have been ruined without it. My husband could not have had eye surgery needed after an accident.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cThanks to the Affordable Care Act, my cousin was able to get affordable insurance despite her preexisting condition. So grateful.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cAnd now my granddaughter, diagnosed with MS at age 22, can have insurance. What do you plan to do with her?\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cMy story is that I once knew seven people who couldn\u2019t get health insurance. Now they all have it, thanks to the ACA and President Obama, and their plans are as good as the one my employer provides \u2014 and they pay less for them. Now, that\u2019s not the kind of story you want to hear.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cI work as a facilitator of a task force that is overseeing the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in Washington state. I have learned that the ACA is helping people who did not previously have health insurance to get it. It is helping bring down costs. It is improving the quality of care.\u201d\n\nThe sun will rise in the west before McMorris Rodgers includes any of these personal stories in her boilerplate rhetoric denouncing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPress releases from McMorris Rodgers\u2019 office speak \u2014 uniformly \u2014 about how each of her actions help the people of Eastern Washington.\n\nYet, the congresswoman represents a district with higher-than-national average unemployment, a greater percentage of people receiving food stamps and income levels lower than the national average.\n\nShe votes and argues the party line, however, and has what pundits describe as a \u201csafe\u201d seat. She is considered a comer in Congress.\n\nOn Thursday, however, there was a rare show of defiance from those Eastern Washington constituents.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Strange Bedfellows -- Politics News", "description": "She was asking for horror stories about health care, but Rep.
