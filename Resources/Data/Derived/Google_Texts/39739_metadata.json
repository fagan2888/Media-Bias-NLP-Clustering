So, in collaboration with Weill Cornell Medical College, he is putting together an integrated physicians group with a focus on primary care at 186 Joralemon St. in Brooklyn Heights, with another branch in Fort Greene and other locations in the works.\n\nThe practice occupies three and a half sparkling floors in the Joralemon Street building, several newly renovated. Another basement space is used for rehab, said Dr. Goddard, who led a tour of the facilities.\n\nMany of the group\u2019s doctors -- including primary care physicians and subspecialists -- previously practiced at LICH, and others were hand-picked by Dr. Goddard.\n\n\u201cWe are an integrated group who have all served the Brooklyn community for most of our professional careers and are dedicated to excellence in health care for the borough of Brooklyn,\u201d Dr. Goddard told the Brooklyn Eagle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got six primary care docs upstairs. We\u2019re talking to another community-based physician from Brooklyn Heights who I hope will decide to join us, and there are people I know from working with over the years who are quality physicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a couple of groups up on Eastern Parkway, for example, and a couple of groups down in Cobble Hill. So it\u2019s putting these blocks together.\u201d In Fort Greene, Drs. Ron Dailey and Jed Burack head the six-member group at Sunrise Medical, 55 Greene Ave.\n\nBesides the nucleus of primary care, the practice includes a gynecologist and an endocrinologist.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re setting up right now a diabetes program,\u201d Dr. Goddard said. \u201cWe recruited a nephrologist from Sinai, who is absolutely super. I have a neurologist who\u2019s part of the Cornell faculty seeing patients here; and a cardiologist from Cornell, also seeing patients here. I have a physiatrist, and we will be recruiting or will have dermatology, geriatrics, hematology, oncology, and we\u2019ve got a pulmonologist who\u2019s coming.\n\n\u201cSo in other words, I\u2019ve got all of the services on site and on Greene Avenue. And it means that instead of people trekking here, there and everywhere else, I can now say to someone, \u2018I really need you to see the neurologist. He\u2019s going to be here on Monday. Let\u2019s get you an appointment for Monday.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to do is get to a point where we have a nucleus of maybe 30 primary care physicians,\u201d Dr. Goddard continued. \u201cAnd what I\u2019m really looking to do is to have responsibility for providing care for about 100,000 insured lives. Those are the sorts of numbers we\u2019re going to need if we're going to be an effective part of an Accountable Care Organization.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Goddard said the practice would continue to grow \u201cusing the concept of practice without walls.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to have people physically located all in one spot in order to deliver integrated care. What you have to do is have them linked by commonality of purpose, and also by using the same methods for practice -- mainly the same electronic medical records platform. So if I have a patient go to see somebody on Greene Avenue, I\u2019m looking at the same record over here as they\u2019re looking at over there,\u201d he said.\n\nForming an integrated physicians group has enormous benefits for patients, Dr. Goddard said. \u201cEverybody is on a common platform; there\u2019s less room for error in terms of mistakes with that information. But more importantly, what it also means is that if I see a person who\u2019s a patient of, for example, Eileen Rassi upstairs, I know exactly what\u2019s going on with that patient. I know exactly what medications that patient is on, and where there may be sensitivities to different medications. And what it does is reduces the risk of error.\u201d\n\nIt also eliminates unnecessary duplication of medical tests, he said. \u201cIt makes it much more economical in terms of health care.\u201d\n\nDr. Goddard says that Weill Cornell shares the group\u2019s vision and commitment.\n\n\u201cCornell came and said, \u2018We\u2019re interested in establishing a presence in Brooklyn, and we\u2019re not interested in managing your practice. But we are interested in the fact that you know the community and you\u2019ve been successful,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Goddard said the practice planned to become a \u201cmedical home\u201d facility in 2015. \u201cWhat this is, is the concept of a caregiver who then takes responsibility for a particular problem,\u201d he explained. \u201cA good example of this would be diabetes. In a medical home, you\u2019re identified as the primary caregiver, and you\u2019re responsible for managing diabetes in that individual.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that the group is not a substitute for an emergency room. \u201cIf this is emergent, if this is acute, you need emergency room services. But we don\u2019t do that. We\u2019re interested in providing primary care and subspecialty care.\u201d He also explained that the group does not provide urgent care, like the nearby Mount Sinai facility.\n\nIf patients need emergency admission, \u201cthey\u2019re going to go to local hospitals,\u201d he said. \u201cIt actually turns out the closest emergency room to us geographically here happens to be New York Presbyterian Lower Manhattan,\u201d (formerly New York Downtown) now an affiliate of Weill Cornell which uses the same electronic health record platform.\n\n\n\nNew York Downtown, at 170 William St., is the only hospital left serving lower Manhattan. It has 128 beds, according to U.S. News and World Report.\n\nWhen asked what he wanted the Brooklyn community to know about the physicians group, Dr. Goddard said, \u201cThat we care about the community, that we care about making sure that the community enjoys better medical services than they\u2019ve enjoyed before, and that we would like to be your healthcare provider.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m going to have good services. My daughter and husband bought a loft off Fulton Mall, so I have to.\u201d\n\nWeill Cornell Physicians at Brooklyn Heights\n\n186 Joralemon Street, 8th floor\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11201\n\n646 962 4656", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brooklyn rheumatologist Dr. David Goddard, former section head at LICH, in collaboration with Weill Cornell Medical College, is putting together an integrated physicians group at 186 Joralemon St. in Brooklyn Heights.", "rights": "Copyright 2014 | Everything Brooklyn Media", "og": {"image": "http://www.brooklyneagle.com/sites/default/files/pages/weill_cornell_physicians_at_brooklyn_heights._inbrooklyn_photo_by_gina_osnovich.jpg"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "robots": "follow, index, noarchive", "keywords": "Brooklyn, Brooklyn Heights, medical care, Cornell", "abstract": "Brooklyn rheumatologist Dr. David Goddard, former section head at LICH, in collaboration with Weill Cornell Medical College, is putting together an integrated physicians group at 186 Joralemon St. in Brooklyn Heights.", "news_keywords": "Brooklyn, Brooklyn Heights, medical care, Cornell"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf4a\"", "article_summary": "Many of the group\u2019s doctors -- including primary care physicians and subspecialists -- previously practiced at LICH, and others were hand-picked by Dr. Goddard.\n\u201cWhat I want to do is get to a point where we have a nucleus of maybe 30 primary care physicians,\u201d Dr. Goddard continued.\nWe\u2019re interested in providing primary care and subspecialty care.\u201d He also explained that the group does not provide urgent care, like the nearby Mount Sinai facility.\n\u201cWe are an integrated group who have all served the Brooklyn community for most of our professional careers and are dedicated to excellence in health care for the borough of Brooklyn,\u201d Dr. Goddard told the Brooklyn Eagle.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got six primary care docs upstairs."}
