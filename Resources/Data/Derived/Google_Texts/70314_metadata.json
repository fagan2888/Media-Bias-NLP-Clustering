(Courtesy)\n\nWintry weather caused Mount Washington Auto Road to restrict access to private vehicles on Saturday\n\n\n\n\u2014 The Mount Washington Observatory on Saturday received its first snow of autumn 2015.\n\n\n\nBetween 1 and 6 a.m. yesterday, .5 inches of snow fell on the Rock Pile, according to Kaitlyn O'Brien, who is a meteorologist and the co-director of summit operations for the observatory.\n\n..\n\nLocated at the 6,288-foot peak of the tallest mountain in the Northeast, the observatory in that same period also recorded a wind gust of 99 mph.\n\n\n\nAlthough its guided tours were unaffected, the wintry weather caused the Mount Washington Auto Road to restrict access to private vehicles, said General Manager Howie Wemyss, who noted that they were allowed to travel only a little more than half of the road's eight-mile length.\n\n..\n\n\u201cWe are battling winter at the summit,\u201d said Wemyss, \u201cbut we think we'll come out of it tomorrow (Sunday) and be fully open again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHome of the world's worst weather,\u201d Saturday's conditions were not unique on Mount Washington, said Wemyss.\n\n..\n\n\u201cThis is very routine for this time of year,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nO'Brien, too, said getting snow at the observatory is a regular occurrence.\n\n\n\nOver its 83-year history, the observatory has received snow every month of the year, she said, albeit not for 12 months consecutively.\n\n..\n\nOn average, the observatory gets 2.2 inches of snow in September \u2013 although it recorded none this year \u2013 and an average of 17.6 inches in October.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is just the start. It's certainly late but not terribly under\u201d seasonal norms, O'Brien said of Saturday's snow.\n\n..\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of rime ice as well covering all of the buildings and structure as well,\u201d she said, adding that the fog covered the observatory until about 9 a.m. Saturday.\n\n\n\nWhen the fog lifted, \u201cwe had pretty much a wintry scene with 130-mile visibility,\u201d said O'Brien, along with a stunning visual juxtaposition of the white snow and rime ice with the fall foliage below.\n\n..\n\njkoziol@newstote.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Mount Washington Observatory on Saturday received its first snow of autumn 2015.", "title": "Wintry weather caused Mount Washington Auto Road to restrict access to private vehicles on Saturday | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "The Mount Washington Observatory on Saturday received its first snow of autumn 2015.", "title": "Wintry weather caused Mount Washington Auto Road to restrict access to private vehicles on Saturday | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20151011/NEWS11/151019957&source=RSS", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20151011/NEWS11/151019957/AR/0/AR-151019957.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Weather", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "White Mountains,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-10-11 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "The Mount Washington Observatory on Saturday received its first snow of autumn 2015.", "title": "Wintry weather caused Mount Washington Auto Road to restrict access to private vehicles on Saturday | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20151011/NEWS11/151019957&source=RSS", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20151011/NEWS11/151019957/AR/0/AR-151019957.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcefd7\"", "article_summary": "(Courtesy)Wintry weather caused Mount Washington Auto Road to restrict access to private vehicles on Saturday\u2014 The Mount Washington Observatory on Saturday received its first snow of autumn 2015.\nAlthough its guided tours were unaffected, the wintry weather caused the Mount Washington Auto Road to restrict access to private vehicles on Saturday, after the first snow of the season on the mountain.\nAlthough its guided tours were unaffected, the wintry weather caused the Mount Washington Auto Road to restrict access to private vehicles, said General Manager Howie Wemyss, who noted that they were allowed to travel only a little more than half of the road's eight-mile length.\n..\u201cWe are battling winter at the summit,\u201d said Wemyss, \u201cbut we think we'll come out of it tomorrow (Sunday) and be fully open again.\u201d\u201cHome of the world's worst weather,\u201d Saturday's conditions were not unique on Mount Washington, said Wemyss.\nOver its 83-year history, the observatory has received snow every month of the year, she said, albeit not for 12 months consecutively."}
