Like many of the economic concerns that animated Tea Party supporters, immigration issues play to people\u2019s anxieties about their financial well-being and the future. Many conservatives who have long mistrusted Mr. Obama because they think his policies will fundamentally alter America believe that his new immigration order will do just that, with millions of potential new foreign-born citizens even though the president\u2019s action does not call for a path to citizenship.\n\nThe conundrum for the Republican Party is how to channel that energy. Turned against liberalism, as it was in the 2010 elections that ousted Democrats from power in the House of Representatives, it can deliver serious political advantage. But turned inward, as it so often has been over the last four years, it threatens to tear the party apart. In Virginia, Mr. Cantor\u2019s ouster so emboldened activists that they have started using \u201cto Cantor\u201d as a shorthand for defeating establishment Republicans.\n\nConservatives see a moment of truth for Tea Party supporters as well. If they think Republican leaders in Congress are not doing enough to fight Mr. Obama on immigration, what is their recourse?\n\n\u201cWhat the Tea Party has struggled with doing is translating their ideological appeal into political clout,\u201d said Laura Ingraham, the conservative author and radio host. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of political clout. They can get out the vote, yes. But I\u2019m talking about getting individual committee chairmen and senators who can mount a real challenge to the establishment forces when required. And can you do that from within the Republican Party?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne challenge is that some of the party\u2019s biggest financial backers want to see an immigration overhaul pass in Congress. And groups that helped finance the Tea Party\u2019s rise, like Americans for Prosperity, which is supported by Charles and David Koch, will not be there to help the anti-immigration overhaul cause.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill are discussing ways to challenge Mr. Obama but are struggling to find a path that does not anger the right. One would be to go to court; another, though it has been discounted by the House Appropriations Committee, would be to try to cut off funding. Other possible pressure points include refusing to confirm the president\u2019s nominees, like Loretta E. Lynch, Mr. Obama\u2019s pick to replace Eric H. Holder Jr. as attorney general.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut satisfying the conservative base will be difficult. Tea Party activists are not likely to sit patiently while a lawsuit works its way through the courts. And many have already expressed skepticism about the Republican leadership\u2019s willingness to see through a fight over appropriations.\n\nSome Kentucky Tea Party activists are already talking about a primary challenge to Representative Harold Rogers, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who has been in office since 1981. Breitbart News, a conservative website, reported on the possible primary challenger last week. Mr. Rogers\u2019s office has said Congress could not simply defund the president\u2019s directive, because the agency that carries it out, Citizenship and Immigration Services, is not financed by appropriations but by the fees it generates.\n\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s a risk to overreacting, but there\u2019s a risk to underreacting as well,\u201d said Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review. \u201cAnd I fear that\u2019s the way the congressional leadership is leaning.\u201d\n\nMr. Lowry suggested one way Congress could react. \u201cIf I were John Boehner,\u201d he said, referring to the House speaker, \u201cI\u2019d say to the president: \u2018Send us your State of the Union in writing. You\u2019re not welcome in our chamber.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOther potential primary targets, Tea Party groups say, are Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the 2012 Republican vice-presidential nominee, and even Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who was elected initially with the help of Tea Party energy.\n\nBut that would be a tough and expensive fight. Almost all Tea Party challengers were defeated this year \u2014 with the race against Mr. Cantor the notable exception. And patience for low-reward tactics like a government shutdown is waning. As shown by how quickly even many of the staunchest conservatives on Capitol Hill tried to dismiss talk of closing the government to pressure Mr. Obama on immigration, the lessons of the 2013 shutdown are sinking in.\n\nStill, others see a conservative populist cause that will be hard to stop. In a speech to the Heritage Foundation on Friday, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, made the case that Mr. Obama and the titans of business who supported his immigration policy, like Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, were ignoring the will of ordinary Americans who want good-paying jobs that are not taken by immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are a nation, and a nation owes things to its people,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cAnd the average working truck driver is worth just as much as Mr. Zuckerberg, just as much as the Wall Street masters of the universe. And who\u2019s representing them?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141125132247, "twitter": {"description": "Federal spending reductions and the battle against the Affordable Care Act are taking a back seat to immigration, to the point that party members are calling for Sarah Palin to oppose John McCain, who supports immigration overhaul.", "title": "After Obama\u2019s Immigration Action, a Blast of Energy for the Tea Party", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/us/obamas-immigration-action-reinvigorates-tea-party.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003255232"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "jwpetersNYT", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/26/us/SUB-SUB-TEAPARTY1/SUB-SUB-TEAPARTY1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/us/obamas-immigration-action-reinvigorates-tea-party.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003255232", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/us/obamas-immigration-action-reinvigorates-tea-party.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 25, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "House of Representatives", "keywords": "Tea Party Movement,Illegal Immigration,Immigration and Emigration,Obama  Barack,Executive Orders and Memorandums,United States Politics and Government,Midterm Elections (2014),Senate,House of Representatives,Sessions  Jefferson B III", "news_keywords": "Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jeremy W.
