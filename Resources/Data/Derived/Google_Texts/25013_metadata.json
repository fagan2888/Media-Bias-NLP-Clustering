Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts announced Wednesday that \u201cStar Wars\u201d creator George Lucas, groundbreaking actresses Rita Moreno and Cicely Tyson, singer Carole King, rock band the Eagles and acclaimed music director Seiji Ozawa will receive this year\u2019s Kennedy Center Honors.\n\nThe diverse group includes six honorees this year. In the past, the Kennedy Center has honored five each year. Organizers said they didn\u2019t want to pass up the chance to honor any of these artists with the national award for influencing American culture through the arts.\n\nThe Kennedy Center Honors culminates in a gala performance Dec. 6 in Washington, featuring top entertainers. The show will be broadcast Dec. 29 on CBS.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at this year\u2019s honorees:\n\nGeorge Lucas\n\nA self-described storyteller at heart, Lucas, 71, created some of the most successful movie franchises with \u201cStar Wars and \u201cIndiana Jones.\u201d He\u2019s also hailed as a pioneer in developing new digital technology to enhance his films\u2019 visual and sound qualities.\n\nLucas said the Kennedy Center acknowledgement is a great honor. \u201cThe honorees over the history of the awards are huge, and it\u2019s great to be in the same company,\u201d he said.\n\nShortly after Lucas receives the award this year, \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d directed by J.J. Abrams will be released in December. This will be the first \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie made without Lucas\u2018 direction. He sold his film company two years ago to Disney as he prepared to retire.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see it. I don\u2019t know anything about it. I\u2019m going to be surprised just like everybody else,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cWhen I sold the company I just sort of relinquished all control. I just sold it. You know, it\u2019s like your children going off to college. Suddenly you don\u2019t have control over it anymore. It\u2019s just the passage of life.\u201d\n\nNow Lucas is working to share his craft with the public through a new museum of narrative art planned for Chicago. But some in the city have opposed the choice of a waterfront location for the seven-story museum. The filmmaker said he is hopeful construction can begin by next spring.\n\n___\n\nRita Moreno\n\nAs an actress and singer on Broadway and in more than 40 feature films, Moreno, 83, has won all four of the biggest prizes in show business - the Oscar, the Tony, two Emmys and a Grammy. When she heard she was receiving the Kennedy Center Honors, Moreno said she immediately thought of her native Puerto Rico and her mother, not speaking any English, who brought her to New York City as a young girl to start a new life.\n\n\u201cYou are reminded that no one is completely self-made,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cYou could say it\u2019s the American dream come true. \u2026 We were on welfare for a while. It\u2019s the immigrant story. It\u2019s also the American dream story. I am just absolutely beside myself with the recognition that I\u2019m getting, I guess, for battling it out and hanging on.\u201d\n\nAnd she\u2019s not done yet. Moreno just finished a new album in Spanish produced by Emilio Estefan and an independent film called \u201cRemember Me.\u201d Last month she was grand marshal of the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. If nothing else happens, I\u2019ve had the best year of my life,\u201d Moreno said.\n\n___\n\nCicely Tyson\n\nThe renowned actress known for her portrayals of strong black women, Tyson, 90, said she was speechless and breathless when she heard she would be receiving \u201cthe highest honor given to a performer.\u201d\n\nTyson may be best known for her leading role in \u201cThe Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,\u201d and she was nominated for an Academy Award for \u201cSounder.\u201d Her performances in \u201cRoots,\u201d \u201dThe Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All,\u201d \u201dFried Green Tomatoes,\u201d \u201dDiary of a Mad Black Woman\u201d and \u201cThe Help\u201d have made an impact as well.\n\nTyson said she was always selective with what roles she would take - but the Kennedy Center Honor tells her she made the right choices.\n\n\u201cDuring my career I certainly questioned whether or not I was doing the right thing when I turned down roles,\u201d she said. \u201cNeedless to say there were very few roles over the years written for women. I had to wait for it not only to be written for a woman but for a black woman. And then of course the longer I live, I became involved in ageism. So there\u2019s always been that challenge.\u201d\n\nTyson will return to Broadway in September, co-starring with James Earl Jones in \u201cThe Gin Game.\u201d Returning to the stage is \u201clike the beginning of a whole new career again,\u201d she said, laughing.\n\n___\n\nCarole King\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly 30 years since King, 73, was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame for her broad influence on pop music, defining the sounds of the 1960s and 70s. She wrote her first No. 1 hit \u201cWill You Love Me Tomorrow\u201d at just 17 years old.\n\nNow more than 400 of her compositions have been recorded by more than 1,000 artists. King wrote such songs as \u201cThe Loco-Motion,\u201d \u201dOne Fine Day\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m into Something Good\u201d with her former husband Gerry Goffin.\n\nKing said it\u2019s amazing to be in such esteemed company for the Kennedy Center Honors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m humbled and grateful to accept,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky to be able to do the work I love for so many years. And it\u2019s even more rewarding to know that what I do has touched the lives of so many people.\u201d\n\n___\n\nEagles\n\nHaving sold more than 120 million albums worldwide with their Southern California sound, the Eagles have become one of the most influential American rock bands of all time, according to Kennedy Center producers. The band\u2019s \u201cTheir Greatest Hits 1971-1975\u201d album is second only to Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d as the best-selling album of all time.\n\nGlenn Frey and Don Henley co-wrote most of the band\u2019s best-known songs, including \u201cHotel California.\u201d They began touring as members of Linda Ronstadt\u2019s backing band but then began writing songs for their debut album, \u201cEagles.\u201d The band members came together from their roots in Detroit, Texas, Kansas and California and stayed together from 1971 to 1980. But they were reunited in 1994 for an MTV special and launched a tour that ran through 1996.\n\nIn a joint statement, the band members said they were \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d for the honor.\n\n\u201cThe members of the Eagles hail from different regions of this great nation, and we feel very fortunate that our music has been embraced by people from all walks of life, all over the world,\u201d they said. \u201cPopular music is one of America\u2019s greatest exports - a bridge that spans geographical and cultural boundaries. We are truly humbled to have been able to be a part of this global connection.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSeiji Ozawa\n\nOne of the celebrities of classical music, Ozawa, 79, was music director of the Boston Symphony for 29 years until 2002. He has led orchestras around the world, including in Toronto, San Francisco and Vienna since he began conducting as a teenager in Japan after World War II. Now Ozawa leads Japan\u2019s pre-eminent music and opera festival.\n\nOzawa said he was honored to join some of the other heroes of classical music conducting who have received the honor - John Williams, Mstislav Rostropovich, Leonard Bernstein.\n\n\u201cBig names. I feel very honored that they are going to give it to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m super happy.\u201d\n\nOzawa started out playing piano, but broke two fingers playing rugby. He thought he would have to give up music, but his piano teacher suggested he could try conducting. Ozawa had no television at home, growing up in poverty, and had never seen an orchestra conductor in his life. Still, he began training at 15 or 16 years old and has devoted his life to conducting music.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m thinking I was super lucky,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ... it would be difficult to imagine a lineup of artists quite like this.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away \u2026 it would be difficult to imagine a lineup of artists quite like this.", "title": "George Lucas, Cicely Tyson, Eagles win Kennedy Center Honors", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/15/george-lucas-cicely-tyson-eagles-win-kennedy-cente/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/15/c58e8db98e2d471f7c0f6a706700f2fd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/15/c58e8db98e2d471f7c0f6a706700f2fd.jpg", "description": "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ... it would be difficult to imagine a lineup of artists quite like this.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "George Lucas, Cicely Tyson, Eagles win Kennedy Center Honors"}, "Author": "BRETT ZONGKER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Kennedy Center, Seiji Ozawa, Carole King, Cicely Tyson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9984\"", "article_summary": "Tyson said she was always selective with what roles she would take - but the Kennedy Center Honor tells her she made the right choices.\nThe Kennedy Center Honors culminates in a gala performance Dec. 6 in Washington, featuring top entertainers.\nThe John F.
