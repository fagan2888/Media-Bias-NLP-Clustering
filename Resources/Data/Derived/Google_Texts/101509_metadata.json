Wharton\n\nOn signing people up for Affordable Care Act\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest obstacles \u2014 I hate to put it that way \u2014 is that we have a public hospital here known as the Regional Medical Center that has always been there, we have large emergency rooms, and I think most folks think that, \u2018Hey look, I\u2019ve heard all this stuff before and when we get sick we go to the emergency room.'\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I try to get down to the details and try to explain to them that the emergency rooms are crowded now, they will be even more crowded because hospitals will lose their DISH payments, the essential access funds, you lose them. Their eyes glaze over.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a tough sell\u2026.Those without insurance have been without insurance for decades and they haven\u2019t found themselves dying in the ditches alongside the road\u2026No one has been able to convince them that that service is in jeopardy also.\u201d\n\nOn the fairness of cities and states cutting pensions\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to situations like this, fair is a word that is not in the vocabulary, quite frankly. It\u2019s just a matter of survival. And when it comes down to how\u2019s the city going to survive, the first casualties are values such as fairness.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil the Detroit bankruptcy it was unthinkable, and in Illinois, until the legislature changed the law, it was unthinkable that anybody would ever touch a vested pension interest. But this is a new world. I think the abnormal will become the new normal. I just don\u2019t think that anything will be sacrosanct when it comes to public benefits anymore\u2026tragically what\u2019s fair is not going to be the order of the day.\u201d\n\nGuest", "article_metadata": {"description": "A.C.
