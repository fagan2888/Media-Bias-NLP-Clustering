Jennifer Granholm continues to make a name for herself on the national stage and back in California, where she spent most of her childhood and is now teaching law and public policy.\n\nWelcome back to Michigan Political Points, my weekly roundup of interesting news, views and YouTubes from the state Capitol and beyond.\n\n\u2022 GOV AGAIN? The San Francisco Chronicle this week highlighted the growing stature of Granholm and former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who is now president of the University of California.\n\nThe report did not mention specific political offices either could pursue, but a Democratric strategist said both women would be \"formidable leaders if they chose to swim in California elective waters.\"\n\nGranholm, who is co-chairing a prominent Super PAC ready to back a potential presidential run by Hillary Clinton, told the newspaper she has no plans to run for anything herself but will \"certainly want to continue helping others.\"\n\n\u2022 INNER NERD: Current Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, who calls himself \"one tough nerd,\" geeked out Tuesday in the halls of the state Capitol, where winning high school students from the state's FIRST Robotics competition joined him as he signed the 2015 education budget into law.\n\n\"What a pleasure it is to see the kids and the work and their commitment to excellence and so many people that are really embracing their inner nerd,\" said Lt. Gov. Brian Calley. \"And what I'd say to you is, just think, some day you could be governor.\"\n\nMoments later a robot built by students from the Belmont area rolled up to Snyder and delivered him the pen he used to sign the bill. Critics knocked the budget for its per-pupil funding allocation formula, but nobody cried foul about losing a Michigan job to a robot.\n\n\u2022 BUFFER ZONE: Right to Life of Michigan on Thursday celebrated a U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down a Massachusetts law that had prohibited protesters from gathering within 35 feet of abortion clinics. The law had expanded a smaller \"buffer zone\" rule enacted in response to a series of violent encounters in the state.\n\nMichigan does not have buffer zone restrictions, but Right to Life called the ruling \"a victory for the First Amendment right to free speech and a victory for the passionate people who stand witness to life.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to decide another case next week -- Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby -- that religious organizations are watching closely. At issue is whether a private company has the religious right to deny contraceptive coverage in health care plans as otherwise required under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u2022 THROWBACK THURSDAY: Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer spent a big part of his week talking Michigan roads, education funding and charter school oversight.
