Rick Perry to Republican spending cuts (that the President also pushed for, but never mind). And on the right, it seems some conservatives have forgotten their animus for czar appointments, suddenly demanding more bureaucratic oversight, of all things \u2014 and then, when the President capitulates, complaining that the appointment of Ron Klain was too \u201cpolitical.\u201d Huh?\n\nAs for the President\u2019s role, Dems are remaining fairly quiet regarding his handling of the situation, which isn\u2019t a great sign. Some in tough elections \u2014 like Sen. Kay Hagan in North Carolina and aspiring governor Wendy Davis in Texas \u2014 are even breaking with the President and calling for a travel ban to and from affected countries.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, are finding creative ways to blame everything from President Obama\u2019s lax border policies to his supposedly nefarious desire to make America more like Africa, as Phyllis Schlafly actually suggested. Ugh.\n\nAnd Obama is blaming the media for making more of Ebola than it really is. \u201cThe Ebola crisis . . . (which) has been the only story here in the United States for the last couple of weeks, is not an outbreak and epidemic here,\u201d he assured donors at a Chicago fund-raiser.\n\nThis \u2014 and only this \u2014 is the President\u2019s problem. Obama is repeatedly the man who cried, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nWhile good leaders know that overreacting can foster panic, they also know that underreacting fosters insecurity. And time and time again, Obama underplays developing scandals, crises and failures to create the appearance of control. The result is often the opposite.\n\nWorried about the Affordable Care Act affecting your health care and your bottom line? Don\u2019t be, the cool and collected President assured us. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan. Your insurance premiums will go down, he told us.\n\nConcerned that the IRS, one of the largest and most powerful bureaucracies in the world, is targeting American citizens for their political proclivities? Nonsense. Despite stonewalling by top officials and the disappearance of countless \u201cunrecoverable\u201d emails, Obama insisted there\u2019s \u201cnot even a smidgen of corruption.\u201d Nothing to see here.\n\nAnxious about terrorism? Don\u2019t be silly. Al Qaeda has been \u201cdecimated,\u201d and ISIS is just Al Qaeda\u2019s \u201cjayvee\u201d team.\n\nUneasy about the NSA\u2019s data-collection program? What for? Obama proposed reforms that he said \u201cshould give the American people greater confidence that their rights are being protected\u201d \u2014 even though the ACLU, a left-right coalition of 125 House members and the President\u2019s own review group said they didn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nShocked that a mentally disturbed, knife-wielding fence-jumper made it all the way into the East Room of the White House? Rest assured the President has \u201ccomplete confidence\u201d in the Secret Service, despite numerous security breaches over the past couple of years.\n\nIncidentally, at one time or another, Obama has also expressed \u201ccomplete confidence\u201d in then-Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Treasury head Timothy Geithner, Attorney General Eric Holder and VA director Eric Shinseki. That\u2019s hardly an illustrious list, but proof once again that even in the midst of obvious turmoil, Obama remains not just unfazed but alarmingly unfazed.\n\nSo media outlets will fill the void left by a shoulder-shrugging President who seems to care less than the average person about these failures, and not surprisingly, this trickles down to voters.\n\nAccording to Gallup, 1 in 5 Americans are worried about contracting Ebola, despite the President\u2019s confidence, and the disease now ranks among the top 10 issues Americans consider to be the most important.\n\nJournalist Tina Brown explained on MSNBC why she thinks Obama is now under water with female voters in battleground states: \u201c(Women) feel unsafe economically; they\u2019re feeling unsafe with regard to ISIS; they\u2019re feeling unsafe about Ebola. What they\u2019re feeling unsafe about is the government response to different crises.\u201d\n\nThe President forgets that, whether people are right or wrong about their fears, politics is perception.\n\nObama didn\u2019t invent Ebola. He didn\u2019t \u201cbring it here\u201d and he doesn\u2019t \u201cwant it here.\u201d But he could act a little more alarmed that it\u2019s here. Someone needs to tell him that when surrounded by wolves, it\u2019s OK, every once in a while, to cry wolf.\n\nContact Cupp at www.thesecupp.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "S.E.
