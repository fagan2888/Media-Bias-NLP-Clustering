Accordingly, the Internet is preparing a long toke on goofy stories and click-bait headlines. (Pro tip: Fox News First likes the symmetry of \u201cBowl Bowl,\u201d but for those looking for a more direct route, \u201cKind Bud Bowl\u201d or \u201cReal Bud Bowl\u201d both have obvious merit.) But beneath the endless pot jokes, there is something happening around social issues in this election cycle. For Democrats, pot legalization is fast becoming a litmus-test question for candidates. By the time we get to 2016, Hillary Clinton have to drop by a Boulder smoke shop rather than just lifting beers in bars as she did in 2008. And what will Senate candidates this year have to say about the moves toward pot de-criminalization? Certainly, Colorado\u2019s Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper will lose some votes over the state\u2019s reimagining of \u201cRocky Mountain High.\u201d\n\nObama: Pot is like cigarettes - In an interview with New York Magazine, President Obama said: \u201cAs has been well documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life. I don't think it is more dangerous than alcohol.\u201d Obama said that pot use was less dangerous than booze \u201cin terms of its impact on the individual consumer.\u201d More.\n\nAbortion still central - While the pot story is beguiling, especially for Baby Boomers who helped bring cannabis into the mainstream, it is a relatively new arrival to the culture wars. The central issue for a decade among liberals was gay marriage. But shifting public opinion on the issue as well as a spate of court decisions have sapped much of the charge from the topic. The most important social issue among Republicans, though, has been and will continue to be abortion. And this week will highlight what remains American\u2019s most contentious social issue.\n\n[Democrats have cheered Pope Francis\u2019 laments about income inequality and capitalism, and President Obama is said to be lining up a meeting. But will liberals be so keen on the new pontiff as they are reminded of his stance on abortion and gay marriage? Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream looks at the perils of using religious figures for political aims.]\n\nMarch on - This week, hundreds of thousands of pro-life activists will descend on Washington for Wednesday\u2019s National March for Life. Still ringing in their ears will be comments from Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the \u201cextreme conservatives who are right-to-life, pro-assault-weapon, anti-gay\u201d have \u201cno place in the state of New York, because that\u2019s not who New Yorkers are.\u201d Cuomo, a popular incumbent up for re-election this year, may be insulated from the blowback because of the heavily liberal lean of his state. But the remarks highlight the deepening divide between red America and blue America on the issue. Not only will abortion animate general-election voters, but will be a litmus test in an increasing number of Republican primaries. The proliferation of state-level, late-term abortion bans and abortion clinic regulations in the wake of the Kermit Gosnell case will make sure of that.\n\n[Nebraska Republican Senate hopeful Ben Sasse released a video Sunday marking this week\u2019s 41st anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision featuring his two-year-old son, Breck. But it\u2019s not kids\u2019 stuff: \u201cAs of January 1st, Uncle Sam is now in the abortion business,\u201d Sasse says of the implementation of ObamaCare.]\n\n\n\nDavis hid husband\u2019s help - Texas Democratic gubernatorial frontrunner Wendy Davis has long emphasized her rise from teenaged single mother living in a trailer to Harvard Law School to a successful legal career to the state Senate. It was there that she became a heroine to American liberals for her arduous, though ultimately unsuccessful, fight to preserve legal access to late-term, elective abortions in the state. But The Dallas Morning News reports that Davis\u2019 story of hardship and self-reliance omits a key figure: her second husband. \u201cDavis was 21, not 19, when she was divorced. She lived only a few months in the family mobile home while separated from her husband before moving into an apartment with her daughter. A single mother working two jobs, she met Jeff Davis, a lawyer 13 years older than her, married him and had a second daughter. He paid for her last two years at Texas Christian University and her time at Harvard Law School, and kept their two daughters while she was in Boston.\u201d Davis even carried the claim of being a teenaged single mother into testimony in a federal lawsuit. She apologized, telling the paper: \u201cMy language should be tighter. I\u2019m learning about using broader, looser language. I need to be more focused on the detail.\u201d Her ex-husband bears no apparent ill will, saying she would be a \u201cgood governor.\u201d But Jeff Davis counseled against sob stories, \u201cShe got a break. Good things happen, opportunities open up. You take them; you get lucky. That\u2019s a better narrative than what they\u2019re trying to paint.\u201d\n\nGet back Honky Cat: Putin celebrates Elton John despite gayness - Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed criticism of his \u201cgay propaganda\u201d law during an interview with Russian and foreign news anchors Friday. \u201cRead the law carefully,\u201d Putin said, \u201cand see what it\u2019s called. The law\u2019s called \u2018On banning the promotion of pedophilia and homosexuality.\u2019\u2019\u2019 The Russian president defended the law because he feels it combats Russia\u2019s demographic decline. In a separate interview with BBC, Putin said he has gay friends [lucky them!], further stating, \u201cIf [gay people] achieve great things, like, for example, Elton John does, he\u2019s a brilliant man, a brilliant musician, and millions of people sincerely love him, despite his [sexual] orientation, it doesn\u2019t have any significance as regards him, especially as a brilliant musician. I think that that very entirely democratic approach to people with non-traditional sexual orientation, with measures to defend our children and our future demographic growth are optimal.\u201d\n\n[\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that theres some folks who just really dislike me because they don\u2019t like the idea of a black president. Now, the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because I\u2019m a black president.\u201d \u2013President Obama talking to The New Yorker.]\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\n\nOn the federal holiday commemorating his birth, Martin Luther King\u2019s embrace of Christian values and ideology is still resonant. At this time 50 years ago King was deeply embroiled in politics as he worked with President Lyndon Johnson on passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act. King remains a political figure 85 years after his birth and nearly 46 years after his death. USA Today considers King\u2019s ongoing political relevance. \u201c[T]o a number of conservatives [neglected in celebrations of King are] his firm embrace of Christian values and a desire to see a colorblind America live up to the creed of equality professed by the Founding Fathers.\u201d Former Rep. Dave Weldon, R-Fla., told the paper: \u201cThe positive impact he\u2019s had on this nation is immeasurable. The attraction to conservatives is that he voiced a lot of things, such as how our nation should be colorblind, that and honestly, how he put his faith into action. Those are conservative values, Republican values.\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

James Lankford, R-Okla., will announce his intention today to run for the seat being vacated by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., at the end of this year. Lankford, who was first elected in 2010, quickly ascended into the Republican leadership. He is considered a potent potential fundraiser. This sets up a possible showdown with Rep. Jim Bridenstine, a conservative Republican who ousted five-term Republican incumbent Rep. John Sullivan in 2012. Bridenstine is still mulling his run, but if he opts to get in, it would likely be a donnybrook. Gov. Mary Fallin, R-Okla., has called a special election concurrent with November\u2019s regular vote, to choose a new senator to serve out the final two years of Coburn\u2019s term. The primary is set for June 24 and could prove to be another expensive showdown between the GOP leadership and conservative insurgents.\n\nOut of the running - The announcement by Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt that he will not seek Coburn\u2019s seat would leave the right side of the primary field open to Bridenstine if he opts for a run. And with the announcement from Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who holds two key leadership posts in the House that he will not vie for the Senate seat, Lankford is unlikely to have any difficulties from party higher-ups.\n\nThe last time there was an open seat in Oklahoma\u2026 - Washington Examiner\u2019s Timothy Carney recalls how Coburn ended up in the Senate: winning as an upstart in the wake of a retirement despite the opposition of the GOP establishment. \u201cConsidering how often Coburn found himself opposing his House GOP elders, especially those on the Appropriations Committee, they were surely happy when he went back to Muskogee to deliver more babies after the 2000 election. But the heartburn returned for the Republican establishment a few years later when Coburn jumped into the race to replace retiring Republican Sen. Don Nickles. Among the handful of GOP candidates, the two clear frontrunners were Coburn and Oklahoma City Mayor Kirk Humphreys. If you wanted to see what Beltway Republicans really thought of Coburn, you could have checked out Humphreys\u2019 campaign coffers\u2026Nickles contributed to Humphreys in the primary, as did Oklahoma's junior senator, Jim Inhofe. Tom Cole was a congressional candidate that year, but he was also the political boss of the Oklahoma GOP, and his campaign contributed to Humphrey in the primary. So did GOP Rep. Wes Watkins of Oklahoma, who had served with Coburn in the House. Coburn\u2019s other Oklahoma colleague in the House, J.C. Watts, endorsed Humphreys. Meanwhile, the entire Senate leadership also backed Humphreys against Coburn. Majority Leader Bill Frist, Majority Whip Mitch McConnell and Republican Policy Committee Chair[man] Jon Kyl all poured money into Humphreys\u2019 campaign.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHRISTIE BITES THE HAND\n\nGov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., is hitting back at MSNBC for being \u201copenly hostile\u201d and \u201calmost gleeful\u201d in their attacks against him. Over the weekend the network interviewed Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer who claims Christie\u2019s lieutenant governor and a top community development official blocked Hurricane Sandy Relief funds because she would not approve a real-estate development proposal from one of Christie\u2019s backers. Christie spokesman Colin Reed has refuted the charge saying the administration has helped Hoboken secure Sandy funds and that, \u201cIt\u2019s very clear partisan politics are at play here, as Democratic mayors with a political ax to grind come out of the woodwork and try to get their faces on television.\u201d Christie was formerly a frequent guest on the liberal cable network\u2019s morning show.

So which seats are most likely to flip from blue to red? The consensus so far among Fox News First readers, (in order of times selected): Arkansas, Montana, Louisiana, South Dakota, North Carolina and West Virginia. Could the Mountain State\u2019s pro-life, moderate Sen. Joe Manchin also give some hope to the GOP? Reader Jack Lawhorn of Virginia seems to think so. Lawhorn writes, \u201cI still think, based on Dr. Krauthammer's assessment of Sen. Manchin (WV), that the Senator may well go Independent, caucusing with the GOP, or possibly cross the aisle all the way.\u201d\n\n[Ed. note: Don\u2019t count on it. Manchin has had the chance before and stood pat. Watch to see how aggressively he stumps this cycle for Democrats in House races in the state, especially his longtime adviser Nick Casey, who is running to replace Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, the leading contender to replace retiring Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.]\n\nShare your top six picks.

The subsidies for coverage are concentrated on the lowest-income households, not the middle class, and the mandate was watered down. So if ObamaCare is to succeed, it will have to do so based on its attractiveness to consumers. That should make the law\u2019s proponents very worried, indeed.\u201d\n\n\n\nObamaCare site directs callers to pottery shop - As Maryland\u2019s ObamaCare Web site continues to sputter, officials have been directing frustrated consumers to a toll-free number for help. But even that hasn\u2019t gone well. The phone number provided by the Web site directed users to call a pottery supply store in Seattle rather than a help desk. The state\u2019s Republican Senate Minority Leader David Brinkley, told the Baltimore Sun, \u201cYou can't make this stuff up, and I guess if it wasn't so serious, it could be funny.\u201d Officials say they were unaware of the problem until the newspaper contacted them. Fox News has the story.\n\nIRAN NUKE DEAL BEGINS\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear watchdog group reported Monday that Iran had halted its 20 percent uranium enrichment, which is just steps away from bomb-making capability, and begun diluting its stockpile of uranium enriched to that level. Under a six-month agreement reached by Iran, the U.S., Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China in November, confirmation from the IAEA that Iran has curbed its enrichment would clear the way for the partial suspension of U.S. and E.U. sanctions. Fox News has more.\n\nYOU HAVE A SEAT ON THE PANEL: DOUBTS ON DATA\n\nPresident Obama is ambivalent when it comes to the use of metadata harvested by the National Security Agency. That\u2019s the sentiment viewer voters across the political spectrum shared with WaPo\u2019s Chuck Lane during Friday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201dAll-star panel. As measured by Bing Pulse, Democrats agreed more strongly than Republicans and independents when Charles Krauthammer said the president\u2019s remarks on the NSA were, \u201c\u2026 90 percent smoke and mirrors and very little substantive change, which is what we need.\u201d\n\nDiscussion of progress, or lack thereof, on the Keystone Pipeline XL drew heightened viewer interaction. \u201cApart from the fact that the policy is ridiculous there are no serious arguments against it, the delay is insulting our close ally Canada.\u201d That statement from Charles Krauthammer saw a spike in viewer votes. Krauthammer\u2019s charge, \u201cWe're leaving them hanging for half a decade. It's disgraceful,\u201d drew 22,000 viewer votes per minute. Bing Pulse tracked 150,000 audience panelist votes, see the full results and take a deeper data dive here. Don\u2019t miss your opportunity to make your voice heard. Take your seat on tonight\u2019s panel.\n\nNO-SELFIES, PLEASE: FIRST LADY\u2019S BIRTHDAY BASH TOP SECRET\n\nWashington Examiner\u2019s Byron York explains why you will not be seeing any photos or social media postings from First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s Saturday birthday celebration. York writes, \u201cIt's not easy to enforce discipline on successful, wealthy, and famous people used to having their own way. But the White House apparently did not want to see photos of the First Lady's glittery gala circulating around the Internet. So it imposed a strict rule: No cell phones. \u2018Guests were told not to bring cellphones with them, and there was a cellphone check-in area for those who did,\u2019 reported the Chicago Tribune. \u2018Signs at the party told guests: No cellphones, no social media.\u2019 People magazine added: \u2018Guests had been greeted by a 'cell phone check' table where they deposited their camera phones on arrival and it was understood that this was not an occasion for Tweeting party photos or Facebooking details.\u2019 The publications cited sources who insisted on anonymity for fear of White House reprisal\u2026maybe, since the president has announced he is devoting the rest of his time in office to an \u2018inequality agenda,\u2019 the White House felt photos of a champagne-soaked, star-studded party would be somewhat off-message. But the Obamas are well-off, accomplished people. They can have a big party if they want (and if they pay for it). Why hide it?\u201d\n\nOMAHA!\n\nWhy does Peyton Manning shout the name of Nebraska\u2019s largest city every time he is about to change up the Denver Bronco\u2019s offensive scheme? Nobody knows but the Broncos and they sure aren\u2019t saying, at least not before the Super Bowl. But Omahans are making it pay for local charity. As Republican Senate candidate Shane Osborn tweeted , local businesses have pledged $800 to Manning\u2019s Peyback Foundation for at-risk kids every time the future Hall-of-Famer shouts it out. \u201cOmaha\u201d rang out 31 times in Denver on Sunday, for a total of $24,800. What will the Super Bowl be worth in \u201cOmaha\u201d shout-outs? Maybe now that Manning knows about the deal, he\u2019ll be more likely to call audibles.\n\nNEVERMORE\n\nSunday marked the 205th anniversary of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s birth, but the celebration in Baltimore was missing something, or someone. The \u201cPoe Toaster\u201d was a man (or perhaps a series of men) who, starting in 1949, would each year leave three roses and a half-drunk bottle on cognac at Poe\u2019s grave. The mysterious visitor was a highlight for the revelers who gathered at the grave, but after a fifth straight year of no-shows, Poe fans are declaring the tradition as vanished as Poe\u2019s unlucky drunkard, Fortunato. The Wire has the epitaph.\n\n[Ed. note: And here I thought the Poe Toaster was just an unreliable model from Cuisinart that left your bread soggy and smelling like absinthe.]\n\nTHIS TIME, BOB WASN\u2019T PLAYING\n\nHis career as an educator was of benefit to thousands, and for those who knew Bob, he was a marsupial for the millennium. But, alas, famous for playing dead, this time it was the real deal for Mississippi\u2019s most famous opossum. And in testament to the goodness of mankind, a Samaritan steeped in to give him a proper send off, including an open casket. WLOX has details, \u201cHis viewing was held at A Pet's Memory Funeral Home and Crematory in Gulfport Saturday afternoon. Those who\u2019ve come in contact with Bob over the years paid their respects\u2026 Many say they fondly remember hand feeding him bananas. He would also allow students to pet him.\u201d\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.
