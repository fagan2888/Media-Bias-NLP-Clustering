Rather, medical care providers must apply to a federal \u201cConsent and Capacity Board\u201d when family members oppose pulling the plug. The decision was the final appeal from family members of Hassan Rasouli, 61, who has been on life support since 2010.\n\nDoctors at Sunnybrook Health Sciences in Toronto had recommended Rasouli be taken off his ventilator given \u201cno hope of recovery,\u201d though family members say he responds to stimulation and displays some ability to communicate. Rasouli remains on several waiting lists for transfer to other facilities, including nearby West Park Healthcare Centre, with approximately 40 such beds. Though Canada offers its people a single-payer medical system that is free of most costs, as much as one-third of Canada\u2019s health care costs are paid out-of-pocket. Residents at West Park, for example, pay $1,707 per month for the stay.\n\nNow, medical experts in Canada expect the ruling to not only influence end-of-care matters but quality of care, too.\n\n\"First, the ruling will likely affect standard of medical care and practice well beyond Ontario,\u201d Robert Sibbald, an adjunct professor at Western University in London, wrote Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. \"Ontario's Consent and Capacity Board is a quasijudicial tribunal that does not benefit from expertise in critical care medicine. Yet it is now the first line of legal adjudication in the province in one of the most complex fields of medicine.\u201d\n\nSibbald also noted the new power of the federal board to establish national quality of care standards, even against professional medical opinion. \u201cThe Consent and Capacity Board, although useful in some cases, should have no role in questioning the judgement of trained, experienced physicians about whether a medical treatment is beyond the standard of care.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cdeath panel\u201d was coined in 2009 by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in opposition to federal health privacy legislation in the United States. While opposing the expansion of Medicaid and other subsidies to expand medical coverage, many conservatives say they fear the emergence of death panels in the U.S. would lead to cases of denied care, with regard specifically to end-of-life care.\n\nSource: Sibbald R, Chidwick P, Hawryluck L.
