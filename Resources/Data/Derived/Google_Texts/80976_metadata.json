The American Academy of Physicians Assistants will draw 8,000 in 2022. The American Chemical Society will draw 14,000 in 2023. And the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association will attract 13,500 in 2026.\n\nHoops Hoops\n\nCombined, those events will have a local economic impact of more than $42 million.\n\n\n\nVisit Indy CEO Leonard Hoops is confident the city\u2019s four recent victories will catch the eye of other medical/pharmaceutical meeting planners.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are currently in bid stage with 72 medical meetings for future years and in \u2018hot prospect\u2019 stage\u2014actively engaged with the customer to get the opportunity to bid\u2014with 42 medical meetings for future years,\u201d Hoops said.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s pretty amazing considering the city\u2019s past. This year, only six of Indianapolis\u2019 55 major conventions and corporate gatherings\u2014and none of its 10 biggest\u2014will fall into the health care category.\n\n\n\nOf all 338 meetings Visit Indy booked for 2015, just more than 11 percent fell into that sector. While the $32.2 million in economic impact from those events is nothing to sneeze at, Visit Indy officials are aiming much higher.\n\n\n\nThe city is far behind convention mega cities such as Orlando, which has about 40 percent of its conventions in health care, and San Diego, which counts seven of its 10 biggest conventions in the category.\n\n\n\nIndianapolis\u2019 convention history has been in the social, military, educational, religious and fraternal sectors\u2014collectively known as SMERF. In recent years, those shows\u2014whose attendees are known to be more frugal than corporate convention-goers\u2014compose about one-third of the city\u2019s convention calendar.\n\n\n\nLong, hard road\n\n\n\nThe dearth of health care conventions doesn\u2019t mean Visit Indy hasn\u2019t tried to get them. Dating back to the early 2000s, local tourism leaders pursued these big fish.\n\n\n\nWhen Leonard Hoops took over for Don Welsh in 2011, he secured funding from drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co. Inc.\u2019s foundation to bolster promotions.\n\n\n\nHoops, who served as vice president of the San Francisco Travel Association before coming to Indianapolis, had seen firsthand what medical/pharmaceutical-related conventions could mean for a city.\n\n\n\nThey bring in attendees who not only beat the national average in spending, but are also the type of people local leaders want exposed to the city.\n\n\n\n\u201cCompanies like Lilly and Roche have been clamoring for these types of events,\u201d Hoops said. \u201cIt\u2019s an essential way to promote the city and makes it easier for these companies to recruit and hire people from all over.\u201d\n\n\n\nDespite the allure, the task was a tall order for Visit Indy staffers.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome meeting planners in this sector won\u2019t even crack the door open for us,\u201d Hoops said. \u201cSome people still think we\u2019re vanilla, and they want Rocky Road.\u201d\n\n\n\nVisit Indy officials had been calling on The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association since 2001, and were never even allowed to bid on its event. Instead, that organization chose New Orleans, Chicago, San Diego, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., during that period.\n\n\n\nVisit Indy officials bid for and lost the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation\u2019s convention five times in nine years. They have been bidding for The American Academy of Physicians Assistants convention since 1997.\n\n\n\nTime after time, city tourism leaders saw these events slip away to bigger and sexier convention destinations, primarily on the East and West coasts.\n\n\n\nUndeterred, Hoops bolstered Visit Indy\u2019s presence in Washington, D.C., where many of these organizations are headquartered. Last year, he instituted a \u201c12-touch\u201d marketing program where Visit Indy sales staffers contact big targets once a month. He produced a list of high-profile groups\u2014many with medical and pharmaceutical ties\u2014that his staff was \u201cnever to give up on.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWinning these events is exciting stuff,\u201d Hoops said. \u201cTo win these, you have to fight it out with the big boys.\u201d\n\n\n\nTough competition\n\nLocklear Locklear\n\nLocal meeting planner Debbie Locklear said the competition for medical/pharmaceutical \u201cis tremendous.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThese are high-profile, high-spend events and every major convention destination in the country is after them,\u201d said Locklear, president and owner of locally based Meeting Services Unlimited Inc., which handles national trade shows locally and nationally.\n\n\n\nHoops gives a lot of credit for the recent wins to Kenneth Hemsley, who headed sales efforts for several of the medical shows, and Joyce Russell, director of Visit Indy\u2019s Washington, D.C., office.\n\n\n\nThere were other factors, too.\n\n\n\nLast year, USA Today ranked Indianapolis the nation\u2019s No. 1 convention city. Hoops said that helped \u201copen a lot of doors and conversations.\u201d The ripple effect from hosting the 2012 Super Bowl also played a part.\n\n\n\nAnother factor: The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, passed in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act, put in place strict reporting regulations for meetings attended by doctors. The mandated reporting started Aug. 1, 2013, and the result, meeting planners said, is more fiscal restraint when it comes to meetings.\n\n\n\nMeeting planners seem to agree the Sunshine Act might make Indianapolis\u2014which is known to be cheaper due to its central location, compact downtown and hotel pricing than many other major convention destinations\u2014more attractive than far-flung locales like Orlando and San Diego.\n\n\n\n\u2018Telling our story\u2019\n\nSmith Smith\n\nRegardless of why these types of meeting are coming to Indianapolis, it\u2019s good news for local medical and pharmaceutical companies, said Indiana Secretary of Commerce Victor Smith.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about telling our story,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe have a growing biomedical and pharmaceutical sector here, and I can\u2019t think of a better way to promote the region than to draw decision-makers and others in this sector to our city and state to show them.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said targeting these types of conventions plays right into the state\u2019s blueprint to grow the sector. According to the Indiana Department of Workforce Development, wages in the medical/pharmaceutical fields are about 30 percent higher than overall state wages.\n\n\n\nLori LeRoy knows firsthand how this works. She was working in the electronics industry in Atlanta when she came to Indianapolis for the Custom Electronic Design & Installation Association convention in 2001.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were thinking about relocating, and the trip here opened my and my husband\u2019s eyes to the possibility of moving here,\u201d LeRoy said.\n\n\n\nNot long after, she and her family did move here and she took a job with BioCrossroads, the life sciences business development group. She said the same experience could happen to people in the medical and pharmaceutical industries.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you come and stay for a few days, you see this city in a whole new light,\u201d LeRoy said. \u201cYou get to see the collaborative effort here, the caliber of the universities, the corporate landscape, and the overall offerings the city has. It demonstrates that this is not just a great place for a convention, but also a place to live and do business.\u201d\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "Visit Indy in the last six months has signed deals for four sizable medical/pharmaceutical-related conventions\u2014hard-earned wins for a city that for years has aimed to be a biomedical hub that attracts big players for annual gatherings.
