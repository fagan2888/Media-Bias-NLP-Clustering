Two years isn\u2019t enough, Triolo said, to finish what she and the rest of the commissioners started.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating a comprehensive master plan not just for the streets, but for everything that lies below it,\u201d Triolo said. \u201cNot only fixing the potholes, but the very reason they exist to begin with.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret Lake Worth has a massive infrastructure problem, one that won\u2019t be solved overnight, especially with so many crater-sized potholes and no real money to fix them. But the city appears to be taking baby steps to address those issues.\n\nOne of those will be on display Tuesday afternoon when the city hosts a ribbon cutting ceremony at 3 p.m. to tout the completion of the first phase of a $17 million, six-phase project to replace steel water mains that are, it seems, older than The New Testament.\n\n+ Lake Worth crews replacing a damaged water main between 13th Avenue North and 15th Avenue North. (Contributed) \u00d7\n\nFor about $50,000, two-inch water mains were replaced by city crews with four-inch water mains on North N Street between 13th Avenue North to 15th Avenue North to increase water flow from 100 gallons a minute to 600 gallons a minute, said Brian Shields, the city\u2019s water utility director.\n\nSome of the water mains are up to 60 years old and break frequently \u2014 at least once a month. \u201cThey\u2019re very shallow, so when traffic goes over them, they tend to break and cause a lot of disruption,\u201d Shields said.\n\nThe next phase, scheduled to start in about a month, will be on Lakeside Drive, south M Street and South J Street between 11th Avenue South and 18th Avenue South. That should take about a month to complete, Shields said.\n\nWhen the project is finished in six years, Shields said 22 miles of water mains will have been replaced. That\u2019s more than 300 football fields. Shields noted how the project has an added bonus.\n\n\u201cWhen we tear up the streets, we also repave the roads,\u201d Shields said. \u201cSo we\u2019re accomplishing two things at the same time.\u201d\n\nKilling two birds with one stone might just be a baby step and not nearly enough to satisfy residents tired of driving over and walking on crumbling streets and sidewalks, but at least it\u2019s a step.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first completed phase of the six-phase project will be unveiled at a ribbon cutting ceremony on Tuesday.", "author": "By Kevin D.
