What cannot be recycled will be taken to Oklahoma's Waste to Energy Landfill and turned into energy.\n\n\"We're delivering a huge one-two punch in our effort to reuse and recycle Christmas waste,\" said Kenny Burkett, founder and owner of American Waste Control.\n\n\"Any items that we just can't process through Mr. Murph is being sent to our new waste to energy processing plant at our landfill and turned in to power. It may sound funny, but some of your Styrofoam and Christmas ribbons may just help turn on someone's lights.\"\n\nRecyclables can be dropped off at over 100 Mr. Murph sites and on location at 1150 North Peoria.
