Oklahoma City police arrested a man who is accused of molesting an 8-year-old girl.

On August 21, the victim's mother reported to police that her daughter had been molested by a family friend, 75-year-old George E. Barnes. The mother said they had been staying at Barnes' home.

The victim reportedly told her therapist that Barnes had molested her several times at his home during the month of June and July of 2014.

During the therapy session, the victim said Barnes would take her to an upstairs room. He would lie down on the bed and have the victim straddle him.

The victim said Barnes would also touch her inappropriately. The therapist reported the allegations to the victim's mother and the DHS.

The mother said she spoke with her other daughter, who said she had never been molested by Barnes.

On Tuesday, September 16, Barnes was arrested and booked into the Oklahoma County Jail on three counts of indecent or lewd acts with a child under 16.
