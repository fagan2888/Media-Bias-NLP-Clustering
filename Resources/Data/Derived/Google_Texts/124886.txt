Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Wisconsin and SSM Health announced an agreement Thursday that will add Dean Clinic as well as SSM Health's hospitals in Madison, Janesville and Baraboo to Anthem's Blue Preferred and Blue Access insurance networks on Jan.1.

The SSM Health hospitals are St. Mary's Hospital in Madison, St. Mary's Janesville Hospital and St. Clare Hospital in Baraboo.

"The opportunity to serve more employer groups exclusively covered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield is a nice complement to our existing Dean Health Plan products and our integrated health system as a whole," Stew Watson, a physician and president and chief executive of Dean Clinic, said in a statement.

Blue Preferred and Blue Access have broad networks and are popular health plans with employers.

"Anthem works with local, regional and national employers and Dean was always one of the most-requested providers to add to our networks," Paul Nobile, regional vice president of sales for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Wisconsin, said in a statement.

The agreement does not include Anthem's health plans that use the Blue Priority network. Those include its health plans sold to individuals and families on the federal marketplace set up through the Affordable Care Act. The agreement also does not include Anthem's Medicare Advantage health plans or its health plan for people covered by Medicaid.
