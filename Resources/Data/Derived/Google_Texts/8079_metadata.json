It\u2019s a bit difficult to tell when Megan Fox is making fun of herself, or the entire world, and when she\u2019s just being Megan Fox. There may be no difference between those things, which has kind of been the problem with her career. Anyway, she informed us that she was a \u201csuper-fan\u201d of the Turtles as a kid, which I don\u2019t believe for a second, because it\u2019s hard to imagine Megan Fox being a super-fan of anything that isn\u2019t Megan Fox. Then she informed us that we were all going to do \u201csomething fun,\u201d and led the audience, very briefly, in a call-and-response chant: \u201cWhen I say \u2018Ninja,\u2019 you say \u2026\u201d We got it. We all said, \u201cTurtles!\u201d As she was leaving the theater, amid a phalanx of burly security guards \u2013 because she is such a huge star \u2014 someone behind me shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve reached the obvious apex of summer silliness with this \u2018roided-up CGI reboot of the TMNT franchise, which tries not to take itself at all seriously but is too big and expensive to be purely a goof. This is a baked-in problem: The Turtles emerged 30 years ago as a tongue-in-cheek parody of such popular comics as Marvel\u2019s \u201cNew Mutants\u201d and Frank Miller\u2019s \u201cRonin,\u201d and then became many times bigger than the things they were supposedly mocking. But if this wildly inconsistent $125 million action spectacle directed by Jonathan Liebesman (\u201cWrath of the Titans\u201d and \u201cBattle Los Angeles\u201d) and produced by Michael Bay will seem totally inexplicable, not to mention unimaginably ludicrous, to anyone not steeped in Ninja Turtle lore and/or \u201880s-\u201890s nostalgia, it\u2019s definitely not the summer\u2019s worst movie.\n\nYes, every moment when the ultra-buff turtles are on screen, busting each other\u2019s chops, doing human beat-box routines and ineptly pitching woo at Megan Fox (because they\u2019re, you know, teenagers) was so acutely painful that I had to draw on my own ninja training and reflect intensively on the transitory nature of all phenomena, just to fend off the profound yearning for death. Then there\u2019s Fox\u2019s inscrutable performance as ambitious TV reporter April O\u2019Neil, who figures out that a mysterious band of masked (and hard-shelled, and sewer-dwelling) vigilantes are doing battle with the dark ninjas of the Foot Clan, who long to conquer New York for nefarious purposes. Yes, the scary bad guys in this movie are called the Foot Clan. That performance is divided between the moments when Fox is trying to have a good time, the ones where she seems filled with contempt for the entire enterprise (and all too aware of the fact that, several years after her public tiff with Bay, she is now relegated to one of his second-tier projects) and the ones where she\u2019s bending over so we can check out her butt. As I suggested earlier, those moments may all be the same, qualitatively speaking.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The onetime star oozes loathing for this overblown kiddie franchise -- but it's not the worst movie of the summer!", "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The onetime star oozes loathing for this overblown kiddie franchise -- but it's not the worst movie of the summer!", "title": "\u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d: Megan Fox, trapped in a CGI goofball nightmare", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/08/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_megan_fox_trapped_in_a_cgi_goofball_nightmare/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/ninja_turtles.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The onetime star oozes loathing for this overblown kiddie franchise -- but it's not the worst movie of the summer!", "creator": "@andohehir", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/ninja_turtles.jpg", "title": "\u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d: Megan Fox, trapped in a CGI goofball nightmare", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d: Megan Fox, trapped in a CGI goofball nightmare", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Action movies, Batman, Jonathan Liebesman, Megan Fox, michael bay, Movies, Spider-Man, Summer movies, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Will arnett", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8290\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s a bit difficult to tell when Megan Fox is making fun of herself, or the entire world, and when she\u2019s just being Megan Fox.\nTopics: Action movies, Batman, Jonathan Liebesman, Megan Fox, michael bay, Movies, Spider-Man, Summer movies, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Will arnett, Entertainment NewsSo Megan Fox showed up in person at the screening of \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d I attended in Manhattan \u2013 along with her co-star Will Arnett, but who cares about him?\nAnyway, she informed us that she was a \u201csuper-fan\u201d of the Turtles as a kid, which I don\u2019t believe for a second, because it\u2019s hard to imagine Megan Fox being a super-fan of anything that isn\u2019t Megan Fox.\nThere may be no difference between those things, which has kind of been the problem with her career.\nAs I suggested earlier, those moments may all be the same, qualitatively speaking."}
