Officials are investigating a boating accident after three bodies were found by the Mid-Bay Bridge in Destin.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission began the search Friday after a female body washed up on shore by the Boggy Bayou.

The woman was identified as 18 year old Taylor Evanoff.

Investigators found a receipt in her pocket from a taxi cab driver who confirmed to authorities she had been dropped off at the Legendary Marina with two other passengers.

Around the same time Friday, a woman also called to report three missing people.

"The Legendary Marina in Destin, we believe that's where they left from, apparently on Thursday night and for some reason it looks like the vessel hit one of the pilings there near the channel," Stan Kirland, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

A search helicopter was sent into the air Friday, but heavy fog forced crews to stop the search early.

The Coast Guard, Okaloosa County Deputies, the FWC, and the Niceville Fire Department continued searching Saturday morning.

Saturday's search led to a recovery of a second body identified as 47-year old Robert Williams before noon.

Officials say just before sunset they found what they believe to be the third body.

Authorities expect it will be identified early Sunday morning.
