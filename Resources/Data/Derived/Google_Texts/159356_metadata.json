Ted Cruz has told a conservative conference that President Barack Obama is lawless, providing the right wing rhetoric that makes him so popular in his home state.\n\nThe conservative Republican laid out his reasoning for why he thinks the president is \u201cdangerous and terrifying.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Statesman, Cruz also slammed Obama for what he referred to as a pattern of \u201clawlessness on a breathtaking scale.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a nation of laws and not men,\u201d Cruz was additionally quoted as saying by the website. \u201cIf we had a system where a president can pick and choose what laws to follow at utter whim \u2026 that is seriously dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe public policy conference at which he spoke was sponsored by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. Minutes before his address, the organization posted a photograph of Cruz on their official Facebook page.\n\nHis address comes just one day after he released a statement on his official website that took aim at Obama\u2019s \u201cpromise zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s altogether fitting that President Obama is \u2026 talking about income inequality because income inequality has increased dramatically as a direct result of his economic policies,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cUnfortunately, rather than stop Washington\u2019s job-killing policies, President Obama proposes yet more government spending and debt.\u201d\n\nIt concludes, \u201cAll of America needs to be a real \u2018Promise Zone\u2019 \u2013 with reduced barriers to small businesses creating private-sector jobs \u2013 and we should start by repealing every word of Obamacare, building the Keystone pipeline, abolishing the IRS, and rolling back abusive regulations.\u201d\n\nCruz has garnered national attention by frequently condemning the Obama administration and the federal health care overhaul. In addition to calling for a complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he said he would replace it with a conservative alternative that would expand health care coverage.\n\nCruz also criticized Obama for not enforcing drug laws in states that have legalized use of marijuana.\n\nPhillip Martin, deputy director of the liberal Progress Texas group, said Cruz\u2019s positions have damaged the nation, particularly when he led Republican efforts to shut down the U.S. government if Obama did not repeal his health care program.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz\u2019s temper tantrums cost taxpayers billions of dollars and did nothing for the 6 million Texans without health insurance,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz is often mentioned as a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
