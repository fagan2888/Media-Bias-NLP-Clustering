Chris Christie, John Kasich and Rick Perry are fighting for the last two spots on the debate stage — and after a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll Sunday morning, Perry is still most in danger of failing to qualify.

The three candidates are all at 3 percent in the new poll. But according to a Campaign Pro analysis of the five most recent live-caller surveys, Christie and Kasich are tied for ninth place, at 3.2 percent. Perry is outside of the top 10, in 11th place, at 2.6 percent.

The new poll continues to show Donald Trump leading the field. Trump is at 19 percent, followed by Scott Walker at 15 percent. Jeb Bush (14 percent) and Ben Carson (10 percent) are the other two candidates who earn double-digit support.

Walker has nudged in front of Bush in the average of the five most recent polls, putting him in second place behind Trump. In fourth place, both in the new poll and the average, is Ben Carson.
