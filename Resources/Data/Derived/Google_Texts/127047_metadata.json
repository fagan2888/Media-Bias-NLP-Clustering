Grief can be exhausting. Eating nutritious foods, getting enough sleep and exercising are natural stress relievers.\n\n\u2022 Accept that you may not be able to accomplish the same things you have in years past. For example, preparing a large meal, shopping and decorating may feel overwhelming. Ask yourself, \"Is this something I can reach out to someone else to handle?\"\n\n\u2022 Be flexible and open to new ways of celebrating the season. Going out to dinner when you typically eat at home, or having a gathering at a new location, can help create new traditions and relieve the anxiety of thinking about how you will manage to get through the \"way things always were.\" Let people know you would like to be flexible with the time you arrive and when you leave, as you will not know until then how you will feel.\n\n\u2022 The emotions that accompany loss can be consuming and draining. Consider limiting some of your commitments and shopping early or online to avoid crowds.\n\n\u2022 Give yourself permission to grieve. Many times the season pressures us into the cultural expectation that we should only feel joy or happiness during the holidays. Recognize that this is unrealistic and it is acceptable to feel and express sadness and pain over your loss. It is OK not to be in the holiday spirit.\n\n\u2022 Prepare for emotional moments. It is normal to have difficult, intense and unpredictable emotions despite preparing yourself. Surround yourself with people who allow you to express these feelings and offer support.\n\n\u2022 When you find yourself saying, \"I'd rather skip the holidays,\" keep in mind the importance of not isolating yourself. Negative self-talk can take over. It's important to establish a healthy balance of privacy, to allow yourself to reflect and grieve, but you also need to interact with people who can distract you from the intense pain you are experiencing.\n\n\u2022 Don't forget to cherish the memories. Finding gratitude in the life you shared with your loved one is important to healing. Memories bring strong emotions. Over time, as you heal, these thoughts become precious and may bring joy for the life you shared.\n\nBarnabas Health Hospice offers a variety of bereavement programs to help individuals cope with loss. For information, call 973-322-4817 (North Jersey and Monmouth County) or 732-818-6826 (Ocean County).\n\nPigott promoted to director of nursing\n\nSAGE Eldercare in Summit has promoted Darriea Pigott, of West Orange to director of nursing for HomeCare services.\n\nPigott joined SAGE in September 2010 as a Field Nursing Supervisor for the department and was recently promoted to lead the department.\n\n\"Darriea has taken on increasing levels of responsibility during her four years with SAGE's HomeCare Department. Her leadership and clinical skills will ensure that our clients continue to receive personalized and compassionate care,\" said Angela Sullivan, interim executive director of SAGE, in a prepared statement. \"In addition, given Darriea's caring nature, she will make sure that the HomeCare staff and the Certified Home Health Aides that care for our clients meet the highest level in industry standards in home care.\"\n\nHomeCare is SAGE's founding service, both of which were instituted in 1954. The service has evolved from homemaking to certified aides who provide personal services. SAGE's HomeCare has been \"Accredited with Distinction\" by the Commission on Accreditation for Home Care (CAHC) for three consecutive years.\n\nPersonal care services include bathing, grocery shopping, meal planning and preparation, toileting, transfers and ambulation, assistance with therapeutic or exercise regimes, laundry and changing bed linens, light housekeeping, and respite care. SAGE's 60 Certified Home Care Aides are employed through the organization and care for more than 100 clients on an hourly or live-in basis in towns within a 20-mile distance from Summit.\n\nAs HomeCare Director, Pigott is responsible for the coordination and management of all operations in the delivery of HomeCare services, including goal setting, policies and procedures, and quality assurance and compliance standards. In addition, she is also responsible for the annual budget of the department, recruitment and hiring of office staff, recruiting and training of the Certified Home Health Aides, and maintaining a high standard of care for clients by assessing, overseeing, and evaluating the field supervisors and aides on a regular basis.\n\nSAGE Eldercare is at 290 Broad St.\n\nFor more information, call 908-273-5550 or visit www.sageeldercare.org.\n\nCheck presented to foundation\n\nPSE&G recently presented a $4,000 check to RWJ Rahway Foundation for the Mobile ICU Radio Replacement Project.\n\n\"These new radios will meet the new FCC guidelines and help the Hospital's first responders meet the needs of our patients and the community,\" Marlene H. Lubinger, president, RWJ Rahway Foundation, said in a prepared statement.\n\nA supporter of the hospital for many years, PSEG has contributed to the hospital's Emergency and First Floor Renovation Projects and cardiac telemetry.\n\nIf you would like to make a donation to RWJ Rahway Foundation, or for information on how to leave a legacy of good health care to the community, call the Foundation Office at 732-499-6135 or email foundation@rwjuhr.com.\n\nHealth centers receive funding\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell recently announced $510,008 in Affordable Care Act funding to 15 health centers in New Jersey to recognize health center quality improvement achievements and invest in ongoing quality improvement activities.\n\nNew Jersey health centers that received awards are proven leaders in areas such as chronic disease management, preventive care and the use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to report quality data.\n\n\"This funding rewards New Jersey health centers that have a proven track record in clinical quality improvement, which translates to better patient care, and it allows them to expand and improve their systems and infrastructure to bring the highest quality primary care services to the communities they serve,\" said Secretary Burwell, in a prepared statement. \"With these funds, health centers in New Jersey will continue to provide access to high quality, comprehensive primary and preventive health care to the patients that need it the most.\"\n\nNew Jersey Health centers receiving these funds are being recognized for high levels of quality performance in one or more of the following categories.\n\n\u2022 Health center quality leaders received awards if they were among the top 30 percent of all health centers that achieved the best overall clinical outcomes, demonstrating their ability to focus on quality in all aspects of their clinical operations; four New Jersey health centers received funding in this category for approximately $171,706.\n\n\u2022 National quality leaders received awards for exceeding national clinical benchmarks (Healthy People 2020 objectives and health center national averages) for chronic disease management, preventive care, and perinatal/prenatal care, demonstrating the critical role that health centers play in promoting higher quality health care nationwide; one New Jersey health center received funding in this category for approximately $35,239.\n\n\u2022 Clinical quality improvers received awards if they demonstrated at least a 10 percent improvement in clinical quality measures between 2012 and 2013, showing a significant improvement in the health of the patients they serve; 15 New Jersey health centers received funding in this category for approximately $273,061.\n\nElectronic Health Record reporters received funding if they used EHRs to report clinical quality measure data on all of their patients, a key transformational step in driving quality improvement for all health center patients across the nation; two New Jersey health centers received funding in this category for approximately $30,000.\n\n\"These funds reward and support those health centers that have taken steps to achieve the highest levels of clinical quality performance and improvement,\" Health and Resources Administration (HRSA) Administrator Mary K. Wakefield said.\n\nIn New Jersey, 20 HRSA-supported health centers operate more than 130 service delivery sites that provide care to nearly 483,113 patients. Nationally, nearly 1,300 HRSA-supported health centers operate more than 9,200 service delivery sites that provide care to nearly 22 million patients in every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Basin.\n\nFor a list of Fiscal Year 2015 Quality Improvement Awards recipients, visit www.hrsa.gov/about/news/2014tables/qualityimprovement/.\n\nTo learn more about the Affordable Care Act and Community Health Centers, visit http://bphc.hrsa.gov/about/healthcenterfactsheet.pdf.\n\nTo learn more about HRSA's Community Health Center Program, visit http://bphc.hrsa.gov/about/index.html.\n\nTo find a health center in your area, visit http://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov.\n\nLearn about the Health Insurance Marketplace\n\nHave your questions about the Health Insurance Marketplace answered by the experts from the Community Health Law Project.\n\nThe program will be held at 10 a.m. Dec. 18 at the Woodbridge Main Library.

The luncheon will be held May 14 at the Imperia in the Somerset section of Franklin. The luncheon is a cornerstone piece of the American Heart Association Go Red For Women movement, which is a national initiative committed to improving cardiovascular health among women. Nationally sponsored by Macy's, Go Red For Women believes that every woman has a reason to live a healthier, longer life and empowers women \u2014 and men \u2014 to take charge of their heart health.\n\nAlthough more women than men die every year from heart disease and stroke, research shows that 80 percent of cardiac events can be prevented with healthy lifestyle choices. That's why the American Heart Association urges women to make changes to live a healthier, longer life.

The goal of this program is to prematurely identify patients who may be at risk for infection related problems, triage them to the appropriate level of care, and treat as many as possible at Bridgeway to not interrupt recovery.\n\n\"As many as 50 percent of patients readmitted from a Skilled Nursing Facility are readmitted with an infection. By utilizing Identify \u2014 Triage \u2014 Treat we hope to reduce the number by 50 percent or more,\" Nahass said in a prepared statement. Furthermore, by taking proactive action, they hope to prevent many of the infections from occurring, especially Clostridium difficile, a particularly problematic health-care infection.\n\nAll admissions from acute care will be eligible for this program. Bridgeway will continue their collaboration with INTERACT to measure results and compare them on a national level. Several metrics will be followed during this process including overall readmission rates, vacancy rates of the facility, diagnoses treated, and outcomes.\n\nAdditional training for staff will be completed through Dr. David Barille, the founder of the POLST program in New Jersey, in order to make sure the goals of care are well defined. Kathleen Seneca will work with Bridgeway's front line clinical staff to educate and in-service them on the trigger symptoms and signs, the process of care, and the importance of contacting her or Nahass for guidance on managing possible infection.\n\nThe team leading the program is made up of leaders regionally and nationally recognized in healthcare delivery reform efforts. Nahass has been a leader in clinical infectious disease for more than 25 years and is the recipient of numerous awards and recognitions for his work. He is a national speaker on the impact of healthcare delivery and payment reform on the treatment of infectious diseases and has authored a number of papers and studies in this area.\n\nSeneca has been the program director for care transitions and readmission of the University Medical Center at Princeton Plainsboro for the past four years. She is a trained infectious disease nurse practitioner that now brings both skill sets to this new role.\n\nBridgeway Senior Healthcare is a family-owned and operated company with more than 33 years of experience providing a customized continuum of care at Bridgeway Care and Rehabilitation Centers at Bridgewater and at Hillsborough as well as Avalon Assisted Living at Bridgewater and at Hillsborough.\n\nFor more information about Bridgeway Senior Healthcare, visit www.BridgewaySeniorCare.com.\n\nWelshinger, Worley join network\n\nTwo leading experts in the treatment of female reproductive cancers have joined the network of Saint Peter's Physician Associates.\n\nDr. Marie Welshinger and Dr. Michael Worley Jr. care for patients on Easton Avenue, down the road from Saint Peter's University Hospital in New Brunswick. A former clinical and research fellow at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, and formerly chief of gynecologic oncology at New York Hospital, Queens, Welshinger is board certified in obstetrics and gynecology and gynecologic oncology. Worley completed a fellowship at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Massachusetts. Widely published in his field, he has lectured at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\"Dr. Marie Welshinger and Dr. Michael Worley are important additions to Saint Peters Physician Associates,\" Dr. Anthony Passannante Jr., chief medical officer, Saint Peter's Healthcare System, and president, Saint Peter's Physician Associates, said in a prepared statement. \"Not only do they allow us to continue to provide high-quality surgical oncology services to our GYN patients, they enable us to expand those services to include robotically and minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. They are a welcome addition to our growing multispecialty enterprise.\"\n\nWorley and Welshinger are part of the women's health team that practices at 78 Easton Ave., one of the more than 20 locations in the community where Saint Peter's Physician Associates care for patients. Dr. Thomas Magliaro provides specialized gynecologic care, including screening for pre-cancerous gynecological conditions and surgery for benign gynecologic conditions, at the same practice.\n\nGynecologic cancers affect a woman's reproductive organs \u2014 the cervix, fallopian tubes, uterus, ovaries, vagina, and vulva. The following cancers are treated by both doctors: ovarian, cervical, uterine, vaginal and vulvar.\n\nLike other gynecologic oncologists, Welshinger and Worley first trained as obstetricians and gynecologists, and later trained several more years in the diagnosis and treatment of female reproductive cancers. In addition to performing surgery on the reproductive organs, they are trained to perform surgery on the other organs of the pelvis and abdominal area that can be affected by diseases such as ovarian cancer.\n\nWelshinger and Worley perform many of their procedures using minimally invasive techniques, a more common surgical option today than traditional surgery, which calls for large incisions. Both use the da Vinci Si Surgical System, which is available at Saint Peter's. The da Vinci technology makes it possible for surgeons to perform complex and delicate robotically assisted procedures through small incisions \u2014 1 to 2 centimeters in size. Surgeons control the robot's extensions, which function as surgical arms, from a control station.\n\nFor the patient, benefits of robotically assisted surgery may include significantly less pain, less blood loss, less scarring, shorter recovery time, and a faster return to normal daily activities.\n\nWelshinger and Worley are seeing patients at 78 Easton Ave., New Brunswick. They can be reached at 732-828-3300. Visit SPPhysicianAssociates.com for a listing of other doctors who are part of Saint Peter's Physician Associates.

Dry indoor air causes myriad problems, including:\n\n\u2022 Increased likelihood of colds, flu and upper respiratory ailments. Viruses that cause colds and flu thrive in low humidity, so dry indoor air can spread airborne viruses more easily than air that is properly humidified. The American Society of Otolaryngology says dry air can make people more susceptible to infection. Dry air also aggravates allergy and asthma symptoms.\n\n\u2022 Damage to home furnishings. Dry air causes walls, woodwork and hardwood floors to crack, which can lead to costly repairs or replacement.\n\n\u2022 Higher energy costs. Air that is not properly humidified causes people to feel colder at higher temperatures. This leads homeowners to turn up the thermostat, increasing energy bills.\n\nDry air is also responsible for a number of the comfort issues that people experience in the winter. Air in the house that is below 35 percent RH can cause nosebleeds, sore throats and dry, itchy skin. To reduce damage to the home and improve health and comfort, homeowners must improve the RH of their indoor air.\n\n\"The best way to control the humidity levels in your home is with a whole-home humidifier,\" Smits said in a prepared statement.\n\nA whole-home humidifier installed as part of a heating and cooling system is designed to deliver the perfect amount of moisture to a home without constant adjustments. With a whole-home system there is no need to refill the unit with water. It will also accurately measure the outdoor temperature and indoor humidity levels to automatically provide the ideal amount of indoor relative humidity.\n\n\"Humidity is also dispersed throughout the house, instead of in just one room,\" said Smits.\n\nFor more information on whole-home humidification and total control of your indoor air quality, call C&D Cooling & Heating at 908-647-1696 or visit www.aprilaire.com. Also, find Aprilaire on Facebook at www.facebook.com/aprilaire.\n\nChoose an active lifestyle\n\nNearly seven in 10 adults and one in three children and teens are overweight or obese.\n\nObesity not only has physical effects on Americans, including increasing risk for heart disease and stroke \u2014 the No. 1 and No. 4 killers in the U.S. but also costs American companies nearly $226 billion in health-related productivity costs.\n\nHowever, people can choose an active lifestyle and improve physical and mental health with just a half hour a day. An active lifestyle has proven health benefits, including improving blood circulation, managing stress, preventing bone loss, boosting energy levels, releasing tension and countering anxiety and depression.\n\nThe American Heart Association and American Stroke Association recommend at least 30 minutes of physical activity five days a week for adults and at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day for children and teens. Physical activity is anything that gets your body moving and burns calories. Break up the time into smaller increments that fit into your daily routine and you can be well on your way to a heart-healthy lifestyle.\n\n\"The idea is that physical activity doesn't have to feel like exercise,\" Scott Evans, an American Heart Association volunteer and program manager of the health and wellness department at Johnson & Johnson Information Technology in Raritan Borough, said in a prepared statement. \"Teaching yourself and your family to include small bursts of activity into your daily routine will make it more likely to stick.\"\n\nHere are some tips for getting in your daily physical activity:\n\n\u2022 Take the stairs;\n\n\u2022 Park at the far end of the parking lot and walk to the building;\n\n\u2022 Walk during your lunch or afternoon break;\n\n\u2022 If you live close to the office, bike there twice a week;\n\n\u2022 Skip dessert and take a walk as a family;\n\n\u2022 Play hide-and-seek with the kids;\n\n\u2022 Set your alarm 15 minutes early and walk the dog before work;\n\n\u2022 Schedule active meetings \u2014 brainstorm while walking around the building;\n\n\u2022 Turn on some music and have a dance party with the kids.\n\n\"Remember, healthy habits start at home,\" Evans said. \"Incorporating more steps into your daily routine may lead to a heart-healthy life.\"\n\nFor more tips on making physical activity part of your daily routine, visit www.heart.org/PhysicalActivity.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1AAS74o", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Health news from Bridgewater, Hillsborough, Linden, Long Hill, Montgomery, New Brunswick, Rahway, Summit, Woodbridge and around Central Jersey.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Health news from Bridgewater, Hillsborough, Linden, Long Hill, Montgomery, New Brunswick, Rahway, Summit, Woodbridge and around Central Jersey.", "title": "Heartbeats: Managing the holidays after family trauma", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/life/wellness/2014/12/16/heartbeats-managing-holidays-family-trauma/20300479/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health news from Bridgewater, Hillsborough, Linden, Long Hill, Montgomery, New Brunswick, Rahway, Summit, Woodbridge and around Central Jersey.", "title": "Heartbeats: Managing the holidays after family trauma", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e19b993660d15c0e8d55516e509c1928d0ba951/c=0-112-1195-1307&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2014/12/12/B9315369649Z.1_20141212111833_000_GUG9AI86K.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "health, Bridgewater, Hillsborough, Linden, Long Hill, Montgomery, New Brunswick, Rahway, Summit, Woodbridge, Central Jersey"}, "article_summary": "For more information on whole-home humidification and total control of your indoor air quality, call C&D Cooling & Heating at 908-647-1696 or visit www.aprilaire.com.\nBarnabas Health Home Care and Hospice offers these suggestions for managing the holiday season:\u2022 Take care of yourself.\nNew Jersey Health centers receiving these funds are being recognized for high levels of quality performance in one or more of the following categories.\nTo learn more about HRSA's Community Health Center Program, visit http://bphc.hrsa.gov/about/index.html.\nTo find a health center in your area, visit http://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov."}
