Form 1095-A coverage notice gitches could be affecting filing volume.

A second giant tax preparer, H&R Block Inc. (NYSE:HRB), has talked about seeing fewer consumers with Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) tax concerns in the past few weeks than it expected.

Individual income tax filings for 2014 are due April 15. As of the end of February, H&R Block U.S. tax season filing volume was down 4.2 percent from the volume number the company posted a year earlier.
