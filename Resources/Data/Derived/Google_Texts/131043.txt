At least three people were injured in a head-on collision on Route 9 in Marlboro early Saturday morning, according to Marlboro police.

Two passengers were taken to Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune City and one was taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, although none of the injuries were “severe or life-threatening,” Marlboro Police Captain Fred Reck said.

One passenger was ejected from the vehicle, Reck said.

“They were taken to those hospitals because of the mechanism of the injuries,” Reck said. “It was more precautionary.”

About 3:30 a.m., a vehicle traveling on the wrong side of Route 9 hit another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction, Reck said. It’s unclear which vehicle was on the wrong side of the road, but the accident happened on Route 9 northbound near its intersection with Bartram Road, Reck said.

One of the vehicles ended up overturned on the southbound side of Route 9, Reck said. There were injured passengers from both vehicles.

The accident is under investigation.
