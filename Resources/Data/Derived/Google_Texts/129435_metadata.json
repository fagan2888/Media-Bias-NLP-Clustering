His answer, referring to the Avalanche\u2019s success dating back to the first of December, assumed that the \u201cyou\u201d meant the Avalanche, not him.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re playing pretty good right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want that to keep going.\u201d\n\nYes, the Avalanche is 17-7-2 in that stretch.\n\nBut he was told the question actually was intended to be about the quiet Swede who led Colorado in scoring during December, has continued to play well (if unflashily) and had just scored his 10th goal of the season \u2014 and his first short-handed \u2014 as the Avalanche beat Dallas and ran its winning streak to four.\n\n\u201cOh, me,\u201d Soderberg responded. \u201cAw, I\u2019m playing pretty good. I play my game. I find my game.\u201d\n\nSoderberg has been centering Blake Comeau and Gabe Landeskog, who also had a shorthanded goal against the Stars. That came with Soderberg serving the second two minutes of the double-minor he drew for inadvertently high-sticking the Stars\u2019 Jason Demers as Demers got the Stars\u2019 only goal.\n\nWith 10 goals and 34 points, he now is third on the Avalanche in scoring, behind Matt Duchene (40) and Nathan MacKinnon (39), and just ahead of Landeskog (33).\n\nDuring Soderberg\u2019s slow start \u2014 at least statistically \u2014 it wasn\u2019t out of line to wonder if the Avalanche had overrated him when it acquired his rights from Boston just before he could have become an unrestricted free agent and signed him to a five-year, $23.75 million deal.\n\nIt was a pre-emptive strike, anticipating an imminent trade of Ryan O\u2019Reilly, who ended up going to Buffalo and signing a seven-year, $52.5 million extension. The year before, the Avalanche had lost Paul Stastny as an unrestricted free agent, and the acquisition and signing of Soderberg summoned comparisons of the three as heady forwards whose contributions went beyond numbers.\n\nColorado\u2019s 80.4 percent penalty-killing now is 19th in the league, and Soderberg does significant work there.\n\nFootnotes. The Avalanche returned to Denver after the game Saturday night, had Sunday completely off and is expected to practice Monday morning before leaving for San Jose. Colorado\u2019s final two games before the all-star break are Tuesday against the Sharks and Wednesday at Los Angeles. \u2026 Forward Jack Skille, who slid and slammed into the end boards, suffering a back injury in the first period against the Stars and didn\u2019t return, was walking around afterward and didn\u2019t appear to be seriously hurt.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Carl Soderberg playing a starring role on Avs", "title": "Carl Soderberg playing a starring role on Avs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/24/carl-soderberg-playing-a-starring-role-on-avs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160124__BN20160125_Z00_BNSP25HKNAVSp1.jpg", "height": 437}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160124__BN20160125_Z00_BNSP25HKNAVSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-24T20:06:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:10:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think we\u2019re playing pretty good right now,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAw, I\u2019m playing pretty good.\nThe question to Carl Soderberg on Saturday night in Dallas began with the observation that \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d on a roll.\nI find my game.\u201dSoderberg has been centering Blake Comeau and Gabe Landeskog, who also had a shorthanded goal against the Stars.\nHis answer, referring to the Avalanche\u2019s success dating back to the first of December, assumed that the \u201cyou\u201d meant the Avalanche, not him."}
