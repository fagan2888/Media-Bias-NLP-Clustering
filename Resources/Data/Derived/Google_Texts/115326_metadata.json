Obama, however, appeared to double down on his strategy \u2014 stating in a Rose Garden speech on Tuesday that he intended to expand, not reduce, his use of unilateral actions to circumvent Congress.\n\nSumming up his position, the President threw down the gauntlet at Congress: \u201cSo sue me.\u201d\n\nThe moment was reminiscent of George W. Bush\u2019s taunting Iraqi insurgents over 10 years ago by saying, \u201cBring \u2019em on.\u201d\n\nIt was irresponsible bravado from a man who was not himself at the receiving end of IEDs and constant attacks that would go on to cost us thousands of military personnel. I imagine some lawyers at the Justice Department may feel the same way about Obama\u2019s \u201csue me\u201d taunt. They are the ones being hammered in federal courts over sweeping new interpretations and unilateral executive actions.\n\nThe renewed promise to go it alone is a familiar refrain from this President. He even pledged to take unilateral action to circumvent Congress in front of both Houses, in his State of the Union address this year \u2014 to the curious delight of half of Congress, which applauded wildly at the notion of being made irrelevant.\n\nThe President was as good as his word. When Congress failed to pass the Dream Act loosening immigration laws for certain groups, the President ordered the same result unilaterally. His administration also ordered massive changes in Obamacare \u2014 from lifting statutory deadlines, to exempting classes of business, to shifting hundreds of millions of dollars from appropriated purposes to other uses.\n\nThe political slogan of \u201cno compromise\u201d has migrated into legal strategy with disastrous results. That is precisely what happened in the recess appointments decision in NLRB vs. Canning. I testified on the President\u2019s recess appointments in Congress after they were made and said that the nominations in my view were flagrantly unconstitutional.\n\nThe fact that the administration decided to force a confrontation on such a weak case shows not just a lack of judgment but a cavalier attitude towards the costs of such losses. While he clearly has authority to set enforcement priorities in areas like immigration law, Obama has repeatedly stepped well over the line of separation.\n\nThese acts of defiance of Congress often come with chest-pounding acclaim, but they also come with costs. For example, by violating the Constitution on recess appointments, a huge array of rulings out of the National Labor Relations Board could be invalid \u2014 creating havoc in the area.\n\nLikewise, the President\u2019s recent loss in the Hobby Lobby case, regarding contraception provisions of Obamacare, will require huge changes in such coverage . In a case that may be issued any day now in Halbig vs. Burwell, the D.C. Circuit could strike down another unilateral policy on tax credits under Obamacare that would mean that the administration wrongly committed billions of dollars without authority. That decision could jeopardize the very viability of health-care reform.\n\nIn our system, there is no license to go it alone. Rather, the Republic\u2019s democratic architecture requires compromise. The process is designed to moderate legislation and create a broader consensus in support of these laws.\n\nNor is congressional refusal to act on a particular prescription of how to fix the economy or repair immigration laws an excuse. Sometimes the country (and by extension Congress) is divided.\n\nWhen that happens, less gets done. The Framers understood such times. They lived in such a time.\n\nWhile Obama did not create the uber-presidency, he has pushed it to a new level of autonomy and authority. It is a model that Democrats may soon regret. Just as Obama has unilaterally rewritten federal laws and ordered the nonenforcement of others, the next President could use the same authority to gut environmental or employment discrimination laws. An uber-President is only liberating when he is your uber-President.\n\nAnd whether it is \u201csue me\u201d or \u201cbring it on,\u201d presidential taunts tend to play better politically than practically. The invitation for a congressional lawsuit may sound on its face like it\u2019s welcoming judicial review, but it\u2019s not. Obama\u2019s administration has fought to block such review by challenging the right of members and citizens to be heard in federal courts.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s taunt will no doubt be answered in kind. Indeed, the House is preparing just such a lawsuit. And so, our national politics have finally descended to the politics of the schoolyard playground. However, unlike on the playground, presidential taunts have constitutional consequences.\n\nTurley is a law professor at George Washington University.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jonathan Turley", "twitter": {"description": "Turley: The unanimous decision of the Supreme Court late last month that President Obama violated the separation of powers in appointing officials is the type of decision that usually concentrates the mind of a chief executive.", "title": "Obama\u2019s irresponsible taunt", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/obama-irresponsible-taunt-article-1.1854252", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1854251.1404424527!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-immigration.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Jonathan Turley", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-06T08:30:34", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/obama-irresponsible-taunt-article-1.1854252", "parsely-title": "Obama\u2019s irresponsible taunt", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-06T04:30:34-0400", "sailthru.title": "Obama\u2019s irresponsible taunt", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1854251.1404424527!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-immigration.jpg", "description": "Turley: The unanimous decision of the Supreme Court late last month that President Obama violated the separation of powers in appointing officials is the type of decision that usually concentrates the mind of a chief executive.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Turley: The unanimous decision of the Supreme Court late last month that President Obama violated the separation of powers in appointing officials is the type of decision that usually concentrates the mind of a chief executive.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Turley: The unanimous decision of the Supreme Court late last month that President Obama violated the separation of powers in appointing officials is the type of decision that usually concentrates the mind of a chief executive.", "title": "Obama\u2019s irresponsible taunt", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/obama-irresponsible-taunt-article-1.1854252", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1854251.1404424527!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-immigration.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Jonathan Turley", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1854251.1404424527!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-immigration.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3189\"", "article_summary": "I imagine some lawyers at the Justice Department may feel the same way about Obama\u2019s \u201csue me\u201d taunt.\nPresident Obama\u2019s taunt will no doubt be answered in kind.\nObama\u2019s administration has fought to block such review by challenging the right of members and citizens to be heard in federal courts.\nWhen Congress failed to pass the Dream Act loosening immigration laws for certain groups, the President ordered the same result unilaterally.\nThat is precisely what happened in the recess appointments decision in NLRB vs. Canning."}
