Ward (ankle) and cornerback Chris Harris (shoulder) in street clothes on the sideline Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably the biggest concern getting into next week,\u201d Kubiak said of Stewart. \u201cBut I think you\u2019ll see him Wednesday. I\u2019d love to see that secondary back in tact for the first time and healthy.\u201d\n\nDanny Trevathan, Brandon Marshall win Ed Block awards\n\nInside linebackers Danny Trevathan and Brandon Marshall were selected by their teammates as the Broncos\u2019 2015 Ed Block Courage Award winners for their \u201ccommitment to sportsmanship and courage.\u201d\n\nThe two overcame significant injuries that required surgery to return this season as the team\u2019s No. 1 and No. 2 leading tacklers, respectively. Trevathan (110 tackles) missed significant time last season and underwent reconstructive knee surgery. Marshall (101 tackles) had two screws placed in his right foot to repair a Lisfranc injury.\n\n\u201cWe pushed each other,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe pushed each other a lot because I would see him, how he was doing, and if he was ahead of me I felt like in his progression, I would try to exceed that. I think he did the same thing.\u201d\n\nVon Miller\u2019s high praise for Wade Phillips\n\nVon Miller, the Broncos\u2019 outside linebacker, earned the second first-team all-pro honor of his career after leading the team in both sacks (11) and quarterback hits (32) in the regular season.\n\nWade Phillips, who returned to the Broncos as their defensive coordinator this season, installed his 3-4 defense and quickly won the trust and support of his players.\n\n\u201cCoach Phillips \u2014 instrumental in my success this year,\u201d Miller said. \u201cEvery day, he came in, he coached me like \u2014 it\u2019s kind of hard to explain. He didn\u2019t coach me like he had been with me through four years. He coached me how I needed to be coached. He pushed me every single day and got it out of me this year. \u201c\n\nFor Danny Trevathan, Super Bowl rings before contract\n\nTrevathan will be an unrestricted free agent in March but said he\u2019s not focused on his next contract.\n\n\u201cContract, all this and that \u2014 I\u2019m not really too focused on that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll take care of itself. I came from nothing, so it\u2019s nothing for me to wait a couple more months and get this big ring for us.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala\n\nNFL news from The Associated Press:\n\nBob Quinn agrees to be Detroit Lions\u2019 general manager\n\nDETROIT \u2014 The Lions agreed to a deal in principle with Bob Quinn to be their general manager, hoping to replicate some of the Patriots\u2019 success.\n\nLions president Rod Wood confirmed the agreement late Friday night.\n\nQuinn had been the Patriots\u2019 director of pro scouting for four seasons after serving as assistant director of pro personnel for two years.
