But the inspector general said it\u2019s concerned that \u201cCBRE may not negotiate property sales and lease transactions in the Postal Service\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Before the Postal Service and CBRE teamed up, the inspector general said, potential landlords used to negotiate directly with the agency.\n\nBut now, the watchdog says it has heard complaints from building owners about CBRE demanding commission payments. In all, CBRE collected roughly $20.6 million in commissions on roughly 3,400 leases.\n\nOn top of that, the inspector general said that it believes the Postal Service \u2013 which lost some $5 billion in the most recent fiscal year \u2013 could be overpaying by about $9.5 million a year on rent due to leases negotiated by CBRE. Those overpayments, the inspector general said, went toward commissions for CBRE.\n\nFor those reasons and more, the inspector general said the Postal Service should get rid of CBRE and allow other companies to bid to be the agency\u2019s broker.\n\nBut in separate statements, both USPS and CBRE shot back that the inspector general\u2019s report missed the mark, suggesting the watchdog didn\u2019t really understand how commercial real estate worked.\n\n\u201cThe Postal Service believes strongly that it uses the industry standard method for broker compensation and that terminating the contract at this time is ill-advised,\u201d said Sue Brennan, a spokeswoman for the agency.\n\nThe agency said it would start a review taking a look at the current commission process, to ensure that the payments given to CBRE are normal procedure.\n\nA spokesman for CBRE added that landlords paying real estate brokers commission when the broker represents a tenant is merely standard practice.\n\nCBRE added that it had gotten an extra $62 million in value for USPS through the sale of surplus real estate, and gotten thousands of lease renewals completed for the agency at no extra cost.\n\n\u201cReforming and updating the USPS is a complex undertaking involving the competing objectives of a variety of special interest groups, few of whom have expertise in real estate practices and standards,\u201d the CBRE spokesman said.\n\nBut the American Postal Workers Union, the largest representative of USPS workers, dubbed the inspector general\u2019s report \u201ca stinging indictment\u201d of how the Postal Service does business.\n\nMark Dimondstein, the union\u2019s president, said the report was a reminder that APWU and other interested parties shouldn\u2019t let USPS sell off at times historic real estate, and should join the call for the agency to fire CBRE.\n\n\u201cThis report shows we need to protect the USPS from corporate pirates who would plunder it,\u201d Dimondstein said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "USPS\u2019s inspector general said the agency\u2019s set-up with CBRE sparks \u201cconflicts of interest.\u201d", "description": "USPS\u2019s inspector general said the agency\u2019s set-up with CBRE sparks \u201cconflicts of interest.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Bernie Becker", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "USPS\u2019s inspector general said the agency\u2019s set-up with CBRE sparks \u201cconflicts of interest.\u201d", "title": "Postal Service urged to end deal with real estate broker", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/240877-postal-service-urged-to-end-deal-with-real-estate-broker", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/postalworker_usps_111512getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/240877-postal-service-urged-to-end-deal-with-real-estate-broker", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-03T07:30-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Postal Service,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-03T07:30:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/240877-postal-service-urged-to-end-deal-with-real-estate-broker", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "USPS\u2019s inspector general said the agency\u2019s set-up with CBRE sparks \u201cconflicts of interest.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "Postal Service urged to end deal with real estate broker"}, "dcterms.title": "Postal Service urged to end deal with real estate broker"}, "article_summary": "The Postal Service needs to end its relationship with a major commercial real estate broker, a federal watchdog said this week.\nA spokesman for CBRE added that landlords paying real estate brokers commission when the broker represents a tenant is merely standard practice.\nUSPS\u2019s inspector general said the agency\u2019s set-up with CBRE, in which the real estate broker sometimes represents both sides of a lease or sale, sparks \u201cconflicts of interest.\u201dBoth the Postal Service and CBRE have defended their current arrangement.\nFor those reasons and more, the inspector general said the Postal Service should get rid of CBRE and allow other companies to bid to be the agency\u2019s broker.\nBut the American Postal Workers Union, the largest representative of USPS workers, dubbed the inspector general\u2019s report \u201ca stinging indictment\u201d of how the Postal Service does business."}
