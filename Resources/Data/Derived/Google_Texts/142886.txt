Police said a woman shot and killed her husband of about 20 years Sunday night outside his workplace in Sharon, Mercer County.

William Emmett, 45, of Greenville, was shot several times in the upper body about 6:15 p.m. near the intersection of East State Street and Woodrow Court, Sharon police Chief Gerry Smith said Monday.

His wife, Amy Emmett, whose age was unavailable, also was also shot multiple times in the upper torso with the same gun, Chief Smith said, but he added that police were still investigating.

Chief Smith said the shooting occurred on the sidewalk next to an employee parking lot of the Sharon Regional Health System, where Mr. Emmett worked. He said Ms. Emmett approached her husband when he arrived for work and shot him several times with a handgun.

Ms. Emmett was taken to St. Elizabeth Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, where she was in stable condition Monday afternoon.

Chief Smith said the couple had three children, the oldest of whom is 17. He said he believes the couple were married for about 20 years and he did not know what led to the dispute.

Because the Emmetts did not live in Sharon, the chief did not know their history. He said his department was working with other Mercer County authorities to see whether the couple had a violent past.

The chief said that he couldnâ€™t find any online court records for the two and was unaware of any protection from abuse orders either had previously filed. He also said the couple were not estranged and lived together.
