WELD COUNTY — Thirty bridges have been reported destroyed and another 20 seriously damaged in flood-ravaged areas of Colorado, a state transportation official said Sunday.

The Colorado Department of Transportation, which oversees every bridge in the state, expects the count to go up over the next few days, said Joshua Laipply, CDOT bridge engineer.

“I doubt we know the extent of it yet,” Laipply said.

CDOT crews were out Sunday inspecting bridges throughout the flood areas in hopes of reopening as soon as possible spans that are still sound, Laipply said.

On State Highway 60 in rural Weld County, repairs were underway on the road leading up to the South Platte bridge near County Road 46.

The bridge itself was in good shape, inspector crews determined, but the road leading up to it on the north side had washed away, leaving a two- to three-foot chasm.

“Our No. 1 priority is to gain access to communities, so emergency services can get in and out,” Laipply said.
