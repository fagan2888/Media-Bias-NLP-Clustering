John Kasich stuck to his upbeat message, trying to appeal to New Hampshire independent voters and moderates by refusing to engage in skirmishes with his opponents, and Jeb Bush reminded the audience that he was a competent governor who knows his way around policy.\n\nThe larger question for each of them is whether they have drastically misread the 2016 Republican electorate. So far Jeb Bush hasn\u2019t found much traction anywhere in the country. Mr. Kasich is only resonating in New Hampshire, where he\u2019s camped out for months and held more events than any other candidate. And Mr. Christie needs a miracle to rebound from his low single-digit polling status in New Hampshire and elsewhere.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Seven GOP candidates face off tonight in New Hampshire for the Republican debate.
