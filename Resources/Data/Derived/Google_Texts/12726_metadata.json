Dannel Malloy looked out for Connecticut's interests, including transportation needs and environmental concerns, and began to lay the groundwork for the very political job he will hold in an important election year.\n\nMalloy will the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association in 2016, a year his party hopes to reverse its slide among voters. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock is the DGA leader now.\n\nMalloy is already raising money for the DGA. He said he \u201ctalked to some folks at receptions\u201d in Washington this weekend about making donations.\n\n\u201cI am already participating in the elections,\u201d Malloy said.\n\nHe\u2019s also gone on the political offensive. Time magazine has called Malloy \u201cthe next liberal bulldog.\" After a meeting at the White House Friday, Malloy condemned former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for saying, \u201cI do not believe that the president loves America.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one in his right mind could question that the president loves America,\u201d Malloy said, and criticized potential GOP presidential candidates for failing to denounce Giuliani, saying their silence \u201cspeaks volumes.\u201d\n\nMalloy also expressed his disdain for \u201cDemocrat-lite\"candidates.\n\n\u201cWhen Democrats run as Republicans, we lose,\u201d he said.\n\nObama's guy\n\nMalloy was selected by President Obama to serve as Democratic co-chair of the Council of Governors, a 10-member panel of governors who address matters pertaining to the National Guard, homeland defense and defense support to civil authorities.\n\nAs co-leader of the council, Malloy came to Washington before the NGA meeting began to discuss National Guard funding and the Pentagon\u2019s plans to strip the National Guard of its Apache helicopters, a move the governors oppose.\n\nMalloy was also named chairman of the Coalition of Northeastern Governors this weekend. The group works jointly on regional issues.\n\nHe also met with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden several times during his stay in Washington.\n\nHe said the issue of transportation came up during these meetings. Connecticut Transportation Commissioner James Redecker has said it\u2019s unlikely the federal government will be a source of new revenues to help pay for Malloy\u2019s proposed 30-year, $100 billion transportation overhaul. The state budget assumes level federal funding.\n\nYet the governor is optimistic there will be more money from Washington.\n\nPartisan differences have stalled approval of a way to replenish the federal transportation trust fund, which pays for a lion\u2019s share of state transportation funding. The trust fund is scheduled to be depleted in May; and if not refilled, federal funding to states for transportation will be cut by half, or more.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an expectation that at least a temporary solution can be reached,\u201d Malloy said. \u201cThe broader thing is, can we get to a solution that increased the funding?\u201d\n\nObama has proposed a one-time 14 percent tax on a corporate profits earned overseas to shore up the transportation trust fund, which is filled largely by gasoline taxes and has been a victim of more fuel-efficient cars and a reduction in the miles Americans are driving.\n\nMalloy also chaired an NGA panel on the environment Sunday, where Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy, who at one time headed Connecticut\u2019s environmental protection agency, fielded tough questions from a group of governors.\n\nMalloy praised McCarthy, a Bostonian. \u201cAs they say in Boston, she\u2019s wicked smart,\u201d the governor said.\n\nBut he also prodded McCarthy to finalize regulations that would prevent air pollution that\u2019s transported to Connecticut mainly from the Midwest.\n\n\u201cIt all comes to my neighborhood,\u201d Malloy said. \u201cKeep Fairfield County and the rest of Connecticut in mind when you seek a solution.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy said the EPA was working on a solution, but also suggested the governors try to forge an agreement among themselves on the issue of pollution and \u201cdownwind states and upwind states.\u201d\n\nSecond chance to get it right?\n\nA leader in Democratic initiatives like implementation of the Affordable Care Act and raising the minimum wage, Malloy often gets singled out by Obama during events in Washington like the NGA gathering.\n\nOn Friday, the president praised Connecticut for its sick leave policy.\n\nAt another meeting with the governors on Monday, the president once again gave a shout out to Connecticut, but called Malloy by the name of a former Maryland governor, Martin O\u2019Malley.\n\n\u201cIn Connecticut, Gov. O\u2019Malley announced his Second Chance Society, a plan to help former prisoners rejoin their communities,\u201d Obama said.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/23/in-washington-malloy-burnishes-liberal-credentials-national-leadership-role/", "news_keywords": "Politics, Washington, Council of Governors, Dannel Malloy, Democratic Governors Association, Gina McCarthy, National Governor's Association, National Guard, President Obama, Rudolph Giuliani", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/23/in-washington-malloy-burnishes-liberal-credentials-national-leadership-role/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "WASHNGTON \u2013 At the National Governor\u2019s Association meeting this weekend, Gov.
