Those supporters see a man of principle, one who is, as an ally put it, \u201ca true believer\u201d in the cause.\n\nBut to most Senate Republicans, Hoskins is a craven political operator with limited experience winning elections. They see a man who\u2019s turned the SCF into a reflexive Republican opposition group with one goal: making the organization, and himself, richer. Recent targets of the group have included Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who long feuded with Hoskins\u2019s onetime boss, former Sen. Jim DeMint. The SCF is aggressively backing McConnell\u2019s tea party primary challenger in 2014, Matt Bevin.\n\n\u201cMatt is in it for whatever Matt can get out of it,\u201d Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said of Hoskins, who crossed paths with the senator during his time as a Senate aide. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything more than that.\u201d\n\nDespite working as a senior aide to DeMint when he served in Congress, Hoskins is known to most Republicans more by reputation than by any personal connection. The DeMint acolyte moved to San Diego County years ago to be closer to family, generating enemies in the Senate GOP from afar. And several veteran Republicans said they\u2019ve had to search for a picture of Hoskins on Google because they don\u2019t recall ever meeting him, despite being the target of his constant attacks.\n\n( PHOTOS: Governors\u2019 offices up for grabs in 2014)\n\nIn an interview, Hoskins brushed off criticism over his tactics and redirected the fire at his GOP critics.\n\n\u201cThey are always looking for someone else to blame,\u201d Hoskins said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to be criticized by conservatives, there is an easy solution: They can stop voting with Democrats.\u201d\n\nFree rein to attack Republicans\n\nHoskins has an ideal situation \u2014 he runs a multimillion-dollar operation with no board of directors to which to report. He and his core team of five staffers essentially have free rein to spend donors\u2019 cash \u2014 to lambaste sitting senators, renovate the group\u2019s Washington office space or build the SCF\u2019s notoriety on the right. Since DeMint left the Senate, any fears of crossing the line against sitting senators have gone out the window.\n\nEven though DeMint used the SCF to prop up right-wing primary challengers opposed by the establishment, he avoided taking on GOP incumbents \u2014 something that is now central to Hoskins\u2019s mission.\n\nSince DeMint left last year, the group, and its affiliated super PAC, Senate Conservatives Action, will soon report raking in more than $9 million in 2013, the most it has ever raised in a nonelection year, burning through much of that cash slamming fellow Republicans.\n\n( PHOTOS: Republican 2016 contenders)\n\nSo far, the SCF has invested $2.1 million in five candidates across the country \u2014 none of whom are preferred by the GOP establishment and only one of whom is running for a seat held by a Democrat. The SCF is bankrolling conservative challengers to Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts and Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran, and a range of other GOP senators \u2014 including Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona \u2014 who have been the subjects of TV and radio attack ads from the group.\n\nHoskins made no apologies about his group\u2019s fundraising success off of its relentless attacks on Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a fundraising organization, and we\u2019re proud of it,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, some of Hoskins\u2019s tactics seem to have gone too far for even conservative stalwarts \u2014 including one of the longtime leaders of the conservative movement, Ed Feulner, a founder of The Heritage Foundation, where DeMint now is at the helm.\n\nAfter receiving a Hoskins fundraising letter attacking McConnell, Feulner turned around and cut the senator a $1,000 check last month, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cI like him,\u201d Feulner said in an email, referring to McConnell. \u201cI think he\u2019s done a good job holding people together.\u201d\n\n( Sign up for POLITICO's Influence tipsheet)\n\nHoskins is part of a small network of activists who\u2019ve tapped into the intraparty wars that have dominated GOP politics since the 2010 midterms. Hoskins, along with activists from the anti-tax Club for Growth and Heritage Action, were instrumental in pressuring conservative lawmakers to take the hard-line strategy demanding a defunding of Obamacare, even though it led to the government shutdown last October. The SCF\u2019s two best months last year were in September and October \u2014 in the run-up and aftermath of the shutdown \u2014 when it pulled in $3.7 million. But the Club for Growth, these days, is seen by Senate GOP-ers as more reasonable and more streamlined in its targets.\n\n\u201cI want everybody in our coalition, whether they are the supporter of those groups, the leaders of the groups, to realize we\u2019re not just going to find totally pure people serving here,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who won a 2010 election upset buoyed by tea party forces. \u201cWe need a broad coalition \u2014 we need to remain united.\u201d\n\nHoskins said the group doesn\u2019t just reflexively endorse any candidate, arguing there\u2019s a thorough vetting process to ensure a would-be senator is sufficiently conservative and has a chance of winning the election. Sometimes the group even polls its 200,000 donors, as it did in making the decision to endorse Bevin, Hoskins said.\n\nThe SCF spent more against McConnell in 2013 than the GOP leader\u2019s main Democratic foe, Alison Lundergan Grimes, who entered the race in July. The group poured $1 million into the race last year, with scathing six-figure TV ad buys slamming the GOP leader for being weak-kneed in fighting Obamacare.\n\nEven in the Arkansas Senate race, where the GOP has united behind Rep. Tom Cotton, the SCF has so far declined to endorse him, even though it\u2019s spent money on TV, attacking Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor.\n\nRepublicans in Washington say following Hoskins\u2019s playbook is a recipe for a Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been by and large very destructive,\u201d said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who faces a primary challenge and has been a frequent target of the group\u2019s attacks. \u201cI wish they spent more time on our political opposition rather than creating internal divisions among Republicans. That does nothing but help our political opponents.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Matt Hoskins doesn't mind bashing Republicans.", "title": "An unbending leader on the right", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/matt-hoskins-senate-conservatives-fund-101943.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/08/140108_matt_hoskins_courtesy_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Senate Conservatives Fund,Republicans,Matt Hoskins,2014 Elections", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Matt Hoskins doesn't mind bashing Republicans.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f61\"", "article_summary": "| Courtesy of Matt Hoskins An unbending leader on the rightFor Matt Hoskins, bashing Republicans is good for business.\nBut to most Senate Republicans, Hoskins is a craven political operator with limited experience winning elections.\nRecent targets of the group have included Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who long feuded with Hoskins\u2019s onetime boss, former Sen.
