They've become a holiday tradition at the News On 6 and they're back and better than ever this year.

Every morning until Dec. 25, 6 In The Morning anchor LeAnne Taylor will be unveiling a new and unique Christmas sweater.

LeAnne said she probably has enough sweaters to wear one every day from Thanksgiving until Christmas, but she'll be showing off two weeks' worth this year.

Tune in to the 8 o'clock hour of 6 In The Morning each day on the Tulsa's CW to see each one.
