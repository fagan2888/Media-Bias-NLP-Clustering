Goucher was disturbed by some of Salazar\u2019s methods, and she took her concerns to USADA chief Travis Tygart. She also furnished information in a BBC documentary.\n\n\u201cDo you think everything I know came out in the BBC documentary? No. There\u2019s an investigation going on,\u201d Goucher said. \u201cThere will be a day. \u2026 I\u2019ve done all I can do at this point. I believe in Travis. The first time I (talked) to USADA, I said, \u2018All I want them to do is stop doing what they\u2019re doing.\u2019 \u201c\n\nGoucher, 37, left Salazar in 2011. She spent three more years in Oregon but returned returned to Boulder in 2014, making a comeback with coaches Mark Wetmore and Heather Burroughs. The men\u2019s race Saturday was won by Galen Rupp, a debut marathoner who is coached by Salazar. Rupp won a silver medal in the 10,000 meters at the 2012 Olympics.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have any impact on my life anymore,\u201d Goucher said. \u201cThey can do nothing to me anymore and justice is coming. People asked, how did you come back? Letting go of that (stuff) is how I came back. I lost 200 pounds of baggage I\u2019ve been carrying around and they can\u2019t touch me anymore.\u201d\n\nRupp didn\u2019t have much to say about the USADA investigation.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that I\u2019ve always been an advocate for clean sport, and I\u2019ve worked really hard over the years to get where I\u2019m at today,\u201d Rupp said. \u201cI\u2019m cooperating with whatever officials I need to cooperate with.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kara Goucher goes off on former coach Alberto Salazar", "title": "Kara Goucher goes off on former coach Alberto Salazar", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/13/kara-goucher-goes-off-on-former-coach-alberto-salazar/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160213__Kara-Goucherp1.jpg", "height": 442}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160213__Kara-Goucherp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-13T17:14:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:22:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "She spent three more years in Oregon but returned returned to Boulder in 2014, making a comeback with coaches Mark Wetmore and Heather Burroughs.\nRupp won a silver medal in the 10,000 meters at the 2012 Olympics.\nGoucher was disturbed by some of Salazar\u2019s methods, and she took her concerns to USADA chief Travis Tygart.\nBut she was defiant on the subject of her former coach, Alberto Salazar of the Nike Oregon Project, who is being investigated by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.\nThe men\u2019s race Saturday was won by Galen Rupp, a debut marathoner who is coached by Salazar."}
