This formulation should not provide much comfort to Israel.

Speaking to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee Monday, American Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Powers declared, “the United States will not allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. Period.”

Does that sound familiar?

It should. It sounds a lot like the formulation Obama used to make promises about Obamacare.

“If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period,” President Obama declared in a 2009 health care speech. “If you like your health care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health care plan, period.”

Well, those promises didn’t pan out so well.

The reason Benjamin Netanyahu is in America to warn about the Iranian nuclear threat is probably because he fears that to the Obama administration, “period” means “don’t believe anything we’re saying.”
