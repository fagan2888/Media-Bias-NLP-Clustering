That stance likely endeared her further to South Carolina\u2019s largely conservative citizenry.\n\n\u201cHer coming out and saying death penalty for the shooter is the kind of strong statement that people want to hear,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster who has followed Haley\u2019s career.\n\nAn Indian-American (her parents are Sikhs), Haley is one of a number of young conservatives who have helped remake the face of the Republican Party, giving it a newfound diversity.\n\nFueled by the tea party movement, she edged out two more established Republicans on her path to the governor\u2019s mansion in 2010. But as a result, she entered office largely unknown. Her approval ratings were tepid.\n\nHaley was then dragged down by battles with the state\u2019s Republican Legislature, an ethics probe regarding campaign-finance disclosure and a scandal surrounding the hacking attack on a state government agency.\n\nIn 2012, she made a political misstep when she threw her support early behind Mitt Romney in South Carolina\u2019s Republican presidential primary, a contest considered critical in the White House race because of its early placement on the primary cycle. When Newt Gingrich trounced Romney by a dozen percentage points, it was a public humiliation for Haley.\n\nPossible vice presidential pick?\n\nBut while all of that might have dimmed Haley\u2019s glow, it hasn\u2019t extinguished it. She\u2019s still considered to be in the mix as a possible vice presidential choice for whoever ends up being Republican presidential nominee for the November 2016 election. And at the very least, her support will be heavily courted in advance of next February\u2019s primary.\n\n\u201cShe holds a statewide office, she\u2019s popular, she has a strong record, and strong conservative credentials,\u201d former Romney adviser Kevin Madden said. \u201cAll of that will get you on the short list for veep talk.\u201d\n\nIn South Carolina, Haley stands at the zenith of her popularity, said Scott Huffmon, a political scientist at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina. She easily beat her Democratic opponent in 2014, Vincent Sheheen, in a rematch of their 2010 battle.\n\nMore recently, she has taken strong stand against the attempted unionization of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner facility in North Charleston, something that has conservatives comparing her to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a likely presidential candidate.\n\nIn the days since the Charleston church killings, Haley has not quelled her conservative support for expansive gun rights.\n\nCritics on social media circulated photos of her test-firing a semiautomatic weapon at a South Carolina firearms plant in 2013. And when at a prayer service the day after massacre a pastor decried gun violence and called for new limits on guns, Haley pointedly stayed seated as the congregation rose to its feet.\n\nHaley has also been assailed on social media for South Carolina\u2019s continued display on the grounds of the state Capitol of the Confederate flag. The Civil War-era flag has long been a flashpoint in national politics \u2014 supporters see it as an expression of the South\u2019s heritage, but critics view it as conveying a racist support for the slave-owning states that fought to retain their rights.\n\nWhen asked about the flag in an interview with CBS \u201cNews Friday,\u201d Haley demurred, saying it wasn\u2019t her concern at the moment.\n\n\u201cShe seems to be offering a mix of honest personal anguish and sensitivity to politics at the same time,\u201d Huffmon said of her performance after the church shootings. \u201cAt the same time, we only see her going as far as her established political positions allow. It\u2019s very much a fine line she is walking.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The governor stood before the cameras and, just briefly, broke, her voice cracking, her eyes sorrowful, revealing her anguish to the world.
