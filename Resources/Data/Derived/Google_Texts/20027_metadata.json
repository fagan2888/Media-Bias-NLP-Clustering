And though Indiana\u2019s late primary is often seen as just a formality (because the races are all but decided by the time May rolls around), things are a bit different this year.\n\nIndiana has been called a \u201cmust-win\u201d state for GOP candidate Donald Trump, and his opponents Ted Cruz and John Kasich have responded by collaborating on a strategy for the state \u2014 Kasich\u2019s campaign agreed to pull resources from Indiana and focus on other races, letting Cruz take on Trump in Indiana.\n\nOn the Democrat side, many are calling the race in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor, and her campaign tone has switched in recent weeks to a greater focus on the general election. But Bernie Sanders continues to push, and his enthusiastic grassroots support hasn\u2019t waned.\n\nAs the battle descends on the state and Hoosiers prepare to visit the polls, here\u2019s some information about the candidates and some of the issues they\u2019ve chosen to highlight during their campaigns:\n\nCLINTON\n\nOn criminal justice reform:\n\n\u2014 Work to strengthen trust between communities and police by investing in law enforcement training programs, supporting legislation to end racial profiling, providing federal funds for police body cameras and creating national guidelines on use of force\n\n\u2014 Take action on mandatory minimum sentences by cutting in half the current minimums for nonviolent drug offenses, applying the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactively, eliminating the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine, re-evaluating policies on prior offenses\n\n\u2014 Promote successful re-entry by supporting the \u201cban the box\u201d initiative and restoring voting rights to offenders who have served their sentences\n\nOn health care:\n\n\u2014 Build on the Affordable Care Act by making premiums more affordable and lessening out-of-pocket consumer expenses, supporting incentives for state Medicaid expansion, expanding access regardless of immigration status\n\n\u2014 Expand health care access to rural Americans\n\n\u2014 Ensure women have access to reproductive health care, including safe and legal abortions\n\nOn racial justice:\n\n\u2014 Dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline by providing funds to support schools in reforming disciplinary policies\n\n\u2014 End the era of mass incarceration\n\n\u2014 Protect the right to vote by fighting to repair the Voting Rights Act and implementing automatic voter registration\n\nFor more on Clinton\u2019s platform, visit hillaryclinton.com/issues.\n\nCRUZ\n\nOn the U.S. Constitution:\n\n\u201cWe need to restore the Constitution as our standard.

We need to give power back to the states and the people so that we remain a land where liberty can flourish.\u201d\n\nOn Second Amendment rights:\n\n\u201cTed Cruz has been a tireless defender of the Second Amendment.

So, let\u2019s not only oppose Obamacare but also put in motion real solutions that will work to improve health care access by holding down costs and help Americans live healthier lives.\u201d\n\nOn education:\n\n\u201cEducation is a state and local issue and should not be micro-managed by the federal government. The teaching curricula, choice of textbooks and lesson plans that local educators use are the responsibility of local school districts\u2014not federal bureaucrats.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cthe most vulnerable Americans\u201d:\n\n\u201cIn Congress John Kasich worked ... to pass legislation that led to historic reforms to federal welfare programs.
