Seven years later, he\u2019s returning to his pledge as he ponders his legacy and his final 500 days in office.\n\nWas this really the moment when climate change reversed course? NationSwell asked dozens of scientists, historians, jurists, former EPA administrators, legislators and presidential candidates a simple question: How will future generations judge Barack Obama\u2019s record on energy and the environment? Not surprisingly, the responses vary. Some were glowing (\u201cBarack Obama is destined to go down as the greatest climate change-fighting president in history,\u201d says Ed Chen, national communications director for the Natural Resources Defense Council), while others were hesitant to issue a verdict: \u201cIt\u2019s a very unfinished climate legacy, full of steps forwards, sideways, and back,\u201d says Bill McKibben, former staff writer at The New Yorker and founder of 350.org, a grassroots climate change movement.\n\nIndeed, the 44th president faltered on environmental legislation in his first term, preferring to expend his political capital on the Affordable Care Act. But Obama\u2019s use of regulatory authority and his agreement with China likely ensure his place in the pantheon of modern environmental champions.\n\nDavid McNew/Getty Images\n\nBACKPEDALLING FROM CAMPAIGN PROMISES\n\nIt\u2019s taken nearly two full terms to bring his labors to fruition. Shortly after defeating Sen. John McCain in the race for the Oval Office, Obama set two bills in motion on which he would stake his legacy: the health care law in the upper chamber, and in the lower, a comprehensive environmental bill that included a market-based carbon cap-and-trade system and renewable energy standards, co-authored by Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat whose amendments strengthened the Clean Air Act in 1990.\n\nIn June 2009, Waxman\u2019s bill narrowly passed the House by a vote of 219-212. \u201cThere was an apparent window of opportunity\u201d in that moment, says D. James Baker, a scientist who headed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under Bill Clinton, but by December, \u201cthe administration was eager for a quick victory and opted for health care.\u201d The climate change bill became Obama\u2019s \u201cstepchild,\u201d a senior official told The New Yorker.\n\nOffering concessions to earn goodwill from the Republican caucus, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agreed to delay implementation of carbon regulations for another year. Soon after, the president announced huge sections of U.S. waters along the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico open for drilling and withdrew support for the versions of Waxman\u2019s cap-and-trade bill being negotiated in the Democratic-led Senate.\n\n\u201cWhether with Obama\u2019s support [a nationwide cap-and-trade law] could have happened is a good question,\u201d says Baker, \u201cbut there is no question that the decision to back off was demoralizing to the environment and climate change community.\u201d Days later, as oil bubbled up from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Democrats hung their heads in defeat. \u201cThe missing piece of his legacy is national climate change legislation, which he and Congress failed to pass,\u201d says Kenneth Kimmel, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nMAKING USE OF REGULATION, NOT LEGISLATION\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Obama failed completely during his first term. The 2009 stimulus bill designated $90 billion for a bevy of green initiatives: retrofitting homes for energy efficiency, fueling development in wind and solar power, modernizing the grid, training employees for green jobs, building high-speed rail, researching carbon capture for coal-burning plants and manufacturing cleaner cars.\n\n\u201cThe stimulus package gave President Obama a chance to invest in renewables early in his first term, allowing him to make progress on the issues unlike most other recent presidents, who have been forced for political reasons to leave critical environmental issues to their second terms,\u201d says Baker. If anything, the president\u2019s preference for working outside the legislature set the standard for his later environmental accomplishments. After the bruising battle over healthcare and the Republican sweep of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama took the path of least resistance.\n\nWaxman retired last year after 20 terms, but you can still sense his frustration with the gridlock that killed his legislation. In an email, he tells NationSwell that Congress \u201crefuses to learn from the overwhelming scientific consensus on the dangers we are facing.\u201d He applauded President Obama for circumventing the increasingly partisan legislature by using \u201cthe power to act domestically and internationally based on existing laws on the books, even without Congress passing new laws.\u201d Bolstered by a Supreme Court ruling in 2007 that George W. Bush\u2019s administration had shirked their duties, Waxman\u2019s Clean Air Act amendments provided all the authority Obama needed.\n\nIt's a very unfinished climate legacy, full of steps forwards, sideways, and back.\u201d Bill McKibben\n\nIn the past month, much of the focus has been on the Clean Power Plan, which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants 32 percent by 2030. But that\u2019s only the latest in a long series of administrative actions. During Obama\u2019s first term, the EPA and the Department of Transportation set new fuel efficiency standards: All cars built after 2025 must get at least 54.5 miles per gallon. This summer, those same agencies proposed raising standards for medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles as well. Despite litigation that\u2019s made its way all the way to the Supreme Court, the EPA slashed the acceptable levels of ozone that clouds city skylines, mercury released by coal-fired plants and methane billowing from oil fields, landfills and farms. When it comes to conservation, Obama\u2019s designated more land and water as national monuments under the Antiquities Act \u2014 260 million acres total \u2014 than any other president.\n\nIn creating \u201cthe first-ever framework for the United States to achieve long-term emissions reductions,\u201d says Richard Revesz, former dean of New York University School of Law, these achievements will outlast Obama\u2019s two terms \u2014 regardless of whom the next president is. \u201cEven if the Democrats lose the White House in 2017, the new greenhouse gas regulations will still need to be implemented,\u201d says Steven Cohen, executive director of Columbia\u2019s Earth Institute. Those guidelines, along with states\u2019 actions, \u201cwill probably end the use of coal as a source of energy in the U.S.\u201d\n\nDespite the likely positive outcomes, several Republicans interviewed chastised the president for his reliance on regulations, instead of legislation. \u201cIt will be seen as a failure that he wasn\u2019t able to get anything through that is enforceable,\u201d says Christine Todd Whitman, the former New Jersey governor who was George W. Bush\u2019s first appointee as EPA administrator. She argues that using the \u201cheavy-handed tool\u201d of the EPA \u201cwill make things more difficult for the agency going forward.\u201d\n\nDavid McNew/Getty Images\n\nOthers had even harsher words. \u201cPresident Obama has dogmatically used energy as a political tool rather than a building block of renewed economic vibrancy,\u201d says Mike Leavitt, former governor of Utah and Whitman\u2019s successor as EPA administrator. Luke Popovich, spokesman for the National Mining Association, agrees. \u201cHe was the president who deepened the partisan divide between Republicans and Democrats over these crucial intersecting issues\u201d of energy and the environment.\n\nCONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE HEAD ON\n\nPerhaps because the president has been \u201chamstrung by politics,\u201d as one historian phrased it, he\u2019s not staking his legacy on any one bill or rule. Instead, as his recent photo-ops in Alaska demonstrates, Obama seems to be focusing on perceptions. His prominence on the global stage \u2014 including his role in negotiating the limited Copenhagen Accord in 2010 and the recent deal with China to curb their emissions by 2030 \u2014 \u201chelped move the issue of global environmental sustainability to the center of the American and international political agenda,\u201d says Cohen.\n\nAs the commander-in-chief prepares to convene with leaders from 196 countries to sign a treaty at the United Nations Climate Change Conference this December, his legacy on climate change \u201clies in his success in making climate change a central policy obligation,\u201d says Carol M. Browner, Obama\u2019s advisor who directed the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy from 2009 to 2011, when Waxman\u2019s cap-and-trade bill foundered. If the president can get millions of Americans, industry and other stakeholders to think about it while also facing opposition from Congress, he\u2019ll be remembered for changing how climate policy is developed and implemented.\n\nAs the effects of climate change become more visible, the challenges facing Obama aren\u2019t disappearing like glaciers are. Perhaps surprisingly, some of the president\u2019s loudest critics are on the left. They\u2019re fuming over the Keystone XL pipeline and off-shore oil and gas exploration in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans.\n\n\u201cWith the president\u2019s permission, Shell is now drilling for oil in the Alaskan Arctic, and his administration has authorized the future sale of 10.2 billion tons of coal,\u201d says Annie Leonard, Greenpeace USA\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that President Obama is serious about cementing his climate legacy, but until he takes steps to ensure the vast majority of fossil fuels remain in the ground, his legacy is as vulnerable as an Arctic ice sheet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the days of his administration wind down, NationSwell examines how history books will judge the 44th president.", "og": {"site_name": "NationSwell", "description": "As the days of his administration wind down, NationSwell examines how history books will judge the 44th president.", "title": "Obama Promised to Make the Environment a Main Policy Issue.
