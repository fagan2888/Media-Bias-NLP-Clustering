It got its nickname even before it opened to traffic, because of a major design failure. It allowed modest wind pressure to make the roadway visibly oscillate both side to side and end to end. In November 1940, four months after its opening, a crossways 40 mph wind started Gertie galloping, and within minutes it spectacularly collapsed into Puget Sound.\n\nA good case can be made that the worst design failure disaster in Vermont history is the Vermont Health Benefits Exchange, Vermont Health Connect.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act of 2010 authorized the federal government to spend billions to underwrite the creation of health insurance exchanges in the states, and create a backup federal exchange. Only 17 states, including Vermont, took advantage of this offer.\n\nThe task, for a state, was to create a web-based exchange where individuals and small businesses could review and select the insurance plan that best met their needs, from a menu of (overpriced) policies that contain the \u201cessential benefits\u201d lobbied into the Obamacare act, plus a host of Vermont mandates.\n\nFrom its first halting rollout on October 1, 2014, VHC never came close to working as (supposedly) designed. For instance, when a policy holder has a \u201cchange of circumstance\u201d, such as a marriage, divorce, new child, address change, etc., VHC\u2019s website can\u2019t cope with the change. VHC has had to hire hundreds of temp workers to manually work their way through thousands of requested changes. The April State Auditor\u2019s report includes an exhaustive list of VHC failures, both of design and management. So far the Shumlin administration has expended an astounding $198 million (federal) dollars on VHC, and has little to show for it but grief and ridicule.\n\nHow bad is this? An enthusiastic supporter of single payer health care, Bekka Mandell of Burlington, commented on VtDigger.org that \u201cmy husband and I have been struggling to navigate the Vermont Health Connect system and I know we\u2019re not alone. Between the two of us, we\u2019ve spent dozens of hours on the phone with them trying to sort out our coverage. We\u2019re expecting our first baby in May, so we\u2019re terrified that some glitch in their system is going to end up costing us hundreds or thousands of dollars in hospital fees. After dealing with the Vermont Health Connect bureaucracy, it\u2019s tempting to throw in the towel on the whole idea of a universal health care system if the state is going to have anything to do with it.\u201d\n\nIf a Vermont Workers Center volunteer like Ms. Mandell has been driven to the brink of scrapping the idea of any universal health care system managed by the state, that ought to be an alarm bell for a lot of people who are naively clamoring for single-payer Green Mountain Care.\n\nThe House version of this year\u2019s health care reform repair bill (S.139) includes a timid response to this failure. It directs the Joint Fiscal Office to analyze the advantages and disadvantages, of alternative options for the VHC \u201cincluding continuing [VHC] , transitioning to a federally facilitated State-based marketplace, and other available options.\u201d Whatever JFO recommends, it won\u2019t become a live option until the legislature approves. That can\u2019t happen until long after the October 1 enrollment period opens for 2016, which for the first time will include mandatory participation by businesses with 51-100 employees.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with the idea of an online insurance purchasing exchange. In fact, dozens of such exchanges operate now in the private sector, but they aren\u2019t allowed to channel income-based Obamacare premium tax credits or state subsidies to their customers.\n\nWhether VHC can ever be made to work appears increasingly unlikely. It\u2019s pretty clear that Washington is not going to toss in another hundred million dollars to rescue the Shumlin administration.\n\nInstead of giving the state government even more control over Vermont\u2019s health care and insurance sectors, the legislature should abandon Green Mountain Care (currently postponed indefinitely), roll back thirty years of foolish state mandates that have afflicted the Vermont insurance market, make a determined start toward a consumer directed health policy that will produce better quality outcomes at less expense, and finally put an end to Vermont\u2019s Galloping Gertie.\n\nThis piece was first published by the Ethan Allen Institute.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Instead of giving the state government ever more control over Vermont\u2019s health care & insurance sectors, the legislature should abandon Green Mountain Care.", "title": "Vermont\u2019s Galloping Gertie - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/Tacoma-Narrows-Bridge.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/218331/vermonts-galloping-gertie/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2015-05-12T14:44:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Instead of giving the state government ever more control over Vermont\u2019s health care & insurance sectors, the legislature should abandon Green Mountain Care.", "title": "Vermont\u2019s Galloping Gertie - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/Tacoma-Narrows-Bridge.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Instead of giving the state government ever more control over Vermont\u2019s health care & insurance sectors, the legislature should abandon Green Mountain Care."}, "article_summary": "A good case can be made that the worst design failure disaster in Vermont history is the Vermont Health Benefits Exchange, Vermont Health Connect.\nIn November 1940, four months after its opening, a crossways 40 mph wind started Gertie galloping, and within minutes it spectacularly collapsed into Puget Sound.\nThe House version of this year\u2019s health care reform repair bill (S.139) includes a timid response to this failure.\nIt allowed modest wind pressure to make the roadway visibly oscillate both side to side and end to end.\nBy John McClaughry | Watchdog Opinion\u201cGalloping Gertie\u201d was the nickname given by construction workers to the infamous Tacoma Narrows Bridge, in the state of Washington."}
