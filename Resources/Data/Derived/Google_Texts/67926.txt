The FBI is looking into the security of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s private email server, The Washington Post reported.

Citing two government officials, the Post reported that the FBI during the past week contacted a Denver-based technology firm that helped the Democratic presidential candidate manage her system.

Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer, David Kendall, also confirmed reports that he was contacted by the FBI about a thumb drive in his possession that contains emails exchanged by Mrs. Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state.

“The government is seeking assurance about the storage of those materials,” Mr. Kendall said. “We are actively cooperating.”

The sources cautioned the Post, though, that the FBI is not investigating Mrs. Clinton herself nor accusing her of wrongdoing.
