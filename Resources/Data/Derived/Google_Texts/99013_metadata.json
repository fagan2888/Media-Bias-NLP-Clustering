As more and more costs are uncovered, business owners will have to determine ways to cover these increases in the cost of doing business.\u201d\n\nJust one day after word spread about the restaurant group\u2019s surcharge, the chain announced they were dropping it from customers\u2019 bills at their restaurants.\n\n\u201cThe health care surcharge at our franchised Buffalo Wild Wings in Lubbock, TX has been removed,\u201d Heather Leiferman, Director of Public Relations, said in a statement. \u201cWe regret any inconvenience this may have caused. Our priority is to always provide our guests a great experience every day so they can enjoy our wings, beer and sports.\u201d\n\nSources: KCBD, KFYO / Photo Source: KCBD, KFYO", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "\u201cWith me and my husband and our babies...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Restaurant Customers Notice Something Strange On Receipts (Photo)", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/health/restaurant-group-adds-surcharge-customers-bills-cover-costs-affordable-care-act", "image": "http://imgur.com/qxpDKkJ.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cWith me and my husband and our babies...", "title": "Restaurant Customers Notice Something Strange On Receipts (Photo)"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-01-22T14:56:25+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2015-01-22T14:56:25+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "ov": {"id": 842455}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb20e\"", "article_summary": "After reports that a restaurant group in Texas was charging a surcharge to cover the costs of the Affordable Care Act, the group decided to drop the fee from customers\u2019 bills.\nHoward Restaurant Group in Lubbock, Texas, decided that in order to cover the increased costs they faced due to the Affordable Care Act, they needed to charge customers a two percent surcharge.\nAfter word spread of their decision, locals in the community expressed that they did not agree with what the restaurant group was doing.\n\u201cThe health care surcharge at our franchised Buffalo Wild Wings in Lubbock, TX has been removed,\u201d Heather Leiferman, Director of Public Relations, said in a statement.\n\u201cSo I don't understand why we're having to pay for everyone else's.\u201dEddy McBride, Lubbock Chamber of Commerce President, said that many local business owners have felt the effects of the Affordable Care Act."}
