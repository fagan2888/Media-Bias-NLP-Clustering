× Arkansas Receives “F-” Rating On Reproductive Health Report Card

ARKANSAS (KFSM) — Arkansas received an F-, a below-failing grade, in a 2015 report card on reproductive health and rights compiled by the Population Institute.

Each state in the Union was graded on nine criteria, which fit into four main categories: Effectiveness (30 points), prevention (20 points), affordability (25 points) and access (25 points). This year, Arkansas earned a 39.7 out of the possible 100 points.

Arkansas is among 19 states that received failing grades in the report, including Oklahoma. The majority of the failing states were in the South and Midwest.

Oregon had the highest rating at 90.1 points, and Louisiana had the lowest at 21.3, according to figures in the report. Overall, the United States received a D+.

According to the report, Arkansas fell from a D grade in last year’s report, largely because of the state’s low scores in prevention and access.

Here’s a breakdown of Arkansas’ grades in the four main categories and their reasoning behind the grades, according to the Population Institute:

Effectiveness

Teen Pregnancy Rate – 7/15. The current rate is 73 pregnancies per 1,000 among women 15-19.

Unintended Pregnancy Rate – 11.3/15. The unintended pregnancy rate is 55 percent of total Arkansas pregnancies.

Prevention

Sex Education – 0/15. Sex education is not mandated in public schools

Access to Emergency Contraception – 2.5/5. Arkansas requires emergency rooms to provide information about emergency contraception.

Affordability
