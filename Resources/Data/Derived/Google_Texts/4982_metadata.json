Leading the opposition was Speaker Thom Tillis, now the Republican candidate for Senate, who argued that expanding Medicaid would only hurt taxpayers in the state. \u201cThis bill puts the interests of our taxpayers and Medicaid patients first,\u201d Tillis said at the time. \u201cIt is clear that North Carolina\u2019s Medicaid system is broken. This bill is rightly focused on repairing Medicaid to better serve our citizens, rather than expanding a broken program.\u201d\n\nA few months later, Democrats in the state legislature tried to get Republican Gov. Pat McCrory to reconsider the decision and call a special session to take up the Medicaid expansion. McCrory refused, and he had the full support of Tillis. \u201cAn expansion of Medicaid would cost North Carolina taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars through 2021,\u201d Tillis said in a statement. \u201cIf these liberal activists were truly serious about reducing the cost of health insurance, they would be in Washington protesting Obamacare, an abomination that has caused insurance premiums to skyrocket for working families.\u201d\n\nIn campaigning for Senate against Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan, Tillis presented himself as an implacable foe of the Affordable Care Act. His campaign website calls the law \u201ca cancer on our national economy.\u201d He backed efforts in the Senate to defund the law that ultimately led to the 2013 government shutdown. \u201cI believe Obamacare is a mortal threat to our economy. It will decrease healthcare quality and raise healthcare premiums and Republicans should do everything in our power to undo it.\u201d During the Republican primary for the Senate nomination, Tillis aired ads boasting that he \u201cstopped Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion cold. It\u2019s not happening in North Carolina, and it\u2019s because of Thom Tillis.\u201d\n\nYou get the idea: Thom Tillis, enemy of Obamacare, vanquisher of expanded Medicaid.\n\nAnd so it was surprising, but only slightly, when Thom Tillis appeared on TWC News\u2019 \u201cCapitol Tonight\u201d last night and said North Carolina should definitely consider expanding Medicaid under Obamacare:\n\nAsked if he thought it would be likely that the state legislature would expand Medicaid coverage after refusing to do so previously, Tillis said it might make sense once the state has better control of the financing of the program, which is notorious for its cost overruns. He said he didn\u2019t have an ideological objection to expanding the coverage. But he said when the state auditor told the previous governor that money was being wasted on it, the appropriate response would not have been to make it bigger and more costly. \u201cI would encourage the state legislature and governor to consider it if they\u2019re completely convinced they now have the situation under control,\u201d Tillis said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thom Tillis bragged that he \"stopped Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion cold.\" Now he says it should be reconsidered", "title": "Another Obamacare enemy folds: Thom Tillis says North Carolina should consider expanding Medicaid", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Thom Tillis bragged that he \"stopped Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion cold.\" Now he says it should be reconsidered", "title": "Another Obamacare enemy folds: Thom Tillis says North Carolina should consider expanding Medicaid", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/22/another_obamacare_enemy_folds_thom_tillis_says_north_carolina_should_consider_expanding_medicaid/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/thom_tillis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thom Tillis bragged that he \"stopped Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion cold.\" Now he says it should be reconsidered", "title": "Another Obamacare enemy folds: Thom Tillis says North Carolina should consider expanding Medicaid", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/thom_tillis.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Editor's Picks, GOP, Kay Hagan, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, North Carolina, Obamacare, Republicans, The Right, Thom Tillis", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3b89\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s not happening in North Carolina, and it\u2019s because of Thom Tillis.\u201dYou get the idea: Thom Tillis, enemy of Obamacare, vanquisher of expanded Medicaid.\nTopics: Affordable Care Act, Editor's Picks, GOP, Kay Hagan, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, North Carolina, Obamacare, Republicans, The Right, Thom Tillis, Politics NewsIn early 2013, the North Carolina general assembly passed legislation rejecting the expansion of Medicaid within the state under the Affordable Care Act.\nLeading the opposition was Speaker Thom Tillis, now the Republican candidate for Senate, who argued that expanding Medicaid would only hurt taxpayers in the state.\n\u201cAn expansion of Medicaid would cost North Carolina taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars through 2021,\u201d Tillis said in a statement.\nPat McCrory to reconsider the decision and call a special session to take up the Medicaid expansion."}
