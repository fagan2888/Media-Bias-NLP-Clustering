An inch of topsoil takes a century to accumulate. But, soil conditions can be improved in a much shorter time, using good management, including increasing organic matter content, which sustains the myriad life forms found in healthy soils.\n\nIncreasing world population underscores the importance of soil improvement education for billions of farmers and home gardeners.\n\nFear Mongering\n\nWhen Faux News\u2019 Chris Wallace tackled the national presidential \u201cissue\u201d of transgendered people using the bathroom which they feel appropriate for them, and reaction to the spate of recent laws \u201cprotecting\u201d women from predatory men in womens\u2019 restrooms, he researched the \u201cproblem\u201d and found a political red herring. Quoting Politico and right and left wing groups, which found no instances of men using transgendered \u201ccover\u201d to assault women in restrooms, Chris conceded that the legislation was a solution in search of a problem. Politico concluded, \u201cWe haven\u2019t found any instances of criminals convicted of using transgender protections as cover in the United States.\u201d\n\nConservatives are disappointed that this latest wedge issue, of demonizing any sexuality that isn\u2019t their 100% straight (man on top) celestially sanctioned version of sexual expression, hasn\u2019t energized their base.\n\nExcept, of course for Ted Cruz, who continues to frame the issue as protecting his daughters from non-existent men posing as women, who would sexually assault unwitting females in public restrooms.\n\nChalk up another example of GOP fear mongering to add to: voter fraud, womens\u2019 reproductive health \u201csafety\u201d TRAP laws, women serving in combat and on submarines, gays serving openly in the military, undocumented Latinos (\u201c...and some, I assume, are good people\u201d), burdening future generations with government debt, \u201cjudicial activism,\u201d a liberal \u201cwar\u201d on Christianity, Obamacare, Black Lives Matter, the government plot to take away your guns, socialism, the Iraq war \u2014 \u201cBut we don\u2019t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud?\u201d (Condolizza Rice), and the biggest fabrication yet, that 1.6 trillion Muslims are out to get us.\n\n\u201cBe afwaid, be vewry afwaid.\u201d\n\nWar\u2019s Death Toll\n\nSince the US lead \u201cWar on Terror\u201d began on 9/11, 1.3 million people have died as a result of the conflicts. According to a study by Physicians for Social Responsibility, Physicians for Global Survival, and the Nobel Prize-winning International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, the death toll in just three countries, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan may be as high as 2 million dead.\n\nMillions dead from 15 years of conflict, but where is the main stream media? Bragging about how good the Donald has been for their bottom line?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe forward to the study remarks, \u201c[A]t a time when we\u2019re contemplating at this point cutting off our removal of troops from Afghanistan and contemplating new military authorization for increasing our operations in Syria and Iraq, this insulation from the real impacts serves our government in being able to continue to conduct these wars in the name of the war on terror, with not only horrendous cost to the people in the region, but we in the United States suffer from what the budgetary costs of unending war are.\u201d\n\nAfter the departure of Robert Gates and Chuck Hagel, president Obama tapped veteran Pentagon insider Ash Carter to be Secretary of Defense. After leaving office, both Gates and Hagel criticized the White House micromanagement of the middle east conflicts, and lack of access to the president.\n\nCarter\u2019s job is to implement a shift in war strategy, which will increasingly rely \u201cheavily on a dizzying patchwork of local ground forces \u2014 often with competing agendas \u2014 moving in large formations to isolate and ultimately invade the two major ISIS strongholds: Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria,\u201d according to Military Times. This more conventional military approach will require troops on the ground, possibly for years to come. But, ignores ISIS strongholds in Syria, which is one of many factions fighting to overthrow Assad.\n\nWe look to support Syrian \u201cmoderates\u201d to effect regime change there. Problem is, there are no Syrian \u201cmoderates.\u201d Another fiction invented 1. to avert public backlash from direct US military intervention in Syria, 2. as an excuse to dump costly military arms in the region, insuring the continued profit \u201cgravy train\u201d of the arms industry.\n\nSyrian civilian deaths have increased since looser rules of engagement were implemented last fall. In 2015, the US sold arms totaling $1.475 billion ($1,475, 000,000) to Egypt. Last November, the State Department announced more arms sales to the Saudis of $1.29 Billion ($1,290,000,000).\n\nBottom line, more people will die in the region, for years to come. In fact, whenever America\u2019s \u201cinterests\u201d are cited as justification for military intervention, people die. Lots of them.\n\nFifteen years from now, after 30 years of failed policy (did we learn nothing from Viet Nam? And LBJ huddling with his advisors in the White House, to decide which parts of Viet Nam to bomb back to the stone age? And the war crimes of Nixon and Kissinger?), will a future president implement another \u201cstrategic shift,\u201d which will further the continued profits of the terrorism industrial complex? What will the middle east death toll be then?\n\nJeff Konicek is a retired educator and bonsai expert, living in Laytonville.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Earth has lost a third of arable land in the past 40 years, according to the University of Sheffield\u2019s Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures.The continual plowing of fields, combined with heavy use of fertilizers, has degraded soils ac", "title": "The Rant: Fear mongering", "og": {"url": "http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/article/NP/20160501/LOCAL1/160509999", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.ukiahdailyjournal.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/ukiahdailyjournal.png?052016", "height": "315px"}, "type": "article", "title": "The Rant: Fear mongering"}, "twitter": {"domain": "ukiahdailyjournal.com", "description": "Earth has lost a third of arable land in the past 40 years, according to the University of Sheffield\u2019s Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures.The continual plowing of fields, combined with heavy use of fertilizers, has degraded soils ac", "title": "The Rant: Fear mongering", "url": "http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/article/NP/20160501/LOCAL1/160509999", "image": {"src": "http://local.ukiahdailyjournal.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/ukiahdailyjournal.png?052016"}, "site": "@UDJnews", "app": {"id": {"iphone": "id503016816?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ukiahdailyjournal"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Columns, Columns news, Ukiah Columns news, CA Columns news, US Columns news, world Columns news.", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Columns, Columns news, Ukiah Columns news, CA Columns news, US Columns news, world Columns news."}, "article_summary": "Increasing world population underscores the importance of soil improvement education for billions of farmers and home gardeners.\n), will a future president implement another \u201cstrategic shift,\u201d which will further the continued profits of the terrorism industrial complex?\nEarth has lost a third of arable land in the past 40 years, according to the University of Sheffield\u2019s Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures.\nThis more conventional military approach will require troops on the ground, possibly for years to come.\nBut, ignores ISIS strongholds in Syria, which is one of many factions fighting to overthrow Assad."}
