Below, an almond-eyed woman dressed in lace lights candles on a makeshift altar for Our Lady of Guadalupe. A few feet away, a man wearing a colorful serape arranges a nativity scene. Suddenly, braceros burst through the rain-streaked door, carrying armfuls of gladiolas and poinsettias, delighting the children.\n\n\u2018Tis the season of Las Posadas \u2014 the nine-day Mexican celebration of Christmas that began running from the middle of December through Christmas. The bustle inside Mercado La Paloma is especially joyous since the immigrant retail center is about to pay off its entire $8 million debt \u2014 loans it probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to secure in today\u2019s corporate banking era.\n\nThe story of La Paloma is one reason why the House of Representatives should join the Senate and White House in passing comprehensive immigration reform in 2014. Polls show that the American public supports immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship \u2014 and no wonder. Many of our friends and neighbors run tiendas, officios, and home- or truck-based businesses, legal and illegal. But few of us know that these activities contributed about $500 billion to our economy in 2012, according to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. And that doesn\u2019t count the money generated by the 11 million non-citizens or \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants working here. Plus, there is the hard-to-quantify value of how these ventures improve our street corners by contributing not just jobs and taxes to the common wealth, but voice, creativity and pleasure.\n\nJust like La Paloma.\n\nThis retail center is two miles south of Los Angeles\u2019 financial heart, but it might as well be light years away from the marble arteries of Bank of America Plaza and L.A.\u2019s World Trade Center. Bordered by two major freeways on the north and east and by Martin Luther King Boulevard on the south, the area was once a vast wasteland of illegal garment factories, slum housing and off-the-book transactions (including drug deals). Some of the grime and grit remain. But over the past 13 years or so, the neighborhood has been improved significantly by the pioneers at Mercado La Paloma.\n\nMeet Raul Morales and his wife, Guadalupe. The couple arrived here from Michoac\u00e1n in the early 1990s. They supported themselves by selling carne asada out of the trunk of their car. They met another street vendor, Gilberto Cetina, who hailed from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. He and his wife Blanca specialized in polla pibil, a dish made on a kerosene stove they unpacked from their van. The couples began working together \u2014 one selling steak, the other chicken \u2014 feeding the workers who emerged from the factories and yards. In between shifts, they shared dreams of earning enough money to someday run their own caf\u00e9s \u2014 with a kitchen and a stove \u2014 and to send their kids to college.\n\nAt the time, those dreams seemed too fantastico. Many immigrants were living in vermin-infested tenements east of the Harbor Freeway, a 10-lane speedway of asphalt and exhaust. West of the freeway sprawled places of unimaginable wealth and power: the University of Southern California, with its $3.7 billion endowment; Mount St. Mary\u2019s College and the Doheny Mansion; the Los Angeles Convention Center, with its beauty pageants and reality TV auditions. When the $400 million Staples Center opened in 1999, thanks partly to $72 million in public funds, other developers rushed in with plans of luxury hotels and condos. All that money started to squeeze the working-class families who lived in this densely packed corridor. And unlike their more glamorous neighbors to the west, the immigrant workers had little clout and few rights.\n\nBut they had a tireless advocate in the guise of Sister Diane Donoghue. A member of the Sisters of Social Services, the nun worked at nearby St. Vincent Catholic Church. When a parishioner who was dying of cancer called to say her landlord was evicting her from the home she and her family had occupied for decades, Donoghue took action. She knew that many other families would soon be homeless if yet another high-priced operation was allowed to displace the low-wage workers. So, she founded the nonprofit Esperanza Community Housing Corp. \u2014 esperanza means \u201chope\u201d in Spanish \u2014 and partnered with community developers and a few then-regional banks.\n\nShe and her team raised the funds to buy two slum houses. They replaced squalid units with about 40 clean affordable ones and a community center that housed a Head Start program. \u201cMost of the residents were undocumented and that was okay,\u201d said the nun. \u201cIt\u2019s never been a question.\u201d Some were here legally and Gilberto, for one, moved his family into an Esperanza apartment. But he never let go of his and Raul\u2019s dream of owning a business. One night, they hit on a plan: Why don\u2019t we recreate the bustling markets like those we left behind at home?\n\nThat\u2019s what \u201cimmigrants\u201d had been doing in Los Angeles for centuries. Six years before British colonists on the East Coast declared independence from England, a group of Mexican families arrived here on horseback and staked a claim for the viceroyalty of New Spain. Later, in 1779, King Carlos III of Spain was so pleased he ordered that a church be built along the banks of the Los Angeles River. La Iglesia de Nuestra Senora la Reina de Los Angeles \u2014 The Church of Our Lady, Queen of the Angels \u2014 remains the oldest building in Los Angeles still used for its original purpose. It\u2019s a constant in the ever-changing skyline here, the only dependable place offering sanctuary to all comers, the same migrants who\u2019ve helped turn \u201cAlta\u201d California into the richest state in the nation.\n\nYet, they\u2019ve often been quashed by more powerful interests. In the mid-1990s, for example, Esperanza was sheltering a few hundred members of the working poor. But Donoghue quickly realized that shelter solved only part of this urban problem. \u201cWe needed to create opportunities for them to obtain living-wage jobs, too,\u201d she said.\n\nSo the nun tapped her connections, both temporal and divine. She and her flock found an abandoned sweatshop on Grand Avenue with three stories and an ugly past. The ground floor still was packed with industrial sewing machines at which workers had toiled for 11 to 16 hours a day with few breaks and no overtime. But the second floor had housed the executive offices, with spacious suites, a commercial kitchen and a sauna. The Beverly Hills owners had abandoned their illegal garment factory, so Donoghue set about buying it. She strong-armed her uptown friends \u2014 bankers, councilmen and philanthropists \u2014 and cobbled together grants, low-income tax credits, bank loans and redevelopment money. At some point, she and her crew came up with an untraditional plan for the 34,000-square-foot site:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Comprehensive reform appears likely to die in Congress.
