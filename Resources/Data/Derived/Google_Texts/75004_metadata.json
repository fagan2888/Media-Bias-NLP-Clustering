It appears regulators knew that without narrow networks, Covered California premium rates would have skyrocketed.\n\nLess than two weeks later, the Covered California website\u2019s on-line directory of doctors and hospitals available under for the 12 health-insurance plans listed on the state exchange was taken off-line \u201cdue to errors,\u201d according to a Covered California customer service representative on their 1-800-300-1506 phone line.\n\nDepartment of Managed Health Care acknowledged on November 18, 2014 over 25% of physicians listed in the medical services directories for Blue Shield of California and for Anthem Blue Cross were not taking Covered California patients or no longer had offices at their listed location.\n\nThe new revelations come as Covered California began on November 15, 2014 enrolling about 1.2 million new and continuing subscribers. Yet, the Covered California website on November 19th was not allowing customers to login and the automated phone prompt stated that the \u201cexpected wait time is two hours.\u201d\n\nOfficials acknowledged last month that the state-run online exchange directory listing 12 health-insurance plans was \u201ctemporarily\u201d taken down to make improvements to the system, including speed, navigation, and search functions.\n\nThe Daily News reported last month that the California Medical Association said the Covered California on-line directory had several factual errors. \u201cUpdating and calibrating the directory is a complex, labor-intensive effort,\u201d Covered California officials replied in a statement. \u201cThe files are very large, and the search tool cross-references literally tens of thousands of doctors, hospitals and other providers across a dozen insurance companies.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported unsuspecting patients appear to have suffered huge additional medical bills for using advertised network doctors and hospitals for medical tests and procedures, but were actually \u201cout-of-network.\u201d\n\nWhen President Obama in his January, 2014 State of the Union speech said, \u201cfew things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system,\u201d he may have been referring to Covered California.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Covered California is what 'Broken' Healthcare Looks Like", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Covered California is what 'Broken' Healthcare Looks Like", "title": "Covered California is what 'Broken' Healthcare Looks Like - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/California/Covered%20California/Covered-California.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2014/11/21/covered-california-is-what-broken-healthcare-looks-like/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Covered California is what 'Broken' Healthcare Looks Like", "title": "Covered California is what 'Broken' Healthcare Looks Like - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/California/Covered%20California/Covered-California.png", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "published_time": "2014-11-21T13:18:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5bf\"", "article_summary": "The Daily News reported last month that the California Medical Association said the Covered California on-line directory had several factual errors.\nThe new revelations come as Covered California began on November 15, 2014 enrolling about 1.2 million new and continuing subscribers.\nIt appears regulators knew that without narrow networks, Covered California premium rates would have skyrocketed.\n\u201cUpdating and calibrating the directory is a complex, labor-intensive effort,\u201d Covered California officials replied in a statement.\nLess than two weeks later, the Covered California website\u2019s on-line directory of doctors and hospitals available under for the 12 health-insurance plans listed on the state exchange was taken off-line \u201cdue to errors,\u201d according to a Covered California customer service representative on their 1-800-300-1506 phone line."}
