The program would be privately funded.\n\nBill sponsor Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, pointed to high rates of HIV and AIDS in Miami-Dade County and said the problems have \"massive repercussions' for emergency rooms, first responders and state health-care spending.\n\n\"It's an epidemic, and we have to do something,'' he said. But Sen. Alan Hays, R-Umatilla, expressed concerns about appearing to sanction the use of illegal drugs.\n\n\"I don't want the state of Florida to give them (illegal drug users) any encouragement to continue their habits,'' said Hays, who voted against the bill, along with Sen. Dorothy Hukill, R-Port Orange, and Sen. John Legg, R-Trinity.\n\nSupporting the measure were committee Chairwoman Anitere Flores, R-Miami; Sen. Joseph Abruzzo, D-Boynton Beach; Sen.
