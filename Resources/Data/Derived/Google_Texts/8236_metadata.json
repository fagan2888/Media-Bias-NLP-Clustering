The Buk missile system, which Russia provided to rebels in Ukraine, is widely believed to have been used to shoot down a Malaysian airliner over that troubled country last year.\n\nRussian air force head Viktor Bondarev, speaking to the Russian publication Komsomolskaya Pravda, spun out a scenario in which Russian forces might need heavy duty anti-aircraft batteries.\n\n\u201cLet's imagine a military plane is hijacked and taken to a neighboring country and air strikes are aimed at us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to be ready for this.\u201d\n\nRelated: Americans Agree on little About ISIS \u2013 Except the U.S. Is Losing the War\n\nLet\u2019s pause a moment and unpack that a bit. In Bondarev\u2019s hypothetical, a number of things have to happen. First, a person with the training to fly a high-tech military airplane would have to find a way to steal or hijack one. Second, they would have to find a neighboring country willing to allow them to use it as a base for attacking the Russian military. Third, that person would have to find a way to pilot that plane through the skies of Syria, which are now constantly being patrolled by the Russian air force, and find a suitable Russian ground target.\n\nThe odds of any one of those things happening are vanishingly small. All three would require divine intervention.\n\nHowever, there is an alternative explanation.\n\nBondarev\u2019s comments come just a couple of days after the U.S. announced that it was dispatching as many as a dozen F-15C fighter planes to the region. The F-15C is a model suited exclusively to air-to-air combat. Again, ISIS has no air force or other means of challenging allied air superiority.\n\nRelated: Can\u2019t Cut a $612 Billion Budget By Less than One Percent? Hogwash!\n\nThe U.S. move, in turn, came after it was revealed that Russia had dispatched a number of its own Su-30 air-to-air fighters to Syria.\n\nIn that context, the addition of the two new anti-aircraft missile systems looks like the next step in a gradual military build-up in the region that has nothing to do with fighting either ISIS or the rebels pressuring Assad, and everything to do with the U.S. and Russia building the capacity to defend themselves against each other.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A Russian military officer on Thursday told the domestic media that President Vladimir Putin\u2019s effort to support the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad had expanded to include not just thousands of personnel to man fighter planes and helicopters, but sophisticated anti-aircraft missile, including the Pantsir and Buk systems.", "title": "Putin Moves Anti-Aircraft Missiles into Syria: Why?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/06/Putin-Moves-Anti-Aircraft-Missiles-Syria-Why", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/syria-crisis-town_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/06/Putin-Moves-Anti-Aircraft-Missiles-Syria-Why", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/syria-crisis-town_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A Russian military officer on Thursday told the domestic media that President Vladimir Putin\u2019s effort to support the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad had expanded to include not just thousands of personnel to man fighter planes and helicopters, but sophisticated anti-aircraft missile, including the Pantsir and Buk systems.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Russian air force head Viktor Bondarev, speaking to the Russian publication Komsomolskaya Pravda, spun out a scenario in which Russian forces might need heavy duty anti-aircraft batteries.\nAgain, ISIS has no air force or other means of challenging allied air superiority.\nSecond, they would have to find a neighboring country willing to allow them to use it as a base for attacking the Russian military.\nThird, that person would have to find a way to pilot that plane through the skies of Syria, which are now constantly being patrolled by the Russian air force, and find a suitable Russian ground target.\nThe U.S. move, in turn, came after it was revealed that Russia had dispatched a number of its own Su-30 air-to-air fighters to Syria."}
