Sam Brownback to soften his stance on the matter.\n\nMercy Hospital System plans to close its hospital in Independence, near the Oklahoma border, next month. Mercy spokeswoman Joanne Smith said expanding the program that provides health coverage to poor and disabled Kansans would have brought the hospital about $1.6 million in additional revenue.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s very significant for a small hospital like ours,\u201d she told The Wichita Eagle (http://bit.ly/1LGNcmW).\n\nKansas is one of 20 states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the federal health care law. Rural hospitals already were struggling with declining populations, and, in many cases, their financial situations had become critical because of changes in the way hospitals get reimbursed under the health care law.\n\nCuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements were designed to be offset by additional revenues from the Medicaid expansion. But when Kansas refused to expand Medicaid, its hospitals were hit especially hard.\n\nSupporters of expanding Medicaid said they hope news of the Independence hospital closure will spur the Legislature to extend the program to 150,000 Kansans who now have no health insurance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have the resources to get it done,\u201d Brownback told students at Hutchinson Community College last week. He said Medicaid costs have grown even without expanding the program. The federal government agreed to pay all costs for the new enrollees through 2016, but it will begin lowering its share in 2017. States will pay 10 percent of the costs by 2020.\n\nThe Kansas Hospital Association, which has repeatedly warned lawmakers that hospitals in the state were struggling because of the state\u2019s decision not to expand its Medicaid program, has a ticker on its website showing the amount of federal money Kansas has passed up by not expanding since January 2014. It\u2019s nearing $738 million.\n\n\u201cI think we figured out it\u2019s about 12 dollars a second,\u201d said Tom Bell, the association\u2019s president.\n\nBrownback said the hospital closure isn\u2019t because the state won\u2019t expand Medicaid. \u201cThey should blame it on Obamacare,\u201d he said.\n\nWith a population of more than 9,000, Independence will be the largest community in the state without a hospital. The closest alternatives are in Neodesha, about 16 miles away, and Coffeyville, 20 miles away.\n\nRep. Sue Concannon, a Beloit Republican who is an outspoken supporter of expansion, said she worries that the Independence hospital\u2019s closing is \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, State, Legislature, The Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "A southern Kansas hospital's pending closure, which administrators blame on the state's reluctance to expand Medicaid, hasn't been enough to persuade Gov.
