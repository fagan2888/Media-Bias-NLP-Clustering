First, the Halbig v. Burwell decision by D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, in which two conservative judges used an error in the act\u2019s language to leap to the ludicrous conclusion that a law passed for the very purpose of helping all Americans get health insurance was in fact intended to allow only certain Americans to do so, was a potential body blow. The full D.C. Circuit is widely expected to reverse the two conservative judges en banc sometime this fall, but it could still wind up at the Supreme Court, and with this Supreme Court, you just never know.\n\nSecond, the law isn\u2019t getting any more popular. It\u2019s true that some polls, which ask respondents whether to \u201ckeep and fix\u201d the Affordable Care Act or repeal it, generally produce majorities saying the former. But that doesn\u2019t mean people have warmed to it, and in early August, a Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll generated some inexplicably bad numbers. The basic favorable-unfavorable rating was 37 to 53 percent. That 53 percent represented a staggering eight-point negative spike since June.\n\nThe spike is odd and vexing, since the news of actual substance since June has mostly been very positive. Most obviously, there are the several million\u2014somewhere between 6 million and 12 million, depending on which source you believe\u2014more Americans with health insurance. Those who pay closer attention to such things might have noticed developments like one that happened at the end of July, when the Medicare trustees\u2019 report said that the program\u2019s solvency could extend for an additional four years, to 2030, because of savings achieved through the ACA. But of course, the percentage of Americans who know that is infinitesimal.\n\nSo, yes\u2014jury still out and all that. Perceptions remain terrible. But it\u2019s worth stepping back and looking at reality. And the reality is this: On the evidence available to us so far, nearly everything that the more vocal conservative critics have said about the ACA has been wrong. No. \u201cWrong\u201d implies a statement made in good faith. These charges were often made in the worst possible faith. And they were lies.\n\nAnd\u2014here\u2019s a crazy thought\u2014maybe it\u2019s not just dumb luck that the law seems to be working, especially in the states that took the Medicaid money and set up well-run exchanges. Maybe it\u2019s working because bureaucrats (!) anticipated all the potential problems and planned for them in the writing of the law. Nancy-Ann DeParle, one of the administration\u2019s chief architects of Obamacare, put it this way: \u201cWhen President Obama took office, there were 42 million uninsured Americans, premiums that were unaffordable for families and businesses, a delivery system with the wrong incentives, and unsustainable cost growth. The Affordable Care Act was the product of nearly two decades of bipartisan analysis and discussions among health policy experts and economists to address these problems, and most--indeed, virtually all--of the policies in the law had widespread agreement from these experts.\u201d In other words, writing this law wasn\u2019t guesswork.\n\nHerewith, the five biggest whoppers, with special emphasis on the fifth (and most current one), and how they\u2019re turning out to be so fantastically wrong.\n\n1. Healthy People Won\u2019t Sign Up\n\nOr call this \u201cDeath Spiral Part I.\u201d The idea here, spread lustily by many conservatives since 2010 but especially during last fall\u2019s disastrous roll out, was that healthy people simply wouldn\u2019t buy insurance. Senator Orrin Hatch said last November that \u201cat this pace, the Obama administration will never be able to meet their enrollment goals.\u201d Speaker John Boehner at the time groused that \u201cthe idea that the federal government should come in and create a one size fits all for the entire country never was going to work.\u201d\n\nTheir hope was that only really sick people would sign up, which would lead rates to spike\u2014the much-feared death spiral (more on that later). But lo and behold it turned out that millions of healthy people did want health insurance. As noted above, the precise numbers are hard to come by. But Gallup\u2019s estimate is that the country has roughly 10 million newly insured citizens under Obamacare. And insurance companies report that around 80 to 85 percent of them are paying their premiums (this was another canard spread on the right, that people would sign up but never pay).\n\nIn sum, the law\u2019s advocates were right, and its critics wrong, that health insurance was something normal Americans did in fact want. \u201cThere never was any realistic prospect of a death spiral,\u201d says Jon Gruber of MIT, one of the country\u2019s top health-care economists.\n\n2. You Won\u2019t Be Able to Choose/Keep Your Doctor/Plan\n\nIt\u2019s true that this happened in a limited number of cases\u2014maybe six or seven million people who bought policies on the individual market got cancellation letters from insurers telling them that their plans didn\u2019t meet the minimum requirements under the new law, as NBC News explosively reported last fall.\n\nIt harmed the administration\u2019s credibility, and rightly so. But it didn\u2019t represent much of a change from the past \u2014 the \u201cchurn-rate\u201d in the individual market has always been high. More importantly, no one seems to have followed up with this population to try to figure out what percentage did, in fact, lose coverage and/or have to pay considerably more for a new plan, so we don\u2019t actually know how many of those six or seven million walked away satisfied or dissatisfied.\n\nBut more broadly, in a country where some 260 million people have health insurance, no one has adduced any proof that the ACA has resulted in anything remotely like the cataclysm opponents predicted. In fact, last fall, Factcheck.org rated such claims as outright falsehoods. And Gruber noted to me that if some people are \u201closing\u201d their doctors, it\u2019s often by their own choice, because now that they have so many different coverage options, many are choosing less expensive or so-called \u201climited network\u201d plans. \u201cNo one is making people buy these plans,\u201d Gruber says. \u201cThey\u2019re cheaper alternatives. This is capitalism at its finest. For the right to criticize that is just ludicrous.\u201d\n\n3. Obamacare Will Explode the Federal Deficit\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Still today, Republicans and conservatives are deft at cherry-picking numbers out of official reports that can convey the misleading impression that fiscal watchdogs think the law will be a disaster.\n\nThe truth is that the Congressional Budget Office said in 2010 and reaffirmed this summer that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s budget impact would be positive. The 2010 estimate was that the ACA would cut deficits by $124 billion over its first decade. And in June, CBO head Douglas Elmendorf reported that his experts \u201chave no reason to think that their initial assessment that the ACA would reduce budget deficits was incorrect.\u201d\n\nNow, he throws in a number of caveats, as any bureaucrat should, having to do with the fact that many provisions of the act will kick in later. But Elmendorf sees no hard evidence to suggest that initial estimates were wrong. In fact, says Paul Van de Water of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \u201cThe CBO has estimated that the law will especially reduce the deficit in its second decade, and there\u2019s every reason to believe that those estimates are on course.\u201d\n\n4. Okay, Then, It Will Bust States\u2019 Budgets\n\nTexas\u2019 Rick Perry, Florida\u2019s Rick Scott, and numerous other Republican governors have said that Obamacare will bust their budgets. They\u2019re basing that on the fact that the federal government will pay 100 percent of the costs of Medicaid expansion through 2016, but a little less than that thereafter (although never less than 90 percent). So states are going to have to start shelling out (that is, states that take the money in the first place, which Texas and Florida did not).\n\nThat\u2019s true as far as it goes. But here\u2019s the part Perry and Scott leave out. All states have, of course, an existing relationship with the Medicaid program in which states pay for some portion of the program\u2019s implementation. And a number of studies estimate that in that pool of funds, states will save significant amounts of money that will offset most of the new expenses incurred under Obamacare. For example, Massachusetts found that after implementation of Romneycare, its costs for \u201cuncompensated care\u201d\u2014charity work, basically\u2014decreased considerably. And one study released in June found that uncompensated care costs are already dropping dramatically under the ACA\u2014but only in the states that have taken the Medicaid money.\n\nThus, Perry, Scott, et alia are perhaps agents of a self-fulfilling prophecy: Yes, the ACA might bust the budgets of their states\u2014the states trying to kill off Obamacare. But in the states trying to make it work, the budgetary impact, say most nonpartisan experts, will be a little bit negative, but pretty small.\n\n5. Premium Rates Will Shoot Through the Roof\n\nThis is the big enchilada, and the culmination of the alleged death spiral. The charge here is that the lack of healthy enrollees will force insurers to jack rates up to the heavens, because they\u2019ll have all these sick and dying people on their hands. Premium hikes for this year were all over the map, because they were based on guesswork by the insurance companies about who was enrolled. But now, the companies have hard data. So just watch, critics say, as the rates go boom.\n\nTo be sure, you can go to your Google machine and enter \u201cinsurance premium increases 2015\u201d and find a lot of scary headlines from earlier this year. But you can ignore them all, because no one really knows yet.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. By roughly this past Memorial Day, insurance companies submitted their 2015 rate requests to the states. These could range from tiny to huge\u2014but they\u2019re just requests. State insurance commissioners are now reviewing the requests. Final, approved rates will be made public in November (before November 15, when Obamacare\u2019s second enrollment period begins). By the way, the ACA, for the first time ever, rationalized this \u201crate season,\u201d so that everything happens in almost every state at the same time and in more or less the same way. Before, there was no national logic to the process at all.\n\nAgain, to echo back to what DeParle said: The people writing the law knew all this was coming, and understood very well that rate shock would be a risk. As a result there are numerous provisions in the law designed to guard against it. The most notable one carries an obvious name: \u201crate review.\u201d Under rate review, any request for an increase of 10 percent or more has to be approved by a board, to which the insurer has to offer copious documentation proving that such a hike is necessary. Prior to the ACA, there was no such review.\n\nBefore we go any further, let\u2019s step back. What\u2019s a typical, pre-ACA rate increase? Good question. In 2008 it was 9.9 percent; 2009, 10.8 percent; 2010, 11.7 percent. Within those broad averages, numbers were all over the map: In 2010, rates went up in Kentucky by just 5.5 percent, but in Nebraska by 21.8 percent.\n\nThe numbers released in November will similarly be all over the map. There are just too many variables to say otherwise\u2014how much competition there is among insurers in any given state (in general, it\u2019s increased); what the risk pool looks like in a state (how old, how sick); and other factors. So undoubtedly, there will be some isolated hair-raising increases.\n\nWe don\u2019t know, but we do have some early indications and studies, and they are pretty hopeful. The Health Research Institute at PricewaterhouseCoopers looked at rate requests from insurers that have been filed across 29 states and the District of Columbia and found that the average increase is 8.2 percent, which is impressively low and definitely not \u201csticker shock.\u201d And remember, these are mostly just requests (in Rhode Island and Oregon, the rates are final), which aggressive state insurance commissioners might seek to make still lower. \"So far, the filings suggest modest increases for 2015, well below the double digit hikes many feared,\u201d says Ceci Connolly, the managing director of the institute.\n\nAll the above is about the individual market\u2014people buying insurance on their own, either through state exchanges or the federal marketplace. For a host of reasons, that\u2019s the best barometer by which to measure the law\u2019s success. But there are other markets, too, notably the small-business market, where employers with fewer than 50 employees buy for their workers. There has been some grumbling among conservatives that this \u201csmall-group\u201d market will take an especially hard hit, but that seems not to be the case either.\n\nAgain, there will be great variance in the small-group market, according to Jon Kingsdale, of the Wakely Consulting Group in Boston. He says the biggest impact will be that, because of some technical changes made by the law, employers with older employees and larger families will likely see rates increase, while employers with younger workers and smaller families may see rates decrease. But overall, says Kingsdale, \u201cI do not believe there will be a significant jump in rate in the small-group market, because the underlying body of people being insured is not so different from the prior year.\u201d\n\nOne last point on rates: This is another area where Republican saboteurs of the law can, if they choose to, make it not work. That is, Republican state insurance commissioners can approve big premium hikes just to make the law look bad. Says Sally McCarty, the former Indiana state insurance commissioner, now at the Georgetown Center on Health Insurance Reforms: \u201cStates that are in earnest about implementing the law will likely see lower increases, and states not so concerned about seeing the law succeed will see higher increases.\u201d\n\nSo there we have it. Yes, it\u2019s too early for firm conclusions. But certainly the preponderance of the evidence so far is that the apocalyptic predictions just aren\u2019t coming true at all. Granted, there\u2019s a lot of other news going on lately, but this is the real reason why Obamacare has kind of dropped out of the news cycle: Republicans aren\u2019t bashing it quite so much anymore, because even they see it\u2019s kind of working.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, U.S. News, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201408170945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/michael-tomasky", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama US News Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Five Biggest Lies About Obamacare", "tags": "barack_obama_u_snewsaffordablecareact,Obamacare:Industryterm,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Despite its continued unpopularity, the Affordable Care Act has been a success, and conservative predictions of \u2018death spirals\u2019 and huge premium spikes just haven\u2019t come true.", "title": "The Five Biggest Lies About Obamacare", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/17/the-five-biggest-lies-about-obamacare.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/08/17/the-five-biggest-lies-about-obamacare/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1408324604077.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "Despite its continued unpopularity, the Affordable Care Act has been a success, and conservative predictions of \u2018death spirals\u2019 and huge premium spikes just haven\u2019t come true.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics.michael-tomasky", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Michael Tomasky", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-08-17T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/michael-tomaskyhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/08/17/the-five-biggest-lies-about-obamacare", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Five Biggest Lies About Obamacare\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/17/the-five-biggest-lies-about-obamacare.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/08/17/the-five-biggest-lies-about-obamacare/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46944153.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/08/17/the-five-biggest-lies-about-obamacare\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-17T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Michael Tomasky\",\"tags\":[\"barack_obama_u_snewsaffordablecareact\",\"Industryterm\",\"politics\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/m/michael-tomasky", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd9eb\"", "article_summary": "In sum, the law\u2019s advocates were right, and its critics wrong, that health insurance was something normal Americans did in fact want.\nBut lo and behold it turned out that millions of healthy people did want health insurance.\nMost obviously, there are the several million\u2014somewhere between 6 million and 12 million, depending on which source you believe\u2014more Americans with health insurance.\nThat is, Republican state insurance commissioners can approve big premium hikes just to make the law look bad.\nBut Gallup\u2019s estimate is that the country has roughly 10 million newly insured citizens under Obamacare."}
