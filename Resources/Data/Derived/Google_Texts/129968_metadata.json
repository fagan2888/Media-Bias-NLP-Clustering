We spoke in the broadest possible language available in order to tell eternal cosmic truths about morality. Dom Raso, former Navy Seal, and NRA commentator knows what I\u2019m talking about. He blasts the propagandists on the left in his latest clip for NRA News for their agenda-driven insistence on specificity.\n\n\u201cWhen someone commits a murder, it used to be a murder right?\u201d Raso, the only semiotician in the history of the world to dead lift 600 lbs says. \u201cNow they race to label anything with a gun as a shooting. Because they know how much attention they\u2019re going to get with that word.\u201d\n\nI know I personally only tune into news coverage about horrifyingly violent events when the word shooting comes up. Otherwise it\u2019s like zzzzzz. Ten dead? Where\u2019s the gun? And why do we call them rapes, come to think of it? It\u2019s simply an assault. Are we going to criminalize all sex acts now just because some of them are used to cause pain? Just doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nHe goes on: \u201cThink about the difference between a shooting and a murder. In one you have shooter, and in the other one a murderer.\u201d\n\nOkay, but what\u2019s the difference?\n\n\u201cAll the sudden, instead of focusing on the real common link between all acts of evil, the evil person who did it, we are subconsciously told to think about the tool they used instead,\u201d Ferdinand de Squat Rack explains.\n\nOne evil person is at the heart of all acts of evil?!\n\n\u201cEvil is the problem, the tool is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nFunny, I was just thinking the same thing vis a vis tools.\n\nNuance, you see, is for people trying to sell you something, which is why gun advocates never make a big deal about the specificity of a gun in question used in a shooting. Calling a specific brand of murder a shooting is bad, but anything less than detailing the exact make and model of the type of gun used is an affront, not only to the 2nd Amendment, but also the very foundation of language. Or something.\n\nRaso then goes on to explain the specific type of gun used in what he calls \u201cthe Navy Yard shooting.\u201d Wait, I thought we weren\u2019t supposed to call them shootings? You see how insidious the left\u2019s campaign on language has become? Raso can\u2019t even refrain from using its jargon in his own editorial about not using its jargon. It\u2019s almost like the things he\u2019s saying here don\u2019t have any meaning whatsoever.\n\nWatch below, via NRA News:\n\n[h/t Gawker]\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Luke O\u2019Neil is a journalist and blogger in Boston.
