By now you\u2019ve learned how to bulk up your savings, cut the fat from your budget, and boost your earnings. Today, taking care of your health.\n\nYour physical health and your financial health go hand in hand, especially as rising deductibles and increased cost sharing leave you on the hook for more expenses when you get sick.\n\nPlus, your pocketbook takes a hit when you\u2019re overweight: The annual cost of carrying extra pounds\u2014including medical expenses, sick leave, and even gas for the car\u2014is $524 for women and $432 for men, according to a 2010 study by the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services. And Fidelity estimates that a couple who retire in good health will spend 20% less on medical care than a couple in poor health will.\n\nYou know what helps: exercise, sleep, a healthy weight, and regular checkups. Here\u2019s how to make it easier to do the right thing.\n\n1. Don\u2019t Pass Up Freebies\n\nUnder Obamacare, annual physicals and a long list of valuable preventive care, from cholesterol tests to colonoscopies, are fully covered by insurance, with no out-of-pocket costs.\n\n2. Be Your Own Doctor\n\nNot quite, but tech has made staying on top of your health easier\u2014especially important with a chronic condition such as high blood pressure. The Health app that\u2019s part of the new Apple operating system unveiled last fall and the Health Tracker app for Android devices allow you to upload, input, and share health and fitness data.\n\n3. Let Your Scale Motivate You\n\nUniversity of Minnesota researchers found that dieters who weighed themselves daily lost an average of 12 pounds in two years; weekly scale watchers lost only six. The once-a-day group was also less likely to regain the weight. Need help? Our sister publication, CookingLightDiet.com, offers healthy eating customized meal plans.\n\n4. Make Tracking a No-Brainer\n\nPeople who count their steps are more motivated to work out. But the novelty of fitness trackers like the Fitbit can quickly wear off. More than half of owners stop using them, a recent University of Pennsylvania survey found; a third bail within a month.\n\nIf that\u2019s you, add a tracking app such as RunKeeper or Moves to your phone instead. \u201cMany people carry smart-phones everywhere,\u201d says Mitesh S. Patel, an internist and researcher at the Wharton School. \u201cIf we really wanted to improve the health of the population, smartphone trackers are an easier place to start.\u201d\n\nPrevious:\n\nNext:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Better physical health can be a boon to your finances.
