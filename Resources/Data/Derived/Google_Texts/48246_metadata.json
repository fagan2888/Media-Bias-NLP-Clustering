Ryan\u2019s newest Republican budget may have redrawn the battle lines for the 2014 election, detailing what his party could do with complete control of Congress and allowing Democrats to broaden the political terrain beyond health care and the narrower issues of the minimum wage and unemployment benefits.\n\nMr. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman and a possible White House contender in 2016, laid out a budget plan that cuts $5 trillion in spending over the next decade. He said it would bring federal spending and taxes into balance by 2024, through steep cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, and the total repeal of the Affordable Care Act just as millions are reaping the benefits of the law.\n\nDefense spending would increase. Domestic programs would be reduced to the lowest levels since modern government accounting. And Medicare would be converted into a \u201cpremium support\u201d system, where people 65 and older could buy private insurance with federal subsidies instead of government-paid health care.\n\n\u201cWe need to be a proposition party, not just an opposition party,\u201d said Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. \u201cWe believe we owe it to the country to offer an alternative to the status quo. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\n\nEven with those tough political choices, the budget would balance in 2024 only because Mr. Ryan is assuming his cuts would prompt a burst of economic growth to raise tax revenues above what independent economists forecast. He also does not adjust the government\u2019s revenue ledger to reflect the cost of repealing the health care law\u2019s tax increases and Medicare cuts, which could total $2 trillion.\n\n\u201cThis is what elections are about,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. \u201cBudgets are the clearest roadmaps for discovering what people\u2019s priorities are.\u201d\n\nThe Ryan budget will be formally drafted on Wednesday in the Budget Committee and brought to a House vote on Friday \u2014 if Republican leaders can muster the 217 votes to pass it over the concerns of moderates who say it goes too far and conservatives who say it does not go far enough. Because Senate Democrats do not intend to even draft a budget this year, the Ryan plan will serve more as a political manifesto than a legislative roadmap for the 113th Congress.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt is not fair, and it is not acceptable to simply sit by and accept the status quo, as Democrats have chosen to do, time and time again,\u201d said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140401103023, "twitter": {"description": "Representative Paul D.
