How that next Speaker makes a silk purse out of a sow\u2019s ear come December is going to be extremely difficult.\u201d\n\nHoagland, a top official with the Bipartisan Policy Center, noted that the Freedom Caucus \u2013 the conservative Republicans who helped force Boehner out \u2013 \u201cis going to be even more powerful in terms of what happens with the next negotiations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis resets everything,\u201d added Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nRelated: Why Boehner\u2019s Resignation Could Be Bad for the Market\n\nBoehner (R-OH) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) thought they might have a way out of the bind by pursuing a duel track and offering up two separate continuing resolutions to keep the government operating. One would allow the Planned Parenthood funding and one would deny it, giving anti-abortion forces the opportunity to vote against funding the organization in the wake of videos showing officials discussing the sale and disposal of aborted fetal body parts and tissue.\n\nHowever, some conservative House and Senate members balked at this approach, saying it would be little more than a show vote that would allow spending for Planned Parenthood to be retained in the continuing resolution.?\n\nRep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC), who signed a letter opposing any measure containing funding for Planned Parenthood, told The Washington Post yesterday, \u201cI have not changed my mind about anything.\u201d\n\nBoehner has spent the last four years negotiating with the White House and Democrats with a gun to his head held by angry conservatives who were spoiling for fights with Obama over an array of issues, from funding of the Affordable Care Act to the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal to the current dustup over Planned Parenthood. With members of the now dominant right wing group called the Freedom Caucus now likely celebrating the speaker\u2019s decision to resign, some of them may be energized to continue the fight with the administration \u2013 even if it means the second government shutdown in two years.\n\nRelated: Countdown to Yet Another Government Shutdown?\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) expressed shock and disappointment this morning that Boehner may have been forced from the speakership, and warned that the path to a short-term and long-term budget deal for the coming fiscal year just got a lot harder.\n\nShe said the resignation was a stark sign of \u201cthe disarray\u201d among House Republicans and \u201ca demonstration of their obsession with shutting down government at the expense of women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s $3.99 trillion overall budget for fiscal 2016 would lift the automatic spending caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act and provide for an additional $37 billion in domestic spending, including more for child care, health and college assistance, and a similar increase for defense spending to battle ISIS and address Russian aggression in the Ukraine. Congressional Republicans support raising the cap on defense spending but have opposed doing the same for domestic programs.\n\nRelated: Cutting Planned Parenthood Could Cost Taxpayers $130 Million\n\nObama is digging in his heels on the budget \u2013 both in opposing any cuts in Planned Parenthood but also insisting on substantially more for his prized domestic initiatives. Whoever succeeds Boehner as speaker will inherit the task of negotiating the final deal later this year.\n\nThose talks would have to determine what the \u201ctop line\u201d overall spending would be, how to finance the additional spending or make offsetting cuts in other programs and amendments or riders by Nov. 20, according to Pelosi.\n\nHarrison said Boehner\u2019s resignation makes the prospects of such far-reaching deals even taking place \u201cvery uncertain\u201d as \u201cit\u2019s not clear who the negotiating partners would be\u201d to cut the deal.\n\nPelosi said that Boehner\u2019s resignation would be \u201cmore than a distraction\u201d from achieving a final budget deal, but that much will depend on how well his successor can work with the White House, Senate leaders and rank and file members.\n\nMoreover, she said, Republicans may feel public pressure to work out a final agreement without a government shutdown.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s abrupt resignation on Friday \u2013 less than a week before th", "title": "Boehner Resignation Increases the Prospects for a Government Shutdown", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/25/Boehner-Resignation-Increases-Prospects-Government-Shutdown", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/federal_government_shutdown.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/25/Boehner-Resignation-Increases-Prospects-Government-Shutdown", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/federal_government_shutdown.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s abrupt resignation on Friday \u2013 less than a week before th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Whoever succeeds Boehner as speaker will inherit the task of negotiating the final deal later this year.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner\u2019s abrupt resignation on Friday \u2013 less than a week before the start of a new fiscal year -- has sparked a crisis atmosphere and uncertainty on Capitol Hill that further fuels speculation about another government shutdown.\nRelated: Cutting Planned Parenthood Could Cost Taxpayers $130 MillionObama is digging in his heels on the budget \u2013 both in opposing any cuts in Planned Parenthood but also insisting on substantially more for his prized domestic initiatives.\nMoreover, she said, Republicans may feel public pressure to work out a final agreement without a government shutdown.\nHarrison said Boehner\u2019s resignation makes the prospects of such far-reaching deals even taking place \u201cvery uncertain\u201d as \u201cit\u2019s not clear who the negotiating partners would be\u201d to cut the deal."}
