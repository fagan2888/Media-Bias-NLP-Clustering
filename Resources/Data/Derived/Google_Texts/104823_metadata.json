John Fleming (R-La.), who made the comment earlier this month.\n\nOther Republicans have warned the law will lead to \"Armageddon,\" he said, and one state representative called it \"as destructive to personal and individual liberties as the Fugitive Slave Act.\"\n\nThe latter comment came from New Hampshire state Rep. Bill O\u2019Brien.\n\n\"Think about that. Affordable health care is worse than a law that lets slaveowners get their runaway slaves back. I mean, these are quotes,\" Obama said. \"I am not making this stuff up.\"\n\nBetter yet, the president continued, one Republican said the health care law has to be repealed \"before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens.\"\n\nThat quote came from Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.).\n\n\"I have to say that is from six months ago,\" Obama said. \"I just want to point out that we still have women. We still have children. And we still have senior citizens.\"\n\nHe added, \"All of this would be funny if it weren't so crazy.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: The Second-Term Curse The Second-Term Curse\n\n1 of 9 President Barack Obama Obama's second-term agenda had to take a backseat after several scandals caught the media's attention in May.
