Dan Sullivan\u2019s fight to combat federal overregulation (\u201cRegulations in an imperfect people\u2019s democracy,\u201d Jan. 1, 2016).\n\nThe Alaska Chamber supports public regulation and regulatory reforms that encourage responsible development of Alaska\u2019s communities and natural resources. Topping both the Chamber\u2019s state and federal lists of policy positions is an entire category of initiatives advocating for improved regulatory efficiency.\n\nI agree with Mr. Moniak that many desirable regulations are intended to keep our citizens safe. As the voice of Alaskan business, I agree that reasonable, navigable regulatory processes are important to protect our citizens, communities and employer companies. And not just in Alaska, but for our nation as a whole.\n\nAs Alaskans, we value our lands and waters perhaps more than any other state in the union. For many of us, Alaska is a lifestyle and a passion as much as it is a home. We breathe the air. We drink the water. We eat the food, and have an expectation that public structures will support our livelihoods.\n\nThe problem comes when public agencies overregulate as the federal government is doing today. When it was first published in 1936, the Federal Register, which contains a daily digest of proposed regulations from agencies, final rules and notices, was 2,620 pages. By the end of 2014, the Federal Register had ballooned to 77,687 pages.\n\nAccording to the Small Business Administration, regulatory enforcement and compliance costs currently come to roughly $1.8 trillion a year. That\u2019s equal to about $15,000 for each American household. That is a problem, and one that lawmakers on both sides of the isle have been struggling with for years.\n\nPresident Barack Obama himself said in 2012, \u201cSmart rules can save lives and keep us safe, but there are some regulations that don\u2019t make sense and cost too much.\u201d\n\nLuckily, there are successful models that we can follow to start our country on the path of purposeful, efficient regulation. Sen. Sullivan, R-Alaska, in consultation with the Alaska Chamber, has introduced just such a bill.\n\nSen. Sullivan\u2019s bill is based on a regulatory system already in place in Canada and Great Britain and is successful to the point that Great Britain has now expanded its initial policy. If it\u2019s passes, we believe that it will go far to boost our sagging economy and encourage entrepreneurship in our state and our country to flourish once again.\n\nMr. Moniak points out that \u201cthe $1.8 trillion figure isn\u2019t all waste and inefficiency.\u201d And he is right on that account. That\u2019s why Alaska\u2019s business community supports a system designed to allow regulators to cull wasteful, inefficient regulations as more appropriate protections are put into place.\n\nSen. Sullivan\u2019s RED Tape Act \u2014 like the successful programs deployed in Canada and Great Britain \u2014 does just that.\n\n\u2022 Curtis Thayer is the president and CEO of Alaska Chamber of Commerce in Anchorage.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Opinion, CURTIS THAYER, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Local, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Sports, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "As the president of the Alaska Chamber of Commerce, I read with interest Rich Moniak's criticism of Sen.
