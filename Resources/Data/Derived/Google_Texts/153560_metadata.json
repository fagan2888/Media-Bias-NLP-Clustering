During his time in Denver, he\u2019d been asked to do studio work with TNT and TBS during the NBA playoffs.\n\nAn entertainment agent saw Ellis and put a full-court press on to get him to transition to fulltime studio work when his playing days were done. Ellis resisted. But years after retiring, in 2009, he was ready to take the leap. He auditioned for ESPN.\n\n\u201cAnd they really liked my work in the audition,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThey brought me on, and it\u2019s been so much fun ever since.\u201d\n\nStith retired in 2002 and, like Ellis, was ready to get away from basketball after a life of sacrificing his body and being away from his family.\n\n\u201cI really just wanted to let my batteries recharge, take care of my body and get back to a point where I could enjoy my quality of life,\u201d Stith said.\n\nThat was the plan. But\u2026\n\nHis old high school, Brunswick in Lawrenceville, Va., called. They\u2019d fallen upon difficult times and asked their former star player to be the coach.\n\n\u201cI told them absolutely not,\u201d Stith said, laughing. \u201cI told them, I\u2019m sure they had plenty of candidates and they would find a good coach. They told me, they actually had a very shortlist. I asked how short the list was. They said: \u2018One. And that\u2019s you.\u2019 \u201c\n\nHe talked it over with his family. They gave him the go-ahead, and he took the job. His Brunswick teams made seven consecutive trips to the state title game, losing the first four but winning the last three.\n\nColleges came calling. But Old Dominion, headed by one of Stith\u2019s old coaches, Jeff Jones, got him.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today,\u201d Stith said.\n\nStith\u2019s two sons are both college level players. Brandon plays for East Carolina. B.J. will follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and play for Virginia in the fall.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "LaPhonso Ellis, Bryant Stith trade in NBA for college madness", "title": "LaPhonso Ellis, Bryant Stith trade in NBA for college madness", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/15/laphonso-ellis-bryant-stith-trade-in-nba-for-college-madness/", "image": {"width": 436, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140316__LaPhonso-Ellisp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140316__LaPhonso-Ellisp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-16T01:24:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T16:24:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "During his time in Denver, he\u2019d been asked to do studio work with TNT and TBS during the NBA playoffs.\nAn entertainment agent saw Ellis and put a full-court press on to get him to transition to fulltime studio work when his playing days were done.\nLaPhonso Ellis and Bryant Stith are in their time of the year.\nEllis analyzes NCAA games for ESPN, a job he unknowingly started to prepare for when he was playing for the Nuggets.\nFor two members of the 1993-94 Nuggets, what used to be sleepy NBA nights in March have turned into frenzied postseason college basketball."}
