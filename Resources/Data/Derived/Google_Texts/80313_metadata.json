The company\u2019s database includes 15 million people with private insurance.\n\nThe medications, largely stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall, are still most commonly prescribed to boys ages 12 to 18. In 2012 7.8 percent of boys ages 4 to 18 were taking an ADHD medication \u2014 that\u2019s more than twice the rate of girls (3.5 percent). But in young adulthood, ages 19 to 25, men\u2019s use plummets, while young women\u2019s rate increases. From ages 26 to 64, use of ADHD medications by women exceeds that of men.\n\nTo find out more about what\u2019s going on, we talked with Dr. David Muzina, a psychiatrist who is the vice president and national practice leader for neuroscience at Express Scripts. This is an edited version of our conversation.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others have reported increases in use of ADHD medications in children, but this increase in adults seems huge. What\u2019s happening there?\n\nADHD is no longer just a childhood condition. Many of the children and adolescents who were diagnosed 10 years ago are now adults, and we know that about 1 in 3 kids carry ADHD with them into adulthood. I think that\u2019s one reason why the numbers in adults are going up. And there\u2019s been progressively more attention on ADHD in the public sphere. More adults recognize the symptoms: \u201cOh, I\u2019m not concentrating, I\u2019m not focusing. Maybe I have ADHD.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s overdiagnosis, overtreatment and perhaps misuse. Frankly, many prescribers mistake a patient\u2019s objective reporting of symptoms like being forgetful for ADHD. Are there life stressors, is there a medical condition, is there depression or anxiety that explains this better?\n\nYou\u2019re seeing a drop-off in young men using ADHD drugs after age 18. Why?\n\nMen are less likely to go to the doctor, and take the meds, and fill the meds. We\u2019re thinking about the 18-, 19-year-old who\u2019s going off to college. They\u2019re going to the doctor only once or twice a year.\n\nBut then why this big spike among women the same age, with 4 percent of young women taking ADHD meds in 2012?\n\nIt\u2019s been known for a long, long time that if girls have ADHD they are more likely to have the inattention form, not the hyperactive, aggressive, disruptive form. Perhaps that difference in how ADHD can look is why the diagnosis is missed in girls. They may be quietly suffering and having trouble in school, but they\u2019re not disruptive.\n\nThey move on into life, where those inattentive symptoms may reveal themselves as academic and social pressures compound. Now it\u2019s becoming more of an issue.\n\nAnd lastly, we know that women in the United States are increasingly juggling more and more and more. Women still tend to have the majority of the responsibilities at home, particularly when families start up. That elevation of pressure and stress can either produce symptoms like ADHD, or that additional stress can express the underlying ADHD that previously had not been diagnosed.\n\nStimulant drugs like Ritalin are pretty well-known for improving energy and concentration, even if you don\u2019t have ADHD. Could that be a factor here?\n\nThere may be an element here of medication being prescribed off-label to help with that, as well as the desire to suppress appetite and lose weight. It\u2019s totally not approved for that. But it\u2019s popularized and perhaps glorified to some extent in popular media, including women\u2019s magazines. I\u2019ve seen references to using these medications for weight loss.\n\nIs this the tip of the iceberg?\n\nI think we\u2019re into the iceberg. We forecast that use of ADHD medications will be 25 percent higher in five years. That\u2019s the main reason why Express Scripts decided to do this deeper analysis, to see what\u2019s driving the trend. If we see patterns from prescriptions that are coming in, we can intervene if someone shouldn\u2019t be on this medication or if we suspect fraud. We\u2019re beginning to put our brains around tightening those monitoring systems.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unlike boys whose use drops with age, young women have higher rates of ADHD drug use than girls 12 to 18.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Use of ADHD Drugs Increasing Fastest Among Young Women\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/03\\/14\\/use-of-adhd-drugs-increasing-fastest-among-young-women\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-14 11:15:31\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-03-14 14:22:26\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":18138,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/03\\/177861835-e1394820572797.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Unlike boys whose use drops with age, young women have higher rates of ADHD drug use than girls 12 to 18.", "title": "Use of ADHD Drugs Increasing Fastest Among Young Women", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/03/14/use-of-adhd-drugs-increasing-fastest-among-young-women/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-14-at-11.20.07-AM-300x347.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5e7\"", "article_summary": "But then why this big spike among women the same age, with 4 percent of young women taking ADHD meds in 2012?\nBy Nancy Shute, NPRUse of ADHD drugs continues to rise in the United States, but the group whose use is increasing the most may come as a surprise: young women.\nFrom ages 26 to 64, use of ADHD medications by women exceeds that of men.\nWe forecast that use of ADHD medications will be 25 percent higher in five years.\nBut in young adulthood, ages 19 to 25, men\u2019s use plummets, while young women\u2019s rate increases."}
