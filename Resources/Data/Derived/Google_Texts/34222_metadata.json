Cupp marked the debut of her new digital series \u201cOutside with Insiders,\u201d while Maeve Reston also debuted her \u201c#MaeveWest\u201d series.\n\nMembers of the CNN\u2019s political team mingled with Cupp and Reston as the first episodes of their online series played on surrounding televisions. Reston\u2019s newborn daughter, a favorite in the crowd, observed the scene from her mothers\u2019 arms.\n\nCupp told The Hill filming her show has been \u201cso much fun.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT \u201cI had this idea to take some of my political friends hunting, fishing or shooting, because that\u2019s what I like to do, and I know a lot of other people like to do it too. So I thought, let\u2019s go out and I bet we can have different kinds of political conversations when we\u2019re outside, not in suits and not in the studio,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the premiere of \u201cOutside with Insiders,\u201d Cupp shoots skeet with 2016 GOP presidential hopeful Scott Walker in his home state of Wisconsin.\n\nCupp said she enjoyed the chance to speak to Walker \u201cwith his guard down, doing something we love to do over hours, not 15 minutes in a studio.\u201d\n\nThe two talked politics, but also music, with Walker discussing his love of Van Halen. He said that he \u201clistens to \u2018Panama\u2019 to get pumped up.\u201d\n\nAsked his opinion of the other Republican candidates, Walker said that he \u201clikes Marco [Rubio] a lot.\u201d\n\nThe party also marked the debut of Reston\u2019s digital series \u201c#MaeveWest.\u201d The national political reporter covers West Coast news when she isn\u2019t on the campaign trail.\n\nReston profiled a Los Angeles pi\u00f1ata shop owner whose business recently boomed after she created a Donald Trump pi\u00f1ata. She also spoke with Mexican immigrants and recorded footage of their attacks on Trump\u2019s pi\u00f1ata.\n\nNo stranger to the lighter side of politics, Reston started the #campaignfashionreport during her time on the campaign trail, tweeting pictures of politicians\u2019 best outfits.\n\nThe launch of Eric Bradner\u2019s nightly newsletter \u201cNightcap\u201d was also celebrated at the event.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "CNN celebrated the premiere of Cupp's \"Outside with Insiders.\"", "description": "CNN celebrated the premiere of Cupp's \"Outside with Insiders.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "In The Know"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "CNN celebrated the premiere of Cupp's \"Outside with Insiders.\"", "title": "S.E.
