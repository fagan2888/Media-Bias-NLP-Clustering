Senator Bernie Sanders is officially running for president. The Vermont Independent is running as a Democrat, making him the second to officially jump into that race after Hillary Clinton.

The AP tweeted out the first confirmation of Sanders’ run, a day before he makes it official:

Sanders also spoke to USA Today and said he’s not just in the race to make a statement; he’s in it for the long haul:

“I am running in this election to win. We’ve got a long path forward. Most people in America have never heard of Bernie Sanders. More than 90% of Americans have heard of Hillary Clinton. … I will absolutely be out-spent. But I do believe we have a chance to raise significant amounts of money through small, individual contributions.”

He believes there is enough support for people “being prepared to take on the billionaire class.”
