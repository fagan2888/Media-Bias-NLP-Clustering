Adam Schiff announced today he plans to introduce federal legislation that would ban the captivity of orcas.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is very strong that the psychological and physical harm done to these magnificent animals far outweighs any benefits reaped from their display,\u201d said Schiff, D-Burbank. \u201cWe cannot be responsible stewards of our natural environment and propagate messages about the importance of animal welfare when our behaviors do not reflect our principles.\u201d\n\nSchiff said his proposed Orca Responsibility and Care Advancement (ORCA) Act would phase out the captivity of orcas, so no future generations of killer whales can be kept on display.\n\nThe legislation would effectively end the famed Shamu killer whale shows at SeaWorld parks in San Diego and around the country.\n\nJill Kermes, senior corporate affairs officers for SeaWorld Entertainment, said the proposed legislation is misguided, saying SeaWorld and other science-based groups \u201care part of the solution, not the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cKiller whales at SeaWorld are healthy and thriving and through conservation and rescue efforts as well as significant work to advance the scientific understanding of orcas and other marine mammals, SeaWorld is a leader in protecting and preserving these species,\u201d Kermes said.\n\n\u201cWe have not captured a whale in the wild in 35 years \u2014 and we will not do so,\u201d Kermes said. \u201cThrough our work with scientists, conservation leaders and the government, SeaWorld is ensuring that all animals in human care are treated with the dignity and respect they require and deserve.\u201d\n\nThe San Diego theme park already took a hit last month when the California Coastal Commission approved an expansion of its killer whale exhibit but ordered an end to the breeding of captive orcas at the park. That ban would also eventually phase out the Shamu exhibit.\n\nSeaWorld plans to challenge the commission\u2019s ruling.\n\nSeaWorld has suffered dipping attendance since the release of the documentary film \u201cBlackfish,\u201d which focused on the treatment of orcas at the park.\n\nOn Monday, SeaWorld Entertainment CEO Joel Manby is expected to announce plans for a new attraction designed to boost attendance \u2014 possibly using some of the $100 million the park planned to spend on the expanded orca tanks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In what could be another major blow to SeaWorld, Rep.
