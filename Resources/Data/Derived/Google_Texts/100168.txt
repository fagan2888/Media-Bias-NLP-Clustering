The 2013 Wimbledon finalist Sabine Lisicki has split with coach Martina Hingis days out from this year’s tournament, the German player announced on her Facebook page.

Lisicki, who injured a wrist and had to quit a French Open second-round match, made the announcement the weekend before the start at the All England Club.

The split was couched in terms of a ‘‘mutual agreement’’. The player said ‘‘different concepts’’ on her tennis had also played a role in the parting.

Even as the coaching relationship changed, Lisicki hinted she and the Swiss might still try doubles again.

‘‘I wish her the best of luck, and maybe we are playing doubles together here and there,’’ said the world No.19, who lost the Wimbledon singles final a year ago to retired Frenchwoman Marion Bartoli.

Lisicki and her 33-year-old coach played four events together in 2014, winning the Miami title but not going past the second round in the other three.

They last took to the court together in Rome in May.

Lisicki will continue to be guided by her father during Wimbledon after the split with Hingis.

It was the second short-term coaching job for Hingis, who spent several months in early 2013 with Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

Hingis has a wildcard into the Wimbledon doubles, teaming up with Russian Vera Zvonareva.
