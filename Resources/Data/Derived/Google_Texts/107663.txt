An estimated 36 percent of women in the U.S. report having experienced intimate partner violence (IPV), also called domestic violence, but among HIV positive women 55 percent report such experiences.

A new Kaiser Family Foundation analysis looks at opportunities to address IPV in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that could help women who are HIV positive or at risk for HIV. The analysis, HIV, Intimate Partner Violence and Women: New Opportunities Under the Affordable Care Act , looks at the law’s broad changes expanding access to affordable health coverage, and its specific provisions designed to protect individuals who have experienced IPV.

Editor’s Note: This analysis has been cross-posted from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Additionally, an update on federal efforts to address the intersection of HIV/AIDS and IPV among women and girls can be found on the AIDS.gov Blog
