Rafaelgilo via Wikimedia Commons\n\nSAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico has reported its first case of Zika, a mosquito-borne virus that has been spreading across South America and the Caribbean and has been linked by Brazilian authorities to a serious birth defect, a U.S. Congressman said on Thursday.\n\nPedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, said in a statement his office had been in touch with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which had confirmed the single case of Zika on the island.\n\n\"There is no reason for alarm, and the public should continue to take common sense steps to avoid mosquito bites, like using repellent and wearing long pants and shirts,\" Pierluisi said.\n\nZika was first detected in Africa in the 1940s but was unknown in the Americas until last year.\n\nThe mosquito-transmitted disease has been confirmed in countries including Brazil, Panama, Venezuela, El Salvador, Mexico, Suriname, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Guatemala and Paraguay, according to public health officials.\n\nBrazilian authorities in November linked Zika to a surge in babies born with microcephaly, a birth defect that seriously limits a child's mental and physical abilities.\n\nBrazil has reported nearly 2,000 cases of babies born with microcephaly, or unusually small brains, the World Health Organization (WHO) said this month.\n\nThe WHO said the cause of the outbreak in Brazil had yet to be determined.\n\nBetween three and 12 days after being bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus, three out of four people come down with symptoms including mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, headaches and joint pain.\n\n(Reporting by Nick Brown in San Juan and Victoria Cavaliere in Los Angeles; Editing by Robert Birsel)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "puerto, rico, reports, first, case, zika, virus, spread, mosquitoes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, says there's no reason for alarm after the first case of a mosquito-borne virus is confirmed.", "title": "Puerto Rico Reports First Case Of Zika Virus", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/puerto-rico-reports-first-case-zika-virus-spread-mosquitoes-367578", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/01/zika-virus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, says there's no reason for alarm after the first case of a mosquito-borne virus is confirmed.", "title": "Puerto Rico Reports First Case Of Zika Virus", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/puerto-rico-reports-first-case-zika-virus-spread-mosquitoes-367578", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/01/zika-virus.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/01/zika-virus.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-01-02T10:15:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-02T10:32:02-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, says there's no reason for alarm after the first case of a mosquito-borne virus is confirmed."}, "article_summary": "Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, says there's no reason for alarm after the first case of a mosquito-borne virus is confirmed.\nPedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, said in a statement his office had been in touch with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which had confirmed the single case of Zika on the island.\nRafaelgilo via Wikimedia CommonsSAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico has reported its first case of Zika, a mosquito-borne virus that has been spreading across South America and the Caribbean and has been linked by Brazilian authorities to a serious birth defect, a U.S.\nZika was first detected in Africa in the 1940s but was unknown in the Americas until last year.\n(Reporting by Nick Brown in San Juan and Victoria Cavaliere in Los Angeles; Editing by Robert Birsel)"}
