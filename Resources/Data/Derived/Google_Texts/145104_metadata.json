The Aug. 6 announcement comes in the wake of the Taliban admitting that Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar was killed two years earlier. In September 2014, Ghazi had officially stated that the IMU was siding with the Islamic State, yet withheld direct allegiance at that time.\n\nEarlier this year, an Uzbek leader of a cell claiming to be part of the IMU, Sadullah Urgenji, stated that his group was changing their affiliation from the Afghan Taliban to Islamic State due to the failure of Omar to make an appearance after 13 years.\n\nThe change of allegiance to Islamic State is, in light of Omar\u2019s death, unsurprising, though notable for a group that has traditionally been strong allies of both al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban. Islamic State has repeatedly attempted to turn groups formerly affiliated with al Qaeda to their own side, particularly in Central Asia, which positions them to take advantage of the announcement of Omar\u2019s death.\n\nThis is particularly the case since Islamic State had already used rumors of Omar\u2019s death as a recruiting tactic. With recent events, it is very likely that the Taliban were keeping the news of Omar\u2019s death secret in order to prevent groups such as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan from leaving the Taliban fold. Having now been caught covering up Omar\u2019s death, however, the Taliban is likely to see that effort backfire.\n\nSean MacCormac is a research analyst at the Center for Security Policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Aug. 6th, the Pakistan-based jihadist organization Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), previously covered here, released a video of its leader Usmon Ghazi and several associates swearing loyalty to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and becoming part of the Khorasan state.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "On Aug. 6th, the Pakistan-based jihadist organization Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), previously covered here, released a video of its leader Usmon Ghazi and several associates swearing loyalty to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and becoming part of the Khorasan state.", "title": "FRANK GAFFNEY: Islamic Uzbek movement swears allegiance to ISIS", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/12/frank-gaffney-islamic-uzbek-movement-swears-allegi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/30/7_302015_afghanistan-taliban8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/30/7_302015_afghanistan-taliban8201.jpg", "description": "On Aug. 6th, the Pakistan-based jihadist organization Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), previously covered here, released a video of its leader Usmon Ghazi and several associates swearing loyalty", "card": "summary", "title": "FRANK GAFFNEY: Islamic Uzbek movement swears allegiance to ISIS"}, "Author": "Sean MacCormac", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, War Conflict, Islamic Movement Of Uzbekistan, Taliban, Uzbekistan"}, "article_summary": "The Aug. 6 announcement comes in the wake of the Taliban admitting that Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar was killed two years earlier.\nThis is particularly the case since Islamic State had already used rumors of Omar\u2019s death as a recruiting tactic.\nIn September 2014, Ghazi had officially stated that the IMU was siding with the Islamic State, yet withheld direct allegiance at that time.\nHaving now been caught covering up Omar\u2019s death, however, the Taliban is likely to see that effort backfire.\nThe Pakistan-based jihadist organization Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), previously covered here, released a video of its leader Usmon Ghazi and several associates swearing loyalty to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and becoming part of the Khorasan state."}
