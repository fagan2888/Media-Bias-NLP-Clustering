WASHINGTON — Kurt DelBene, former chief of Microsoft’s Office division and husband of U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, was tapped by President Obama on Tuesday to take over the continuing fix for the troubled Affordable Care Act website.

Kurt DelBene will assume his new assignment from Jeff Zients, who was brought in temporarily to tackle the enrollment foul-ups that marred the launch of the federal Obamacare health exchange. Zients is slated to become director of the National Economic Council next year.

Kurt DelBene announced his retirement from Microsoft in July during a reorganization announced by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. He is married to Suzan DelBene, a freshman Democrat from Medina and a former Microsoft executive herself.

The couple married in 1997.

Suzan DelBene said in a statement she was pleased the Obama administration was bringing in her husband — and his private-sector expertise — to the federal Healthcare.gov website.
