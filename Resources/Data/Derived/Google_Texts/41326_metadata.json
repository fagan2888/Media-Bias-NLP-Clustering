Medi-Cal is the state\u2019s version of the federal Medicaid program that provides health insurance to low-income residents.\n\nThese Californians live in 22 counties, from Orange County to the Central Coast and rural Northern California. Unlike about 8 million other Medi-Cal enrollees in managed care, most of them can\u2019t appeal their case to an independent physician.\n\nAdvocates, patients and some lawmakers say this has delayed critical treatments and is simply unfair.\n\n\u201cThere should be uniformity in the protections of all Medi-Cal recipients,\u201d says state Sen. Bill Monning, a Democrat whose district covers three affected counties: Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Luis Obispo.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll explain this inconsistency and offer advice to those people it affects.\n\nQ: I live in Orange County and have Medi-Cal. I\u2019m in the middle of cancer treatment but my health plan is making me get reapproved before I can continue. What are my options?\n\nA: If your medical plan makes a decision that you disagree with, such as not covering the medication or therapy your doctor has ordered, you usually start by appealing with the plan itself.\n\nIf the plan won\u2019t budge, you move to the second level of appeals. This is where the difference lies.\n\nThe vast majority of managed care Medi-Cal recipients are in plans regulated by the state Department of Managed Health Care. They have access to something called an Independent Medical Review (IMR), which allows them to appeal their plan\u2019s decision to an independent physician (or physicians) who are experts in the conditions being reviewed.\n\nIf your health issue is urgent, you can request an expedited IMR to be conducted within a week.\n\nIf it is not urgent, it is usually decided within 30 days.\n\nBut Orange County managed care Medi-Cal recipients receive coverage through a plan called a County Organized Health System (COHS).\n\nThere are six COHS plans, including CalOptima in Orange County and Partnership HealthPlan, which covers 14 Northern California counties. If you\u2019re in one of these counties, your local COHS plan is the only Medi-Cal plan available to you.\n\nThese publicly operated plans were exempted from certain requirements more than 30 years ago when they were much smaller entities.\n\nThat means you don\u2019t have access to an IMR for your second layer of appeals. You must request a state fair hearing and plead your case before an administrative law judge who usually is not a medical expert.\n\nThe cases must be decided within 90 days after the Medi-Cal recipient requests a hearing, says Michael Weston, spokesman for the state Department of Social Services, which conducts the hearings.\n\nAn enrollee whose health is in danger from delay may request an expedited hearing. If a judge agrees, a hearing will be scheduled within 10 days of the request and a decision rendered within five days after all evidence has been submitted, Weston says.\n\n(There is an exception. The Health Plan of San Mateo, a COHS plan, has voluntarily agreed to be regulated by the Department of Managed Health Care, so its enrollees can request an IMR.)\n\nFallstead has requested two state fair hearings in the past two years. Both took longer than 90 days to resolve.\n\n\u201cI feel like they\u2019re denying me medication,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m not a person to them.\u201d\n\nLiza Thantranon, Legal Services of Northern California\u2019s managing attorney for health, says she deals with this problem every day.\n\nHer clients who have access to IMRs usually are able to resolve their cases within a month, she says. However, the majority of her COHS clients who request state fair hearings wait more than 90 days for a decision, some as long as six to eight months.\n\n\u201cIn the middle, you have administrative law judges trying to evaluate which doctor is right,\u201d Thantranon says. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what the science is.\u201d\n\nWeston counters that the judges are trained to make \u201cfactual findings based on evidence, including the medical evidence provided by the plan and the doctor.\u201d\n\nThe plans say they\u2019re not against regulation, but over-regulation. They\u2019re already regulated twice, by the federal and state governments, says Bob Freeman, CEO of CenCal Health, the COHS plan that covers about 165,000 Medi-Cal enrollees in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties.\n\nAdding this additional layer of regulation would require them to pay about $4 million collectively in fees each year to the Department of Managed Health Care, he says.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the value to the taxpayer in that?\u201d Freeman asks. \u201cThat money could go somewhere else.\u201d\n\nFor those of you who are in a COHS plan, here are some tips on the appeal process:\n\nIf your plan denies the initial internal appeal, ask it to review its decision. At the same time, immediately request a state fair hearing. You can always withdraw from the hearing later if you\u2019re able to resolve the problem directly with your health plan.\n\nRequest a state fair hearing by calling 855-795-0634 or email your request to shdcsu@dss.ca.gov.\n\nBefore your hearing, gather medical evidence to bolster your case. \u201cAsk your doctors to write letters of support,\u201d Thantranon says. Your doctor can also participate in the hearing by phone, Weston says.\n\nGet help from health care advocacy groups. The Health Consumer Alliance is a good place to start: healthconsumer.org and 888-804-3536.\n\nIf you\u2019re unhappy with the state fair hearing decision, you may be able to request a rehearing or take your case to civil court, Weston says.
