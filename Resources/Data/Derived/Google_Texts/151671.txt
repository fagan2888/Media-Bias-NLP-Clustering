The deadline to sign up for health care coverage for 2016 under the Affordable Care Act is fast approaching.

Mississippians who wish to have coverage under the ACA, sometimes called Obamacare, beginning Feb. 1 have to sign up by Friday. Those who miss the Friday deadline have until Jan. 31 to sign up for coverage beginning in March.

Mississippians who want to change their plan from 2015 must do so before the Jan. 31 deadline.

Consumers cannot receive coverage under the ACA for 2016 if they miss the Jan. 31 deadline.

According to a press release issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 96,982 Mississippians — and 8.7 million consumers nationwide — have signed up for the health care coverage since enrollment began Nov.1..

"It’s important for consumers in Mississippi to come back and shop before Jan. 15 to have coverage effective Feb. 1," said Jonathan Gold, press secretary for HHS. "This year, 91 percent of Mississippi consumers can save on premium costs by switching to a different plan within their level of coverage, and more than eight in 10 returning consumers in the state can find coverage for $75 or less a month after tax credits."

In the first month of open enrollment, 88 percent of Mississippi consumers who selected health insurance plans were determined eligible for financial assistance to lower their monthly premiums, according to HHS.

As of Jan. 9, 8,802 consumers in the Biloxi-Gulfport market area, 12,678 consumers in the Columbus-Tupelo-West Point market area, 6,780 consumers in the Greenwood-Greenville market area, 10,713 consumers in the Hattiesburg-Laurel market area, 38,558 consumers in the Jackson market area and 3,875 consumers in the Meridian market area selected or were automatically enrolled in a plan.

“We saw unprecedented demand for Jan. 1 coverage and continue to make steady progress signing up new customers as open enrollment proceeds," HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in the release. "We are focused on educating customers about the affordable options at HealthCare.gov and providing them the help they need to make the best coverage choices.”
