A majority of Americans support the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the constitutionality of federal subsidies under Obamacare, according to a new poll.

Just over six in 10 Americans (62 percent) say they approve of the court's decision, according to a new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation . About one third (32 percent) say they disapprove of the ruling.

As expected, Democrats (82 percent) are more likely to approve of the King v. Burwell decision compared to Republicans, who are more likely to disapprove (62 percent). Independents approved of the decision 61-34.

However, Americans remain split over how they view Obamacare. Forty-three percent view Obamacare favorably, compared to 40 percent who view it unfavorably.
