But after Tuesday night\u2019s debate, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul might not be on speaking terms.\n\nThey were the Tea Party\u2019s three success stories in the Senate, the great right hope in the age of Obama. And Tuesday night, they were all at each other\u2019s throats.\n\nOf the three, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have a plausible shot at the GOP nomination. But Rand Paul, in what was his best debate performance of the race so far, was able to hold his ground\u2014and even get in a swipe or two. But once again it was the Cruz and Rubio show\u2014the two middle-tier candidates who at least act like they have the most to gain from these contests.\n\nCruz stuck to a tried-and-true strategy that he\u2019s followed throughout his career as senator. As The New York Times\u2019 Ross Douthat noted back in 2013, Cruz defined \u201chimself as a national figure not by taking positions on questions that divide his party, but by picking issues where the party is basically united\u2014Obamacare, gun control, taxes\u2014and playing the maximalist while promising the moon.\u201d That sets him apart from Rubio and Paul, who tried (and failed) to change the GOP\u2019s policies on immigration and foreign policy, respectively.\n\nCruz triangulates within the factions of his divided party, and he did that again Tuesday night after Rubio and Paul traded barbs over foreign policy.\n\nPaul characterized Rubio\u2019s tax plan as a \u201ctrillion-dollar expenditure\u201d that he would push through while also advocating for increased military spending. Rubio defended his plan, Paul brought up the military again, and Rubio accused Paul of being a \u201ccommitted isolationist.\u201d\n\nIt went on like that for another few minutes, with each senator accusing the other of not being a real conservative. Rubio said Paul would leave America undefended. Paul said Rubio would bankrupt the country while intervening in wars we should stay out of.\n\nThat gave Cruz an opening for his \u201cmiddle ground\u201d approach.\n\n\u201cIf you think defending this nation is expensive, try not defending it,\u201d he said to applause. \u201cBut you can do that and pay for it. You can do that and also be fiscally responsible.\u201d To pay for defense, Cruz said, all you need is to stop paying for other things\u2014like, say, \u201csugar subsidies.\u201d\n\nMentioning sugar subsidies was a jab at Rubio. Those subsidies, despised by many on the right as an egregious example of crony capitalism, are backed by some of the GOP\u2019s major donors, specifically Rubio supporter and sugar baron Pepe Fanjul. Expect to hear more from Cruz about all that in the coming weeks.\n\nBut fight night did not go as many predicted.\n\nJeb Bush and Rubio, the two guys facing off for the establishment lane in the primary, largely steered clear of each other this time around. Meanwhile, frontrunners Donald Trump and Ben Carson seemed to lay down their arms as well. The debate touched only lightly on Carson\u2019s rough week of biographical vetting.\n\nCarly Fiorina had a good night\u2014the crowd inside the Milwaukee Theater frequently rewarded her polished, practiced answers with cheers.\n\nShe even managed to provoke Trump, who chided her for interrupting all the men on the stage.\n\n\u201cWhy does she keep interrupting everybody?\u201d Trump said. \u201cTerrible.\u201d\n\nHe was immediately booed.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

He didn\u2019t seem to have a real grasp of any of the major issues being discussed but had at least been tutored enough that he didn\u2019t commit any significant gaffes. He briefly addressed the questions about the accuracy of his biography, which has come under assault by the media as well as by Trump.\n\n\u201cWell, first of all, thank you for not asking me what I said in the 10th grade. I appreciate that,\u201d Carson quipped when asked whether the onslaught had hurt his brand.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is, you know, what\u2014we should vet all candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truth,\u201d Carson said, and then\u2014again\u2014accused the media of giving Hillary Clinton a pass.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, looks increasingly bored by the political process and mostly phoned it in yet again. He adhered to his shtick\u2014lots of flash, platitudes, and not a ton of substance. He was able to stumble through the last few debates without much damage to his standing in the polls, but with Carson on the rise, Trump\u2019s slow but steady decline will likely continue.\n\nJohn Kasich once again got a bizarre amount of time to give rambling answers that put him to the left of the Republican field.\n\nStill, several candidates (well, mostly Trump) paused to punch down as the Ohio governor tried to get into conversation after conversation.\n\nAfter Kasich called Trump\u2019s assertion that he could deport millions of immigrants after the construction of a border wall between the United States and Mexico \u201csilly,\u201d Trump attacked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to hear from this man,\u201d Trump said dismissively. \u201cLet me tell you, you\u2019re lucky in Ohio that you struck oil.\u201d\n\nWhen Bush tried to jump into the conversation, Trump pivoted.\n\n\u201cYou should let Jeb speak,\u201d Trump told Kasich, managing to sound condescending to Kasich and Bush at the same time.\n\nBush, for his part, later responded, \u201cThank you, Donald, for allowing me to speak at the debate. That\u2019s really nice of you. Really appreciate that.\u201d\n\nBush seemed annoyed that more questions weren\u2019t directed his way. Still, he avoided doing any harm, which these days is a win for the former establishment favorite, even if he didn\u2019t bring the fireworks his aides had been promising in the press.\n\nBut what became increasingly apparent over the course of this debate was the Tea Partiers are now as fractured as the party they did so much to revive and then divide.\n\nThe Fox Business Network moderators, who hung back and allowed the candidates to tout their differences, apparently pleased the RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who chortled:", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "willrahn"}, "keywords": "Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Politics-Election, 2016 Election, Republican Party, u.s. poli, Donald Trump, John Kasich", "publicationDate": 201511110631, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "They won their Senate seats because they spoke the Tea Party\u2019s language.
