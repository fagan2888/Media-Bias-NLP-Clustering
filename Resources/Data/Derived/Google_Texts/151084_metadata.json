The administration, though, went ahead.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The pledges are part of a larger effort to modernize the healthcare system.", "description": "The pledges are part of a larger effort to modernize the healthcare system.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The pledges are part of a larger effort to modernize the healthcare system.", "title": "Burwell unveils industry pledges on electronic health records", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/271183-burwell-unveils-industry-pledges-on-electronic-health-records", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-29T20:30:01-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-29T20:30-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/271183-burwell-unveils-industry-pledges-on-electronic-health-records", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-29T20:30-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-29T20:30:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-29T20:30:01-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Sylvia Burwell,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/271183-burwell-unveils-industry-pledges-on-electronic-health-records", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The pledges are part of a larger effort to modernize the healthcare system.", "card": "summary", "title": "Burwell unveils industry pledges on electronic health records"}, "dcterms.title": "Burwell unveils industry pledges on electronic health records"}, "article_summary": "The pledges come from health IT developers that provide 90 percent of electronic health records used by hospitals, as well as the country\u2019s five largest healthcare provider systems.\nThe Obama administration on Monday announced commitments from a range of healthcare companies aimed at improving the flow of electronic health records.\nThe 2009 stimulus law incentivized the adoption of electronic health records, and more than $30 billion in government incentive payments have been made since then.\nPresident Obama also spoke of electronic medical records last week in touting his \u201cprecision medicine\u201d initiative to make treatments increasingly individualized.\nSecond is a commitment to make it easier to share electronic health records between different companies and systems and cut down on blockages due to business practices or misunderstandings of privacy law."}
