The Morristown Green was awash in lawn chairs and blankets today as thousands of people attended the fourth annual Morristown Jazz & Blue's Festival.

Many started arriving early so that they could secure their favorite spots, some choosing the shade of large trees while others worked on their tans in the sun.

The event, held in celebration of the 350th anniversary of the founding of New Jersey, featured performances by Trio Da Paz, The Bucky Pizzarelli Guitar Summit, Winard Harper & Jeli Posse and The Matt Schofield Trio. Guest guitarists Frank Vignola, Vinnie Raniolo and Ed Laub accompanied Pizzarelli.

Attendee Marlene Aardenburg said she recently moved to Morristown from Florida because she and her husband Luke wanted to live in a town that offered culture, history and places to walk and bike.

"It was a great surprise to find that there was a jazz festival going on today, we are in awe and very happy," Aardenburg said.
