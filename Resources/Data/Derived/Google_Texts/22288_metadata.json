You have a few options. You could always repair it, which would take some time, effort, and probably a bit of scratch unless you happen to be proficient in piano repair (in which case, quit slacking and repair your piano). You could pay even more money and turn it into a self-playing pianola. Then when your friends come over you can smugly ask them what instrument they play as you mime the perfectly played song the piano is taking care of. Or, you could go for Plan C, and turn your piano into the awesomest piano ever.\n\nSome pianos are attractive and add an air of class. Some can be sultry. And some can play the video game Doom.\n\nUsing a dilapidated piano, a group of indie developers mapped all the directional and action keys to keys on a piano. The result is the most bad ass, demon killing piano ever created. Lucifer has night mares about the disjointed song this piano plays. Check it out below.\n\nCaleb Denison: The art of TV placement\n\nWhile at CEDIA 2013 this year, I saw a few really cool products I just didn\u2019t have enough time to report on. This is one of them.\n\nHidden Vision TV Mounts hide your TV so that it looks like framed art on the wall. When you\u2019re ready to watch, you can either flip the frame around to expose the TV screen, or just extend it from the wall to watch from bed, depending on the style of mount you pick. The extender mount is perfect for those who like to watch TV in bed, but don\u2019t want to sacrifice space elsewhere in their room. I can see this being particularly appealing for RV and Park Model owners who have smaller bedrooms. Check out the video below to see the mounts in action.\n\nLes Shu: GWAR covers Billy Ocean tune, and it doesn\u2019t suck\n\nI don\u2019t listen to heavy metal, but I don\u2019t listen to GWAR not because of the music, but simply because they have always scared the crap out of me. Their cover of one-hit wonder Billy Ocean and his terrible \u201cGet Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car,\u201d however, paints the band in a new light for me. In fact, these guys (if you can call them that) are pretty awesome.\n\nIn its Undercover series, The Onion A.V. (the satirical newspaper\u2019s A&E site) invited bands to perform one of 25 predetermined songs. GWAR got stuck with \u201cGOMD, GIMC,\u201d with front man (or thing) Oderus Urungus calling the song \u201cpretty much demeaning to women\u201d and saying \u201csomething seems altogether unwholesome about it.\u201d While it was all in jest, GWAR manages to make this cheesy melody actually enjoyable. However, they don\u2019t make the song lyrics sound any less creepy.\n\nAndrew Couts: Following the Silk Road\n\nThis has been a crazy-ass week. Our federal government shut down. Obamacare\u2019s online exchanges went live (and crapped out under the weight of traffic), bikers beat the hell out of some guy in New York City after he ran over some of them with his Range Rover, and a young mother went nuts and tried to ram her car through the front door of the White House. But nothing is as crazy as the FBI\u2019s case against Ross Ulbricht, the 29-year-old suspected of operating the world\u2019s largest online black market, Silk Road. The case against Ulbricht is so wild, even the court documents are fascinating reads. Forget Breaking Bad \u2013 if you\u2019re interested in larger-than-life drug drama, I highly recommend taking the time to check them out.\n\nMolly McHugh: The last place you expected Usher\n\nWhen I was in middle school and even high school, the name Usher was said with reverence. He was like my generation\u2019s Justin Bieber without the Joffrey comparisons (seriously, someone needs to put something other than a wife beater on that kid, take his phone away, and drop him off with the good people of Canada before it\u2019s too late). That voice! Those moves!\n\nI even had my own Usher run-in once \u2013 at this year\u2019s past SXSW. The day I was leaving, I had lunch with a friend in downtown Austin, and just who do you think happened to be trying to go up the tiny staircase to the bathroom when I was coming down it?! That\u2019s right! Usher! I said, \u201cYou\u2019re Usher\u201d without any emotion, half-heartedly went for a high-five, lost the courage, and dropped my arm to its side. I\u2019m sure it was a really significant moment for him too.\n\nAnyway, what I\u2019m getting at is that this man is a legend \u2013 a legend who was made to sing the alphabet on Sesame Street this week. I get it, dude\u2019s got kids now, but there\u2019s something incredibly horrifying about seeing my middle school celebrity crush with his arm around Elmo. It\u2019s also hypnotizing because there\u2019s something so wrong about seeing Chili\u2019s former lover (oh yeah, you remember that, right?) sexy-singing the ABCs.\n\nCan you tell me how to get to Sesame Street indeed.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.ratio_4_3": "http://icdn7.digitaltrends.com/image/staff-picks-10_05_2013-480x360-c.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://icdn5.digitaltrends.com/image/staff-picks-10_05_2013-50x50.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Digital Trends Staff", "description": "You want to know all the best from around the Web in the past week, but you don\u2019t want to have to look for it, right?
