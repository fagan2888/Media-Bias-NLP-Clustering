The days of television commercials being startlingly louder than the shows people are watching could soon be coming to an end.

Television commercials will be noticeably quieter under new rules from the Federal Communications Commission.

The FCC announced Tuesday it is moving forward with changes to its regulations to further restrict the volume of television commercials under the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act.

"It is our hope that these changes will result in a modest decrease in the perceived loudness of certain commercials," the agency wrote in the Federal Register.

The rules, which were last updated in 2011, give the agency a new way of measuring the loudness of television commercials. They apply to digital broadcasters, digital cable operators and satellite providers.

The rules go into effect on June 4, 2015.
