New Jersey is an open-records state. Yet for weeks now, we have been stonewalled and given the run-around by everyone we\u2019ve asked for help in obtaining the relevant police records. We\u2019ve asked nicely, we\u2019ve asked firmly, we\u2019ve asked in every way imaginable, but gotten nowhere. It is much easier to learn about the most sensitive aspects of top-secret national-security programs than it is to get Newark police records related to that day,\" Lowry writes.\n\n\"Enough is enough. Yesterday we filed suit against the Newark Police Department, the City of Newark, and Mayor Booker to obtain the records in keeping with New Jersey law. This suit shouldn\u2019t be necessary, but the official obstruction in Newark has made it so. In such an instance, everyone should favor openness.\"\n\nUPDATE: National Review to get Wazn Miller documents\n\nHadas Gold is a reporter at Politico.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "<p>National Review is suing Cory Booker, the City of Newark and Newark Police Department.</p>", "title": "National Review to sue Cory Booker", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/09/national-review-to-sue-cory-booker-172383.html", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/hadas.gold"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "<p>National Review is suing Cory Booker, the City of Newark and Newark Police Department.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019ve asked nicely, we\u2019ve asked firmly, we\u2019ve asked in every way imaginable, but gotten nowhere.\nOn Media Blog Archives Select Date\u2026 December, 2015 November, 2015 October, 2015 September, 2015 August, 2015 July, 2015 June, 2015 May, 2015 April, 2015 March, 2015 February, 2015 January, 2015National Review to sue Cory BookerRich Lowry, National Review's editor, announced Wednesday they will be suing Newark Mayor Cory Booker along with the Newark Police Department and the City of Newark.\nUPDATE: National Review to get Wazn Miller documentsHadas Gold is a reporter at Politico.\nIn a post on National Review, Lowry, also a columnist at POLITICO, says their reporters tried to access documents related to Miller's unsolved murder in order to substantiate Booker's claims he was with Miller as he died.\nYet for weeks now, we have been stonewalled and given the run-around by everyone we\u2019ve asked for help in obtaining the relevant police records."}
