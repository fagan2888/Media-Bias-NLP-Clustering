Mathew Staver, who is currently serving as head legal counsel for Davis, made the comparison on the \"Crosstalk\" radio show Wednesday, RightWingWatch.com reported. \"[Davis is] there to do a duty, a job and the job duty was changed,\" Staver argued. \"Does that mean that if you\u2019re Christian, don\u2019t apply here? ... What happened in Nazi Germany, what happened there first, they removed the Jews from government public employment, then they stopped patronizing them in their private businesses, then they continued to stigmatize them, then they were the \u2018problems,\u2019 then they killed them.\"\n\nStaver doubled down on his Nazi Germany comparison on Thursday on \"Washington Watch,\" a radio show hosted by Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, going so far as to invoke images of gas chambers while doing so, RightWingWatch.com noted. \"Back in the 1930s, it began with the Jews, where they were evicted from public employment, then boycotted in their private employment, then stigmatized and that led to the gas chambers,\" Staver told Perkins. \"This is the new persecution of Christians here in this country.\u201d \"You cannot obey something that is contrary to God's law,\" Staver continued. \"And we would easily say, well, what would happen if the government forced you to turn over a Jew in Nazi Germany? All of us would say we wouldn't do that, we wouldn't listen to that. Well, we're about ready to walk into the moment.\u201d\n\nDavis, who was taken into custody on Thursday, is expected to remain in jail for at least a week while her lawyers appeal the ruling. \"They\u2019re not gonna let her out and she\u2019s not gonna bow... I promise you that,\" Davis' husband, Joe, told the press Thursday. He also argued that his wife had been put in jail \"illegally\" and vowed to \"ask [Kentucky Gov. Steve] Beshear to do his job or step down.\" Carter County jailer R.W. Boggs told WKYT that Davis wouldn\u2019t be receiving any special treatment while incarcerated, Towleroad reported.\u201cMy job is to keep the door locked until the judge tells me to unlock it. As far as we\u2019re concerned, it was just another day in the neighborhood,\u201d he said. Boggs added, \u201cIt\u2019s a day in jail -- breakfast, lunch, dinner and daily activities. It\u2019s not glamorous, it\u2019s not exciting. It\u2019s jail.\u201d Meanwhile, the Rowan County clerk's office began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, including James Yates and William Smith Jr., who, thanks to Davis' refusal to serve them, had to apply six times before finally receiving their license.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffAlso on HuffPost:\n\n13 Things The Bible Forbids (That You're Probably Guilty Of Doing)\n\n13 Things The Bible Forbids (That You're Probably Guilty Of Doing)\n\n1 of 13 Eating A Ham Sandwich Lunch time?
