These results represent real people who did not die or suffer infections or harm in the hospital.\"\n\nData collected by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality shows that HACs fell from 145 per 1,000 discharges in 2010 to 121 per 1,000 discharges in 2014, a 17% decline.\n\nHospital-acquired conditions include adverse drug events, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line associated bloodstream infections, pressure ulcers, and surgical site infections, among others. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality analyzed the numbers of avoidable HACs compared to 2010 rates using baseline estimates of deaths and excess healthcare costs developed by Partnership for Patients.\n\nAHRQ Director Richard Kronick says the 37,000 lives saved from reduced HACs in 2014 were \"approximately equivalent to a one-year hiatus from all deaths from breast cancer in the United States.\"\n\nTJC Names Top Performers, Notes 'Dramatic' Quality Improvements\n\nThe biggest reductions seen in the four-year span were among three of the most common HACs or adverse events, Kronick says. Adverse drugs events fell by 16% and contributed 40% of the overall reduction; pressure ulcers dropped 23% and represented 28% in the overall reduction; and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) dropped 38% and accounted for 16% of the overall reductions.\n\n\"Overall, other important hospital-acquired infections showed reductions in addition to the CAUTIs. Most notably there were very large reductions in central line-associated bloodstream infections, (CLASBIs)\" Kronick says. \"These infections are relatively rare, but quite deadly. In 2010, the rate of CLABSIs was 0.55 per 1,000 hospitalizations. By 2014 this rate was reduced by over 70% down to 0.15 per 1,000 hospitalizations. We are clearly not yet at zero but we are getting close.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Data collected by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality shows that hospital-acquired conditions such as adverse drug events, pressure ulcers, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections declined sharply between 2010 and 2014.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "keywords": "nursing, physicians, revenue", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd238b\"", "article_summary": "HACs Plummet 17%, Save $20B Under ObamacareData collected by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality shows that hospital-acquired conditions such as adverse drug events, pressure ulcers, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections declined sharply between 2010 and 2014.\nHospital-acquired conditions include adverse drug events, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line associated bloodstream infections, pressure ulcers, and surgical site infections, among others.\nTJC Names Top Performers, Notes 'Dramatic' Quality ImprovementsThe biggest reductions seen in the four-year span were among three of the most common HACs or adverse events, Kronick says.\nData collected by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality shows that HACs fell from 145 per 1,000 discharges in 2010 to 121 per 1,000 discharges in 2014, a 17% decline.\nThese results represent real people who did not die or suffer infections or harm in the hospital.\""}
