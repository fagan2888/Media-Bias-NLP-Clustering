It's a terror state funded by US taxpayers. And its core terror group has no problem praising the murder of Americans.\n\nAs Palestinian Media Watch reports, Fatah praised the perpetrators of the 1972 Lod airport massacre in Israel.\n\nIn 1972, three members of the Japanese Red Army carried out a terror attack in Israel's airport. 24 people were killed and 70 were wounded when the terrorists shot at passengers and threw hand grenades. As the anniversary of the attack approaches, Fatah sticks to its policy of glorifying terrorists on the date of their attacks.\n\n\n\nPosting a photo from the attack, showing pools of blood on the floor next to torn and scattered luggage, Fatah sent \"greetings\" to the surviving \"hero,\" the murderer Kozo Okamoto, on its Facebook page:\n\n\n\n\"44 years since the airport operation (26 killed and 80 injured) [higher numbers in the original -Ed.] A thousand greetings to the Japanese fighter and friend Kozo Okamoto, the hero of the Lod airport operation, May 30, 1972.\" [Official Fatah Facebook page, May 17, 2016]\n\nAmong the dead were 17 Puerto Rican tourists. United States citizens on a tour from their San Juan church. Even after the massacre, the survivors remained behind refusing to be intimidated by the terrorists.\n\nIn June 2006, a legislative initiative of Puerto Rico Senator Jos\u00e9 Garriga Pic\u00f3, Senate Project (PS) 1535, was approved by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico. The bill made May 30 \"Lod Massacre Remembrance Day\". On August 2, 2006, the Governor of Puerto Rico, An\u00edbal Acevedo Vil\u00e1, signed it into law as Law 144 August 2, 2006. \"Lod Remembrance Day\" commemorate the events, honors both those murdered and those who survived, and educates the Puerto Rican public against terrorism. Victims of the attack: US citizens of Puerto Rico: 1. Reverend Angel Berganzo 2. Carmela Cintr\u00f3n 3. Carmen E. Crespo 4. V\u00edrgen Flores 5. Esther Gonz\u00e1lez 6.

Carmelo Calder\u00f3n Molina\n\nWhy does the US continue funding terrorists who blatantly celebrate the murder of Americans?\n\nIn Puerto Rico, Comit\u00e9 Co-Lod conducts memorials in memory of the victims of the massacre. The commemoration is often held at the Holocaust memorial near the capitol in San Juan.\n\nMargarito Hernandez Otero, president of the Co-Lod Committee, stressed that \"The most tragic aspect is that one of the perpetrators of the slaughter, Kozo Okamoto, is alive and has never faced justice.\" \"Survivors and activists of the cause of the victims have made an international claim for the United States to officially request the extradition of Okamoto for his crimes,\" said the chairman.\n\nInstead of requesting his extradition, the government continues funding those who celebrate the massacre.\n\n\"I threw myself to the floor asking God that nothing happened ... As the shots were ebbing tried to get up and felt there was something heavy on me,\" the survivor Juan Antonio Rodriguez Larroy recalled in 2008, in an article published in Primera Hora. \"I thought I was paralyzed, who had hurt me, because I could not move. Then I started to move my legs and I touched something hot under the collar. I see is blood, but it was not mine but a dead person who had fallen on me. \" About 70 Puerto Ricans had left the day before beginning a long journey that had included stops in New York and Rome, before arriving at the capital of Israel, having wanted to visit the Holy Land.\n\nIt is long past time for this injustice to be remedied.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "title": "US Funded Palestinian Terror State Praises Murder of 17 Americans", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/262905/us-funded-palestinian-terror-state-praises-murder-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/05/lod-airport-massacre-300x194.jpg?itok=r9Oy7tq6", "updated_time": "2016-05-18T11:07:47-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/262905/us-funded-palestinian-terror-state-praises-murder-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/05/lod-airport-massacre-300x194.jpg?itok=r9Oy7tq6", "card": "summary", "title": "US Funded Palestinian Terror State Praises Murder of 17 Americans"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-18T11:07:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-18T11:07:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In June 2006, a legislative initiative of Puerto Rico Senator Jos\u00e9 Garriga Pic\u00f3, Senate Project (PS) 1535, was approved by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico.\nAs Palestinian Media Watch reports, Fatah praised the perpetrators of the 1972 Lod airport massacre in Israel.\nOn August 2, 2006, the Governor of Puerto Rico, An\u00edbal Acevedo Vil\u00e1, signed it into law as Law 144 August 2, 2006.\nA thousand greetings to the Japanese fighter and friend Kozo Okamoto, the hero of the Lod airport operation, May 30, 1972.\"\nThe bill made May 30 \"Lod Massacre Remembrance Day\"."}
