And while they\u2019re technically wrong, it\u2019s not hard to see why they have that idea. Despite 56 consecutive months of private sector job growth, the labor force participation rate is at its lowest level since 1978. While the top 1 percent has bounced back just fine, middle-class wages remain stagnant. Can you blame the country for not breaking into \u201cHappy Days Are Here Again\u201d?\n\nIn his New York Times column this morning, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman identifies what\u2019s behind the sluggish economy \u2014 and it isn\u2019t \u201cWashington gridlock\u201d or \u201cpartisan squabbling.\u201d Instead, Krugman declares, it\u2019s \u201cthe destructive ideology that has taken over the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nSince the recovery, Krugman writes, \u201cAmerica has been awash in savings,\u201d with both individuals and businesses reluctant to spend and make big investments. \u201cAnd the mismatch between desired saving and the willingness to invest has kept the economy depressed,\u201d Krugman contends. \u201cRemember, your spending is my income and my spending is your income, so if everyone tries to spend less at the same time, everyone\u2019s income falls.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution? Given what Krugman calls our \u201chuge infrastructure needs, especially in water and transportation\u201d \u2014 and considering the incredibly low interest rates on U.S. government bonds \u2014 massive public investment in infrastructure is in order. Instead, infrastructure spending has plummeted in recent years, as Republicans have proven obstinate in their opposition to the Obama administration\u2019s proposals for infrastructure investments. Underlying that opposition is an ideology of \u201coverwhelming hostility to government spending of any kind,\u201d Krugman argues. And thanks to the right-wing capture of the GOP, our economy remains depressed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five years after the Great Recession's official end, the recovery is still halting.
