Most U.S. airlines currently allow bags that are up to 22 inches by 14 inches by 9 inches.\n\nLawmakers responded to the proposal by introducing legislation to block airlines that charge passengers for checked luggage from shrinking the size of carry-on bags.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe IATA said Wednesday that it is putting the proposal on hold to conduct a \"comprehensive reassessment\" of the merits of shrinking the size of carry-on luggage.\n\n\"While many welcomed the Cabin OK initiative, significant concerns were expressed in North America,\" Tom Windmuller, IATA's senior vice president for airport, passenger, cargo and security, said in a statement.\n\n\"Cabin OK is a voluntary program for airlines and for consumers,\" he continued. \"This is clearly an issue that is close to the heart of travelers. We need to get it right. Today we are pausing the rollout and launching a comprehensive reassessment of the Cabin OK program with plans to further engage program participants, the rest of our members, and other key stakeholders.\"\n\nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, welcomed the decision to delay any changes.\n\n\u201cIf adopted by airlines, this standard would have prevented Americans from using many carry-on bags currently in use,\" Thune said in a statement. \"This ill-conceived proposal created understandable frustration among the traveling public.\n\n\"The Senate Commerce Committee immediately indicated our intention to scrutinize any such change by U.S. carriers. Given the public outcry and concern from lawmakers, IATA\u2019s decision to pause and reassess is appropriate,\u201d he added.\n\nSupporters of requiring smaller carry-on luggage had argued the restriction would speed up the boarding process for flights.\n\nCritics accused airlines of trying to force passengers to pay more checked bag fees by shrinking the carry-on luggage allowance.\n\n\u201cConsumers are tired of being squeezed \u2014 physically and fiscally \u2014 by airlines and this proposal is a step too far,\u201d Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) said in a statement after he introduced the legislation this week to stop the proposal.\n\n\u201cIt is a transparent attempt to squeeze even more money out of passengers by forcing them to pay baggage fees to check luggage they purchased specifically to avoid those fees,\" Cohen continued. \"The new proposed carry-on size limits should not be allowed to go into effect, especially at a time when the airlines are already making huge profits.\u201d\n\nThe group that lobbies for U.S. airlines in Washington, Airlines For America (A4A), moved Wednesday to distance itself from the proposal to shrink the size of passengers' carry-on luggage.\n\n\u201cA4A and its members reject the recent carry-on size initiative put forth by IATA because it is unnecessary and flies in the face of the actions the U.S. carriers are taking to invest in the customer experience \u2014 roughly $1.2 billion a month \u2014 including larger overhead bins,\u201d A4A President Nicholas Calio said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOur members already have guidelines in place on what size bags they can accommodate, making this action unnecessary,\" Calio continued. \"We agree with IATA\u2019s action to reassess this initiative and take into account stakeholders\u2019 views and recognize work already underway to improve baggage facilitation.\u201d\n\nCustomer groups have attributed the increase in the amount of carry-on luggage to fees for checked baggage implemented by almost every U.S. airline in recent years.\n\nThey say passengers are carrying on bags that they would have previously checked to their destinations to avoid the fees.\n\nAirlines have defended the bag fees, saying it allows passengers to choose how much luggage they want to bring on flights.\n\nThe Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics state that airlines collected $3.5 billion from baggage fees in 2014.\n\nThis story was updated at 4:24 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The industry is taking a \"comprehensive reassessment\" after criticism.", "description": "The industry is taking a \"comprehensive reassessment\" after criticism.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The industry is taking a \"comprehensive reassessment\" after criticism.", "title": "Airlines halt plan to shrink carry-on bags", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/245271-airlines-pausing-carry-on-luggage-reduction", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/tsa_032709getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-17T16:50:52-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-06-17T16:50-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/245271-airlines-pausing-carry-on-luggage-reduction", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-17T12:44-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "International Air Transport Association, Carry-on luggage size limit, Baggage allowance, Airline bag fees,Steve Cohen,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-17T12:44:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-17T16:50:52-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/245271-airlines-pausing-carry-on-luggage-reduction", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The industry is taking a \"comprehensive reassessment\" after criticism.", "card": "summary", "title": "Airlines halt plan to shrink carry-on bags"}, "dcterms.title": "Airlines halt plan to shrink carry-on bags"}, "article_summary": "The airline industry is hitting pause on a proposal to shrink the allowed size of passengers' carry-on bags after intense pushback from lawmakers.\nLawmakers responded to the proposal by introducing legislation to block airlines that charge passengers for checked luggage from shrinking the size of carry-on bags.\n\u201cIf adopted by airlines, this standard would have prevented Americans from using many carry-on bags currently in use,\" Thune said in a statement.\n\u201cOur members already have guidelines in place on what size bags they can accommodate, making this action unnecessary,\" Calio continued.\nSupporters of requiring smaller carry-on luggage had argued the restriction would speed up the boarding process for flights."}
