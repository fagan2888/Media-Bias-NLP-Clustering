And the number of traffic-related injuries and fatalities in that group will likely increase as well, as they did in 2012 (injuries up 16 percent, fatalities up 3 percent).\n\nSpurred by the numbers, and in the spirit of Older Driver Safety Awareness Week (Dec. 2-6), the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a five-year traffic safety plan for older drivers, passengers and pedestrians. It\u2019s accompanied by Older Driver Highway Safety Program Guidelines for states to implement that \u201ckeep older people safely mobile.\u201d\n\nThe plan includes discussions of frailty and fragility among older drivers and passengers, but perhaps doesn\u2019t emphasize this point enough: injuries and fatalities are closely connected with the greater vulnerability of older bodies; we shouldn\u2019t infer that older drivers are at fault in crashes.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the exercise is NHTSA\u2019s resolve to sharpen the definition of \u201colder drivers.\u201d With more people in their 60s, 70s, 80s and beyond on the road, aging itself needs to be better understood, so that functional changes in \u201cvision, strength, flexibility and cognition\u201d can inform policies on driving. Lumping all \u201colder drivers\u201d together is increasingly unhelpful.\n\n\u201cShow Us Your Modern Family\u201d Photo Contest.

The Driving Resource Center includes: classroom and online driving courses to freshen and improve driving skills; \u201cCar Fit,\u201d which helps drivers confirm that all safety equipment, such as seat belts and mirrors, are properly positioned; a look at new technologies that are making driving safer for all; and \u201cWe Need to Talk,\u201d which helps families have conversations when it\u2019s time to limit or stop driving.\n\nThe NHTSA plan\u2019s connection to new guidelines directing states to address older driver safety heartens Debra Alvarez, AARP senior legislative representative on transportation issues. And she adds that some less obvious things could make a big difference.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s currently a whole family of crash test dummies,\u201d she says, \u201cfrom children to adults. But there\u2019s no crash test dummy for older adults.\u201d NHTSA\u2019s research in this area would be an important step toward understanding how older bodies behave in crashes, and could save lives.\n\nImages \u2013 Graph: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; Crash test dummies: National Museum of American History/Flickr\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "There are 35 million drivers over age 65 on the road today, an increase of more than 20 percent over the past 10 years.
