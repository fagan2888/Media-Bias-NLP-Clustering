In Donald Trump’s latest book, Crippled America, the former frontrunner for the Republican nomination writes that government “doesn’t belong in health care except as the very last resort.” As Trump goes onto explain, he thinks the government should guarantee funding for insurance companies that lose a lot money, whether as a result of outside factors or simply poor management. In other words, he’s in favor of government bailouts for health insurance companies.

Here is the full passage:

The government doesn’t belong in health care except as the very last resort. The main way the government should be involved is to make sure the insurance companies are financially strong so that if there is a catastrophic event or they make some kind of miscalculation, they have the resources they’ll need to handle it.

Trump, a long-time proponent of universal healthcare, has argued for repealing Obamacare and replacing it with “something terrific.” Obamacare includes a provision that would trigger taxpayer bailouts for insurance companies that experience greater-than-expected losses. Some Republicans are trying to repeal it.
