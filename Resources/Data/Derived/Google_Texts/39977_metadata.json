And by the time Cruz\u2019s crusade to defund Obamacare finally crashed to a halt Wednesday, the Texas senator had precious few friends left.\n\nThe government shutdown alienated colleagues in both parties. It generated fresh animosity toward the tea party and a flurry of recriminations toward Cruz. Voter support for the Republican Party plunged.\n\nAnd the health care law survived unscathed.\n\n\u201cThis is a terrible deal,\u201d Cruz said moments before the deal to reopen the government sailed through the Senate with bipartisan support. He blamed the defeat on colleagues who lacked the political courage to stand with him.\n\n\u201cThe outcome could have been different,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine a world in which Senate Republicans united to support House Republicans.\u201d\n\nCruz willed himself to the center of the fight. For months, he predicted that Democrats would cave if Republicans stood together to strip funding from the health care law. He dramatized the cause with a 21-hour overnight Senate speech, soaring to unusual prominence for a freshman senator. He refrained from using the risk of a catastrophic default on U.S. debt as leverage. Still, the defeat was so resounding that it left his political future in doubt.\n\nThe vast majority of his colleagues repudiated his tactics. Some accused him of promoting himself more than any attainable goals or the health of his party.\n\nSen. John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, called the last few weeks an \u201cagonizing odyssey.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has been one of the most shameful chapters I\u2019ve seen here,\u201d he said, lamenting damage to the GOP for little gain. \u201cWe\u2019re in a hole. We have to dig out. We weren\u2019t going to defund Obamacare, and we weren\u2019t going to keep the government shut down.\u201d\n\nAbout the only praise flowing toward Cruz on Wednesday pertained to his decision not to stand in the way of the deal Senate leaders hatched.\n\n\u201cAt some point, when you\u2019ve reached the end of the road, to then make life miserable for no reason, with absolutely no outcome in sight \u2014 then the pendulum swings,\u201d said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.\n\nCruz maintained that he never had any intention of allowing default, though he hadn\u2019t made that clear until he stepped in front of TV cameras, right at the same moment Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell had taken to the Senate floor to unveil the eleventh-hour deal he\u2019s struck with Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be gained from delaying this vote one day or two days. The outcome will be the same,\u201d Cruz said, adding that \u201conce again, it appears the Washington establishment is refusing to listen to the American people.\u201d\n\nCruz and his aides insisted the fight actually paid off. The flaws of Obamacare are now a topic of daily conversation in Washington and across the country, they argued.\n\nPolls have consistently shown, though, that while Americans are unhappy with the health care law, they oppose defunding it, especially in connection with shutting down the government.\n\nGOP strategist John Feehery called it smart for Cruz to steer clear of triggering a default. Taking blame for the shutdown is one thing; a calamity of that magnitude would have been quite another.\n\n\u201cHe will not want to have the weight of the world on his shoulders. \u2026 He just declares victory by voting no,\u201d said Feehery, a former top aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert.\n\nBut, he said, Cruz\u2019s extremism has not just harmed the party. It will, in his view, make it impossible to win the GOP nomination for president in 2016, though Cruz could enjoy the notoriety of a Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin, or win a third-party nomination if the tea party splits off.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about legislating. It\u2019s about being in the center of things,\u201d Feehery said. \u201cHe\u2019s become a tea party hero.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s popularity among party activists will get its next test Oct. 25, when he headlines a major Iowa GOP dinner.\n\nDemocrats were eager to blame Cruz for the shutdown and potential damage to the economy. Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa called it \u201ca reckless, tea party-fueled temper tantrum.\u201d\n\nAnd fellow Republicans in Washington weren\u2019t coming to Cruz\u2019s defense, either, on the question of whether the shutdown was worth it.\n\n\u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t anybody\u2019s intention to have this shutdown. Hopefully we\u2019ve all learned some important lessons,\u201d said Texas\u2019 senior senator, John Cornyn, the deputy GOP leader.\n\nSome Republicans complained that the shutdown overshadowed the huge glitches when the Obamacare insurance marketplaces went online Oct. 1, shielding Democrats from embarrassment.\n\n\u201cObamacare is going to be the gift that keeps on giving,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the critics of Cruz\u2019s tactics. He called it hostage-taking and political \u201coverreach.\u201d\n\nThat fellow conservatives would air such concerns reflected the chasm of mistrust and misapprehension Cruz has created after just 10 months in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been asking from the beginning, what\u2019s the endgame?\u201d said Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., who has fumed for weeks at Cruz for prodding fellow Republicans into the showdown. She noted that Obamacare exchanges opened on schedule despite the shutdown.\n\nGOP leaders had leaned hard on Cruz.\n\nSen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader, credited the Texan for highlighting concerns about Obamacare. \u201cBut at the end of the day, if it\u2019s clear that\u2019s not going to succeed, you might want to fight another day and find areas that unite us,\u201d he said. \u201cYou learn from it and move on.\u201d\n\nMany tea party activists hailed Cruz, along with Utah Sen. Mike Lee, as one of the few conservative leaders willing to fight. But other Cruz allies seemed to be struggling to find a silver lining.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., asserted that Cruz\u2019s efforts \u201cclarified\u201d where each party stands on Obamacare \u2014 as if that hadn\u2019t already been clear after President Barack Obama insisted he won\u2019t allow repeal or defunding of his signature health care law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an unfortunate series of events in some ways,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAt the Texas Association of Business, a leading advocacy group in Austin, president Bill Hammond said Cruz erred in fighting to defund Obamacare, rather than push to cut spending and overhaul entitlement programs as most Republican lawmakers urged.\n\n\u201cIt was unrealistic,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that he will turn his guns on making certain that my grandchildren have Social Security and Medicare, by reforming them without raising taxes.\u201d\n\nFollow Todd J.
