CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - The police department in New Hampshire’s capital city is planning a prescription drug take back day.

The Concord police department, in conjunction with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, will take in unwanted, expired and unused prescription drugs at police headquarters on Green Street from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. April 30.

Authorities say it’s a chance to prevent pill abuse and theft by ridding homes of excess drugs.

The DEA says it cannot accept liquid medicine or needles. The service is free and anonymous.

Officials say Americans turned in over 350 tons of prescription drugs at thousands of take back sites nationwide last September.
