Report findings showed several distinct benefits to pursuing higher education, even if costs increase.\n\nThe median average earnings for college graduates were $23,764 higher in 2013 than the median earnings for people without a college degree, according to the report.\n\nUsing data from more than 9,000 of TriNet\u2019s clients and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the report found that employees with a master\u2019s degree made a median salary of about $69,108 last year, $35,256 more than employees with high school diplomas made in 2013.\n\nHaving a college degree also helped increase people\u2019s chances of being gainfully employed. Unemployment rates in 2013 decreased as education levels increased, according to the report.\n\nHigh school graduates had an unemployment rate of 7.5%. People with a bachelor\u2019s degree had an unemployment rate of 4%, people with a master\u2019s degree had a 3.4% unemployment rate and those with a professional degree had a 2.3% unemployment rate.\n\nHaving a college degree may also help improve a person\u2019s chances to find full-time work. The report showed that people with an associate\u2019s degree or higher worked an average of 40 hours or more each week. High school graduates worked an average of 33.5 hours each week.\n\nThough college costs are rising, the report concluded that getting a degree could be worth the cost.\n\n\u201cBased on this data, even facing increasing costs of higher education, there is a clear benefit in earnings potential for workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, which may outweigh the risks of student loan debt,\u201d the report states.\n\nGet Free Updates!
