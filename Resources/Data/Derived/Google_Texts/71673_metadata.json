The company learned that consumers are paying more attention to the details in their medical bills. They want to know specifics of both their out-of-pocket expenses and those covered by payers, they consider bills and costs \u201cvery important\u201d and think the billing experience shares importance with quality of care.\n\n\u201cThe results of this report validates our hypothesis about the significance of billing,\u201d Silva-Craig said. \u201cThe one thing that surprised us is that the costs being assumed by consumers are rising at a rate much faster than we thought.\u201d\n\nJeff Jones, managing director for Chicago-based Huron Healthcare also acknowledged the influence of consumerism on price transparency, but says other factors are responsible as well, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 fiscal guidelines for Medicare and Medicaid, accountability initiatives for accountable care organizations, tenets of the Affordable Care Act and ICD-10 coding stratification.\n\n\u201cNo single factor is behind it, but there are a number of things in the industry that are making price transparency more visible, more important and more possible in terms of the new methods we have,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming transparent\n\nOld habits die hard in healthcare and a provider organization can\u2019t be expected to adopt a new transparent pricing model overnight. The necessary due diligence can be a time-consuming process, Jones said.\n\n\u201cPart of the challenge is to get the right data to make the right claims,\u201d he said. \u201cThe consumer mindset as it relates to buying healthcare is different from buying a wireless plan or flat-screen TV. Buying healthcare is much more personal, much more emotional than purchasing material goods. So, for the provider, it becomes an issue of furnishing accurate data and representing the amount of variance in the price and helping consumers understand the difference between their options.\u201d\n\nChallenges are both cultural and technological, Silva-Craig said. \u201cChanges in behavior are needed for a different approach. Hospitals are being increasingly challenged by consumers about how pricing is determined and about policies they don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nOver the past two decades, hospitals have been taught how to quantify services through activity-based costing and clinical care pathways, but Silva-Craig points out that these formulas are more germane to cost negotiations with payers than for developing price transparency models for consumers.\n\n\u201cTransparency is what the patient\u2019s cost obligation is and this is unique and distinctive,\u201d he said. \u201cCost is important for the hospital to know what goes into procedures. There are some basic steps hospitals can take to improve transparency and it will eventually get to the point where transparency will require more line-item detail. But for now, disclosing allowables and obligations are suitable for the conversation.\u201d\n\nConsider variables\n\nAs healthcare moves toward evidence-based medicine, the variables that can complicate service charges should be reduced, Jones said. Taken together, he believes that providers can assemble a basic cost structure prior to procedures with the understanding that exceptions do occur.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of things prior to a procedure that can\u2019t be known, which makes it hard to set an exact price,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a lot of health systems, they have enough history with the majority of their procedures to come up with reasonable estimates. I think it is possible to stratify services with the least amount of variance, but for the more sophisticated procedures, it can be difficult.\u201d\n\nAs a resource, employer mobile and online app vendors such as Castlight Health can serve as a price transparency guide, furnishing procedure cost estimates based on claims data, Jones said.\n\nCost of avoidance\n\nBecause of the external factors influencing healthcare, price transparency is not going away and those who aren\u2019t committed to doing something are flirting with financial disaster, Silva-Craig said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a competitive climate. Customers are asking for it and if you\u2019re not embracing it, you won\u2019t yield a positive financial outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cThirteen hospitals went bankrupt last year alone.\u201d\n\nStill, the price transparency movement is in its infancy and hospitals have some time to figure things out, Silva-Craig said.\n\n\u201cHospitals need to assess where they are \u2013 it is still an early adoption phase,\u201d he said. \u201cGive or take, 20 percent of our client base is doing something and adapting to this cultural shift. But we have seen a lot of clients only taking pieces of it when a holistic approach is needed. This will become more apparent as the model progresses over the next five years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/consumers-driving-price-transparency", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/milton_silva_low_res.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "To compete in an increasingly consumer-centric business environment, healthcare providers must develop pricing and billing matrices that explain in detail the type of services rendered and the assigned amounts.", "title": "Consumers driving price transparency"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/milton_silva_low_res.jpg"}, "title": "Consumers driving price transparency", "description": "To compete in an increasingly consumer-centric business environment, healthcare providers must develop pricing and billing matrices that explain in detail the type of services rendered and the assigned amounts.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "The days of cryptic invoicing are coming to an end for healthcare \u2013 or at it least they should be, financial experts say.&#13; To compete in an increasingly consumer-centric business environment, healthcare providers must develop pricing and billing matrices that explain in detail the type of services rendered and the assigned amounts.&#13; When given a choice of providers, consumers will gravitate toward organizations that give them a positive experience from intake to discharge, said Milton Silva-Craig, president of Chicago-based TransUnion Healthcare.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc947d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cConsumers want greater transparency in understanding their bill \u2013 historically there have been arcane bills that you can\u2019t figure out,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThirteen hospitals went bankrupt last year alone.\u201dStill, the price transparency movement is in its infancy and hospitals have some time to figure things out, Silva-Craig said.\nCost of avoidanceBecause of the external factors influencing healthcare, price transparency is not going away and those who aren\u2019t committed to doing something are flirting with financial disaster, Silva-Craig said.\n\u201cNo single factor is behind it, but there are a number of things in the industry that are making price transparency more visible, more important and more possible in terms of the new methods we have,\u201d he said.\nThere are some basic steps hospitals can take to improve transparency and it will eventually get to the point where transparency will require more line-item detail."}
