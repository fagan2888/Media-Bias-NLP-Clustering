The pools will open full-time June 7, after public schools are out of session.

The Mary T. Meagher Aquatic Center is an indoor pool that's open year-round.

Mike Stewart, a pool manager for Louisville Metro Parks, was chatting about the busy opening weekend for the Norton pool he oversees at Camp Taylor Memorial Park.

"It's a clean pool, a good environment — walk! — and a great place to cool off," Stewart said, punctuating his conversation as he frequently does, with reminders that running isn't allowed. "Oh, I'll be saying that around 30 times a day all summer."

All four of the city's outdoor pools opened Saturday and remained open through Memorial Day, an annual tradition that devotees look forward to all winter. The Norton, Algonquin, Fairdale and Sun Valley pools will open again May 31 and June 1, and then open full time starting June 7, after Jefferson Country Public Schools are out of session.

Georgetta Johnson and a friend had a group of five children at the Norton pool Monday afternoon and had begun the day with a picnic.

"This is a tradition for us," said Johnson, who lives near Camp Taylor Memorial Park. "We come out on the first day that they open and probably come up here about twice a month in the summer."

Scott Risinger, aquatic manager for Metro Parks, was checking out the scene at Norton, where around 125 swimmers and sunbathers were gathered. It had been a busy opening weekend at all four pools, he said, especially considering that the reopening of Kentucky Kingdom offered stiff competition.

"Today's been one of our better days since it's so sunny and hot," Risinger said. "We're always more busy when it's sunny, although we have some diehards who come out no matter what. Even with Kentucky Kingdom opening, this is a good day."

Stewart estimated that Norton had had between 150 and 200 visitors between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Monday. Norton's summer pool hours are 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., while Algonquin, Fairdale and Sun Valley pools will be daily from 1 to 6 p.m.

Admission is $2 for children 17 and under, and $3 for adults.

"We're cheap and we try to cater to families," Risinger said. "A lot of people will have picnics and then hit the pool."
