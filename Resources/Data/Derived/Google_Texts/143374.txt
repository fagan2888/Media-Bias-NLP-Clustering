U.S. adults seem to dislike the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) a little more now than they did this past summer, but they say they aren't giving PPACA all that much thought.

Analysts at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation have published data supporting those conclusions in a summary of results from a recent telephone survey of 1,201 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. The sample included 970 registered voters, including 382 Democrats, 335 Republicans and 324 independents.
