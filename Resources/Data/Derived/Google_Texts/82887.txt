Tax records for business personal property -- non real-estate assets that businesses are required to pay taxes on -- are now searchable online, thanks to recent upgrades of the Orleans Parish Assessor's website.

Businesses owners can also now fill out their personal property tax declarations, known as LAT 5s, online. To help owners navigate the new process, Orleans Parish Assessor Erroll Williams and Mickey Markey, who supervises collection of taxes on business personal property, are hosting a series of informational sessions.

Space is limited, so those interested in attending are encouraged to make reservations by phone, 504-897-6152, or online, bcodevin@aol.com.

The sessions are scheduled for:

Monday, March 2

9 a.m.-10 a.m., at City Hall, Room 4E01.

Wednesday, March 4
