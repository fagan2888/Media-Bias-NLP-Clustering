But we can judge a team only against its peers.\n\nAnd CSU-Pueblo is the class of Division II \u2014 the defending national champion. Saturday, the No. 6-ranked ThunderWolves hosted No. 7 Colorado Mines in a Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference game.\n\nSenior tailback Cameron McDondle, though, put some distance between Pueblo and Mines. His 308 yards rushing set a school record as he led the ThunderWolves (7-1, 6-0 RMAC) to a 49-21 victory over the Orediggers (7-1, 5-1) before 7,265 at the ThunderBowl.\n\n\u201cWe just kept punching for little yards, punching and punching,\u201d McDondle said, \u201cand they finally started to break open.\u201d\n\nMcDondle\u2019s 70-yard run with less than a minute left in the first half \u2014 up the middle and through the hands of four would-be tacklers \u2014 put Pueblo ahead 28-0. He also muscled out runs of 58 and 53 yards and scored twice.\n\n\u201cI gotta get some wheels so I can finish those runs,\u201d McDondle said with a laugh.\n\nPut it this way: Mines, with one of the most explosive offenses in the nation, gained 367 total yards in the game. But that was only 59 yards more than McDondle, a Columbine High School product, gained on the ground. Pueblo\u2019s total: 546.\n\nMines junior quarterback Justin Dvorak can sling the ball. His 34 touchdown plays (29 passing, five rushing) coming in led D-II.\n\nBut Pueblo blitzed Dvorak early and often, keeping Mines off the scoreboard in the first half. Six ThunderWolves defenders made tackles for a loss, led by Josh Croy\u2019s two for minus-8 yards. Dvorak finished 26-of-36 passing for 226 yards and one TD, an 8-yard scoring toss to Cole Spurgeon early in the second half.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a dangerous quarterback when he gets out and scrambles,\u201d Pueblo coach John Wristen said. \u201cWe tried to keep him in the pocket, then rally to the ball.\u201d\n\nDvorak left late in the third quarter with an apparent concussion after he was hit in the head while sliding on a scramble.\n\nPueblo piled on with two more McDondle TDs \u2014 from Cameron\u2019s younger brother, sophomore Bernard, who scored on runs of 5 and 7 yards in the third quarter to put the T-Wolves up 42-7, their biggest lead.\n\nPueblo improved to 12-4 against ranked teams in Wristen\u2019s eight-year tenure, including 4-1 against teams in the top 10. And the T-Wolves won a fifth consecutive game over Mines.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of respect for what Mines does. We just got on a roll there,\u201d Wristen said.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No. 6 CSU-Pueblo routs No. 7 Colorado Mines in rival RMAC test", "title": "No. 6 CSU-Pueblo routs No. 7 Colorado Mines in rival RMAC test", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/24/no-6-csu-pueblo-routs-no-7-colorado-mines-in-rival-rmac-test/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-24T18:52:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-24T18:52:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI gotta get some wheels so I can finish those runs,\u201d McDondle said with a laugh.\nSure, if Colorado State went head to head with CSU-Pueblo, the Rams probably would win.\nBut Pueblo blitzed Dvorak early and often, keeping Mines off the scoreboard in the first half.\nSenior tailback Cameron McDondle, though, put some distance between Pueblo and Mines.\nPut it this way: Mines, with one of the most explosive offenses in the nation, gained 367 total yards in the game."}
