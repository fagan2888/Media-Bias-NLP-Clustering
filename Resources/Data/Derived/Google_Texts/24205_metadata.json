For example, the poll shows President Obama\u2019s approval rating at a seven-month high and approval of Obama\u2019s economic stewardship is now at its highest level since 2009. Making matters worse, support for the Affordable Care Act has reached an all-time high for any Fox News poll and a plurality of respondents now believe Obamacare will end up being \u201ca good thing for the country.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s question #27 that jumped out at me.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the Benghazi terrorist attacks, the Obama administration incorrectly claimed it was a spontaneous assault in response to an online video, even though the administration had intelligence reports that the attacks were connected to terrorist groups tied to al Qaeda. Do you think the Obama administration knowingly lied about the attacks to help the president during the ongoing re-election campaign, or not?\u201d\n\nR emember, this is a question in a poll conducted by an ostensible news organization. It effectively asks, \u201cThe administration totally lied. Do you think the administration knowingly lied?\u201d\n\nMaking matters worse, Fox News isn\u2019t just offering a case study in how not to conduct a legitimate poll, it\u2019s also failing in other important ways.\n\nFor example, despite claims the poll presents as fact, the truth remains that the online video did play a role in motivating the initial attacks. and despite multiple investigations, there\u2019s literally nothing to suggest administration officials deliberately tried to mislead anyone.\n\nW hat\u2019s more, note the responses to the poll \u2013 even after Fox News told poll respondents that the administration lied, when asked whether the administration lied, only 51% agreed. That\u2019s obviously a majority, but when questions are manipulated to generate a specific response, the results are supposed to be even more one-sided.\n\nIn contrast, the Fox News poll found that 63% of respondents believe congressional Republicans are pursuing this story for partisan gain, not because they\u2019re interested in the truth.\n\nFox News\u2019 habit of playing political games with its polling has been ongoing for a while . I first noted it back in March 2007, when the network\u2019s poll asked, in all seriousness, \u201cDo you think the Democratic Party should allow a grassroots organization like Moveon.org to take it over or should it resist this type of takeover?\u201d Soon after, another Fox poll asked, \u201cDo you think illegal immigrants from Mexico should be given special treatment and allowed to jump in front of immigrants from other countries that want to come to the United States legally, or not?\u201d\n\nIn 2009, a Fox poll asked, \u201cDo you think the United Nations should be in charge of the worldwide effort to combat climate change and the United States should report to the United Nations on this effort, or should it be up to individual countries and the United States would be allowed to make decisions on its own?\u201d\n\nIn March 2013, a Fox poll asked, \u201cFormer President George W. Bush stopped golfing after the start of the Iraq war. Do you think President Barack Obama should stop golfing until the unemployment rate improves and the economy is doing better?\u201d\n\nIn June 2013, a Fox News poll claimed, \u201cThe Internal Revenue Service admitted it targeted Tea Party and conservative groups for extra scrutiny,\u201d despite the fact that this isn\u2019t what the IRS said.\n\nProfessional news organizations put a great deal of care into how they word polling questions.
