When it comes to obesity treatment, however, the only ways you can really lose weight is through exercise, eating well, some weight medications, or bariatric surgery.\n\nA new study out of Yale, however, has found that preventing obesity and diabetes could lie in the process of keeping a nuclear receptor from being activated in the brain. The study, published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, found that blocking a nuclear receptor called PPARgamma in some brain cells in mice resulted in the animals eating less and thus not gaining weight. The mice became somewhat resistant to a high-fat diet, the authors say.\n\n\u201cThese animals ate fat and sugar, and did not gain weight, while their control littermates gained weight on the same diet,\u201d said Sabrina Diano, professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Science at Yale School of Medicine, in a press release. \u201cWe showed that the PPARgamma receptor in neurons that produce POMC could control responses to a high-fat diet without resulting in obesity.\u201d Nuclear receptors are a type of protein found in particular cells that are responsible for monitoring steroid and thyroid hormones. They are in charge of development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism.\n\nThe researchers focused on POMC neurons, which are found in the hypothalamus, and regulate food and fullness. When POMC neurons are activated, they trigger a sense of fullness and end up curbing your appetite. PPARgamma, on the other hand, regulates POMC neurons; the researchers hypothesized that if the former were blocked, it might lead to an increase in POMC neurons, which would make you feel full more often. \u201cWhen we blocked PPARgamma in these hypothalamic cells, we found an increased level of free radical formation in POMC neurons, and they were more active,\u201d Diano said.\n\nThe study might also have a positive effect on diabetes research. A certain class of drugs used to treat diabetes, known as thiazolidinedione (TZD), lower blood-glucose levels but still cause patients to unfortunately gain weight. The authors found that targeting PPARgamma might be able to prevent TZD from triggering weight gain.\n\n\u201cOur study suggests that the increased weight gain in diabetic patients treated with TZD could be due to the effect of this drug in the brain, therefore, targeting peripheral PPARgamma to treat type 2 diabetes should be done by developing TZD compounds that can\u2019t penetrate the brain,\u201d Diano said. \u201cWe could keep the benefits of TZD without the side effects of weight gain. Our next step is to test this theory in diabetes mouse models.\u201d\n\nBefore an obesity therapy is developed, however, many overweight patients might have to stick to the natural cure of exercise and diet.\n\nSource: Diano S, Horvath T, Long L, Toda C, Jeong JK.
