One month after being sentenced to life in prison, the Aurora theater shooting gunman has been moved to the Colorado State Penitentiary, prisons officials said Friday.

James Holmes is being moved to a single cell and is considered a “closed custody offender,” said Adrienne Jacobson, a Colorado Department of Corrections spokeswoman. “He is not in maximum-security status housing.”

Holmes was convicted of killing 12 people and wounding 70 others in an Aurora movie theater July 20, 2012. A jury last month rejected the death penalty and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

He will be housed at the penitentiary “until a suitable management control unit within the department is located,” the corrections department said in a release.
