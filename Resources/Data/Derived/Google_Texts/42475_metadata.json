It's just to get people out there and on the scene.\"\n\nParticipants who complete the list can show their selfies to Erie Community Center staff members to redeem a prize. The town does not plan to collect or post the selfie images, Buller said.\n\n\"The goal is to focus on setting trends instead of following them, making 2014 the year people go outside, change their outlook and get involved in their community through parks and recreation,\" Buller said.\n\nBuller said participants are encouraged to walk, run or bike to the designated locations, but any means of transportation is acceptable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Most of the locations are easy to get to,\" she said. \"There's a couple that you have to go to by foot or by bike, but however you get there is OK. If nothing else, hopefully it will get people to get out to different parts of Erie.\"\n\nScavenger hunt forms are available at the Erie Community Center, 450 Powers St., or on the town's website, erieco.gov.\n\nErie Mayor Tina Harris on June 24 proclaimed July to be Parks and Recreation Month in Erie. The scavenger hunt is just one of the unique ways the town will celebrate the month.\n\nBuller said the town also will distribute unannounced awards throughout July to residents \"caught in the act\" of using Erie's parks and recreation facilities.\n\nContact Colorado Hometown Weekly staff writer Doug Pike at 720-648-5022 or piked@coloradohometownweekly.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.coloradohometownweekly.com/news/erie/ci_26054257/erie-recreation-department-host-selfie-scavenger-hunt", "modificationDate": "2014-06-29T09:51:55-0600", "sailthru.section": "News", "sailthru.author": "By Doug Pike ,  Colorado Hometown Weekly", "description": "Some Colorado communities host \"Turn Off the TV Week\" or \"Unplug\" programs to encourage their residents to get out from behind their technology and be active.", "ag": {"canon": "ColoradoHometownWeekly:article:26054257:view"}, "startDate": "2014-06-29T14:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.coloradohometownweekly.com/news/erie/ci_26054257/erie-recreation-department-host-selfie-scavenger-hunt", "image": "http://local.coloradohometownweekly.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/coloradohometownweekly.png", "type": "article", "description": "Some Colorado communities host \"Turn Off the TV Week\" or \"Unplug\" programs to encourage their residents to get out from behind their technology and be active.", "title": "Erie Recreation Department to host 'selfie' scavenger hunt"}, "twitter": {"domain": "coloradohometownweekly.com", "description": "Some Colorado communities host \"Turn Off the TV Week\" or \"Unplug\" programs to encourage their residents to get out from behind their technology and be active.", "title": "Erie Recreation Department to host 'selfie' scavenger hunt", "url": "http://www.coloradohometownweekly.com/news/erie/ci_26054257/erie-recreation-department-host-selfie-scavenger-hunt", "image": "http://local.coloradohometownweekly.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/coloradohometownweekly.png", "site": "@CoHoWeekly", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-29T14:00:00-0600", "endDate": "2024-06-28T15:51:33-0600", "sailthru.title": "Erie Recreation Department to host 'selfie' scavenger hunt", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Doug Pike,", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "7TSeYPRgZBWsXyuMByACVgSzAN7YTLFkMDnQzqUDAg4", "sailthru.site": "coloradohometownweekly.com", "pubDate": "2014-06-28T15:56:34-0600", "news_keywords": "Erie news, Lafayette news, Louisville news, Superio news, ColoradoColorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, local school news, entertainment news, events, nightlife, us news, Colorado Hometown Weekly"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb32d\"", "article_summary": "Erie Parks and Recreation Director Farrell Buller said the department came up with the selfie scavenger hunt as a fun way to get residents outside to see their town.\nBut in honor of National Parks and Recreation Month, which takes place during July, the Erie Parks and Recreation Department is encouraging residents to tote their smart phones or tablets with them as they embark on a \"selfie\" scavenger hunt.\nErie Mayor Tina Harris on June 24 proclaimed July to be Parks and Recreation Month in Erie.\nScavenger hunt forms are available at the Erie Community Center, 450 Powers St., or on the town's website, erieco.gov.\nThe theme of the 2014 National Parks and Recreation Month is \"Out Is In.\""}
