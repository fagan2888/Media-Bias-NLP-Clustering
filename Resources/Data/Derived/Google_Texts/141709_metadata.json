The bill would appropriate $170-740 million annually in taxpayer funds in part to grant illegal aliens Medi-Cal coverage.\n\nCalifornians from a number of organizations around the state traveled to Sacramento to oppose the bill in the hearing. Reports from those in attendance noted that filming was not allowed. Those present estimated 40 speaking out in support of SB 4, and 24 in opposition to the bill.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBreitbart News\u2019 Adelle Nazarian previously reported on the State Senate\u2019s passage of SB 4, specifying that the bill \u201cwould allow for illegal aliens in California to purchase health insurance through Covered California, pending a federal waiver; allow for illegal alien children aged 19 and under to enroll in Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s insurance program for the poor; and allow for a limited number of adults aged 19 and over to enroll in the Medi-Cal program as state funding is made available.\u201d\n\nExpert witnesses appearing in opposition to SB 4 were, \u201cChannel Temple, Spokesperson for the Black Community, Patrice Lynes, RN, Betty Robinson, RN, Dr. Robert Newman and former banking VP Janet West,\u201d according to attendee Robin Hvidson.\n\nSenator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens), lead author of SB 4, has promoted the bill as bipartisan, despite Republican support from only two Senators in a prior vote, as reported by Breitbart News.\n\nOver 12 million California residents participate in Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s healthcare welfare system, which has been overloaded with the current Obamacare-related enrollment.\n\nLara commented at an immigration roundtable forum, \u201cI am very proud that Republicans continue to join us in assuring that we educate our immigrants\u2026that we incorporate them into our communities.\u201d\n\nLara claimed, \u201cEvery immigration bill that has come out of Sacramento comes with Republican support and that is is part because of our work that we\u2019ve done to educate our Republican elected officials.\u201d He then painted the Tea Party as the \u201cfringe.\u201d\n\nTwo of the group\u2019s members stopped at the Kate Steinle memorial, according to Hvidson. One called the site a \u201challowed and profound memorial.\u201d\n\nSteinle is the young woman killed at Pier 14 in San Francisco on July 1 by a five-time deported, seven-time convicted felon illegal alien.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Citizen Lobbyists Fight Back Against Medi-Cal for Illegal Aliens", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Citizen Lobbyists Fight Back Against Medi-Cal for Illegal Aliens", "title": "Citizen Lobbyists Fight Back Against Medi-Cal for Illegal Aliens - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-15-at-2.10.40-PM.png", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-07-15T14:12:26-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/07/15/citizen-lobbyists-fight-back-against-medi-cal-for-illegal-aliens/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Citizen Lobbyists Fight Back Against Medi-Cal for Illegal Aliens", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-15-at-2.10.40-PM.png", "title": "Citizen Lobbyists Fight Back Against Medi-Cal for Illegal Aliens - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "border, illegal alien, illegal immigration, kate steinle, kathryn steinle, medi-cal, SB 4, Sen.
