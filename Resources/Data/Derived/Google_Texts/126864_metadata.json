The unemployment rate is now once again at pre-recession levels \u2013 the lowest in seven years (5.5%).\u201d\n\nStreisand blasts Republicans\u2019 relentless \u201copposition\u201d to Obama\u2019s purported efforts to save American workers.\n\nUnfortunately, the \u201cgood news\u201d from Streisand, the renowned economist, is indeed news to the 93 million Americans currently out of work.\n\nAs WND reported just last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the number of Americans 16 years and older who did not participate in the labor force rose from 92,898,000 in February to a record high of 93,175,000 in March.\n\nIt was first time the number of Americans out of the labor force has exceeded 93 million.\n\nWhat do YOU think? What planet does Barbra Streisand live on? Sound off in today\u2019s WND poll!\n\nIn fact, the 5.5 percent unemployment rate Streisand cites doesn\u2019t indicate Americans are finally back to work. It means so many have given up hope of getting jobs that they aren\u2019t even counted as \u201cunemployed\u201d anymore.\n\nThe labor force participation rate plunged from 62.8 percent to 62.7 percent from February to March. Nearly 100,000 more Americans dropped out of the labor force last month.\n\nBut take heart, America.\n\nBabs has more \u201cgood news\u201d: \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s Administration, with only opposition from the Republicans, has steadily helped put more than 11 million Americans back to work in the private sector.\u201d\n\nBut is 11 million jobs really a robust milestone worthy of praise \u2013 and an indicator that Republicans should be thrown out of office for their \u201copposition\u201d \u2013 as Streisand suggests?\n\nAccording to a Forbes analysis of the issue, \u201cPresident Reagan entered office in a period of high inflation which was stamped out by high interest rates that in turn led to the 1982 recession. His job-creation record after that may fairly be termed outstanding: nearly 20 million more Americans were employed when he left office than when the recession ended. Overall, including the recession on his watch, Reagan\u2019s net job growth over eight years was 16.1 million.\u201d\n\nForbes added, \u201cCharting Obama and Reagan\u2019s job-creation against overall U.S. population increases makes the picture look even worse for Obama, and the Reagan-era U.S. had a much smaller population.\u201d\n\nAnd through his executive amnesty, the Daily Caller notes, Obama \u201cis giving out one work permit for every two jobs created since his inauguration.\u201d\n\nStreisand is known for her long history of leftist advocacy and exaltation of Obama \u2013 even comparing him to \u201cgods\u201d and \u201ckings\u201d in a September 2014 interview with the Associated Press:\n\n\u201cI think we have advanced with Obama, and I think people are giving him a hard time, which is not fair because this Affordable Care Act is working and it\u2019s going to help a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like Greek tragedy, you know, they always try to bring down the gods, bring down the kings, bring down the leaders.\u201d\n\nShe has even dubbed Obama \u201cmore fiscally conservative\u201d than his recent GOP predecessors.\n\nIn 2012, Streisand declared, \u201cCompared to George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, Obama has been more fiscally conservative than any other president in recent history, with the exception of President Bill Clinton.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Barbra Streisand may not be the brightest star in Hollywood.
