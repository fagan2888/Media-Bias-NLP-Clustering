The new business called \"SMRxT\" specializes in sensors that tell patients when to take their medication \u2014 and how much to take.\n\nThe move is part of the Orlando Economic Development Commission\u2019s plan to attract more tech businesses to the area.\n\nDave Porter, senior vice president of the commission, said it took a year to secure SMRxT\u2019s move with help from partners like IQ Orlando, which is dedicated to bringing life science and health care-related businesses to Orlando.\n\n\u201cThese things aren\u2019t easy,\" Porter said. \"Competition for these types of projects is fierce. And so, we\u2019re very fortunate to land a technology company like this in life sciences.\u201d\n\nThe company has 10 employees, but plans to add 55 more jobs by the end of 2017 when its manufacturing operations will be fully moved to Orlando. SMRxT\u2019s president Mike Huffer is expecting to cut costs nearly 40 percent.\n\n\u201cTo get a life science company like this to come here will have a big impact and probably attract other life science companies to notice Orlando as a place to do business,\u201d Porter said.\n\nHe adds that the Orlando Economic Development Commission is working to attract other tech companies in aerospace, defense, and advanced manufacturing.\n\n--Renata Sago is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
