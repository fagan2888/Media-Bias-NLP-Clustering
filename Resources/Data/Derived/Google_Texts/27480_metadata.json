That degree of difficulty increased on January 1, 2014. That\u2019s the date when new regulations of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) kicked in that govern how hospitals can collect money from patients or extend financial aid to them.\n\nNon-profit hospitals need to pay attention to the new requirements set forth by the ACA law. It is likely that these new rules will affect most hospital laboratory managers and hospital-based pathology organizations. That\u2019s because these new rules will affect six out of 10 of the nation\u2019s hospitals.\n\nRules Establish Limits on How Hospitals May Collect Money from Patients\n\nUnder the new ACA regulations, hospital governing boards will be forced to approve policies that set new limits on collection efforts. These regulations also require facilities to make a reasonable effort to identify patients eligible for financial aid, noted a report published by Modern Healthcare.\n\nThese new rules came in response to arrogant collection practices. Legal actions such as property liens filed by some non-profit hospitals prompted public outrage and investigations by state and federal regulators. This ACA mandate emphasizes the public\u2019s higher expectation that non-profit hospitals exist for the greater good of society, rather than for generating profits. This was the rationale for providing them tax breaks in the first place, noted the Modern Healthcare article.\n\nNon-profit Hospitals Failing to Comply Could Lose Tax-exempt Status\n\nThe stakes for hospitals covered by the new ACA regulations are high: failing to comply will jeopardize the hospital\u2019s tax-exempt status. Under ACA, patients who cannot afford to pay must be identified before the hospital can take legal action to:\n\n1) collect the debt;\n\n2) report them to consumer credit bureaus; or,\n\n3) sell their debt to collection companies.\n\n\u201cWillful and flagrant violations\u201d will result in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stripping away the violator\u2019s tax breaks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be even more sure that someone [a patient] doesn\u2019t qualify for charity before they end up in bad debt or the collection process,\u201d explained Keith Hearle, President of Alexandria, Virginia-based Verite Healthcare Consulting.\n\nOnus of Enrolling Poor Patients in Financial Aid Shifting to Hospitals\n\nHearle further noted that states are pushing for so-called \u201cpresumptive enrollment.\u201d One example is the state of Illinois. It will soon require hospitals to establish presumptive eligibility policies for financial aid. Illinois will mandate that hospitals try to enroll patients using public data when possible. As a result, some hospitals have already implemented presumptive enrollment policies.\n\nOne example is St. Louis-based BJC HealthCare, which operates 13 hospitals in Illinois and Missouri. It established a safety net through its presumptive charity-care process, according to Kim Kitson, BJC spokesperson. \u201cThis process is based on a formula and implemented through a third-party provider to screen for patients who have a financial need, but were not identified during the initial encounter,\u201d she explained.\n\nHoping to Dramatically Reduce Patient Bad Debt\n\nBJC hopes this program dramatically reduces BJC\u2019s bad debt. In 2011, an estimated 93% of uncollectible accounts was attributed to patients who would likely have qualified for financial assistance, according to the Modern Healthcare report.\n\nFederal Tax forms ask hospitals to estimate the amount of bad debt that most likely is attributable to patients who could have qualified for financial aid but did not receive it. However, the IRS does not consider bad debt a subsidized service to the community. While some hospitals deny that potentially needy patients are among their uncollectable accounts, others admit that most unpaid bills are for patients who could have qualified for aid but did not apply.\n\n\u201cFor me, that is a system failure,\u201d observed Michael Fine, a Healthcare and Tax Attorney in the Chicago office of the global law firm of McDermott, Will and Emery. He jointly chairs the firm\u2019s Tax Exemption Group. \u201cIt\u2019s time to revamp the way you [hospital boards] go about addressing financial assistance.\u201d That means adopting new policies, he added, stressing that under new rules, the \u201csame old boiler-plate, cookie-cutter policies [for collections and financial assistance] won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nMost low-income, or \u201cworking poor,\u201d patients will benefit, from the new ACA rules, stated Jessica Curtis, Director of the Hospital Accountability Project for Community Catalyst, a national nonprofit consumer advocacy group. She explained in the Modern Healthcare report that previously hospital patients had to be aware of financial aid and negotiate to pay the hospital bills they could afford. Curtis went on to say that Healthcare Reform shifts the burden of identifying and enrolling eligible patients in financial aid programs from patients to hospitals.\n\nThe Implication of Financial Rules for Laboratories and Pathology Groups\n\nClinical laboratories and pathology groups should realize the implications of new ACA rules on their own organizations: patients who cannot afford to pay their share of a hospital bill most likely cannot afford to pay for the balance on bills for services by other providers. Therefore, clinical laboratories and pathologists may want to consider a patient\u2019s ability pay in their own billing and collection practices.\n\nFurthermore, with government health insurance exchanges offering low-cost, high-deductible plans and employers increasingly shifting employees to higher deductible insurance plans, most healthcare providers recognize the potential for increased levels of uncollectible debt owed by patients. This is one more reason why clinical laboratories may want to collect deductibles from patients at the time when specimens are collected, whenever possible.\n\n\u2014Patricia Kirk\n\nRelated Information:\n\nAcross the board: Affordable Care Act prompting hospital trustees to pay closer attention to policies on patient billing, collection and bad debt\n\nObamacare Won\u2019t Offer Relief On Bad Debt For Hospitals\n\nACA-compliant plans may not help hospitals cut bad debt\n\nTo Handle Increased Bad Debt by Patients in High-Deductible Health Plans, Hospitals Are Offering Loan Programs\n\nEven under ACA, hospital bad debt could mount Hospitals must become more adept at collections", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory, affordable care act, aca, nonprofit hospital, collection practices, internal revenue service, irs, financial aid, charity care, presumptive enrollment, keith hearle, verite healthcare consulting, bjc healthcare, kim kitson, michael fine, mcdermott will and emery, jessica curtis, community catalyst, healthcare reform, high-deductible plan, insurance exchange, uncollectible debt, bad debt   ,aca,affordable care act,bad debt,bjc healthcare,charity care,clinical laboratory,collection practices,community catalyst,financial aid,healthcare reform,high-deductible plan,insurance exchange,internal revenue service,irs,jessica curtis,keith hearle,kim kitson,mcdermott will and emery,medical laboratory,michael fine,nonprofit hospital,presumptive enrollment,uncollectible debt,verite healthcare consulting,coding, billing, and collections,laboratory news,laboratory operations,laboratory pathology,managed care contracts & payer reimbursement,management & operations", "description": "On January 1, 2014, nonprofit hospitals became subject to new collection and financial aid requirements under the Affordable Care Act.
