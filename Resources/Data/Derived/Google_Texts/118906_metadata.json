So close to a big playoff win, Jeff Gordon was left with a cut on his lip.\n\nThe Chase for the Sprint Cup championship took another intense turn Sunday night when Gordon and Keselowski were a part of a brawl after Jimmie Johnson won his third consecutive Texas fall race.\n\nJohnson emerged from a frantic finish, the second attempt at an overtime two-lap sprint to the finish after his teammate Gordon spun out from the front after contact with Keselowski.\n\nWhile Johnson celebrated his fourth victory at Texas and 70th Sprint Cup win overall, fireworks exploded in the sky \u2014 and on pit road.\n\nAn irate Gordon stopped his car right by Keselowski and confronted him. There were plenty of punches thrown in the melee, with NASCAR officials in the middle of crew members and others around the Keselowski\u2019s No. 2 car.\n\nGordon was leading on a restart on lap 335, one more than the race\u2019s scheduled length, when he took the outside lane. When Gordon drifted up a bit, Keselowski pushed through the gap, and made contact that left Gordon\u2019s car with a cut tire.\n\n\u201cWe were just racing for the win. I didn\u2019t wreck him, and just raced him hard. He left a hole. Everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you\u2019re supposed to go for it,\u201d said Keselowski, who appeared to be spitting blood after the post-race brawl. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ruin anyone\u2019s day. I wanted to win the race and that was the opportunity. It just didn\u2019t come together.\u201d\n\nGordon said he was on older tires when \u201cout of nowhere I got slammed by the 2.\u201d He then used an expletive in referring to Keselowski, who finished third.\n\n\u201cThe way he races, I don\u2019t know how he ever won a championship. This is why everyone is fighting with him,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any conversation. You can\u2019t have a conversation with him. There\u2019s big consequences. To me, it\u2019s just a bunch of crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head.\u201d\n\nGordon spun out, lost a lap in the pits, and finished 29th.\n\nIt was the second time in the last four races that another driver confronted Keselowski after the checkered flag.\n\nJohnson, who beat Chase contender Kevin Harvick by a half-second, described Texas as intense and said he was sure it was \u201chighly entertaining.\u201d He said he couldn\u2019t wait to go back and watch the tape.\n\nHarvick appeared to shove Keselowski into the fray, and crew members started throwing punches.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to race like that, you\u2019re going to have to man up at some point,\u201d Harvick said afterward. \u201cI didn\u2019t get in the middle of anything. I just turned him around and told him to go fight his own fight.\u201d\n\nJohnson, the six-time Cup champion who was eliminated after the second round in the new Chase format, led 191 of the 341 laps.\n\nThe next highest-finishing Chase contenders at Texas were Carl Edwards in ninth and Denny Hamlin 10th.\n\nTexas was the second consecutive Chase race won by a driver already eliminated from title contention. That means at least three drivers will advance on points to get into the final four in the season finale at Homestead in two weeks.\n\nThe third round of the Chase wraps up next Sunday in Phoenix, where Harvick won eight months ago in the second race of the season. Matt Kenseth and Hamlin were the only of the eight Chase contenders to finish outside the top eight in that race.\n\nJoey Logano finished 12th at Texas, but is listed first in points while having the same number as Hamlin and two more than Ryan Newman. Gordon is fourth, a point ahead of Kenseth and Carl Edwards, followed by Keselowski and Harvick \u2014 though there is only an 18-point gap between first and eighth place.\n\nKyle Busch finished fourth, though he never really threatened in his bid to complete his second career NASCAR weekend trifecta. Busch slipped early in the field, and was able to move up only during a late series of cautions.\n\nBusch won the Nationwide Series race at the high-banked, 1 1/2-mile track Saturday after starting the weekend with a victory in the Camping World Truck Series race Friday night. He started ninth in the Cup race.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jeff Gordon angry with Brad Keselowski after Jimmie Johnson\u2019s win", "title": "Jeff Gordon angry with Brad Keselowski after Jimmie Johnson\u2019s win", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/02/jeff-gordon-angry-with-brad-keselowski-after-jimmie-johnsons-win/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141102__jimmie-johnsonp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141102__jimmie-johnsonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-02T19:28:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:36:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe216f\"", "article_summary": "So close to a big playoff win, Jeff Gordon was left with a cut on his lip.\nTexas was the second consecutive Chase race won by a driver already eliminated from title contention.\nThe third round of the Chase wraps up next Sunday in Phoenix, where Harvick won eight months ago in the second race of the season.\nWhen Gordon drifted up a bit, Keselowski pushed through the gap, and made contact that left Gordon\u2019s car with a cut tire.\nWhile Johnson celebrated his fourth victory at Texas and 70th Sprint Cup win overall, fireworks exploded in the sky \u2014 and on pit road."}
