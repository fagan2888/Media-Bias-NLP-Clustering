This is a high-stakes, high-risk election.\"\n\n\"This is a knife-edge election and can only be cut two ways: Conservative or Labour,\" Cameron said. \"Britain on the rise or turning the clock back.\"\n\nThe campaign officially kicks off Monday, when Parliament is dissolved before the May 7 vote. Polls suggest neither the Conservatives nor Labour will win a majority of seats.\n\nIn a sign the close-fought battle will be bruising, Cameron launched a personal attack on Labour leader Ed Miliband.\n\n\"I know what this role needs \u2014 and frankly, I don't think Ed Miliband has it,\" Cameron said.\n\n\"Some people might say, 'Don't make this personal,' but when it comes to who's prime minister, the personal is national.\"\n\nCameron slammed Miliband's left-of-center party as a \"bunch of hypocritical, holier-than-thou, hopeless, sneering socialists.\"\n\nMiliband launched his election campaign Friday from the top of London's Orbit tower, promising to preserve the cash-strapped National Health Service.\n\nCameron also made the NHS a key issue, vowing that his government would ensure people had access to doctors and hospital services seven days a week.\n\n\u0081\"With a future Conservative government, we would have a truly seven-day NHS,\" Cameron said \u2014 though he didn't outline how he would pay for it.\n\nCameron's coalition government has cut billions in spending in a bid to curb the country's deficit, and he says austerity measures will continue in a second term.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister David Cameron said Saturday that Britain's election campaign is on a knife edge, as he rallied the Conservative party with a...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-03-29 22:25:04 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister David Cameron said Saturday that Britain's election campaign is on a knife edge, as he rallied the Conservative party with a...", "title": "David Cameron Rallies Party Before 'Knife Edge' Election", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/28/britain-cameron-rally-election_n_6962878.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2776162/images/o-DAVID-CAMERON-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@theworldpost", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2776162/images/o-DAVID-CAMERON-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister David Cameron said Saturday that Britain's election campaign is on a knife edge, as he rallied the Conservative party with a...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "David Cameron Rallies Party Before 'Knife Edge' Election"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-28 22:25:04 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6962878", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "world", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "david cameron,david cameron british election,British election,great britian election,british prime minister election,Conservative party britain,united kingdom election,labour party,labour party election,UK Election,uk david cameron,united kingdon election david cameron", "article": {"section": "WorldPost", "tag": "david cameron,david cameron british election,British election,great britian election,british prime minister election,Conservative party britain,united kingdom election,labour party,labour party election,UK Election,uk david cameron,united kingdon election david cameron", "published_time": "2015-03-28 22:25:04 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-03-28 22:59:02 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Christopher Furlong via Getty ImagesLONDON (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister David Cameron said Saturday that Britain's election campaign is on a knife edge, as he rallied the Conservative party with a personal attack on his main rival.\nMiliband launched his election campaign Friday from the top of London's Orbit tower, promising to preserve the cash-strapped National Health Service.\n\"This is a knife-edge election and can only be cut two ways: Conservative or Labour,\" Cameron said.\n\"Some people might say, 'Don't make this personal,' but when it comes to who's prime minister, the personal is national.\"\nCameron told a party rally that \"this isn't any election."}
