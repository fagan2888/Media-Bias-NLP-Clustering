They need another 200 volunteers to sign up for the inaugural MealPack event for Feed My Starving Children, a Christian nonprofit hunger relief organization based in Coon Rapids, Minn., that helps communities in developing countries become self-sustaining.\n\n\"You spend a little time, and you make a huge impact,\" said Dowdy, team lead and co-founder of the event.\n\nDowdy and Zonnefeld co-founded Northern Colorado Outreach in Fort Collins last year to connect volunteers with nonprofits and to promote the Meal Pack event. For the event, Northern Colorado Outreach partnered with Northern Colorado Shares, a Fort Collins nonprofit that works on a new project or with an organization every 90 days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, more than 2,500 volunteers signed up to work in two-hour shifts in teams of eight to assemble meals specifically formulated for malnourished children. The meals will be sent to areas that cannot grow sustainable food and face high starvation levels.\n\nTo assemble the meals, the volunteers will measure and scoop the ingredients into bags, which they will seal and put in shipping boxes, with each volunteer packing an average of 216 meals per session. The bags include four meals with dehydrated rice, soy, protein and vegetables as part of the manna rice packs.\n\n\"We have been absolutely blown away by the response, the interest level and willingness for people to come up here in the northern Colorado region and participate in this event,\" Dowdy said.\n\nThere will be 18 packing stations, and 360 volunteers working on any given shift.\n\n\"It's a fun, high energy event,\" Dowdy said.\n\nNorthern Colorado Outreach and NOCOShares aim to pack 500,000 meals over the two days and a third shift added March 1, and they need to raise $60,000 to help pay for the ingredients. Each meal costs 22 cents.\n\nSo far, the two organizations raised $45,000 and have eight corporate donors for the event.\n\nThe billionth meal was sent out last year.\n\nShelley Widhalm: 970-669-5050, swidhalm@reporter-herald.com, twitter.com/ShelleyWidhalm", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/lifestyles/neighbors/ci_27533371/slammin-famine-help-needed", "sailthru.section": "Neighbors", "sailthru.author": "By Shelley Widhalm \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "When Eric Dowdy saw volunteers  energized after spending two hours packing meals for starving children, he knew he had to get a program started in Loveland.
