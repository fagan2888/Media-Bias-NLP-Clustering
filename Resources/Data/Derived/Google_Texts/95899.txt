A Robersonville policeman was injured in a crash late Friday while on his way to help out his partner.

Highway Patrol tells us they received the call around 11:30 last night when troopers were working a checkpoint on NC 903 near the Martin-Pitt County line.

Officer Aaron Carmichael was driving on West Green Street in his patrol car when he lost control, went off to the right of the road, and hit a tree head-on, according to troopers.

Sgt. Kip Sales says Carmichael was heading to help his partner who was involved in a foot chase with a suspect over a drug violation.

Sales says the officer's face hit the windshield.

We're told no other people were involved in the crash.

Robersonville police say Carmichael had a broken right femur and dislocated left hip. Carmichael had surgery this morning at Vidant Medical Center in Greenville.

He is listed in fair condition.

Sales says no citations were given, and the crash is still being investigated.
