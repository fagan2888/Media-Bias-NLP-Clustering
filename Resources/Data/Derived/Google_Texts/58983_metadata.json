The board\u2019s powers are significant, and some say completely unconstitutional, because language in the ACA frees the board from any kind of congressional or judicial oversight.\n\nThe board, which many in the right-wing have labeled the ACA\u2019s \u201cdeath panel\u201d after Sarah Palin coined the term in 2009, would be able to set Medicare policy and health care payment rates for virtually all Americans starting in 2017. Language in the ACA even prevents Congress from being able to repeal the IPAB\u2019s existence after that same year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really and truly an unprecedented concentration of power,\u201d said Christina Sandefur, an lawyer at the Goldwater Institute in Phoenix, Ariz., who argued the case June 10 before the 9th Circuit Court.\n\nThose challenging the legitimacy of the IPAB in the Coons v. Law lawsuit argue that it is unconstitutional for a variety of reasons \u2014 in particular, they say it violates the Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, while also running afoul of the separation of powers that are enshrined throughout the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIt consolidates the powers of every single branch of government into one body, and yet it is unaccountable to any of those branches,\u201d Sandefur told Watchdog.org on Friday.\n\nUnder the provisions of the ACA, the board would be made up of 15 presidential appointees. But in an interesting twist, all the powers of IPAB would revert to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services if the president does not appoint anyone to the board.\n\nSo far, no appointments have been made.\n\nBut last week\u2019s oral arguments in San Francisco only glossed over many of the deeper, constitutional issues at play in the IPAB case.\n\nThat\u2019s because courts are unwilling to except legal challenges until someone has been harmed by the entity being challenged, which has proven to be the major hurtle in the IPAB case.\n\nPlaintiffs say that is the case.\n\nDr. Erik Novack, an Arizona orthopedic surgeon, is one of those plaintiffs. Because many of his patients are on Medicaid, Novack claims he will face declining reimbursement rates from IPAB decrees.\n\nAttorneys defending the federal law have argued the court should not consider the case \u201cripe\u201d until members of the board are appointed and it begins functioning.\n\nIt was mostly on those grounds that the case was dismissed in Demceber by U.S. District Court Judge G. Murrey Snow.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s claim is unripe insofar as they argue that they will be forced to disclose confidential medical information to third parties,\u201d Snow wrote.\n\nOn appeal, the issue of ripeness will be the first thing the three-judge panel in the 9th Circuit will have to decide, but there is no timetable for a decision.\n\nIf a majority of the panel sees the case as ripe, the judges will then move on to the constitutional questions. Eventually the case will likely make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, although it may be several years before that happens.\n\nThe clock is ticking on other aspects of the IPAB, though.\n\nOnce the board begins making policy, it is insulated from congressional or judicial oversight, with Congress given only a brief window in 2017 to repeal or limit the IPAB\u2019s powers \u2014 and it would require a supermajority to do so, per ACA rules.\n\nAfter that, the board becomes the metaphorical cockroach that would survive even a nuclear holocaust.\n\nEven among members of Congress who voted for the ACA, there are some who question the broad powers given to the IPAB under the law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never supported it, and I would certainly be in favor of abolishing it,\u201d U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., told Politico in 2011. \u201cI\u2019m opposed to independent commissions or outside groups playing a role other than on a recommendatory basis.\u201d\n\nSandefur, of the Goldwater Institute, compares the situation to the recent scandal with the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nShe says the \u201csilver lining\u201d of the VA scandal is that Congress and the president have been calling for reforms since news broke of the long waiting times leading to patients\u2019 deaths. But insulated from oversight, the IPAB would be unable to be reformed if similar scandals occurred under its watch.\n\nThe ACA gives the IPAB the authority to set policy for Medicaid, but also requires it to consider private sector consequences for the Medicaid program \u2014 that could include potentially rationing care or increasing taxes to assist Medicaid, Sandefur said.\n\nEven though there are some limits to what the board can do, without any branch of government capable of enforcing those limits, do they matter?\n\n\u201cIf IPAB starts making unpopular, unconstitutional or even dangerous decisions, there is really nothing we can do about it,\u201d Sandefur said. \u201cIts actions can\u2019t be reviewed by the courts and Congress can\u2019t step in to make changes.\u201d\n\nBoehm is a reporter for Watchdog.org and can be reached at EBoehm@Watchdog.org.
