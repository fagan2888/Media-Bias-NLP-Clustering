Former President Bill Clinton today said President Obama should live up to his promise to Americans that if they like their health plans, they can keep them \u2013 even if it means a change to the law.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney later said the president agreed with Clinton\u2019s sentiment that the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to the American public when he said they could keep their existing plans.\n\nOn other Democrats joining suit, Hayes noted, \u201cYou can mark it down.
