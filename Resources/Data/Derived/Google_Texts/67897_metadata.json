Event is free and open to the public, but you must RSVP.\n\nBorn between 1980 and 2000, the millennial generation dwarfs even the baby-boom generation in numbers and is already fundamentally remaking American politics, culture, and business.\n\nMillennials are widely credited with handing Barack Obama a second term as president, with being socially tolerant and skeptical of government invasions of privacy and personal freedoms, and creating world-changing companies such as Facebook.\n\nMillennials also display an admirable independent streak, with fully one-third refusing to identify as either Democrat or Republican. They are the politically unclaimed generation and how they define their relationship to power will define the next 50 years or more of American life.\n\nThe October issue of Reason is devoted to millennials and features articles discussing the rise of \"the Hipster Capitalist,\" the increasingly desperate scramble among parties for the youth vote, the millennial fondness for dystopian fiction and movies such as The Hunger Games and Divergent, and the new language of politics spoken by today's post-partisan youth. This special issue of Reason follows the release of this summer's Reason-Rupe Poll of millennials that was widely discussed in The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post, and elsewhere.\n\nYou're invited to join Reason.com's Nick Gillespie and Reason Foundation Polling Director Emily Ekins for a fast-paced, wide-ranging discussion about millennials, what they believe, and how libertarians interested in promoting \"free minds and free markets\" might best with today's younger generation.\n\nLight snacks, beer, wine, and soft drinks will be served.\n\nTuesday, August 26\n\n6:00 p.m. \u2013 8:00 p.m.\n\nReason DC HQ\n\n1747 Connecticut Ave. NW\n\nWashington, DC 20007\n\nRSVP HERE\n\nMap: http://goo.gl/maps/Xt0Fc\n\nQuestions?
