General Atlantic Picks Up Stake in Barcelona Wine Bar and Bartaco Owner

Rosser Capital is already invested in the fast casual chains

General Atlantic is making a minority growth investment in fast casual chain operator Barteca Holdings, joining Rosser Capital Partners.

Barteca, founded in 1995, owns the Barcelona Wine Bar and Bartaco chains. Barcelona Wine Bar is a tapas and wine bar operator, while Bartaco is a casual dining chain that focuses on tacos. The two chains own a combined 22 restaurants with most of them located on the East Coast. The target’s management team and Rosser Capital will remain invested in the company. Rosser purchased a stake in Barteca in 2012.

“We believe Barcelona Wine Bar and Bartaco are uniquely positioned bar-centric, small box, small plate concepts that cater to consumer demands,” says General Atlantic vice president Shaw Joseph.

Private equity firms have been interested in regionally focused restaurant chains that have the potential to grow nationally. For instance, Stone-Goff Partners is buying sports bar chain Greene Turtle Sports Bar & Grille. Greene Turtle operates 41 restaurants across New York, Washington D.C., Maryland, West Virginia and Delaware.

Kirkand & Ellis LLP and Golenbock Eiseman Assor Bell & Peskoe LLP are representing Barteca. Paul Weiss Wharton & Garrison LLP is representing General Atlantic, which is receiving financing from Citizens Bank and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC).
