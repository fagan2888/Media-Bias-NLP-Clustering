He lived his entire life inside a sterile plastic bubble, unable to have contact with the outside world or other humans due to a defect in his immune system, which left him vulnerable to serious infections.\n\nBack then, there wasn\u2019t much doctors could do to stop or mitigate the immune disorder \u2014 so David had to stay inside his bubble, or wear a plastic \u201cspace suit,\u201d until he died at age 12 from lymphoma. Bone marrow transplants were one way to treat the disorder, and more recently, gene therapy has been used to treat various types of SCID. So far, doctors have fixed the immune systems of some 17 children who\u2019ve suffered from ADA-SCID and X-SCID, two different forms of the disease. But being able to identify the disease early on is still in the works among researchers.\n\nNow, a new study out of Virginia Tech has pinpointed a potential biomarker in gut bacteria that could help doctors diagnose SCID early on and help treat infants as soon as possible. Plenty of studies have shown that gut microbes are essential in keeping a balance in our stomachs and immune systems. \u201cThis is an interesting finding because it means we can potentially screen for this microbe at an early age to find defects in the immune system,\u201d Xin M. Luo, assistant professor of immunology at Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, said in the press release.\n\nThanks To David Vetter, doctors were able to learn a lot more about SCID to better treat future children.

The mice with a defective immune system had more of a microbe known as Akkermansia muciniphila, which is \u201calso a human intestinal microbe,\u201d Husen Zhang, research assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the College of Engineering, said in the press release. \u201cAlthough it is rather newly discovered, it has been there for a long time. Previous reports found that the microbe increases with antibiotic use, indicating that it might thrive when other gut microbes don\u2019t survive a round of antibiotics.\u201d\n\nAfter bone marrow transplants, though, the mice\u2019s levels of the microbe were reduced to normal. \u201cThere have been many studies recently on how gut microbes modulate the immune response, but we wanted to do the opposite,\u201d Luo said in the press release. \u201cWe are asking the question, \u2018How does our immune system affect bacteria in the gut?\u2019\u201d\n\nSCID is a rare disease, only affecting some 0.1 percent of the human population, but it\u2019s so severe that most children usually die within their first year if it goes undetected. This is because infants will usually experience bad infections from bacteria, viruses, or fungi.\n\n\u201cIf SCID is not detected, children cannot live past their first year,\u201d Luo said in the press release. \u201cNow, we may have a noninvasive way to screen for this disease because this microbe may be present only in negligible amounts in healthy, young children. If larger populations of the microbe are present, quick examination is needed to prevent a potentially deadly emergency.\u201d\n\nSource: Zhang H, Sparks J, Karyala S, Settlage R, Luo X. \u201cHost adaptive immunity alters gut microbiota.\u201d The ISME Journal. 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "scid, bubble boy syndrome, david vetter", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers have discovered a biomarker for a severe immune disorder commonly referred to as \u201cbubble boy syndrome.\u201d", "title": "Researchers Find Biomarker To Diagnose Heart-Breaking 'Bubble Boy Syndrome'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bubble-boy-syndrome-biomarker-found-will-help-diagnose-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-306052", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/02/david-vetter.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers have discovered a biomarker for a severe immune disorder commonly referred to as \u201cbubble boy syndrome.\u201d", "title": "Researchers Find Biomarker To Diagnose Heart-Breaking 'Bubble Boy Syndrome'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bubble-boy-syndrome-biomarker-found-will-help-diagnose-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-306052", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/02/david-vetter.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/02/david-vetter.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-10-02T10:58:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-02T10:58:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers have discovered a biomarker for a severe immune disorder commonly referred to as \u201cbubble boy syndrome.\u201d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc00\"", "article_summary": "The infamous \u201cbubble boy,\u201d David Vetter, was born in Texas in 1971 with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).\nWikimedia / NASAIn the study, researchers compared gut microbes in healthy mice to those with an impaired immune system \u2014 both before and after weaning.\nPlenty of studies have shown that gut microbes are essential in keeping a balance in our stomachs and immune systems.\nHe lived his entire life inside a sterile plastic bubble, unable to have contact with the outside world or other humans due to a defect in his immune system, which left him vulnerable to serious infections.\nThanks To David Vetter, doctors were able to learn a lot more about SCID to better treat future children."}
