The meeting will include a public hearing. When: 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 22 Where: Commissioners' third-floor hearing room, Boulder County Courthouse, 1325 Pearl St., Boulder Additional information: The proposed regulations are available with the Oct. 22 meeting agenda at http://tinyurl.com/bocomeets2013.\n\nUnder the proposed rules, only establishments that had or applied for county medical marijuana licenses before Oct. 1 could seek to expand into the retail recreational marijuana market.\n\nIf those already-operating medical businesses get the appropriate state and local approvals, they could begin selling growing and selling marijuana products for recreational use as early as next January.\n\nAny other would-be recreational marijuana businesses would have to wait until at least Jan 1, 2015, to apply for licenses to operate in unincorporated Boulder County, under a moratorium the commissioners also will consider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe regulations for recreational marijuana businesses would be similar to those Boulder County has in place for medical marijuana businesses.\n\nThe new rules would, however, include provisions the county staff said are intended to prevent or discourage youths' purchases of marijuana and marijuana-infused products from retail shops.\n\nAnyone under the age of 21 would be prohibited from being inside any retail marijuana store, even if it's also a medical marijuana dispensary. Establishments doing selling medical and retail marijuana would have to verify the age of everyone entering the business with an electronic ID scanner.\n\nRecreational marijuana receipts would have to include notices that it's illegal to transfer or sell marijuana to anyone under age 21. Recreational marijuana shops could operate only between the hours of 8 a.m. and 7 p.m., and there'd be specific Boulder County limits on the display and advertising of marijuana.\n\nThe proposed regulations also would also establish energy-efficiency requirements for all marijuana growing and cultivation operations. Anyone seeking a county license for growing operations would have to submit a \"sustainability plan.\" Fifty percent of the growing operation's energy consumption would have to be offset within one year, and 100 percent after two years.\n\nIn Boulder County, 39 medical marijuana businesses operate in unincorporated Boulder County, including seven dispensaries, 23 growing operations and nine facilities manufacturing marijuana-infused products.\n\nOnly two -- an infused-products manufacturing facility and a growing operation -- have obtained county licenses. The other 37 are allowed to operate during a review of their conformance to licensing requirements or county land-use, zoning and building rules.\n\nLast month, Boulder County's Land Use Department staff sought a 10-month moratorium on accepting applications for recreational marijuana business licenses, saying that long of a time-out was needed to make sure county regulations conform to the hundred pages of recently promulgated state regulations about retail marijuana sales.\n\nCounty commissioners, however, decided on Sept. 27 to instead impose a 22-day moratorium, which ends Tuesday.\n\nJohn Fryar can be reached at 303-684-5211 or jfryar@times-call.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/news_region-news/ci_24351956/new-marijuana-rules-possible-unincorporated-boulder-county", "modificationDate": "2013-10-20T23:36:45-0600", "sailthru.section": "Region News", "sailthru.author": "By John Fryar   Longmont Times-Call", "description": "BOULDER -- Some medical marijuana businesses in unincorporated Boulder County could grow and sell marijuana for recreational use, under regulations that Boulder County commissioners will consider Tuesday.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:24351956:view"}, "startDate": "2013-10-20T23:33:53-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/news_region-news/ci_24351956/new-marijuana-rules-possible-unincorporated-boulder-county", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "BOULDER -- Some medical marijuana businesses in unincorporated Boulder County could grow and sell marijuana for recreational use, under regulations that Boulder County commissioners will consider Tuesday.", "title": "New marijuana rules possible in unincorporated Boulder County"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "BOULDER -- Some medical marijuana businesses in unincorporated Boulder County could grow and sell marijuana for recreational use, under regulations that Boulder County commissioners will consider Tuesday.", "title": "New marijuana rules possible in unincorporated Boulder County", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/news_region-news/ci_24351956/new-marijuana-rules-possible-unincorporated-boulder-county", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-20T23:33:53-0600", "endDate": "2023-10-20T22:10:02-0600", "sailthru.title": "New marijuana rules possible in unincorporated Boulder County", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By John Fryar", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2013-10-20T23:36:55-0600", "news_keywords": "news, longmont, times call, region, news, colorado, happenings"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5b28\"", "article_summary": "County license could require energy-efficiency planBOULDER -- Some medical marijuana businesses in unincorporated Boulder County could grow and sell marijuana for recreational use, under regulations that Boulder County commissioners will consider Tuesday.\nIn Boulder County, 39 medical marijuana businesses operate in unincorporated Boulder County, including seven dispensaries, 23 growing operations and nine facilities manufacturing marijuana-infused products.\nAdvertisementThe regulations for recreational marijuana businesses would be similar to those Boulder County has in place for medical marijuana businesses.\nUnder the proposed rules, only establishments that had or applied for county medical marijuana licenses before Oct. 1 could seek to expand into the retail recreational marijuana market.\nAnyone under the age of 21 would be prohibited from being inside any retail marijuana store, even if it's also a medical marijuana dispensary."}
