Anyone following the Texas lawyer\u2019s Senate career could already tell that Cruz \u2014 like Helms, a persistent obstructionist and perhaps the most disliked member of the chamber \u2014 had hewed closely to Senator No\u2019s playbook as part of his own meteoric political rise. Here are a few of the tactics and issues that Cruz, like Helms before him, has embraced.\n\n1. Speak Loudly and Carry a Big Stick\n\nLike Helms, a longtime Raleigh journalist and radio newscaster before entering politics, Cruz \u2014 himself a national debate champion at Princeton and an accomplished appellate litigator \u2014 is a gifted orator, a useful tool in the pontificating Senate. Both have deployed speech early and often, droning on when necessary as a political weapon. In 1973, his first year in the Senate, Helms was a force of nature, with a 96 percent attendance rate, 138 speeches and 19,963 phone calls, and he would become famous for staging a 16-day filibuster in 1983 to block (unsuccessfully) the federal holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. Thirty years later, in his inaugural year in the same chamber, Cruz also embraced the filibuster, grabbing national attention with a 21-hour attempt to deny funding (unsuccessfully) for the Affordable Care Act, at one point reading Dr. Seuss\u2019 Green Eggs and Ham to his two daughters watching at home.\n\n2. Making Friends, Not Laws\n\nHelms- and Cruz-style hijinks inevitably produce little in the way of legislative results, but that\u2019s partly the point. Helms was famous for not only filibustering voting rights laws and other legislation he opposed on principle, but also for championing doomed-to-fail bills \u2014 like one allowing Americans to remove anti-pollution devices from cars \u2014 in order to please frustrated conservatives by making their causes his own. Helms\u2019 bills \u201cmade very little law, but they have made millions of highly motivated friends,\u201d Ernest Furgurson observes in Hard Right: The Rise of Jesse Helms.\n\nLikewise, despite his fruitless campaign to repeal \u201cevery blessed word of Obamacare\u201d while ranking 94th in Senate seniority, Cruz almost single-handedly shut down the federal government in 2013. This and other similarly pointless calls, like trying to abolish the IRS, alienated some colleagues but delighted the GOP base.\n\n3. Purifying the Party\n\nSome of Cruz\u2019s zanier appeals, like his recent proposal to allow unlimited campaign contributions, also aim to put fellow Republicans in the hot seat. Helms shared Cruz\u2019s desire to purge the party of moderates and fill any leadership vacuum with his own brand of uncompromising social conservatism. \u201cI\u2019m nobody\u2019s Republican or anything else,\u201d Helms famously said after Richard Nixon was elected. In the same way that Cruz has labeled moderates \u201csquishes,\u201d and proclaimed that the GOP has not stood \u201cfor the principles we\u2019re supposed to believe in,\u201d Helms denounced colleagues who compromised with Bill Clinton in the 1990s as \u201cJudases.\u201d\n\n4. Rewinding the Clock on Social Issues\n\nPart of standing for principles also means trying to reverse the tide of recent history, or at least hold it back. Nowhere is this more apparent for both men than in the area of civil rights. In addition to opposing the MLK holiday, Helms decried the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as \u201cthe single most dangerous piece of legislation ever introduced.\u201d He was even more outspoken on the issue of gay rights, labeling homosexuals \u201cweak, morally sick wretches.\u201d A devout Southern Baptist like Helms, Cruz may be less incendiary in his rhetoric, but he has continued Helms\u2019 crusade to undo provisions of the Voting Rights Act and halt the civil rights afforded to gay Americans, complaining that same-sex marriage jeopardizes the \u201cfuture of our country.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nThere are other issues the two men would have agreed on, like limited government and abortion, as well as areas where they would\u2019ve disagreed. On foreign policy, for example, Cruz is further toward the isolationist end of the spectrum than was Helms, who supported arming the Contras and expanding NATO.\n\nAnd had they been in the Senate together, it\u2019s difficult to say whether the two men would have liked one another. Cruz, of Cuban descent, might not have appreciated Helms\u2019 statement that \u201call Latins are volatile people.\u201d Likewise, Helms, a college dropout, might not have understood Cruz\u2019s aversion as a law student to studying with anyone who had not attended Harvard, Princeton or Yale as an undergrad. But if politics makes for strange bedfellows, then the like-minded Cruz and Helms would\u2019ve undoubtedly found themselves sharing a bed.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Sen. Ted Cruz Sen.
