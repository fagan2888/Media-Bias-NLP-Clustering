As Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon is a top labor ally Jones is taking his message directly to the people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been debating this for six or seven years and there\u2019s been little to no movement\u201d in the legislature, Jones said in an interview with the Washington Free Beacon. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to take this to the voters because the people need to weigh in on this.\u201d\n\nJones has earned the support of worker freedom groups across the country. Mark Mix, president of the Right to Work Foundation, which was a driving force behind the passage of right to work laws in Michigan and Indiana, said that Missouri could become more attractive to potential investors and businesses if citizens send the message that they support a pro-jobs, rather than pro-union, agenda.\n\n\u201cMissouri is just one state that will be pushing right to work as the 2014 legislative sessions begin,\u201d Mix said. \u201cThe individual freedom that right to work brings to the workplace is the foremost priority but it can no longer be a serious debate over the economic benefits and jobs that right to work laws bring.\u201d\n\nJones, a long-time backer of right to work, said the GOP needs to force the issue and the 2014 ballot is the surest way to make sure it actually gets to a vote. While right to work has long been an issue of contention in Missouri, there is a renewed sense of urgency because of regional competition for jobs.\n\nMissouri borders eight states and all but two of them, Kentucky and Illinois, are right to work states. Other regional competitors, including Michigan and Indiana, became \u201cworker freedom\u201d states, as Jones call them, in 2013.\n\n\u201cMany other states have moved past us and incorporated worker freedom laws. Missouri is going to be left behind very quickly in economic battles if it doesn\u2019t compete with our neighbor\u2019s policies,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf we want to lag behind, we can keep covering our eyes to this fact.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the departure of automobile manufacturing from the state over the past two decades. Ford shuttered a St. Louis area plant that employed more than 1,400 people in 2006. Chrysler closed two more operations in the region in 2008 and 2009, removing 43,000 jobs and $15 billion in the process. Jones said that right to work could have helped Missouri compete with the lower cost, union-free manufacturing plants in Tennessee where the auto industry is expanding.\n\n\u201cBeing a pro-union, closed-shop state has not helped us retain jobs, it\u2019s made us lose jobs at a more rapid pace,\u201d he said. \u201cRight to work laws force unions to compete, to allow free market to flood in, cause more jobs and opportunities to be available. All the red herrings that are thrown out are false.\u201d\n\nJones is more optimistic about the effectiveness of right to work laws than he is his fellow lawmakers. He recognizes that Nixon, who received nearly $2.5 million from labor unions in 2008 and 2012, will never sign the bill and that unions have also endorsed key state senate Republicans in 2012. The ballot initiative process will help him bypass those obstacles.\n\nPotential laws can be added to the ballot with simple majority votes in the House and Senate and do not require approval from the governor. Republicans have a 110-53 advantage in the Missouri House of Representatives and a 28-10 advantage in the Missouri Senate. Jones aims to create a mandate for the ballot initiative by delivering a strong showing in the House that will force the more labor-friendly Senate\u2019s hand and avoid a filibuster.\n\n\u201cWe have quite a few GOP members who are friendly to big labor interests, but if this is given a fair vote\u2014no filibuster\u2014it will pass,\u201d he said. \u201cThe higher the vote of the representatives, the louder the message that\u2019s sent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tim Jones to urge ballot initiative in coming year", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "One of Missouri\u2019s top officials is attempting to rally voters to make the \u201cShow-Me\u201d state the nation\u2019s 25th right to work state.
