But for now, it\u2019s New Hampshire residents who are being bombarded with political ads on TV.\n\nAnd since we\u2019re not in New Hampshire, most Ohioans aren\u2019t aware just how familiar the Granite State is becoming with our governor, John Kasich. As of Sunday afternoon, New Hampshire broadcast TV has aired an ad mentioning Kasich no fewer than 18 times a day since mid-November.\n\nMany of those ads were paid for by the Kasich campaign and New Day for America, a pro-Kasich super political action committee, or super PAC. But others are ads attacking Kasich, who is staking his presidential campaign on success in New Hampshire, that were paid for by super PACs aligned with other so-called establishment candidates.\n\nThanks to the Political TV Ad Archive, which also provided the data used in this story, here are all 14 Kasich ads \u2014 pro and con \u2014 that have aired in New Hampshire in the build-up to the state\u2019s Feb. 9 primary. (This does not include a 15th ad attacking Sen. Marco Rubio, financed by New Day for America, that never aired after the Kasich campaign disavowed it.)", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "john-kasich-new-hampshire, news", "title": "Here are all 14 TV ads that aired in New Hampshire that mention John Kasich", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Here are all 14 TV ads that aired in New Hampshire that mention John Kasich\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/02/here_are_all_14_tv_ads_airing.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/open_impact/photo/19703194-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17959124\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-02-08T19:36:00Z\", \"author\": \"Andrew J.
