RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Daley Blind apparently is so wrapped up in the World Cup that Father’s Day passed him by.

“I forgot about it,” he said Sunday after going through a light training session because of a sore knee. “I didn’t do anything.”

No matter. He’d already given his dad Danny — who is also assistant Netherlands coach — two gifts to savor on Friday when he launched a pair of pinpoint long passes to set up the first two Dutch goals in the 5-1 thrashing of defending champion Spain in Salvador.

His commanding play in that match has sparked intense speculation in England that Blind could soon be playing alongside Robin van Persie in the red of Manchester United. Current Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal will take over at Old Trafford next season and attempt to rebuild the team after a disastrous season by the club’s standards.

He said he was proud of the attention, particularly from England.

“I understand there’s a lot of attention because of Robin playing there and Louis van Gaal,” he said. “But now I’m totally focused on the Netherlands.”

If Blind were to make the move to England, it would mean him playing for only the third club of his 24-year-old life.

He joined Ajax when he was eight — although he kicked balls around the Amsterdam club long before that as Danny captained the team and led it to the Champions League title in 1995 — with Van Gaal as coach.

Rising up through the Amsterdam club’s famous youth program, Blind signed a professional contract in 2007 when he had just turned 17. He extended it last year to the end of the 2016 season. His only football in another shirt came in a brief period on loan to Dutch club Groningen.
