His international breakthrough, \u201cA Prophet,\u201d reinvented the prison drama, while follow-up \u201cRust and Bone\u201d was inspired by B-movie melodramas.\n\n\u201cFor me, genre is a Trojan Horse,\u201d Audiard said \u2014 a way of smuggling surprises past the audience\u2019s defenses.\n\n\u201cDheepan\u201d is part social-issues drama, as it follows former Tamil Tiger fighter Dheepan (Antonythasan Jesuthasan), 20-something woman Yalini (Kalieaswari Srinivasan) and 9-year-old Illayaal (Claudine Vinasithamby), refugees from the war in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe three pose as a family in order to come to France, where Dheepan gets a job as caretaker at a high-rise housing project on the outskirts of Paris.\n\nAudiard shows the trio\u2019s first steps toward a new life, before the violence they thought they had left behind erupts in a bloody climax that reveals the film\u2019s vigilante-flick origins. But \u201cDheepan\u201d also has the bruised-and-battered tenderness that marked Audiard\u2019s earlier films.\n\n\u201cWhat is really at the heart is the love story,\u201d the director said during an interview Saturday. \u201cHow are we going to get from a fake family to a real family? How can we get from antagonism to love?\u201d\n\n\u201cDheepan\u201d is one of a handful of films considered strong contenders for the top trophy at Cannes, where \u201cA Prophet\u201d won the second-place prize in 2009.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Love battles revenge in Audiard\u2019s refugee drama \u2018Dheepan\u2019", "title": "Love battles revenge in Audiard\u2019s refugee drama \u2018Dheepan\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Love battles revenge in Audiard\u2019s refugee drama \u2018Dheepan\u2019", "title": "Love battles revenge in Audiard\u2019s refugee drama \u2018Dheepan\u2019", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/love_battles_revenge_in_audiards_refugee_drama_dheepan/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-cannes-dheepan-red-carpet.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Love battles revenge in Audiard\u2019s refugee drama \u2018Dheepan\u2019", "title": "Love battles revenge in Audiard\u2019s refugee drama \u2018Dheepan\u2019", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-cannes-dheepan-red-carpet.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jill Lawless", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c67\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s a long way from where the project began, as a remake of Sam Peckinpah\u2019s violent revenge thriller, \u201cStraw Dogs.\u201d\u201cThat was the origin of the origin,\u201d Audiard said.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsCANNES, France (AP) \u2014 For much of its running time, Jacques Audiard\u2019s new film, \u201cDheepan,\u201d is a gritty and naturalistic depiction of Tamil refugees trying to build a new life in France.\nHis international breakthrough, \u201cA Prophet,\u201d reinvented the prison drama, while follow-up \u201cRust and Bone\u201d was inspired by B-movie melodramas.\n\u201cDheepan\u201d is part social-issues drama, as it follows former Tamil Tiger fighter Dheepan (Antonythasan Jesuthasan), 20-something woman Yalini (Kalieaswari Srinivasan) and 9-year-old Illayaal (Claudine Vinasithamby), refugees from the war in Sri Lanka.\nBut \u201cDheepan\u201d also has the bruised-and-battered tenderness that marked Audiard\u2019s earlier films."}
