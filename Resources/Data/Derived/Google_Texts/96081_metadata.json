And as weather improves, more people will be making it to the doctor's office.\n\n\"January was pretty ugly because most people didn't like the fourth quarter,\" Heupel said. \"And we've had some days that, for a lot of various reasons, have picked the group up.\"\n\nUnitedHealth Group shares rose above $80 for the first time Wednesday but closed just shy of that threshold. CEO Stephen J. Hemsley in a 2009 file photo.\n\n\"Let's face it,\" he added. \"People don't want to go to the doctor when it's 20 below or there's 20 inches of snow.\"\n\nRising enrollment numbers also are fueling the burst, Heupel said. The federal government reported earlier this week that 5 million Americans have enrolled in health plans through new federal and state-based insurance exchanges. UnitedHealth stands to gain from states that have expanded Medicaid.\n\nBut the wariness over the rollout of the exchanges and the Affordable Care Act continues to temper enthusiasm.\n\n\"If we find out that no one is making money on these new customers, or maybe even losing money, that'll sour opinion,\" Heupel said.\n\nWellPoint is hosting its analysts day on Friday, and some analysts are expecting an upbeat report. Its shares were up 1.37 percent to $99.05 on Wednesday.\n\nHumana was up 3.1 percent to $116.96; Cigna was up 3.3 percent to $80.28.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The entire health insurance sector rose Wednesday, but UnitedHealth has been at record highs for most of the month.", "title": "UnitedHealth Group stock hits new highs", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/unitedhealth-stock-hits-new-highs/251107941/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/unitedhealth031914.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/unitedhealth031914.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The entire health insurance sector rose Wednesday, but UnitedHealth has been at record highs for most of the month.", "title": "UnitedHealth Group stock hits new highs", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/unitedhealth-stock-hits-new-highs/251107941/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/unitedhealth031914.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/unitedhealth031914.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The entire health insurance sector rose Wednesday, but UnitedHealth has been at record highs for most of the month."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaff8\"", "article_summary": "UnitedHealth Group shares rose above $80 for the first time Wednesday but closed just shy of that threshold.\nUnitedHealth Group Inc.'s stock has been on a two-week surge, hitting an all-time high for the first time earlier this month and continuing to climb even higher.\nEnthusiasm stems from several factors ranging from the weather to Medicare Advantage rates to improved enrollment on health care exchanges, he said.\nThere's \"improving sentiment\" for UnitedHealth along with its peers in the broader health sector, including WellPoint, Humana, Cigna and Aetna, said Thrivent Financial analyst David Heupel.\nThe federal government reported earlier this week that 5 million Americans have enrolled in health plans through new federal and state-based insurance exchanges."}
