It’s fair to assume that the editors at Women’s Health magazine are reasonably savvy about issues involving gynecology and reproductive rights. So when one of those editors called her new insurance company about a mail-order prescription for her birth control, she was surprised to have the company say that birth control wasn’t covered. She’d have to pay $200.

Actually, that’s against the law, as Korin Miller notes after relaying the anecdote on Womenshealthmag.com. “Under the [Affordable Care] Act, women with health insurance are entitled to important preventative services, such as birth control and well-woman visits with no co-pay or deductible,” she writes.

Apparently, a lot of women have been accepting similar rejections from their insurers. So last week the Obama administration issued a “guidance” to “eliminate any ambiguity,” the Health and Human Services Department said. “Insurers must cover without cost-sharing at least one form of contraception in each of the methods that the Food and Drug Administration has identified,” the directive says, “including the ring, the patch and intrauterine devices.”

For good measure, the guidance goes on to remind insurers that if a woman is at an increased risk for having the BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 cancer-susceptibility gene, the company must cover preventive screening, genetic counseling and genetic testing.
