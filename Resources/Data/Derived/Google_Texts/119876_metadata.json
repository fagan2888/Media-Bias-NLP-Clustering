A September GAO report found that hefty regulations in Obamacare exchanges are driving smaller insurers to drop out of the exchanges entirely. (RELATED: GAO: Competition, Regulations Drive Smaller Providers From Obamacare Exchanges)\n\nIn Obamacare\u2019s first year, the biggest, most established insurers had a better ability to offer lower premiums, in comparison to smaller, newer insurers without a stronger non-exchange customer base in case of unexpected losses. With larger insurers already taking the lead in Obamacare exchanges, it looks like those who were most demonized during the campaign for Obamacare are its most serious benefactors.\n\nInvestors think so, at least. Aetna and UnitedHealth Group, two of the largest insurance companies in the country, are both doing better than expected under Obamacare exchanges. (RELATED: Large Insurance Companies Are Raking In The Cash, Thanks To Obamacare)\n\nLarge, consolidated hospital systems and large insurers are doing the best under Obamacare, according to CNBC, and it looks like stocks in health care giants are continuing to climb. That may not be great for physicians\u2019 private practices and small insurers \u2014 and it\u2019s definitely not what Obamacare was sold as.\n\n\u201cThey are the villains in this,\u201d then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said of large private insurers in July 2009. \u201cThey can disguise their arguments any way they want, but the fact is that they don\u2019t want the competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course they\u2019ve been immoral all along in how they have treated the people that they insure with pre-existing conditions, you know, the litany of it all,\u201d Pelosi charged.\n\nWellPoint, which Democrats used as a poster child in 2010 for insurers\u2019 so-called discrimination, has gained 751,000 subscribers through Obamacare exchanges and almost 699,000 through Medicaid, according to The New York Times. Growth in government health insurance is proving lucrative for the company: government business it accounts for 45 percent of its operating revenues.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Dems' line that insurers are the villain is a thing of the past", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare made it through Congress with top Democrats' constant assertions that big, corporate insurance companies were the problem, but in the three years after the health-care law passed those insur", "title": "GAO: Largest Health Insurers Have Gotten Even Bigger Since Obamacare Passed", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/01/gao-largest-health-insurers-have-gotten-even-bigger-since-obamacare-passed/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/7b348a1bb72e42e1a662c9a65ec453ab-e1389021437550.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dems' line that insurers are the villain is a thing of the past", "title": "GAO: Largest Health Insurers Have Gotten Even Bigger Since Obamacare Passed Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/01/gao-largest-health-insurers-have-gotten-even-bigger-since-obamacare-passed/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/7b348a1bb72e42e1a662c9a65ec453ab-e1389021437550.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-01 20:07:27", "sailthru.title": "GAO: Largest Health Insurers Have Gotten Even Bigger Since Obamacare Passed", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Obamacare made it through Congress with top Democrats' constant assertions that big, corporate insurance companies were the problem, but in the three years after the health-care law passed those insur", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/7b348a1bb72e42e1a662c9a65ec453ab-e1389021437550.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3982\"", "article_summary": "A September GAO report found that hefty regulations in Obamacare exchanges are driving smaller insurers to drop out of the exchanges entirely.\nAetna and UnitedHealth Group, two of the largest insurance companies in the country, are both doing better than expected under Obamacare exchanges.\nWith larger insurers already taking the lead in Obamacare exchanges, it looks like those who were most demonized during the campaign for Obamacare are its most serious benefactors.\nGrowth in government health insurance is proving lucrative for the company: government business it accounts for 45 percent of its operating revenues.\nThat may not be great for physicians\u2019 private practices and small insurers \u2014 and it\u2019s definitely not what Obamacare was sold as."}
