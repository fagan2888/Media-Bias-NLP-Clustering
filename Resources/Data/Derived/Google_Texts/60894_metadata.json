The duo\u2019s friendship has been well documented, although newly released letters held at the Polish National Library show the closeness of their relationship.\n\nDuring the 1970s the duo collaborated on an English translation of a book written by Karol Wojtyla, \u2014 as he was known before becoming John Paul II \u2014 prompting the correspondence that was to continue for decades. Tymieniecka was married and the letters do not suggest that the Wojtyla broke his vow of celibacy. She died in 2014.\n\nThe closeness of their relationship is demonstrated by Wojtyla\u2019s decision to give Tymieniecka his scapular; two pieces of cloth joined by string, worn over the shoulders to signify devotion to Christian life.\n\n\u201cAlready last year I was looking for an answer to these words, \u2018I belong to you\u2019, and finally, before leaving Poland, I found a way \u2014 a scapular. The dimension in which I accept and feel you everywhere in all kinds of situations, when you are close, and when you are far away,\u201d he wrote in a 1976 letter published by the BBC.\n\nAfter being elected pope in 1978 \u2014 he reigned until his death in 2005 \u2014 the pope wrote again to Tymieniecka and told her their correspondence should continue. Her written responses to the pontiff\u2019s letters have not been published.\n\nThe National Library of Poland released a statement saying media have taken the correspondence out of context.\n\n\u201cJohn Paul II was surrounded by a circle of friends \u2013 including clergymen, nuns and laypeople \u2013 with whom he stayed in close contact,\u201d the National Library of Poland statement said. \u201cAnna Teresa Tymieniecka was within this circle of friends \u2014 John Paul II\u2019s friendship with her was neither secret nor extraordinary.\u201d\n\n(Rosie Scammell writes from Rome)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Ethics, Institutions, Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, BBC, Catholic, Christian, letters, scapular, St. John Paul II", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "(RNS) The duo\u2019s friendship has been well-documented, although newly released letters held at the Polish National Library show the closeness of their relationship.", "title": "St. John Paul II\u2019s letters to Polish-American woman reveal intimate friendship", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2016/02/15/st-john-paul-iis-letters-to-polish-american-woman-reveal-intimate-friendship/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Revelations-300x250-RNS.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rosiescammell"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/02/15/st-john-paul-iis-letters-to-polish-american-woman-reveal-intimate-friendship/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/02/15/st-john-paul-iis-letters-to-polish-american-woman-reveal-intimate-friendship/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "(RNS) The duo\u2019s friendship has been well-documented, although newly released letters held at the Polish National Library show the closeness of their relationship."}, "article_summary": "(RNS) A series of letters sent from St. John Paul II to a Polish-American academic shed new light on the pair\u2019s close relationship and intimate discussions.\n\u201cAnna Teresa Tymieniecka was within this circle of friends \u2014 John Paul II\u2019s friendship with her was neither secret nor extraordinary.\u201d(Rosie Scammell writes from Rome)\nThe duo\u2019s friendship has been well documented, although newly released letters held at the Polish National Library show the closeness of their relationship.\n\u201cJohn Paul II was surrounded by a circle of friends \u2013 including clergymen, nuns and laypeople \u2013 with whom he stayed in close contact,\u201d the National Library of Poland statement said.\nThe National Library of Poland released a statement saying media have taken the correspondence out of context."}
