Last week, HHS reported 4.2 million people had selected insurance plans, with 25% being between the ages of 18 and 34. It\u2019s also still not clear who has paid their first month\u2019s premium.\n\nPaul Howard, director of the Center for Medical Progress at the Manhattan Institute, says that the jump is \u201chuge\u201d from last week to this week, but that the true number of enrollees is likely lower, as there are reports that as many as 20% have not paid their first month\u2019s premium, which is how the insurance industry traditionally defines an enrollee.\n\n\u201cI take the administration\u2019s new proclamations with a hefty dose of salt,\u201d Howard says.\n\nLarry Kocot, visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, adds that while open enrollment period is ending, there\u2019s still much work to be done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of enrollment period, but the beginning of a fixing period,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone is high-fiving, but the race is just beginning.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Uninsured, Not That Interested\n\nOn Monday Bankrate.com released a report that one-third of uninsured Americans say that they plan to stay that way.\n\n\u201cThis is a population that is notoriously hard to get at,\u201d Howard says of the uninsured. \u201cThe administration is trying to push a big rock uphill at this point.\u201d\n\nBut Kocot isn\u2019t as concerned with interest as he is with attrition rates, or rates of people who fail to pay for their premiums and actually fully enroll.\n\n\u201cThe enrollment number is accelerating and there is a campaign like feel to this, because as you push people to enroll, there\u2019s a lot of encouragement,\u201d he says. \u201cBut will they pay their initial premium, and continue to do so, especially if they didn\u2019t have insurance in the first place?\u201d\n\nAnother Glitch? Not so Fast\n\nAnother glitch on the federal exchange was discovered by the Philadelphia Inquirer on Friday. The newspaper reported HHS was using 2014 federal poverty level guidelines to give site visitors calculations on subsidies, while the ACA specified using 2013 poverty guidelines.\n\nThat mean when enrollees were \u201cwindow shopping\u201d to see what their potential costs would be under the plans, they were getting incorrect estimates. The law gives subsidies to those making up to 400% of the federal poverty level, about $45,000 for an individual and $94,000 for a family of four.\n\nBut Howard says while the glitch is certainly not good news, it also isn\u2019t substantial. If and when a person decides to enroll, their subsidy calculations should be correct.\n\n\u201cThe federal poverty level doesn\u2019t change that much from year-to-year,\u201d Howard says. \u201cSo the difference wouldn\u2019t be that substantial. And if people are that price-sensitive, at the bottom end, it may look like a bit too much money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 01:19:20 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "With a little more than a week left to sign up, enrollment on state and federal health exchanges under the Affordable Care Act hit 5 million people this week, as the enrollment figures move closer to the White House\u2019s original goal of 7 million.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/03/21/obamacare-week-26-new-enrollment-milestone.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/031814/0/0/031814_fbn_kateenrollmentstats.jpg?ve=1", "description": "With a little more than a week left to sign up, enrollment on state and federal health exchanges under the Affordable Care Act hit 5 million people this week, as the enrollment figures move closer to the White House\u2019s original goal of 7 million.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "ObamaCare Week 26: New Enrollment Milestone"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"Kate Rogers\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"ObamaCare Week 26: New Enrollment Milestone\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/031814/0/0/031814_fbn_kateenrollmentstats.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-21T21:07:31Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/03/21/obamacare-week-26-new-enrollment-milestone.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"97cb11a4-e3f6-4e69-b7a6-e319b513f1a3\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "With a little more than a week left to sign up, enrollment on state and federal health exchanges under the Affordable Care Act hit 5 million people this week, as the enrollment figures move closer to the White House\u2019s original goal of 7 million.", "dc.identifier": "97cb11a4-e3f6-4e69-b7a6-e319b513f1a3", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "description": "With a little more than a week left to sign up, enrollment on state and federal health exchanges under the Affordable Care Act hit 5 million people this week, as the enrollment figures move closer to the White House\u2019s original goal of 7 million.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Obamacare Week 26: New Enrollment Milestone", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-08 01:19:20 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "With a little more than a week left to sign up, enrollment on state and federal health exchanges under the Affordable Care Act hit 5 million people this week, as the enrollment figures move closer to the White House\u2019s original goal of 7 million.", "title": "ObamaCare Week 26: New Enrollment Milestone | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/03/21/obamacare-week-26-new-enrollment-milestone.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/031814/0/0/031814_fbn_kateenrollmentstats.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-03-21", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Kate Rogers\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"ObamaCare Week 26: New Enrollment Milestone\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/031814/0/0/031814_fbn_kateenrollmentstats.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-21T21:07:31Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/03/21/obamacare-week-26-new-enrollment-milestone.html\",\"post_id\":\"97cb11a4-e3f6-4e69-b7a6-e319b513f1a3\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "dc.creator": "Kate Rogers"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of enrollment period, but the beginning of a fixing period,\u201d he says.\nLarry Kocot, visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, adds that while open enrollment period is ending, there\u2019s still much work to be done.\nThe newspaper reported HHS was using 2014 federal poverty level guidelines to give site visitors calculations on subsidies, while the ACA specified using 2013 poverty guidelines.\nThe law gives subsidies to those making up to 400% of the federal poverty level, about $45,000 for an individual and $94,000 for a family of four.\n\u201cThe federal poverty level doesn\u2019t change that much from year-to-year,\u201d Howard says."}
