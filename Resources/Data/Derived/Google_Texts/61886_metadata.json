The overwhelming number of editorial boards came to the same conclusion: That Republicans \u2014 specifically the tea party caucus \u2014 are to blame. Even those editorial boards that don\u2019t like the Affordable Care Act think shutting down the government is a bridge too far.\n\nHere\u2019s a sampling of the editorials from around the country:\n\nKansas City Star: \u201cThe government of the people of the United States is partially shut down because a faction of the Republican Party insists on tying further spending to the crippling of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\u201d\n\nThe Oregonian: \u201cNot everyone with reservations about the law believes it\u2019s necessary to shut down national parks to express them. That\u2019s not to say the Affordable Care Act, in which Oregon is heavily invested, is wonderful legislation. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s a complex piece of work approved in highly partisan fashion[.] \u2026 [T]his week\u2019s events won\u2019t help Republicans make the case that they offer a credible, serious alternative to the party that created [the ACA].\u201d\n\nSeattle Times: \u201cWashington\u2019s get-along, go-along Republican members of Congress must start showing some independence. A good place to begin is by voting \u201cno\u201d on the wacky ideological diversions of their fringe colleagues.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Times: \u201cUnlike the GOP\u2019s previous flirtations with a government shutdown, this fight isn\u2019t being waged in the name of lower deficits and debt. It\u2019s just a desperate attempt to score political points against the Affordable Care Act before it goes fully into effect and the benefits become clearer.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle: \u201cThe party\u2019s leadership looks powerless in controlling these insurgents, many from congressional districts where boundaries were redrawn to make a moderate outlook untenable. Compromise and balance are being bred out of lawmaking by a haywire system.\u201d\n\nArizona Republic: \u201c[W]e need the Republican Party to rein in the madness. Sen. John McCain tried. He called out the firebrands on the futility of turning a routine funding bill into a proxy for continuing opposition to Obamacare. But the voice of reason failed. Normally level-headed Speaker John Boehner abdicated his role as resident House parent and joined the binge-happy tea drinkers.\u201d\n\nAlbuquerque Journal: \u201cAmerica closed much of its government because its leaders couldn\u2019t even agree on directions to the strip mall that houses the loan office, much less terms of the six-week loan. \u2026 Instead of fulfilling No. 1 on their job descriptions and passing a federal budget, then fixing the ACA, members of Congress decided to play politics, no surprise, and co-mingled the funding of general operations with a political hot potato \u2013 because you can\u2019t see a furloughed employee\u2019s unpaid bills from their offices in D.C.\u201d\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune: \u201cAll the shutdown threats have ever stood to accomplish has been to boost the tea party bona fides of such obstructionists as Utah\u2019s Sen. Mike Lee and Texas\u2019 Sen. Ted Cruz. \u2026 [T]he idea that Obamacare is such a threat that it would be worth a government shutdown or, much worse, a refusal to raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling later this month, borders on the insane.\u201d\n\nThe Denver Post: \u201cThis is a battle Republicans cannot win. President Obama and Senate Democrats have no incentive to offer concessions so long as the public doesn\u2019t hold them responsible for any resulting hardship. Republicans are most likely to be blamed, and then, when the consequences get bad enough, they\u2019ll have little choice but to capitulate.\u201d\n\nMinneapolis Star-Tribune: \u201cGOP representatives one after the other repeated the same two arguments: that their party\u2019s stop-Obamacare-at-any-cost budget strategy reflects the \u2018will of the people,\u2019 and that Democrats and President Obama simply aren\u2019t willing to compromise. The numbers tell a different, more reality-based story, which is why the natural tendency to blame both sides for the budget debacle should be checked as the shutdown and its potentially harmful economic consequences play out. \u2026 It would be one thing if House Republicans were putting only their political futures at risk. But this political equivalent to civil war will likely cause civilian casualties.\u201d\n\nDes Moines Register: \u201cIf Senate Democrats were to cave to this threat, federal budgets in the future would be held hostage to any pet project of either party. If that\u2019s the way the game is to be played, congressional Democrats could pass budget resolutions with some demands of their own: tighter controls on gun and ammo sales; elimination of limits on a woman\u2019s right to choose abortion; legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states; hefty tax increases on corporations; controls on greenhouse gas emissions; etc. What the American people have seen play out in Washington this week is a pathetic lack of leadership and statesmanship.\u201d\n\nMiami Herald: \u201cThe ACA is not perfect, as President Obama himself has acknowledged. But what\u2019s the alternative? Republicans never made a sincere effort to come up with their own version. That\u2019s one big reason ACA is now the law of the land. \u2026 The appropriate way to stop a law is to not pass it in the first place, or to repeal it. Using the budget process is not the way government should work \u2014 and not the way government has worked in the past.\u201d\n\nLexington Herald-Leader: \u201cRepublicans, who could have celebrated a win on spending cuts, must instead worry about being blamed for shutting down national parks, cutting off paychecks to 800,000-plus workers, disrupting services to veterans and halting coal mine inspections and permitting.\u201d (Worth the click: The Herald-Leader, which doesn\u2019t have great relations with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, actually paints McConnell in a favorable light: \u201cKentucky\u2019s Republican senators are offering ways to keep the government funded. Even facing a Tea Party primary challenger, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell voted to end Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s anti-Obamacare filibuster.\u201d)\n\nCharleston Gazette: \u201cRepublicans in Congress are a minority, so they cannot pass laws. But their control of the House lets them block needed legislation \u2014 thus they have power to extort. \u2026 What a disgusting mess. Why, for heaven\u2019s sake, are Republicans so determined to take health insurance away from 30 million less-privileged Americans? No wonder many Americans feel contempt for politics and don\u2019t even bother to vote.\u201d\n\nNewark Star-Ledger: \u201c[I]t is time for grown-up Republicans to step up and assert themselves. They have to talk the tea party faction off the ledge and explain that this fight is hopeless, that President Obama is not going to sabotage his own health care reform, the landmark achievement of his first term. \u2026 [\u201cExtremists in the House\"] are hostage takers. They are threatening to damage the country unless Democrats bend to their will on a policy debate they lost, fair and square. This time it is the Affordable Care Act. Next time it could be another tax cut for the rich, or an expansion of offshore oil drilling.\u201d\n\nHartford Courant: \u201cHouse Republicans \u2026 aren\u2019t fooling anyone. They who proclaim strict fealty to the Constitution are attempting to sabotage it, to thwart the process, to change a law by holding the government hostage.\u201d\n\nPortland Press Herald: \u201c[T]he people who are feeling the impact of congressional Republicans\u2019 unwillingness to compromise are people who work for the federal government or benefit from government programs. They didn\u2019t contribute to the current impasse, but they\u2019ll bear the brunt of it. And that\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner\u2019s leadership, and his hold on the Republican Conference, took a beating.\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel: \u201cThe president is right, and about three dozen tea party Republicans who are calling the shots now in Congress are dead wrong. Their leader, House Speaker John Boehner, is either unwilling or unable to stop them. He needs to try.\u201d\n\nRaleigh News & Observer: \u201cThis is a sorry commentary indeed on the ineffectiveness of Speaker John Boehner. It\u2019s another head-scratching moment. \u2026 [N]ow the question is, why can\u2019t Speaker Boehner, who has the necessary votes to pass a bill to keep the government going without attachments designed to wreck the Affordable Care Act, get that done? The answer is a maddening conundrum: Boehner fears alienating the tea partyers, who though a long way from having a majority can make mischief.\u201d\n\nConcord Monitor: \u201cThis is Boehner\u2019s government shutdown. The lachrymose speaker who cries when he sees a little kid recite the Pledge of Allegiance is shedding no tears for the kids who won\u2019t get fed because their Head Start program was closed. The House controls the budget, and the speaker controls the agenda. \u2026 House Republicans have turned out the lights because they don\u2019t like the new couch, but the public will only put up with the dark so long.\u201d\n\nHonolulu Star-Advertiser: \u201cThe standoff on Capitol Hill culminating in the current federal government shutdown represents the worst possible alternative lawmakers could have selected. It was a cynical political choice made all the more shameful by the fact that real people could suffer from it, especially if it drags on for any length of time. \u2026 [C]learly [Boehner] caved to those in his caucus who favor this kind of scorched-earth tactic, ultimately an unproductive exercise other than for the purpose of scoring political points in conservative Republican House districts.\u201d\n\nA few papers placed blame on both sides \u2014 to an extent.\n\nThe Tennessean: \u201c\u2018CLOSED\u2019 is never a sign that you want to see \u2014 especially when it\u2019s unnecessary and counterproductive. \u2026 At this point, it almost doesn\u2019t matter whom you blame for the shutdown \u2014 the president, congressional Democrats, mainstream Republicans, the tea party or all of the above \u2014 but it is very hard to fathom the perverseness of those who are happy to prove their point on the backs of millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nRichmond Times-Dispatch: \u201cThe shutdown of the federal government that began early Tuesday morning represents a massive failure on all sides of the debate in Washington. \u2026 The continuing resolution would have passed, though, if House Speaker John Boehner had been able to convince conservative upstarts to accept the proposal put forward by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia\u2019s 7th District. That would have pressed the Senate on Obamacare without forcing a shutdown. They refused. \u2026 [A] speaker of greater stature \u2014 Sam Rayburn, for instance \u2014 would have delivered just such a lesson in a manner those on the receiving end would not soon have forgotten.\u201d\n\nChicago Tribune: \u201cPast experience, though, suggests that the White House and Congress are playing with fire. Political brinkmanship in Washington creates economic uncertainty. \u2026 We can find no heroes in this government shutdown. We can find victims, though: the American citizens whose jobs and standard of living have been put in jeopardy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nation's editorial pages overwhelmingly place blame on one side in the shutdown debate.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The nation's editorial pages overwhelmingly place blame on one side in the shutdown debate.", "title": "The view from the op-ed pages: GOP takes a beating", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2013/10/02/the-view-from-the-op-ed-pages-gop-takes-a-beating/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/files/2013/10/cartoon.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@postreid"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2013/10/02/the-view-from-the-op-ed-pages-gop-takes-a-beating/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "shutdown, states,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "shutdown, states,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd845b\"", "article_summary": "Compromise and balance are being bred out of lawmaking by a haywire system.\u201dArizona Republic: \u201c[W]e need the Republican Party to rein in the madness.\nThe overwhelming number of editorial boards came to the same conclusion: That Republicans \u2014 specifically the tea party caucus \u2014 are to blame.\nNext time it could be another tax cut for the rich, or an expansion of offshore oil drilling.\u201dHartford Courant: \u201cHouse Republicans \u2026 aren\u2019t fooling anyone.\nTheir leader, House Speaker John Boehner, is either unwilling or unable to stop them.\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel: \u201cThe president is right, and about three dozen tea party Republicans who are calling the shots now in Congress are dead wrong."}
