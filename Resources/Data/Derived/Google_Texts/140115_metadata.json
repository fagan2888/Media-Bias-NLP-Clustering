Leon has been a licensed health insurance advisor for more than eight years and has flourished in the health and life industry.\n\nAs the health insurance industry began to change in the face of the Obamacare-era, many insurance companies began to alter their business models. When this shift started, Jeannette felt she could earn a more lucrative income as an insurance advisor for a larger marketplace. To her surprise, she encountered some disadvantages.\n\n\u201cThe grass wasn\u2019t as green on the other side. Brokers contracted with other companies may earn a little more money on advances, but I didn\u2019t have the same team of support, the family aspect of looking out for each other was missing, and I wasn\u2019t provided the same training opportunities that I had with IPA,\u201d said Leon.\n\nShe returns with new certification that will help her assist clients shopping both on and off the Obamacare exchanges. Through the Department of Health and Human Services, Leon sought education and training on the federal health care marketplace and became a certified insurance advisor. Her desire to help clients make the best choices drove this decision. Now, she is equipped to once again offer her services to IPA Family clients as well as new prospects that have entered the marketplace during the open-enrollment period.\n\nLeon is not coming back alone. Inspired by their mother and her experiences in the industry and with IPA Family, her children Ashley and Kevin Leon are also joining the organization.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to join a company that welcomes me and is so willing to work with someone who is in the early stages of learning about the industry,\u201d said Kevin. \u201cAlthough I set appointments for my mother for many years, I am excited to now have my own business to help others like she has.\u201d\n\nLeon has historically been in the top ten for IPA sales in the country, and together the family is looking forward to rebuilding this level of excellence in their local community. An office in the Bradenton / Sarasota area will open soon, and announcements will follow with location and career opportunities.\n\nIf you live in the Bradenton / Sarasota area and need health or life insurance advising or want more information on the Affordable Care Act and how it will affect you and your family or your business, contact Leon at 407-929-5815 or visit her HealtheDeals website.\n\nIn the state of Florida, IPA\u2019s Centers of Excellence are located in Tampa, St. Petersburg Brandon, Bradenton, Cape Coral, Clearwater.
