A key Virginia House committee plans to review a bill by Henrico Del. Peter Farrell (R-56th) that he said would make workers’ compensation more fair and transparent.

The bill, HB378, would establish fee schedules for medical services. Farrell said he is “cautiously optimistic” about the bill’s future, as reported by Capital News Service

“For at least four or five years now, we’ve been trying to figure out how to come up with a more transparent reimbursement system in our workers’ compensation world in Virginia,” he said.

Farrell said the bipartisan bill aimed to be fair to both employers and physicians. Fee schedules would determine the amount of money an employer is liable for an injured employee. The Virginia Workers’ Compensation Commission, with the help of a consulting firm, will use averaged data from 2014 and 2015 to show employers exactly where prices come from.

A fee schedule will not, however, cut the reimbursement rates for doctors. Farrell said 45 other states already had fee schedules, and they often tried to cut these reimbursements.

The only opposition Farrell said he has heard of is from people who make money from the absence of a fee schedule.

The bill unanimously passed the Committee on Commerce and Labor, and is currently awaiting discussion by the Committee on Appropriations since it could have fiscal impact.

There is an emergency clause so that if the bill is passed, the Virginia Workers’ Compensation Commission can begin work immediately. The next steps for the commission would be to begin collecting data and establishing the fee schedules, which would become effective on January 1, 2018, Farrell said.

The Commission would need two full time employees to handle the fee schedule work, according to its chief deputy commissioner.
