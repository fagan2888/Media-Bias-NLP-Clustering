Yet, the ability to focus is crucial to accomplishing most tasks. (Still reading?) Most everyone, then, would naturally be interested in a new app, Focus@will, which claims its neuroscience-based music will increase your attention span by up to 400 percent. While Wired magazine analyzes the possibility of this app delivering on its grand promise, my own version of a snap judgment is much less demanding and requires, well, a shorter attention span.\n\nBut you can decide for yourself. \u201cDo you like to listen to music while you work?\u201d the website shouts from its landing page. According to the company, which was founded by musicians, about half of us do like to work with tunes playing in the background, but that\u2019s not a great idea since mainstream music is designed to connect with you intellectually and emotionally. Instead of reducing distraction and raising your comprehension, most music essentially does the opposite.\n\nComparatively, Focus@will delivers \"attention amplifying\" music intended to \u201cengage with your brain's limbic system,\u201d according to the website. The app makes it easier for a listener to \u201cget into the concentration flow, and then keeps you there.\u201d Licensed music selections were chosen because they lacked vocals, saxophones, or other things the company has found distracting through its tests. Developed in partnership with two neuroscientists, the company claims use of the app typically results in a 12 to 15 percent positive increase in \"focus biomarker\" and up to 400 percent extended session time. Subscribers can have unlimited access for $3.99 per month.\n\nAmong the reasons Wired writer Christian Jarrett colors himself \u201cskeptical\" is a lack of data on the product. If you scan through the scientific literature provided by the company, \u201cyou\u2019ll find a wide assortment of scientific references, some decades old, others more recent,\u201d Jarrett writes. \u201cCrucially, not one of them is a trial for the benefits of the Focus@will app.\u201d Another reason for incredulity is his belief that individuals never respond uniformly to different types of music and, depending on the task, may require singular types of non-distracting background noise. Essentially, he is asking, Isn\u2019t the app too one size fits all?\n\nKudos for a thoughtful assessment, but I believe my own test for judging this app is much more efficient. Go to the free trial page. Any online music product that can\u2019t supply me with a free 10-minute demonstration without first sucking information out of me probably isn\u2019t worth it (in my most humble opinion). From past experience, companies requiring me to sign in just for dropping by are compiling email lists, which they intend to sell for a profit of which I will not be partaking... so sorry, guys. I\u2019m easy, but not that easy. I\u2019d have no problem supplying my information to a company offering a product I actually had a chance to look over and wanted to use, but to have to ante up before I\u2019ve even been allowed a test run\u2026 well, I just don\u2019t need to be plagued for eternity with emails from who-knows-where just for looking in the window. I don\u2019t have the attention span for that.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "attention span, neuroscience, music, background music, advertising claims", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "New app claims its neuroscience-based music will increase your attention span by up to 400 percent.", "title": "Listen To This App: It Could Boost Your Concentration By 400%", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/short-attention-span-apps-neuroscience-based-music-designed-increase-your-concentration-291696", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/07/background-music.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New app claims its neuroscience-based music will increase your attention span by up to 400 percent.", "title": "Listen To This App: It Could Boost Your Concentration By 400%", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/short-attention-span-apps-neuroscience-based-music-designed-increase-your-concentration-291696", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/07/background-music.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/07/background-music.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-07-07T14:09:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-07T14:09:58-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "New app claims its neuroscience-based music will increase your attention span by up to 400 percent."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ca4\"", "article_summary": "Most everyone, then, would naturally be interested in a new app, Focus@will, which claims its neuroscience-based music will increase your attention span by up to 400 percent.\nI don\u2019t have the attention span for that.\nWe are told the average attention span has plummeted from 12 seconds in 2000 to eight seconds in 2013, while that of a gold fish remains strong at 9 seconds.\nComparatively, Focus@will delivers \"attention amplifying\" music intended to \u201cengage with your brain's limbic system,\u201d according to the website.\nAny online music product that can\u2019t supply me with a free 10-minute demonstration without first sucking information out of me probably isn\u2019t worth it (in my most humble opinion)."}
