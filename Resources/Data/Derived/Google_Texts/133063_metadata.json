Ivy Fatigue\n\nIn the New Republic William Deresiewicz, author and former Yale professor, argues against sending your kids to Ivy League schools. \u201cOur system of elite education manufactures young people who are smart and talented and driven, yes, but also anxious, timid, and lost, with little intellectual curiosity and a stunted sense of purpose: trapped in a bubble of privilege, heading meekly in the same direction, great at what they\u2019re doing but with no idea why they\u2019re doing it.\u201d I don\u2019t know. I think most of these kids know they\u2019re doing it for the IPO.\n\n\n\n2. Complications\n\nWithin the space of two hours, two federal appeals courts issued two contradictory rulings on the health care insurance subsidies associated with (and necessary to) the Affordable Care Act.\n\n3. No Fly Zone\n\nFollowing a missile strike in the area surrounding Israel\u2019s only international airport, the FAA followed the lead of several international airlines and prohibited all flights to Israel for 24 hours. From Jeffrey Goldberg: \u201cThe FAA may wind up having more influence over the course of the Gaza war than the State Department.\u201d\n\n+ As international efforts towards a ceasefire continue, Hamas claims to have captured an Israeli soldier.\n\n+ \u201cMore than 500 Palestinians and at least 18 Israelis have been sacrificed on the altar of this deluded strategy. When we eventually emerge from the chaos, no one will be safer. And many of the wounds created can possibly never heal.\u201d Claire Hajaj: My Jewish mother, my Palestinian father and a family torn apart.\n\n4. Being There\n\nAs if we needed another reminder that location is everything, and that living in a society under siege can damage people in multiple ways, there\u2019s this: 11 of the parents of the abducted Nigerian schoolgirls have died since their kidnapping. Seven by violence. Four from heart failure, high blood pressure and other stress-related illnesses.\n\n5. A Little Help From My Friends\n\n\u201cIf we expect a genius to be somehow fundamentally different from the rest of humanity, studying Einstein\u2019s life and opinions will disappoint.\u201d Aeon\u2019s Matthew Francis takes on the notion of cognitive celebrity. \u201cAlbert Einstein was a genius, but he wasn\u2019t the only one \u2014 why has his name come to mean something superhuman?\u201d\n\n+ \u201cThe lone genius is a myth that has outlived its usefulness. Fortunately, a more truthful model is emerging: the creative network, as with the crowd-sourced Wikipedia or the writer\u2019s room at The Daily Show or \u2014 the real heart of creativity \u2014 the intimate exchange of the creative pair, such as John Lennon and Paul McCartney.\u201d the NYT\u2019s Joshua Wolf Shenk on the end of genius. (I think my body of solo-work suggests I was way ahead of the curve on this one\u2026)\n\n6. Corrections Academy\n\n\u201cDespite the inadvertent hilarity, the real marvel of our mobile text-correction systems is how astoundingly good they are. It\u2019s not too much of an exaggeration to call autocorrect the overlooked underwriter of our era of mobile prolixity.\u201d (More importantly, it has given wildly unfunny people a small chance of being inadvertently funny on occasion.) From Wired: The fascinating history of autocorrect.\n\n7. Sleep Apathy\n\nResearchers are staying up all night to prove just how many hours of sleep is ideal. The latest volley in the sleep wars suggests that seven hours is perfect, and the much-hyped eight hours could actually be dangerous. Wake me when it\u2019s over.\n\n+ Wired: Why does sleeping in just make me more tired?\n\n8. Welcome to Landlordia\n\nThe guest checked in but he didn\u2019t check out. And now the person who rented out the condo has learned a key lesson of the era: We\u2019re all landlords now.\n\n9. Peaking Early\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s favorite seasons of shows are seasons two and three, because you\u2019ve had a year to get to know them, and then you\u2019re still in the honeymoon period where you go, \u2018This is great!'\u201d The Atantic tries to answer that age-old question: Why do so many TV shows peak in season three?\n\n+ Netflix now has a ton of content and more than 50 million subscribers. Of course Netflix has 50 million subscribers. Where else can you get a babysitter for $8.99 a month?\n\n+ Classism, sexism, anti-environmentalism bordering on racism, and more.\n\nTracy Van Slyke with a few thoughts on Thomas the Tank Engine. And don\u2019t even get her started on Barney\u2026\n\n10. The Bottom of the News\n\nNew Yorkers are wondering who put the two white flags atop the Brooklyn Bridge. (You didn\u2019t expect the hipsters to stand and fight, did you?)\n\n+ The Cornish beaches where Lego keeps washing up.\n\n+ Chipotle is now a $20 billion company and analysts say there\u2019s still plenty of room to grow. (Sure, they could start selling real burritos\u2026)\n\n+ Derek Jeter by the numbers. It\u2019s good to be the Captain.\n\n+ And how about a little love for the Internet\u2019s least viral videos.", "article_metadata": {"description": "July 22, 2014", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "July 22, 2014", "title": "The Argument Against Ivy League Schools and Other Fascinating News on the Web", "url": "http://time.com/3020413/the-argument-against-ivy-league-educations-and-other-fascinating-news-on-the-web/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png"}, "description": "July 22, 2014", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Argument Against Ivy League Schools and Other Fascinating News on the Web"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "nextdraft", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "nextdraft"}, "article_summary": "Ivy FatigueIn the New Republic William Deresiewicz, author and former Yale professor, argues against sending your kids to Ivy League schools.\nI think most of these kids know they\u2019re doing it for the IPO.\nSleep ApathyResearchers are staying up all night to prove just how many hours of sleep is ideal.\n+ \u201cMore than 500 Palestinians and at least 18 Israelis have been sacrificed on the altar of this deluded strategy.\nThe latest volley in the sleep wars suggests that seven hours is perfect, and the much-hyped eight hours could actually be dangerous."}
