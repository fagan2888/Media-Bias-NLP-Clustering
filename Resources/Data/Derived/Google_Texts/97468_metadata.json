The objective is to knock the opposing drone to the ground or into the black mesh netting. For almost 15 minutes, Cornblatt watched his buzzing drone get battered like a beach volleyball.But life in the drone sports community may soon change. Drone operators \u2014 including hobbyists, racers and drone combatants \u2014 will likely be required to register with the federal government before flying or risk violating federal rules.The federal government\u2019s push to mandate drone registration as a way to improve safety and accountability comes as drones increase in popularity and concerns mount over incidents involving drones interfering with wildfire operations and crashing at the U.S. Open and White House.A task force convened by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has recommended operators owning drones weighing more than 250 grams \u2014 about half-a-pound \u2014 register online. Registration would allow the FAA and law enforcement to trace drones that have broken the law back to their owners.Some drone operators in the Bay Area welcome registration, but others are concerned about the potential impact it might have on the hobbyist community. Critics say the registration weight limit is too low and doubt that registration will achieve greater safety and accountability in the budding drone community.As the CEO of Aerial Sports League and founder of Game of Drones, a drone sports company, Cornblatt is not opposed to registration. But, he believes education would do more to curb bad behavior.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that the ultimate purpose of this drone registration is a little vague,\u201d Cornblatt said. \u201cThe goals of it will not necessarily be rectified by the registration process. The value of education over registration \u2026 is much more important.\u201dCornblatt wasn\u2019t on the task force, but he did serve as an expert who spoke to several of its members. In addition to drone combat, the Aerial Sports League also oversees small racing drones. These drones, he said, don\u2019t pose the same dangers as more sophisticated camera drones that fly up to 400 feet and have advanced features like auto-pilot or GPS. He hoped racing drones weighing more than 250 grams would have been exempted from task force\u2019s proposed registration rules.\u201cAll of our drones are low to the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re in close proximity and they\u2019re not going to fly away and hit an airport.\u201dCornblatt isn\u2019t alone in his dissenting views.Adrien Perkins, president of the Stanford Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Club (SUAVE), has concerns about the weight limit, too. He\u2019s also skeptical of whether drone registration will make the skies safer.\u201cYou have to draw a limit that isn\u2019t purely weight-based,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to be also based on capabilities of the aircraft.\u201dSome national experts have concerns about the registration, too.Matt Waite, a professor in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, has concerns about the 250-gram weight limit and hopes registration will be based more on a drone\u2019s capability rather than its size. Waite runs the Drone Journalism Lab and has worked at the St. Petersburg Times.\u201cAre we really going to get in the business of regulating children\u2019s toys as if they were firearms or caustic chemicals?\u201d he said.Even though the proposed registration system may be imperfect, he said, it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201cThere needs to be some way to enforce rules and hold people accountable,\u201d Waite said.\n\nThe debate surrounding drone registration intensified Oct. 19 when Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx announced plans to mandate registration for all drone operators. During his press conference, Foxx said a task force would be convened to provide recommendations to the FAA \u2014 an agency within the Department of Transportation \u2014 of what a drone registration system might look like.\n\nIn an 18-page report submitted to the FAA Nov. 21, the task force recommended creating an owner-based registration system where operators would use one registration number for all their aircraft weighing above 250 grams.The task force \u2014 comprised of individuals from companies like Amazon, Google and Walmart \u2014 said operators should be required to submit their name and street address to an online federal database before flying their aircraft.Owners would have to attach their FAA-designated registration number to their drones to be in compliance with federal rules. The Consumer Technology Association estimates 400,000 consumer drones will be purchased during the holiday season, some of which will fall under the registration category.Though the task force provided a series of recommendations for a registration system, the FAA has not indicated when or if it would adopt the task force\u2019s findings.Some local hobbyists see registration as a step forward.\n\nClay Coleman, a FAA operations supervisor in Oakland, is a drone hobbyist who has worked for the FAA for two decades. His recreational white and gold DJI Phantom 3 drone weighs more than two pounds, making it eligible for registration based on the task force\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\u201cThe main reason I really like the idea is because it will open an opportunity to educate new drone operators about the rules and regulations of airspace,\u201d he said.Coleman said registration could make the drone population more accountable.\u201cThere will be a segment of the population that still is going to do dumb things and probably cause some unfortunate tragedies,\u201d he said.\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t try to educate as many as possible,\u201d he added.Ian Gregor, a public affairs manager for the FAA\u2019s Pacific Division, agrees.\u201cWe believe this (registration) system will also make it easier to find people who ignore the rules and operate unsafely,\u201d he said in a written statement.\u201cWe recognize that registration is not the single solution to addressing unmanned aircraft safety, but it is an important part of our integrated strategy,\u201d he added.Several corporations and airports, including Los Angeles World Airports \u2013 the entity overseeing airports in Ontario, Los Angeles and Van Nuys \u2013 have endorsed registration.\u201cWe believe registration will increase accountability and contribute to ensuring operators know the rules and fly their unmanned aircraft in a responsible manner,\u201d Los Angeles World Airports said in a written statement posted on the U.S. Department of Transportation website. \u201cRegistration also will enhance multi-agency law-enforcement efforts to track down violators.\u201dBut whether drone operators will submit correct personal information to the FAA registration database is concerning to some like Jonathan Rupprecht, a Florida-based drone lawyer who represents clients seeking federal exemptions for commercial drone use.He expressed concern over the lack of ID-verification in the proposed registration database and said federal rule-making process could prevent registration from being implemented until next year.\u201cIt\u2019s all going to fall apart because it\u2019s not comprehensive enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the major problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Drone operators will soon likely be required to register with the federal government before flying or risk violating federal rules.", "title": "Proposed drone registration rules draw mixed reactions from Bay Area hobbyists - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4.drone_coleman_cropped.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-12T06:26:06+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/12/09/proposed-drone-registration-rules-reactions/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "uav", "published_time": "2015-12-09T09:03:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-12T06:26:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Drone operators will soon likely be required to register with the federal government before flying or risk violating federal rules.", "creator": "@journoshane", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4.drone_coleman_cropped.jpg", "title": "Proposed drone registration rules draw mixed reactions from Bay Area hobbyists - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12f5\"", "article_summary": "The debate surrounding drone registration intensified Oct. 19 when Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx announced plans to mandate registration for all drone operators.\nHe\u2019s also skeptical of whether drone registration will make the skies safer.\u201cYou have to draw a limit that isn\u2019t purely weight-based,\u201d he said.\nThe drone-fighting sport, which bears similarities to sumo wrestling and demolition derbies, pits two drone operators against each other.\nBut, he believes education would do more to curb bad behavior.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that the ultimate purpose of this drone registration is a little vague,\u201d Cornblatt said.\nFor almost 15 minutes, Cornblatt watched his buzzing drone get battered like a beach volleyball.But life in the drone sports community may soon change."}
