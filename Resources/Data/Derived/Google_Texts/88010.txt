Need a laugh? Look no further! Funny or Die just released the video, “Little Republicans: Presidential Debate Highlights” – a spinoff of the GOP debate – and it’s a total gem. From the kid with the Rand Paul hairdo, to the Scott Walker impersonation… this is pretty GOP dog-gone awesome.

They straight up look like young Republicans! Except, way cuter.
