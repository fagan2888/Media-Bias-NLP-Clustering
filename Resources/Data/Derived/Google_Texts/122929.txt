With less than three weeks left to go before the end of the session, the Supreme Court today handed down three new opinions, including in Kerry v. Din. In that case, the court ruled that an American citizen cannot challenge the government’s decision not to award a visa to his or her non-citizen spouse.

The court still has yet to rule on the big cases that everyone is waiting for, including gay marriage, the Affordable Care Act and lethal injections.

Here & Now’s Robin Young talks with Dahlia Lithwick, who covers the Supreme Court for Slate, about Kerry v. Din, what’s left on the docket and why the Court tends to leave the biggest cases for last.
