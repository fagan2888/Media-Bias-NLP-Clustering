The owners (Ralph Sacco and Tony Gigliott) addressed the criticism by saying that the logo honors First Nations culture and that it\u2019s part of the community\u2019s longstanding history.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nA Facebook page \u201cIs the Thorold Blackhawks Logo Offensive?\u201d is designed as \u201ca place for discussion if people are offended by the First Nations caricature.\u201d\n\nAlso on the group\u2019s discussion page are photos of goods, such as an Indian American doll with the #thisisastereotype hashtag and caricatures of historically racists Native cartoonish images like Native Warriors to point out why the images are demeaning; and several shared stories pointing to the fact that Dan Snyder\u2019s Washington Redskins name and logo are offensive.\n\nOn the team\u2019s home page, a rebuttal to the media attention about the logo says:\n\nBlack Hawk was charismatic, courageous and heroic. It is with characteristics such as these that one is commemorated; a name lives on, books are written and statues are erected. Black Hawk made such an impact on North American history that the U.S. Navy named vessels after him, various states named cities, bridges, lakes and colleges after him.\n\nI believe that drawing inspiration from our fearless leaders and commemorating their intrepidness is important. It helps our children to learn history and pass a valuable heritage on to succeeding generations.\n\nThe Thorold Blackhawk icon symbolizes the spirit of a great warrior and exemplifies strength, courage and determination.\n\nI welcome the question \u201cWhy did Thorold name its Junior \u201cB\u201d team after Black Hawk?\u201d The answer inspires us to learn more about who Black Hawk was and help his legacy endure in our Blackhawks team.\n\nThe St. Catherine Standard, an Ontario online publication, reported that the hockey team and First Nations activists expect a resolution over the logo before the team starts its season this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blackhawk Down: Is this Logo Offensive?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/18/blackhawk-down-logo-offensive-155923", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/thorold_blackhawks.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Blackhawk Down: Is this Logo Offensive?"}, "abstract": "Blackhawk Down: Is this Logo Offensive?", "dc": {"title": "Blackhawk Down: Is this Logo Offensive?"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/18/blackhawk-down-logo-offensive-155923", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Thorold Blackhawks, Ontario, Canada, hockey, Redskins, logo", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-07-18T10:42-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Blackhawk Down: Is this Logo Offensive?"}, "article_summary": "On the team\u2019s home page, a rebuttal to the media attention about the logo says:Black Hawk was charismatic, courageous and heroic.\nBlack Hawk made such an impact on North American history that the U.S. Navy named vessels after him, various states named cities, bridges, lakes and colleges after him.\nThe members of St. Andrew\u2019s Presbyterian Church in Thorold sent a letter to the team\u2019s owners asking that they change the logo, reported Yahoo News.\nThe Thorold Blackhawk icon symbolizes the spirit of a great warrior and exemplifies strength, courage and determination.\nThe Blackhawks are a junior hockey team in Thorold, Ontario, and for the last year, their logo has come under scrutiny from local newspapers, on social media, and from the members of a church congregation."}
