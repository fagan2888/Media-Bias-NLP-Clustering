We want them to have the most accurate and updated information especially because of the trust that individuals give from the community,\u201d Escobar said.\n\nThe promotora and navigator forum, titled \u201cIt\u2019s Our Turn,\u201d helped the promotoras to provide consistant responses on topics they frequently encounter here, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe got together to be on the same page, to learn about what is going on with health reform, and discuss nutrition, exercise and diabetes. We want to be concious that we are on the same page, and we want to be prepared to help the community,\u201d Elvia Alcala, Promotora de Salud and STPA Cameron County coordinator, said in Spanish.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that promotoras are prepared because we can better serve the community. We are the ones that knock on the doors, visiting families and advising them on recourses they have available, and telling them what clinics to go to, and where to find help,\u201d Alcala said.\n\nThe promotoras also learned the importance of their own personal development from keynote speaker Alberto Trevi\u00f1o, who addressed them Sunday, and Fernando Martinez who spoke about empowerment during uncertainty.\n\n\u201cA lot of the time we don\u2019t take time for ourselves. We need to take care of ourselves so that we can take care of others,\u201d Minerva Garcia, a Hidalgo County promotora, said. \u201c(We learned) how to take care of ourselves, how to be less stressed, and how to be good listeners so that in return we can be prepared and listen to our community.\u201d\n\nThe forum continued Monday, when speaker Enrique Griego addressed obesity facts, challenges and strategies.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a lot of obesity, especially in our teens. We have a lot of teens that are 12 or 13 that are overweight, but they do not consider themselves overweight because they are healthy,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cSo how do we address things like that? We don\u2019t want to insult people, but we also want to teach them about preventative checkups or screenings that can help them.\u201d\n\nTrevi\u00f1o spoke Monday about the Affordable Care Act, and the navigator concept, which officials said is similar promotora work.\n\n\u201cThe navigators are basically helping the community navigate through the Affordable Care Act, to see who qualifies, what families qualify, which is what the promotora already does with Medicaid and CHIP,\u201d Escobar said, adding that several STPA promotoras are in the process of becoming navigator certified, and more are expected to participate in future training.\n\nThe promotoras also held a walk for cancer research at the beach, discussed strategies for capacity building, and participated in social events during the forum.\n\nPersons seeking assistance from STPA promotora can reach the STPA office at 956-383-5393, or by email email at stpa08@sbcglobal.net.\n\njmendoza@valleystar.com", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Brownsville Herald", "description": "SOUTH PADRE ISLAND \u2014 About 60 South Texas Promotora Association members from as far away as Laredo attended the two-day forum here, seeking to emphasize the importance of personal development, discuss common health issues, and answer questions about navigators and the health care reform.", "title": "Promotoras stress self-motivation, healthy living", "url": "http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/local/article_d8a011be-2fc5-11e3-b53a-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": "http://www.aim-ads.com/multimedia-themonitor-com/wwwroot/herald_icon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@BrownsvilleNews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "SOUTH PADRE ISLAND \u2014 About 60 South Texas Promotora Association members from as far away as Laredo attended the two-day forum here, seeking to emphasize the importance of personal development, discuss common health issues, and answer questions about navigators and the health care reform.", "fb": {"app_id": 218220474972284}, "keywords": "local", "google-site-verification": "fIj8GGnpBGNOd0kOB7XPSmHJNw93FzFvUQDoiX4ibFY", "news_keywords": "local"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b21\"", "article_summary": "Persons seeking assistance from STPA promotora can reach the STPA office at 956-383-5393, or by email email at stpa08@sbcglobal.net.\nWe want them to have the most accurate and updated information especially because of the trust that individuals give from the community,\u201d Escobar said.\nThe promotora and navigator forum, titled \u201cIt\u2019s Our Turn,\u201d helped the promotoras to provide consistant responses on topics they frequently encounter here, officials said.\n\u201cWe call it STPA promotoras get it DONE because of Diabetes, Obesity, Nutrition and Excercise, and that is what we are focusing on today,\u201d STPA CEO Merida Escobar said about the outreach efforts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that promotoras are prepared because we can better serve the community."}
