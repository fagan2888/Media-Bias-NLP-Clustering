The city of Ferguson, Missouri, is being forced to return two military Humvees used by law enforcement to the Pentagon amid concern over vehicles intended for war zones being deployed during protests.

Several government officials told The Guardian that the Obama administration will reclaim the two vehicles that were deployed to the St. Louis suburb where violent protesting has erupted again, a year after the shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer.

“They have simply informed us they will be taking them back,” said Jeff Small, a spokesman for Ferguson.

Although the Defense Department ordered the city to return the pair of Humvees in June, similar military vehicles were deployed Sunday night.

The Humvees were initially distributed as part of a national program to provide surplus military equipment and weapons to local police departments.

Pentagon officials recalled the vehicles after discovering the city had been given twice as many vehicles in 2013 without proper federal authorization, International Business Times reported.

Officials stressed that the Humvees were not being recalled because of civil unrest in the city.

“The Ferguson police department officially has two Humvees on their books, the state coordinators provided the police department two more Humvees without following the proper transfer protocol,” Mark Wright, a spokesman for the Defense Department, told The Guardian in a statement.

The city’s attempt to appeal the decision to recall the vehicles was rejected by the Pentagon.

President Obama ordered a government-wide review of the surplus military equipment distribution program following national outcry over police militarization demonstrated during protesting in Ferguson last year.
