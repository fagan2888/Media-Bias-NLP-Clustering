And the federal government is mishandling many of those applications.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nEvelyn Burdick thought it would be easy to apply for her American Indian exemption. As a member of the Cherokee Nation, the Anchorage resident sees a doctor at the Alaska Native Medical Center. Burdick likes the care she gets there and has no plans to sign up for private insurance under Obamacare. So she sent an exemption application to the federal government almost as soon as it was available, on January 9th:\n\n\u201cI have yet to receive any correspondence from them back whatsoever. Not even to let me know they\u2019ve received my application.\u201d\n\nBurdick is not alone. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium has helped hundreds of Alaska Natives and American Indians in the state who have had problems with their exemption applications. The exemption is a simple six digit number applicants need for their tax forms to avoid paying a penalty ($95 dollars or 1% of income, whichever is greater) for not having health insurance. Monique Martin, with ANTHC, has been working with the federal government to resolve the problems:\n\n\u201cEvery time we call it\u2019s a bear with us sort of request but we\u2019ve been bearing with them since February when we first started reporting issues and we are anxious for a resolution to this issue.\u201d\n\nThe Federal government has fumbled the applications in several different ways. Martin works closely with three other people at ANTHC who all applied for the exemption for themselves. Martin\u2019s exemption number came back with no problems. But her three colleagues were not so lucky:\n\n\u201cOne of our coworkers received her letter twice, with two different exemption numbers for her and her kids. One received the wrong exemption\u2026 and another one is still waiting to hear on her application. So we\u2019ve seen all the errors come to us, so we have real world examples that we can show the federal government.\u201d\n\nNo one from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was willing to do an interview for this story. In an e-mail, a spokesperson with the agency wrote that they are working to improve the process daily and committed to providing consumers with their exemption numbers in time for tax filing season. Martin says she\u2019s cautiously optimistic that can happen:\n\n\u201cWe are the squeaky wheel in Alaska and we\u2019re really pushing the federal government to resolve this issue and to get this addressed for people so they aren\u2019t negatively impacted.\u201d\n\nMartin worries about how the federal government will handle the rush of exemption applications as tax time approaches. She expects many Alaska Natives and American Indians haven\u2019t even thought about sending in the application yet. Evelyn Burdick, who was proactive and applied early in the process, says the nine month long wait for a response has been frustrating:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be penalized for not having the healthcare.gov insurance. I\u2019m trying to follow the rules and regulations that healthcare.gov set up and they\u2019re not making it any easier.\u201d\n\nLate last month, Monique Martin was able to get Burdick\u2019s exemption number for her from a contact at the federal government. Burdick is happy to have the number, but she still wants to see it in writing. She says she has no idea when it will arrive in her mailbox, but at this rate she\u2019s not expecting it any time soon.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership between APRN, NPR and Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "Most Americans are supposed to have health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.
