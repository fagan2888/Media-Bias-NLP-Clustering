And while Santa, being immortal, has no need for life insurance, it\u2019s certainly cool (pun fully intentional) to know that the cost of replacing his work by hiring some other jovial, bearded, chubby senior citizen with a knack for driving airborne sleds and reindeer wrangling would come in at $139,924 this year.\n\nRelated: The 9 Holiday Gifts Everyone Wants This Year\n\nThat estimate, based largely on his role as what Insure.com calls \u201can industrial engineer managing the North Pole toy factory,\u201d is probably more than St. Nick needs, but would rank as a pretty paltry CEO compensation package.\n\nThe salary projection also means that Santa should be in line for something that far too few Americans saw in 2014 \u2014 a raise. The value of Santa\u2019s work is $2,000 higher than it was in 2013. That might help cover any increase in Santa\u2019s own costs, given that the volatility in global commodity prices, which could take a toll on the cost of reindeer feed.\n\nAnd Santa has something else that a lot of other Americans may well envy: job security. Let\u2019s face it, nobody\u2019s going to give him the boot. The job is his, permanently.\n\nBut while you might be envious at the value of Santa\u2019s compensation package, not to mention the raise, you may want to stop and ponder what he has to do to earn it. (See the Insure.com breakdown below.)\n\nFirst of all, there\u2019s the North Pole. I didn\u2019t see any mention in there of hardship pay, and if you think living in icy winter climes like Minneapolis and Chicago is unpleasant in December and January, try the North Pole for 12 months a year. Sure, it looks charming on the holiday cards \u2014 but that\u2019s all marketing. If Soviet-era diplomats could get hardship bonuses when being posted to Ottawa, Canada, surely Santa could get a 20 percent bonus for spending his life in a rather isolated and frozen location nearly 3,000 miles further north?\n\nThen, too, there are the elves. The Insure.com estimate calculates that Santa can expect to spend 182.5 hours every year as a labor negotiator (at $27.20 an hour) and 2,912 hours a year overseeing workshop operations, with the latter earning him a total of $116,000 of his compensation. But while I\u2019m sure every narcissistic, politically incorrect CEO complains he\u2019s working with mental midgets, jolly old Santa manages to keep order in a warehouse full of merry elves \u2014 and, judging from all the toys being delivered to boys and girls around the world, he clearly gets maximum productivity out of his staff. There\u2019s a strong case to be made that Santa deserves more than the standard hourly rate of $40.09 for this (and that the elves deserve some great performance bonuses, too).\n\nRelated: 10 of the Most Inappropriate Toys for Kids\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Santa clearly should stick a zero on the end of his hourly rate for shopping mall visits (currently $16.04). Nothing can possibly compensate for the indignity of having your beard pulled, screaming toddlers dumped in your lap or even \u2014 horror of horrors \u2014 imperfectly toilet trained cherubs forcing you to dry-clean yet another brand new red suit.\n\nOn the other hand, billing $62.31 an hour for 10-hour global joyride through the sky, outside the reach of all radar tracking devices and without having to abide by the channels reserved for commercial aircraft? That\u2019s clearly a perk, and not a legitimate expense.\n\nSpeaking of perks, these appear to be largely missing from the Santa Index. Possibly that\u2019s because Santa really doesn\u2019t have to plan for his retirement, after all, so there\u2019s no need for a matching 401(k) contribution or pension plan. But for a guy who spends his time charging across the sky guiding reindeer and trying to land with pinpoint accuracy atop roofs, attempting to squeeze his bulk down chimneys, and sampling milk and cookies left out by people he has never met (you know what people have told you about taking candy from strangers\u2026), surely he could use some decent health insurance? And some liability insurance wouldn\u2019t go amiss, either. Let\u2019s hope that someone is providing him with these necessities.\n\nSo, if this represents the value of Santa\u2019s services, and some of the factors that we could weigh in determining his 2015 compensation, how much should he earn?\n\nInsure.com was curious enough to ask 895 households about that \u2014 households who say Santa pays them a visit every year and presumably have a vested interest in his continued motivation to generate repeat visits. The division of opinion revealed by the survey is enough to make any board of directors quail. It seems that 29 percent of respondents would be happy to pay Santa about $1 for every child under the age of 15 in the world (his estimated constituency), or a whopping $1.8 billion. Another 29 percent \u2014 the \u201cbah humbug\u201d board \u2014 would pay him nothing at all.\n\nRelated: Holiday Shopping Alert \u2014 The Most Dangerous Toys for Kids\n\nThe next time that a corporate CEO like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase or Coca Cola\u2019s Muhtar Kent finds himself or herself under fire for collecting a supersized salary, they may want to ponder that before protesting about their value to the organization.\n\nThe Santa Index 2014\n\nSanta's Job BLS Occupation Title Hours/ day Days/ year Hours/ Year Mean hourly\n\nwage Annual Earnings Running the workshop\n\nIndustrial Engineers 8 364 2912 $40.09 $116,742 Professional shopper Sales and Related Workers, All Other 8 15 120 $16.50 $1,980 Wrapper of gifts Packers and Packagers, Hand 12 14 168 $10.90 $1,831 Labor negotiator (with the elves) Labor Relations Specialists 0.5 365 182.5 $27.20 $4,964 Letter reader Correspondence Clerks 1 100 100 $17.22 $1,722 Talking to kids in the mall Customer Service Representatives 8 21 168 $16.04 $2,695 Investigator (knows if you've been good or bad) Private Detectives and Investigators 1 30 30 $25.91 $777 List checker (checking it twice) Bookkeeping, Accounting, and Auditing Clerks 1 30 30 $17.91 $537 Taking care of reindeer Farm Workers, Farm, Ranch, and Aquacultural Animals 1 365 365 $11.91 $4,347 Snow plow driver Highway Maintenance Workers 0.5 360 180 $17.78 $3,200 Sleigh pilot Airline Pilots, Copilots, and Flight Engineers 10 1 10 $62.31 $623 Chimney sweep Building Cleaning Workers, All Other 10 1 10 $14.57 $146 Cookie taster Agricultural Inspectors 10 1 10 $20.96 $210 Gift distributor Shipping, Receiving, and Traffic Clerks 10 1 10 $14.93 $149 Announcer (\"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!\") Public Address System and Other Announcers 0.01 1 0.01 $18.60 $0 Total Santa salary for 2014: $139,924\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "So, just how much does Santa Claus pocket for his Christmas Eve sprint around the worl", "title": "New Data Shows Santa Claus Is Worth a Mere $139,924 a Year", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/09/What-s-Santa-Claus-Worth-Six-Figures-Least", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/05152013_Senior_Jobs_Santa_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/09/What-s-Santa-Claus-Worth-Six-Figures-Least", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/05152013_Senior_Jobs_Santa_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "So, just how much does Santa Claus pocket for his Christmas Eve sprint around the worl", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3bdb\"", "article_summary": "The value of Santa\u2019s work is $2,000 higher than it was in 2013.\nFirst of all, there\u2019s the North Pole.\nThe salary projection also means that Santa should be in line for something that far too few Americans saw in 2014 \u2014 a raise.\nPublic Address System and Other Announcers 0.01 1 0.01 $18.60 $0 Total Santa salary for 2014: $139,924Top Reads from The Fiscal Times:\nAnd Santa has something else that a lot of other Americans may well envy: job security."}
