Both are sharp looking single-family resort designs, never seen before, with HUGE room for you to entertain kids, grandkids, cousins and friends \u2013 and if you buy now, Village will include a session with a decorator, and credits for a full complement of your choice of alpine interior furnishings.\n\nMeanwhile, in a family-friendly resort where there\u2019s still time for summer biking, hiking and fishing, Village will give you a twosome for 18 holes on the scenic Golf Granby Ranch course, just for coming to see the model and Village\u2019s ski-in/ski-out \u2018Tall Timber\u2019 enclave, nestled between two of Granby Ranch\u2019s lifts. The first 25 families will receive the coupons for a return golf visit; and will see the site beside the course where Granby Ranch\u2019s developer has committed to begin construction on a clubhouse and residents\u2019 pavilion.\n\nMove into either home this coming month and you can start spending weekends here right away \u2013 using the swim club and spa; the trails into 5,000 acres of back country; Granby Ranch\u2019s own trout lease along the Fraser River that winds through meadow below the golf course; and Granby Ranch Grill in the remodeled base lodge, where you can meet the neighbors and wind-down over drinks and dinner after a day on the trail. This winter, you and the kids can be using Ski Granby Ranch\u2019s trails and terrain parks (owners get full family lift passes, plus some golf foursomes, as part of their monthly HOA). All of this is only 20 minutes from the slopes at Winter Park; 93 miles from downtown Denver \u2014 closer than Vail, while avoiding the Eisenhower Tunnel.\n\nNot surprisingly, Village\u2019s Sheila Bailey (you\u2019ll meet her this weekend) is Grand County\u2019s fastest selling agent; showing single-family designs that wrap a huge complement of appealing, functional holiday space into fetching Colorado mountain architecture. She\u2019ll show you a Connemara plan ready for move in within weeks, with 3,800 square feet of finished space, on a main level with entertaining area and master suite, a walkout level with plenty of room for guest suites and a bunkroom, and in an upstairs loft for a library or retreat. The five-bedroom cabin is at $684,000 \u2014 and Bailey can show you another on the same September timetable, with 3,012 square feet at $599,000.\n\nShe\u2019ll also let you see where other homes are coming on line about the time the snow flies \u2013 and three home sites right on Granby Ranch\u2019s Owners Lift where Village could create a highly personalized retreat for you, at a base price including lot premium from the mid-to-high $500s. Village\u2019s Signature Retreat Collection model is located on the way into Granby Ranch just before the ski lodge; but the two homes nearing completion are totally new plans, never viewed before this weekend \u2013 each with rustic stone fireplaces, engineered wood floors, granite kitchen tops with a Travertine backsplash, set beneath high ceilings and lodge-style windows, with a large loft perched overhead. Both have two-car garages and \u201cgear rooms\u201d where you can strap on skis or store your fly rods and backpacks.\n\nGranby Ranch is 90 minutes west of Denver; to reach the model from I-70 take U.S. 40 west 43 mi. (15 mi. past Winter Park) to Village Road, then east 1.8 mile to the model at Fairway Lane.\n\nTall Timber at Granby Ranch by Village Homes; ski-in/out cabins on Ski Granby Ranch mountain, furnished for move-in; two homes for early fall occupancy on view sites; 4-season amenities with skiing, biking, golf, trout waters; free 18-hole golf twosome for first 25 visitors. 108 Fairway Ln, Granby; from I-70 take U.S. 40 west 43 mi. (15 mi. past Winter Park) to Village Rd., right 1.8 mi. to Fairway Ln\n\nFrom low $500s, furnished cabin move-in $599,000\n\n970-887-0144\n\nMark Samuelson writes on real estate and business; you can email him atmark@samuelsonassoc.com.
