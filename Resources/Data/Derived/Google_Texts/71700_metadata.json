As you can imagine, the declaration from such a high-powered woman that she submits to her husband didn\u2019t go over too well with audiences during a previous episode of the show, but wpeaking with Sister 2 Sister, Dr. Kimes didn\u2019t back down from her beliefs, telling the magazine:\n\n\u201cI submit to my husband. I make my husband\u2019s food. I take care of the household. I understand my role as a wife and a mother. \u201cBlack women need to see a woman who takes care of a household, who\u2019s married with children and that\u2019s not seen a whole lot,\u201d she said, adding that regarding the show as a whole, \u201cIt should be applauded that all of us are educated. We talk about business, money and relationships. I think that\u2019s a part of the whole scope of life.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s get back to that whole household thing though, shall we? Dr. Kimes\u2019 position certainly isn\u2019t new and, for many, is a biblical mandate, but we\u2019re going to guess what most female viewers took issue with more than her cooking dinner for her husband was calling him \u201cdaddy.\u201d Explaining her vernacular, she said:\n\n\u201cI thought that was cute. When my son was born, I would say \u2018Damon\u2019 and both of them would answer.\u201d\n\nGuess the nickname just stuck after, huh?\n\nI don\u2019t know about you but I feel a side-eye coming on. True, we don\u2019t see many brown women who are happily married with children on TV, but are we lacking a submissive role model to show us how to take care of house and home? I\u2019m not sure about that.
