As reports were beginning to emerge that “Fast & Furious” actor Paul Walker was killed in a car accident in Southern California Saturday, the news editor at a feminist blog jumped at the chance to use the tragedy to go after Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.

In response to the tragic news, Erin Gloria Ryan, news editor at Jezebel.com, posted a despicable comment:

Ryan quickly had second thoughts and deleted the tweet, but a firestorm of criticism was already building. She posted an apology that read: “No excuse. It was dumb. I’m sorry.” And then a follow up tweet as the firestorm continued to build:

I don’t wish death on anyone. Joking about that was insensitive and inappropriate. — Erin Gloria Ryan (@morninggloria) December 1, 2013

As for the wave of criticism, Twitchy.com chronicled some of tweets directed at Ryan:
