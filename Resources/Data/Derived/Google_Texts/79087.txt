Many in Southwest Florida are saying goodbye this week to a teen who died shortly after collapsing during a workout, but left behind a big gift.

Family and friends gathered Saturday at HealthPark Medical Center to remember Alexis Bonadies, who was a sophomore at Riverdale High School.

When Alexis, 15, got her learner's permit, she made sure to become an organ donor. It was a decision her parents didn't understand at the time, but now that Alexis is gone, it all makes sense.

Alexis collapsed after a workout at home. She went into cardiac arrest, then an induced coma, before she died Friday.

"She went into some type of convulsion, I was screaming her name and she didn't wake up and then I called 911," her mother Kim said.

Her father Louis described his last words to his daughter. "'Alexis, I'll meet you at the hospital, I love you.' Those were the last words I said to her."

Kim described finding out about Alexis' decision to be an organ donor.

"You don't think of it at the time. At the time as her mom I'm thinking no, you're crazy don't do that, what's wrong with you?"

But now it makes sense, they said.

"She's a brave, strong girl and knowing that someone is going to be able to get out of that hospital and on with their lives..." said Stephanie Mendoza, a friend of Alexis.

On Saturday, HealthPark raised a flag to honor Alexis' decision to donate, a choice her parents said proves what type of person their daughter was.

"It was completely her decision, you know, sitting while she was laying there. If there is anything that could've been done for her, I would've wished that some other teenager would've been as thoughtful and kind," Kim said.

Those considering becoming an organ donor can make that decision online.
