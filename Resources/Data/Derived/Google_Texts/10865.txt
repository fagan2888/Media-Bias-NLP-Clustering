Rain, wind and waves pound Ocean Isle Beach as Tropical Storm Ana moves through on Sunday, May 10, 2015.

BRUNSWICK COUNTY, NC (WWAY) — Tropical Storm Ana made landfall around 6 a.m. between Myrtle Beach and North Myrtle Beach, SC. That means Brunswick County has been squarely in the cross hairs of the storm.

Heavy rain soaked Brunswick County overnight with reports of 1-3 feet of water from overwash along East 5th Street and Shallotte Blvd. in Ocean Isle Beach early this morning. Flooding continues to be a serious concern, and flood warnings have been posted much of the night and into the morning.

As day broke, Brunswick County Emergency Services said there was not much going on other than some street flooding. Through the day, though, the rain picked up, dropping several inches in some places and causing ponding and more concerns about flooding.

Throughout the night there were scattered power outages in Brunswick, New Hanover and Columbus counties, but all were resolved fairly quickly, including one that affected about 1,300 customers in Wilmington and another the cut power to about 400 customers in Whiteville.
