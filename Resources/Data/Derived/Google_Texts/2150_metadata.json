I can\u2019t think of any. There are no doubt issues that politicians ignore, but do they have overwhelming support like marijuana reform? Why do politicians get away with this?\n\nThere is a reason provided in the Oregonian article:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a political risk,\u201d said Adam Davis, whose Portland-based firm of Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall frequently conducts polls and focus groups on public policy. \u201cI think elected officials are held to a higher standard,\u201d Davis added. \u201cThey\u2019re paid with tax dollars and people feel they should be doing their job with a clear head.\u201d\n\nSo elected officials are held to a higher standard\u2026and they should be doing their jobs with a clear head\u2026Can I take that to assume that no politicians consume alcohol? How many fundraisers and other events do they attend where they drink wine or other forms of alcohol? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to assume that they consume alcohol on numerous occasions, while on the clock considering they are always on the clock. Marijuana is undoubtedly safer than alcohol, so I fail to see how this is a valid reason. If a politician consumes marijuana they get pushed out of office. Yet if they get smashed on booze every night there\u2019s no issue. Why?\n\nThe fact of the matter is a lot of politicians accept money from opponents of the marijuana industry. Pharmaceutical companies, alcohol companies, law enforcement lobbyists, prison lobbyists, just about anyone who has ever worked with Kevin Sabet \u2013 they all fund marijuana prohibition. So it\u2019s not about what the public thinks, or doing what is right, it\u2019s about doing what makes politicians money.\n\nThere is one great equalizing weapon that marijuana supporters have to get around the reefer madness coalition that most politicians are a part of \u2013 the initiative process. Colorado and Washington politicians didn\u2019t legalize marijuana. Average citizens who were tired of the political minority determining the marijuana laws that they had to live by took matters into their own hands. Unfortunately, not all states have the initiative process. But enough do that if they all passed marijuana legalization initiatives the rest of the states would follow suit. So get active, and don\u2019t let out of touch politicians keep marijuana prohibition in place just so they can line their own pockets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If a politician consumes marijuana they get pushed out of office.
