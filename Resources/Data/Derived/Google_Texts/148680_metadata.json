Weight Watchers, for example, makes the weekly weigh-in a cornerstone of its plan.\n\nBut a new Brown University and University of Tennessee study of 178 adults, average age 52, found that subjects who weighed themselves daily lost more weight than those who didn\u2019t do this.\n\n\u201cWe teach participants to view the weight on the scale as information. Stepping on the scale regularly gives you feedback about whether your weight is in the desired range and enables you to take corrective action if it is not,\u201d said coauthor Jessica Gokee LaRose, an assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown, who specializes in obesity prevention.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Health Newsletter\n\nLaRose said in an email that this study, due to be published next month in the journal Health Psychology, as well as others have found that a daily weight check \u201cis not associated with negative psychological effects,\u201d like depression or eating disorders. In fact, she added, \u201cthe opposite is often observed,\u201d with people making more lifestyle changes to help them take, or keep, the weight off.\n\nPrevious research seems to back her up. A University of Minnesota study that tracked the scale habits of 1,800 dieting adults showed that those who weighed themselves daily lost an average of 12 pounds over two years, while those who checked their weight weekly lost only 6. The daily weighers were also less likely to regain the pounds they had lost.\n\nSimilarly, a study of 3,500 members of the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) who had lost 60 or more pounds and had kept them off for at least a year found that 44 percent weighed themselves daily. And according to Drexel University researchers who checked in with 3,000 successful dieters after a year, those who stopped weighing themselves daily regained more weight than did those who kept up the daily routine.\n\nWeight-loss researcher Sherry Pagoto, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, said people who have trouble \u201cfacing the music\u201d by stepping on the scale should remember that \u201cit\u2019s just information\u201d to help you see which behaviors result in small gains or losses. Knowing your weight each morning can help when you\u2019re deciding on which foods to eat during the day or whether to skip exercise, she said in an email.\n\n>> Get entertainment and dining discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\n\u201cWeighing yourself isn\u2019t the scary part,\u201d she added. \u201cAvoiding the scale is what creates the fear.\u201d Make it part of your morning routine, like brushing your teeth, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple act that can result in weight loss.\u201d\n\nPhoto: pidjoe/iStock\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "\u201cDon\u2019t weigh yourself every day\u201d was the advice experts used to give for those of us trying to lose weight, but a growing number of studies find that people actually lose more weight \u2013 and keep it off\u00a0 \u2013 if they step on the scale daily.
