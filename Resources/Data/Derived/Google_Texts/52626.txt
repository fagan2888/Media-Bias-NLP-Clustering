Re: “A sleazy political ad; what’s new?,” Sept. 24 editorial.

Sen. Michael Bennet’s support for the Iran deal endangers our safety and jeopardizes the future. The deal allows Iran to pursue weapons, arms, cash and intercontinental ballistic missile systems and does not provide the adequate safeguards to Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon.

Out of the right side of his mouth, Bennet says, “Iran is the biggest exporter of terrorism in the world; Iran is anti-Semitic; Iran has threatened the existence of Israel; Iran has threatened our existence; Iran has done nothing to earn the validation of its nuclear program.” Out of the left he says, “Nay,” as he votes in favor of Iran building a nuclear weapon and wiping Israel off the face of the map.

On perhaps the most pressing national security issue of a generation, Bennet and his allies in the upper chamber refused to allow an up-or-down vote on a bipartisan disapproval resolution on Obama’s dangerous Iran deal.

While walking hand-in-hand with President Obama and Ayatollah Khomeini and giving a voice to radical Iranians, Bennet rejects the opinions of those who will suffer the consequences.

Rational and informed Coloradans do not support the Iran deal and social media has provided an outlet for the public outcry on this issue. Voters are outraged with the political class acting against their best interests, and Bennet’s votes to silence our voices shows he is not listening to us.

Coloradans don’t want to see the largest state sponsor of terror enriched with the means to pursue its dangerous agenda, and that’s why so many Coloradans have joined Advancing Colorado in opposition to Bennet’s support for the deal.
