He said Monday that he was leaving to work with his wife and son on a new streetwear brand.\n\n\"I believe that now is the right time to step away,\" Wilson said in a statement.\n\nWilson started Vancouver, Canada-based Lululemon in 1998. The brand helped pioneer a wave of stylish workout gear that women increasingly wear in daily life outside the gym. The company has grown to more than 250 stores.\n\nThe retailer and its founder have weathered their share of rough times.\n\nWilson resigned as chairman in late 2013 after Lululemon was forced to recall thousands of black yoga pants because of a manufacturing defect that made them see-through -- a wardrobe malfunction that online wits quickly dubbed \"sheer-gate.\"\n\nLululemon Athletica store Joe Raedle / Getty Images A woman walks past a Lululemon Athletica store in Miami on Dec. 10, 2013.

The deal gave Advent control of nearly 14% of outstanding shares in the retailer. Wilson's stake in the company is also about 14%.\n\nWilson said Monday that he believed Lululemon was back on track after it had \"lost its way.\"\n\n\"I had to raise a strong voice to make myself heard,\" he said. \"I am happy to say that I now believe the company has returned to the core values that made it great.\"\n\nShares of Lululemon closed down 72 cents, or 1.1%, to $65.52.\n\nFollow Shan Li on Twitter @ShanLi", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Lululemon Athletica founder Chip Wilson steps down from board", "date": "2015-02-02", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Lululemon Athletica Inc. founder Chip Wilson, who helped make the yoga pant a wardrobe staple for many women, has resigned from the retailer's board.", "title": "Lululemon Athletica founder Chip Wilson steps down from board", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lululemon-founder-20150202-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54cfd1d6/turbine/la-fi-lululemon-founder-20150202", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp11.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "lululemon, yoga, chip wilson", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82701419", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "lululemon, yoga, chip wilson", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Lululemon Athletica Inc. founder Chip Wilson, who helped make the yoga pant a wardrobe staple for many women, has resigned from the retailer's board.
