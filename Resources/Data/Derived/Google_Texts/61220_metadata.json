John Bowlen is a minority owner of the team.\n\nAlthough the NFL has not set a precise time limit, John Bowlen said it\u2019s unclear how much longer than two years the league might be willing to wait \u2014 if at all.\n\n\u201cMaybe two more, maybe five, maybe none,\u201d John Bowlen said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see.\u201d\n\nWhen Pat Bowlen, 70, stepped aside in July as the team\u2019s CEO to deal with the effects of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, team officials made clear his ongoing desire to keep the Broncos in his family.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he anticipated his demise would be as quick as this,\u201d John Bowlen said.\n\nIf none of the children can prove to the trustees they have the ability to run the team \u2014 and some have shown an interest in trying \u2014 then the family must sell, John Bowlen said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll know in two years who it will be,\u201d he said, \u201cbut whether they\u2019re ready to go is another matter.\u201d\n\nJohn Bowlen said he doubts the NFL would be so harsh as to force a sale if a successor isn\u2019t at least identified within two years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure (NFL commissioner) Roger (Goodell) would do that to Joe (Ellis) or Pat\u2019s family because they\u2019re that close,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NFL did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHistory of impatience\n\nBut the NFL has a history of impatience when it comes to ownership changes, typically giving no more than two years to hash things out.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills sold last week for a reported $1.4 billion, just six months after founder Ralph Wilson\u2019s death. Family members quickly took over teams when other owners died, including the Oakland Raiders, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tennessee Titans and Detroit Lions.\n\nAnd despite the tumultuous sale of some teams \u2014 such as the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Los Angeles Clippers \u2014 and worries that some new owners might move their franchises, the odds of the Broncos ever leaving Denver appear minuscule.\n\nWith its 13-year-old stadium and one of the league\u2019s best fan bases \u2014 Nielsen Scarborough recently ranked the Broncos as having the seventh-best market penetration in the NFL and Forbes put Denver with the second-best fan base \u2014 the team enjoys unparalleled support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there are a number of people who would say that if it\u2019s not Pat Bowlen owning the team, it would be better just selling it, but it would not leave Denver,\u201d John Bowlen said.\n\nFor now, Pat Bowlen has handed the reins to Ellis, his longtime friend and confidant. And with former quarterback John Elway as general manager and vice president of football operations, the team appears in capable hands.\n\nBut that\u2019s temporary.\n\nThe future of the Denver Broncos is still very much in flux.\n\nA family operation\n\nFrom the day the Bowlens purchased the team from Edgar Kaiser in 1984, it was a family operation.\n\nUnable to cover the $78 million purchase on his own, Pat Bowlen turned to his younger brother, John, who was heading the family oil and gas business in Calgary.\n\nThe generosity of their wildcat millionaire father, Paul, ensured the Broncos was a family-led legacy.\n\n\u201cPat wanted to do it on his own, but there was a need to lean into the company for credit, which we did,\u201d said John Bowlen, president and CEO of Regent Resources Ltd. \u201cDad, on his death bed, said, \u2018Don\u2019t feed him to the wolves. Help your brother,\u2019 and we did. It was a family company and so would be the Broncos.\u201d\n\nThe Bowlens pretty much shared in the team equally, with Pat having a mild edge in order to satisfy NFL rules that require a majority partner to hold 30 percent.\n\nBrother William Bowlen and sister Mary Elizabeth Jagger sold their interest back to the family in 1996 and 1997.\n\nAnd when their mother, Arvella Regis Bowlen, died in 2006 at age 90, her interests were divided between Pat and John, making them whole owners of the Broncos, although paperwork shows that the team is held in holding company names.\n\nLittle has changed, said John Bowlen, who controlled as much as 49 percent of the Broncos but has been selling interest back to his brother.\n\nAt his death, the 40 percent John Bowlen retains today, though inherited by his children, would be sold to Pat\u2019s side of the family, John Bowlen said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re obligated to take it out of my estate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, ultimately, yes, it all goes back to the family.\u201d\n\nEllis in the lead chair\n\nAlthough Ellis sits in the lead chair today, it\u2019s for the taking by one of Pat\u2019s children \u2014 who range in age from 16 to 45.\n\n\u201cThe desire is for one of Pat\u2019s children to show the ability to step into the role,\u201d John Bowlen said. \u201cThe wish is that one of those kids will demonstrate that ability.\u201d\n\nThe decision about which child takes over, John Bowlen said, rests with the three trustees: Ellis, 56; Broncos counsel Rich Slivka, 69; and Denver attorney Mary Kelly, 60.\n\nAlthough John Bowlen remains the Broncos coordinator of corporate sponsorships, he said his work at Regent Resources keeps him too busy to consider trying to take on the team.\n\n\u201cIt would take some pondering on my part,\u201d he said, noting the tax implications of such a choice. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I don\u2019t have a say in things now, maybe not day to day, but some.\u201d\n\nNone of John Bowlen\u2019s children \u2014 four daughters ranging in age from 16 to 41, and a 34-year-old son \u2014 are allowed to take on ownership under the trust.\n\nSome of Pat Bowlen\u2019s children already have a foot in the door.\n\nBetween Pat Bowlen\u2019s two daughters from his first marriage to Sally Parker, only the youngest, Jane Elizabeth \u201cBeth\u201d Bowlen Wallace, 44, is on board, working as the Broncos\u2019 director of special projects and events.\n\nHer older sister, Amie Bowlen Klemmer, 45, lives in Hawaii.\n\nThree of Pat Bowlen\u2019s children from his 34-year marriage to Annabel Bowlen also work in some capacity with the team or league.\n\nPatrick III, 30, lives in Denver and is the facilities coordinator of the team\u2019s stadium management company.\n\nTwenty-eight-year-old John Jr., named for his uncle, has a master\u2019s degree in business administration, with a concentration in sports and entertainment management, from the University of Colorado at Denver and has held a variety of jobs within the Broncos organization.\n\nBrittany, 24, is a recent graduate of the University of Notre Dame and is a part of the NFL\u2019s junior rotational internship program in New York, which trains participants in the business side of the league.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell whether Pat Bowlen\u2019s youngest daughters \u2014 Annabel, 21, who works in retail, and Christianna, 16, a high school sophomore \u2014 will become active with the team and league.\n\nShould the decision to sell be made \u2014 by the NFL or the trustees \u2014 any ownership change appears likely to include Elway.\n\n\u201cI would think, with all conjecture aside, that he would certainly have the inside track, if he wanted it,\u201d John Bowlen said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not difficult to see how or why.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly a business precedent for player-led investment groups such as Magic Johnson and Wayne Gretzky,\u201d said Kevin Adler, founder and president of Engage Marketing in Chicago, a sports marketing company. \u201cIf Elway were to put the word out to acquire an investment group to get an ownership interest in the Broncos, people would line up.\u201d\n\nThe Denver Broncos released a statement early on Sunday morning on behalf of Pat Bowlen and his immediate family:\n\n\u201cOwner Pat Bowlen has indicated a strong desire to keep specifics of his estate planning private, and the Denver Broncos intend to honor his wishes.\n\n\u201cWhile Mr. Bowlen\u2019s long-term hope is for one of his children to run the team, any speculation on the transition of his ownership to one of them is premature. No timetable has been set for that process by the organization or the National Football League.\n\n\u201cThere are no plans for the sale of the Denver Broncos, and the Pat Bowlen Trust will continue to implement the provisions set forth by Mr. Bowlen to keep the team in the Bowlen family.\u201d\n\nElway, who did not respond to a request for an interview, has privately said he is unwilling to make any speculations.\n\nBegin, end at Elway\n\nWhile offering the Broncos for sale is likely to draw a number of suitors, insiders say the list would probably begin and end at John Elway.\n\nAfter all, it almost did before.\n\nIn 1998, Elway\u2019s final season as a player, Pat Bowlen offered him a 10 percent stake in the team, according to copies of the agreement filed away in federal and state lawsuits over the deal.\n\nBowlen had offered Elway even more.\n\nThere was a second 10 percent piece of the team, according to the agreement, as well as a job as Bowlen\u2019s special assistant with an intent on eventually naming Elway, a Stanford University graduate, to the post of chief operating officer.\n\nElway\u2019s ownership deal extended to any NFL team Bowlen might own, according to the agreement. If Bowlen sold the Broncos, Elway would go with him.\n\nWith the team still in Denver, Elway would have gotten right of first refusal on any future sale, except for between Bowlen family members.\n\nAnd if the Hall of Fame quarterback wanted to go it alone, Bowlen agreed to \u201cuse his influence to assist Elway in obtaining an NFL franchise if Elway so wishes.\u201d\n\nAlthough Elway never signed the deal \u2014 Ellis was with the Broncos as its executive vice president for business operations and Elway didn\u2019t see much room for himself in the front office \u2014 the relationship he had with Bowlen remained sturdy.\n\nLike Bowlen, Elway is one of Denver\u2019s favorite adopted sons, having brought home a pair of Super Bowl victories. He\u2019s a successful businessman with eponymous car dealerships and restaurants.\n\nAnd Elway and Bowlen \u2014 with Stan Kroenke \u2014 co-owned the Colorado Crush Arena Football League team, until the league and team folded in 2008.\n\nElway came back to the Broncos in 2011 as executive vice president of football operations. He soon landed quarterback Peyton Manning and helped the team to its first Super Bowl appearance since 1999, when Elway was named the game\u2019s MVP and lifted the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nShould the Bowlen family have to find a buyer, several NFL watchers say, who better than John Elway.\n\n\u201cAnytime a team has an opportunity to include a well-regarded patriarch of the sport into their ownership \u2014 such as the Dodgers and Magic Johnson with the Guggenheim partnership \u2014 it\u2019s a desirable thing,\u201d said David Carter, executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business.\n\nFigurehead athlete-owners are no longer the norm, he said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work anymore to bring in an athlete and give him a percentage of the team just to hang in the window,\u201d Carter said. \u201cAnd at this point in his business career, if Elway pursued an ownership, he might not even need Bowlen, though it would be nice to have that wind in your sails.\u201d\n\nBut no matter his past value as a quarterback or current value as a manager and executive \u2014 any bid for ownership of the team today will come down to Elway\u2019s partners.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that it would be difficult not to approve of John,\u201d John Bowlen said, \u201cbut a mammoth part would be who my partners would approve.\n\n\u201cUltimately,\u201d he said, \u201cit is about who is with him.\u201d\n\nThe NFL today requires a single principal owner to have a 30 percent interest \u2014 $420 million if the Broncos\u2019 value is kept conservative, at about $1.45 billion, according to Forbes \u2014 and that is likely out of reach for Elway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about whether they are individuals the NFL wants to allow into their treehouse,\u201d Carter said. \u201cMoney is critical, but so is knowing the market and having a business plan the league will subscribe to.\u201d\n\nDavid Migoya: 303-954-1506, dmigoya@denverpost.com or twitter.com/davidmigoya\n\nThe Bowlen children\n\nPatrick Dennis Bowlen, right, has seven children, each of whom has the opportunity to become the new principal owner of the Denver Broncos.\n\nAmie Bowlen Klemmer, 45 Mother is Bowlen\u2019s first wife, Sally Parker.
