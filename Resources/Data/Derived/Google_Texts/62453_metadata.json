Volunteers in Medicine has undertaken a study to determine how many patients it will lose to Medicaid and insurance coverage, but Florence Jameson, the group\u2019s co-founder and president, said there\u2019s a deep pool of people who need the free care. The Medicaid eligibility went from 41 percent of poverty to 138 percent of poverty, she said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many (patients) we\u2019ll lose yet,\u201d Jameson said. \u201cBut the bottom line is we still have more patients than we will ever be able to see even if we lose patients.\u201d\n\nEven with the Affordable Care Act, Jameson said, there will still be nearly 300,000 uninsured Nevadans who will need free health services.\n\n\u201cThere will always be working poor and uninsured that fall between 138 percent and 200 percent of poverty that don\u2019t have immediate access to health care and need some temporary or long-term health care,\u201d she added. \u201cThere are a lot of people still struggling with access to health care.\u201d\n\nVolunteers in Medicine has a $1 million-a-year budget that it meets through donations, grants and an annual fundraiser. It has eight paid staff members and relies on about 450 volunteers including doctors, nurses and other workers. The group gets most of its supplies and medicine donated and rents its site, a former recreation center, from Clark County for $1 a year.\n\nDoctors including family practitioners, internal medicine specialists, podiatrists, dermatologists and psychiatrists serve Volunteers in Medicine patients. Patients can get blood tests and diagnostic tests that include X-rays, MRIs and biopsies. Patients can also receive insulin for diabetes and other medications they require, even if they\u2019ve had a heart attack or stroke. The clinic, however, doesn\u2019t offer surgery.\n\n\u201cWe provide a lifeline to people who find themselves without insurance,\u201d Jameson said. \u201cIf they are pending for Medicaid and need help urgently, we will reach out immediately as a life raft to keep them afloat until they\u2019re on Medicaid and a doctor comes through for them.\n\n\u201cEven if they apply for Medicaid and they did qualify, they have to wait 30 days to see the doctor and it may be 45 days or 90 days before they get an appointment,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re discharged home after you\u2019ve had a heart attack or stroke, you need somebody right away.\u201d\n\nJameson is excited when she talks about opening the new clinic on an acre of land the group owns at Martin Luther King Boulevard and Madison Avenue in downtown Las Vegas. The site was selected because the near-downtown area has some of the valley\u2019s highest poverty. Also, she said, the clinic will make medical care more accessible to that area\u2019s residents, especially if they\u2019re released from University Medical Center or Valley Hospital and need follow-up care.\n\nVolunteers in Medicine secured $400,000 for the land, $250,000 for permits, licenses and fees and has $1.2 million set aside for the $2 million structure. The group plans to start construction once it gets $800,000.\n\nThe downtown clinic will provide better access for patients, Jameson said, and will better attract doctors to volunteer because of its proximity blocks from UMC and Valley Hospital.\n\n\u201cThe doctors say if we can get the downtown clinic open, they can come more often and give follow-up care to the patients they discharge,\u201d Jameson said.\n\nJameson said everything is coming together for the clinic. When the new-clinic push started, there were three collaborating partners. Now there are more than 50 partners, including local diagnosticians, radiologists and hospitals.\n\n\u201cI am sure anyone came to this great city and walked down that Las Vegas Strip and saw the glitz and glamour that they could ever dream that they could be one of those people, either young or old, that fell in that area where there was no access to health care, (that) they would not be able to see a doctor or get their hypertension meds or heart meds and they could end up with a heart attack, stroke or diabetic coma.\u201d Jameson said. \u201cThese people go to the emergency rooms so many times and then they\u2019re just depressed. They give up and stay home and many of them just die. It is sad.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing and a shame in this country we live in that this ever would have to happen,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need that downtown clinic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Array Array", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "BUCK WARGO SPECIAL TO THE LAS VEGAS BUSINESS PRESS", "parsely-title": "Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion won\u2019t allay demand for free clinic", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/business-press/business-medicine/affordable-care-act-medicaid-expansion-won-t-allay-demand", "twitter": {"description": "Array Array", "title": "Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion won\u2019t allay demand for free clinic", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/business-press/business-medicine/affordable-care-act-medicaid-expansion-won-t-allay-demand", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_Volunteers-Medical_052114JA_04.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_Volunteers-Medical_052114JA_03.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_Volunteers-Medical_052114JA_02.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_Volunteers-Medical_052114JA_01.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_Volunteers-Medical_052114JA_05.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1888711"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1344781", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1344781", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Array Array", "title": "Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion won\u2019t allay demand for free clinic", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/business-press/business-medicine/affordable-care-act-medicaid-expansion-won-t-allay-demand", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_Volunteers-Medical_052114JA_04.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-author": "BUCK WARGO SPECIAL TO THE LAS VEGAS BUSINESS PRESS", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Business of Medicine,Life, Health, Business Press, Business,", "parsely-section": "Business of Medicine", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-23T03:00:07-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Business of Medicine,Life,Health,Business Press,Business", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_Volunteers-Medical_052114JA_04.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-06-23T10:00:07Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd148\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion in Nevada won\u2019t dent demand for a free clinic serving the region\u2019s poor, a nonprofit group\u2019s leader said.\nDoctors including family practitioners, internal medicine specialists, podiatrists, dermatologists and psychiatrists serve Volunteers in Medicine patients.\n\u201cThere will always be working poor and uninsured that fall between 138 percent and 200 percent of poverty that don\u2019t have immediate access to health care and need some temporary or long-term health care,\u201d she added.\nThe downtown clinic will provide better access for patients, Jameson said, and will better attract doctors to volunteer because of its proximity blocks from UMC and Valley Hospital.\nThe Medicaid eligibility went from 41 percent of poverty to 138 percent of poverty, she said."}
