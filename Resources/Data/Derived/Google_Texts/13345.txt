A seven-year-old Wichita boy went up to Wichita Police Officers with a note saying he wants to grow up to be a police officer.

Sir Harris is getting ready for the second grade, but says he already knows what he wants to do when he grows up.

"I want to be a police officer," he said.

On Monday, he went to some officers working a crime down the street from his house and gave them a note that read "I want to be a police".

The officers showed up at his house and gave him a chance to see what it is like to be an officer.

Harris got to pet a police dog and play with the lights and sirens. One of the officers gave the boy a hug before he left.

Harris's mother was very impressed by the officers.

"The fact that they cared enough to come out here and take time out of their day to meet him, it shows that police have heart too and that they care about the youth just as much as the rest of us," his mother, Priscilla Harris said.
