But that isn\u2019t the end of the GOP\u2019s long battle to replace Obamacare with a health care reform bill that won\u2019t drive up insurance premiums and bankrupt our country.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan promised to take the fight to the next step. While neither chamber had the votes to override Mr. Obama\u2019s veto, he said the House would hold a vote to override anyway, \u201ctaking this process all the way to the end under the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is one story that is being told here today,\u201d he said following the House passage of the repeal bill, \u201cit is this: The idea that Obamacare is the law of the land for a long time is a myth. We will see this law either collapse under its own weight, or we will see this law, in the next session of Congress be repealed and signed and replaced, by a Republican president.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Ryan and his new team of Republican leaders, this is the beginning of an election-year process to show that Republicans have put their divisions behind them and are making the legislative process work. They also intend to show that the only impediment to good government is a Democratic president who has vetoed the bill to complete construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and blocked pro-job tax cuts.\n\nAmong Republican bills waiting in the wings is a sweeping overhaul of the tax code to cleanse it of costly loopholes and corporate welfare, plowing the savings into cutting the tax rates for businesses and individuals to boost economic growth, job creation and business investment.\n\nOther areas awaiting legislative action include welfare and entitlement reforms, and an alternative to Obamacare.\n\nWhat Mr. Ryan wants to do this year is return to \u201cregular order,\u201d passing all 12 appropriations bill one by one, allowing floor votes on amendments sought by members of the House GOP conference.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole purpose of having a bottom-up organic process in Congress, not a top-down leadership,\u201d Mr. Ryan said at a news conference last week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m decentralizing power of this place. And when you decentralize power, you have a group decide these things,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ryan and the rest of the GOP leadership do not expect Mr. Obama and the Democrats to embrace their proposals to cut taxes to spur economic growth. They rarely focus on the economy or jobs \u2014 except in an occasional speech in which Mr. Obama cherry-picks good data but ignores other gloomy statistics, such as declining economic growth.\n\nBy and large, the White House and the Democrats are ignoring the economy, and with good reason. Much of it is bleak.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that payroll employment rose by 292,000 in December. But dig down into the fine print of its report and the employment figures aren\u2019t so good.\n\n\u201cThe number of unemployed persons, at 7.9 million, was essentially uncharged in December,\u201d the BLS said.\n\nBlack unemployment stood at 8.3 percent. For working-age teenagers, it was more than 16 percent. For Hispanics it was unchanged at 6.3 percent.\n\n\u201cThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially unchanged at 2.1 million,\u201d BLS said.\n\n\u201cAnd the number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed at 6.0 million.\u201d\n\nThese longtime victims of the Obama economy want full-time employment, but were working part-time \u201cbecause their hours had been cut back or they were unable to find a full-time job.\u201d the government said.\n\nThen there were another 2 million unfortunate people who were \u201cmarginally attached to the labor force\u201d but were not counted as unemployed, even though they had looked for a job in recent months. The reason: They hadn\u2019t searched for a job in the past several weeks.\n\nAmong them, there were 663,000 discouraged workers who have stopped looking for a job because they believed there were none available for them.\n\nThe real shocker in the Obama economy lately has been the decline in manufacturing activity and inventories as businesses push to reduce their stockpile of unsold goods.\n\nEconomists said this, among other weaknesses in the economy, signaled much weaker fourth-quarter growth.\n\nThe economy\u2019s gross domestic product grew at an anemic 2 percent in the third quarter. And it\u2019s getting weaker.\n\nThe Commerce Department said Friday that wholesale inventories, in both durable and nondurable goods, fell to 0.3 percent.\n\nIts report \u201cadded to weak data on construction spending, export growth and manufacturing that have suggested GDP growth braked sharply in the final three months of 2015,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nEstimates of fourth-quarter GDP growth have ranged from 1.1 percent to as low as 0.4 percent.\n\nThe Atlanta Federal Reserve\u2019s GDP Now model is projecting GDP grew by an anemic 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter. In other words, the economy is barely breathing.\n\nEconomists at Barclays last week were also projecting GDP will come in at 0.7 percent, dealing a devastating blow to the administration\u2019s rosier outlook.\n\nOther forecasters are saying the economy isn\u2019t going to improve anytime soon, is facing an even rockier year ahead, and is giving the GOP another opportunity to strengthen their control of Congress and win back the White House.\n\nStay tuned.\n\n\u2022 Donald Lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans kept their 2014 promise to the voters who put them in control of Congress, passing legislation to repeal Obamacare.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Republicans kept their 2014 promise to the voters who put them in control of Congress, passing legislation to repeal Obamacare.", "title": "DONALD LAMBRO: Poor economy improves odds for Republicans", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/12/donald-lambro-poor-economy-improves-odds-for-repub/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/12/Republicans_Obama.JPEG-01fc5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/12/Republicans_Obama.JPEG-01fc5.jpg", "description": "Republicans kept their 2014 promise to the voters who put them in control of Congress, passing legislation to repeal Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "title": "DONALD LAMBRO: Poor economy improves odds for Republicans"}, "Author": "Donald Lambro and Donald Lambro", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Labor, Politics, Congress, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "The real shocker in the Obama economy lately has been the decline in manufacturing activity and inventories as businesses push to reduce their stockpile of unsold goods.\nEstimates of fourth-quarter GDP growth have ranged from 1.1 percent to as low as 0.4 percent.\nIts report \u201cadded to weak data on construction spending, export growth and manufacturing that have suggested GDP growth braked sharply in the final three months of 2015,\u201d Reuters reported.\nMr. Ryan and the rest of the GOP leadership do not expect Mr. Obama and the Democrats to embrace their proposals to cut taxes to spur economic growth.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole purpose of having a bottom-up organic process in Congress, not a top-down leadership,\u201d Mr. Ryan said at a news conference last week."}
