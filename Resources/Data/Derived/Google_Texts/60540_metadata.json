And they were turbulent.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, he was on the outside of a rotation.\n\nThe young Nuggets shooting guard\u2019s confidence took a hit, but he did not fold. He did not complain outwardly. He did get a boost from then-teammate Randy Foye, who took the former Michigan State star under his wing, glued him even tighter to the gym and the work it took to persevere, and did not let go. Harris, meanwhile, didn\u2019t do anything but what he\u2019s seemingly always done: put his head down and do what is asked of him.\n\nThis season, first-year Nuggets coach Michael Malone asked more of Harris.\n\nIt was music to Harris\u2019 ears.\n\nBut his path was laced with thorns. It\u2019s not an unprecedented circumstance, but this has been a pressure-packed season for a 21-year-old, second-year pro. Because while the Nuggets\u2019 expectations were tabled, the scrutiny on Harris wasn\u2019t.\n\nThis, simply, was a make-or-break season for Harris. Yes, this early in his NBA career.\n\nFalter, and any desire he had to become a starting shooting guard in the NBA would take a hit pretty closely akin to a death blow. And shooting guard would have been added to the list of areas to improve for Nuggets executives.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t worked out that way.\n\nHarris has removed the worry.\n\nAnd he has done it just how he always has \u2014 by putting his head down and doing what he\u2019s been asked to do.\n\nLately, that\u2019s been so much more.\n\nLike scoring.\n\nHe used to do that. A lot. Harris was a 25-points-per-game scorer his senior season in high school, just four years ago, before being asked to fit in and play a mostly \u201c3-and-D\u201d role with the Spartans, a Big Ten Conference power.\n\nHarris is now getting back in touch with the player who lit up the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cFor sure,\u201d he said. \u201cJust being more aggressive on the offensive and defensive end. Just getting back into it. Instead of just being labeled as a defender, being an all-around player.\u201d\n\nThe NBA is a funny place. It has a way of quickly putting players into a box and then sealing it shut. Harris was headed right to that place, typecast as a defense-first two guard who could hit an occasional 3-pointer. Hey, it\u2019s work, and any work in the NBA is good if a player can get it. But so many dynamic players trudge through NBA careers as a shell of their former selves.\n\nHarris got a reprieve.\n\nHe earned it, really.\n\nIt started with movement on offense. The Nuggets were not running plays for him, so he manufactured looks on his own with hard cuts to the basket. Teammates found him for layups and dunks. He ran the court for fast-break baskets. And, of course, he hit from 3-point range.\n\nOn a team that struggled to shoot a high percentage, Harris stood out. His shooting percentages were solid. It reached a point where Malone couldn\u2019t ignore the numbers. He had to find out if what was happening organically could be mass produced.\n\nSo he started drawing up plays targeting Harris as the shooter. Harris, in turn, also started seeking out additional shooting opportunities.\n\n\u201cJust figuring out times when I need to be aggressive, and times when I can hunt for my shot.\u201d Harris said. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a good job of just looking for teammates to get me in spots where I can score.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worked.\n\nIn the 15 games before the Nuggets beat the Lakers 116-105 in Los Angeles on Friday night, Harris averaged 16 points per game on 50 percent shooting. Among the NBA\u2019s shooting guards, that would put Harris behind only Miami\u2019s Dwyane Wade and Detroit\u2019s Kentavious Caldwell-Pope in scoring. As it is, Harris entered the weekend ranked fifth in the NBA in scoring among qualified shooting guards.\n\nAnd he\u2019s only 21.\n\nThe Nuggets no longer feel an urgency to address their shooting guard position. Harris is doing his best to show they already have their man.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@ denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota\n\nWhen: This week\u2019s Post player of the week takes us to uncharted waters \u2014 to a rookie. Minnesota\u2019s Karl-Anthony Towns rose to the top and takes home the award for the evaluation period of March 19-25.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In three games, Towns averaged 25.7 points, 10.7 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.7 blocks per game. He shot 59.6 percent from the field and was dominant all week, leading the Timberwolves to wins in two of the three games.\n\nBackground: The only thing more impressive than the numbers themselves was the consistency at which he arrived at them. Towns scored 24, 26 and 27 points in the three games. He grabbed 11, 11 and 10 rebounds in the three contests. He shot 57 percent from the field twice and 64.7 percent in the other contest. There haven\u2019t been wild swings in his play all season long as he has done nothing but validate over and over again why he was the No. 1 overall pick in last year\u2019s NBA draft.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: With all due respect to those sifting through numbers to make the rookie of the year race somewhat close, it isn\u2019t. Towns is the runaway leader and essentially has been from Day One. We just all needed to see him blossom to etch it in stone. Towns has dazzled this season, and there\u2019s no reason to think that he won\u2019t follow up this season\u2019s rookie of the year award with All-NBA teams and maybe even a league MVP in future seasons. He\u2019s that good. And he\u2019s only getting better.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: Nuggets\u2019 Gary Harris blossoming as NBA sophomore", "title": "Dempsey: Nuggets\u2019 Gary Harris blossoming as NBA sophomore", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/26/dempsey-nuggets-gary-harris-blossoming-as-nba-sophomore/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-26T16:28:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:37:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christopher Dempsey"}, "article_summary": "And shooting guard would have been added to the list of areas to improve for Nuggets executives.\nThe young Nuggets shooting guard\u2019s confidence took a hit, but he did not fold.\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The first sign that Gary Harris had the temperament it took to pull himself through rough NBA waters came last season.\nThe Nuggets no longer feel an urgency to address their shooting guard position.\nFalter, and any desire he had to become a starting shooting guard in the NBA would take a hit pretty closely akin to a death blow."}
