Wellness visits \u2013 otherwise known as \u201cphysical exams\u201d \u2013 are a crucial component of whole-person care. To help with this initiative, Health Net offers CareAlerts, customized messages that notify members when it\u2019s time to visit their doctor.\n\n\u201cHaving an annual wellness visit with your doctor is an important part of maintaining good health,\u201d said Patricia Buss, M.D., medical and health care services operations officer for Health Net, Inc. \u201cWellness visits are particularly important for those with chronic diseases, such as diabetes or heart disease, and those with a family history of chronic illness or cancer.\u201d\n\nHealth Net\u2019s CareAlert Program\n\nAnnual wellness visits are just one way to help maximize good health. Screenings, immunizations and other preventive health measures also are important. This is why Health Net created CareAlert, a member and provider alert program that notifies both the doctor and the patient when it\u2019s time for things like medical screenings, medication renewals, provider follow-up visits and immunizations.\n\nThese reminders increase the opportunity to influence healthier behaviors and may help to reduce medical risks, such as drug interactions and duplicate therapies. Enrollment in Health Net HMO plans is automatic, and patients may receive CareAlerts related to chronic condition tests, preventive care and medications, among others.\n\nWhat to Expect at a Wellness Visit\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), annual exams are designed to check for diseases, identify future medical concerns, update immunizations and strengthen the patient-doctor relationship. This is a good time to bring up any medical concerns, talk about weight issues and exercise, and ask questions about current medications. An open discussion about general lifestyle habits goes far in getting patients the right kind of care.\n\nThe doctor also may check blood pressure and vital signs, and possibly conduct a gender-specific exam. In addition, he or she may review lab tests taken prior to the appointment, and may order additional studies, like a mammogram or a colonoscopy screening.\n\nCovered by Affordable Care Act\n\nDepending on an individual\u2019s coverage, many preventive services, some of which may be part of a standard annual wellness visit, are now provided free of charge as a result of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cConsequently,\u201d said Buss, \u201ccost to the patient may no longer be an obstacle in relation to these yearly exams that can \u2013 in some instances \u2013 truly be lifesaving.\u201d\n\nHow to Prepare\n\nHealth Net recommends visiting the doctor with a list of questions about your health. The answers can help patients set health goals and plan ahead. The NIH recommends dressing in easily removable clothing and refraining from wearing excessive jewelry. It\u2019s also important to:\n\nBring a list of all current medications including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and herbal supplements\n\ncurrent medications including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and herbal supplements Explain in detail any pain you\u2019re experiencing\n\nHave results in hand from any recent tests or lab work\n\nChronical hospitalizations, surgeries and serious medical issues\n\nSupply contact information for additional physicians\n\nMedical Advice Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided is not intended as medical advice or as a substitute for professional medical care. Always seek the advice of your physician or other health provider for any questions you may have regarding your medical condition and follow your health care provider\u2019s instructions.\n\nAbout Health Net\n\nHealth Net, Inc.
