The public can submit an idea to the staff or choose from one of hundreds of pre-designed options. The only cost is the price of the materials used in printing. Stavick showed KETV NewsWatch 7 varying levels of 3D printers, from retail models to much more advanced machines.\n\nAfter the printing process, the final step is soaking to remove support materials around the design. The staff will wear 3D printed jewelry at the DO Space opening in November.\n\nOutside the 3D lab, the DO Space is filled with computers, tablets, e-readers and a wide range of computer programming and design tools. The space will also feature educational opportunities for a wide range of ages and needs.\n\nThe DO Space is funded all from private donations. Susan Morris with Heritage Services, which helped make the project possible, said the cost of remodeling the building alone was more than $5 million.\n\nThe project is funded for the next four years.\n\n\u201cA flexible four year operational plan is being designed, allowing time to explore community interests, adapt resources and services to new trends, and evolve based on ongoing evaluation,\u201d Morris said.\n\nAnother focus of the project -- providing access to technology to everyone in the city.\n\n\"While its emphasis will be on the new and emerging digital world, this community offering will promote learning, reading and creativity to its large and diverse audience.\"\n\nAs for Stavick, the space is all about giving people a chance to \u2018do\u2019 something great.\n\n\"The question was how do we get more access to technology and tech education into the community?\" Stavick asked. \"Something like this really helps boost economic development \u2026 Do Space is about opportunity, and I just can't wait to see what Omaha's going to do with this space.\"\n\nThe grand opening will take place November 7th, with a ribbon cutting at 9 a.m., and activities for the families throughout the day.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 05 Oct 2015 22:27:59 CDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Alexandra Stone", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "Omaha's busiest intersection is buzzing as the city\u2019s first digital library is about to open its doors at 72nd and Dodge.", "title": "Do Space to be open to the public soon", "url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/do-space-to-be-open-to-the-public-soon/35666630", "image": "http://www.ketv.com/image/view/-/35674812/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/92ncnw/-/img-Do-Space-to-be-open-to-the-public-soon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/do-space-to-be-open-to-the-public-soon/35666630", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "ketv://content/article/35666630", "iphone": "ketv://content/article/35666630", "googleplay": "ketv://content/article/35666630"}, "name": {"ipad": "ketv", "iphone": "ketv", "googleplay": "ketv"}, "id": {"ipad": 505254249, "iphone": 505254249, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}}, "site": "@ketv", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "ketv://content/article/35666630", "app_name": "ketv", "package": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}, "ios": {"url": "ketv://content/article/35666630", "app_store_id": 505254249, "app_name": "ketv"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130967633662636}, "google-site-verification": "a0PMTzs25l6fcC16_88mc37ga4Phf53uYiDWwMp4Ois", "keywords": "3D Printing", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/AlexandraStoneReports"}, "news_keywords": "3D Printing", "description": "Omaha's busiest intersection is buzzing as the city\u2019s first digital library is about to open its doors at 72nd and Dodge."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc420\"", "article_summary": "[Video: Do Space to be open to the public soon]The DO Space will open to the public in November.\nThere's one piece of the digital library Stavick said is unlike anything offered in the metro.\n\"Our goal is really to serve everyone in the community, whether they're beginners or advanced,\" Rebecca Stavick, DO Space Executive Director said.\nThe 3D printing lab is set up to be easy to use.\nOmaha's busiest intersection is buzzing as the city\u2019s first digital library is about to open its doors at 72nd and Dodge."}
