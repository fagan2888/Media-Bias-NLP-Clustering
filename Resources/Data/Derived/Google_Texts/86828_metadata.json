But I\u2019ve been deeply troubled by her equation of \u201chaving it all\u201d and having children. Women have multifaceted interests, priorities and pursuits \u2014 one of which may or may not be motherhood. More important, I\u2019m troubled by blaming women\u2019s paucity in the senior ranks on a competitive environment marked by long hours, which (naturally) privileges those without children.\n\nAs a 27-year veteran of the diversity and inclusion field, I have done research showing that the barriers women face as they work their way up the corporate ladder are far more pervasive and insidious than a culture of long hours. Stereotypes about what women can and want to do continue to abound \u2014 and work to surreptitiously hold women back. Disparate access to the informal networks that are so critical to moving up the ladder are another enormous barrier. Mentoring and sponsorship of women also play a critical role; there is still a gender imbalance here.\n\nWhile I applaud Ms. Slaughter for her focus on the systemic roots of women\u2019s workplace inequality, she\u2019s doing a disservice by not taking up the case in its entirety. Without rigorous attention to the many and varied mechanisms, systems and cultural mores that combine to affect women\u2019s careers, we can expect to see little progress in this area.\n\nPAULETTE R. GERKOVICH\n\nBrooklyn\n\nTo the Editor: I did a double take of recognition at these sentences: \u201cBut many women who started out with all the ambition in the world find themselves in a place they never expected to be. They do not choose to leave their jobs; they are shut out by the refusal of their bosses to make it possible for them to fit their family life and their work life together.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile struggling to balance working full time as a physician with caring for my dying father, my special-needs daughter and my 90-year-old aunt who had fallen and broken her hip, I requested that my boss allow me to go part time or telework. He denied these requests and explained to me how many other physicians were successfully making it all work. (Really?) I loved my work passionately, but I took an unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. In his world, where his wife was primarily caring for his children, my boss (a caring and thoughtful person) could not understand my struggle.\n\nThere remains a profound misunderstanding in the workplace of the toxic level of expectations and stress under which women are working. Does anyone really wonder why there are so few women \u201cat the top\u201d?", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150926143104, "twitter": {"description": "Readers respond to an essay by Anne-Marie Slaughter about a work culture that remains stacked against working mothers.", "title": "Barriers for Women in the Workplace", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/barriers-for-women-in-the-workplace.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003927085"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/27/opinion/27LworkWeb/27LworkWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/barriers-for-women-in-the-workplace.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003927085", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/barriers-for-women-in-the-workplace.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "hdl_p": "Barriers for Women", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 26, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Work-Life Balance,Women and Girls,Workplace Environment,Slaughter  Anne-Marie", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "SCG": "sunday", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Slaughter, Anne-Marie", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Readers respond to an essay by Anne-Marie Slaughter about a work culture that remains stacked against working mothers.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/27/opinion/27LworkWeb/27LworkWeb-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/27/opinion/27LworkWeb/27LworkWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "Readers respond to an essay by Anne-Marie Slaughter about a work culture that remains stacked against working mothers.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 26, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-09-26", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Slaughter, Anne-Marie", "published": "2015-09-26", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "27Lwork", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150926230705, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/barriers-for-women-in-the-workplace.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/27/opinion/27LworkWeb/27LworkWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Readers respond to an essay by Anne-Marie Slaughter about a work culture that remains stacked against working mothers.", "title": "Barriers for Women in the Workplace"}, "pdate": 20150926, "des": "Workplace Environment", "articleid": 100000003927085, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Barriers for Women in the Workplace", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "Stereotypes about what women can and want to do continue to abound \u2014 and work to surreptitiously hold women back.\nThere remains a profound misunderstanding in the workplace of the toxic level of expectations and stress under which women are working.\nMentoring and sponsorship of women also play a critical role; there is still a gender imbalance here.\nWomen have multifaceted interests, priorities and pursuits \u2014 one of which may or may not be motherhood.\nPhotoReaders discuss work-family balance for women in today\u2019s corporate culture."}
