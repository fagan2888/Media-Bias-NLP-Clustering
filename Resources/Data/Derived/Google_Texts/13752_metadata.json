The BDN also supported Obamacare, which just caused another 3,300 Maine families to lose their health care plans.\n\nThe BDN cited Cain\u2019s political preference to \u201cengage \u2014 rather than attack \u2014 the opposing side.\u201d The facts tell a different story.\n\nDuring this congressional campaign, Cain and her agents have spent nearly $2 million on nasty TV ads and mailers personally attacking me. For weeks, they have attacked my successful professional career, which was earned with extremely hard work. They have even attacked my record of paying all property taxes in full (thousands of dollars), always.\n\nCain has also been untruthful about my unwavering support for our senior citizens.\n\nI ask you, the voters, to consider my 35 years of job creation and, as state treasurer, my record of eliminating wasteful government spending and reducing debt that led to lower taxes and more jobs. Then, compare those achievements to Cain\u2019s extreme big government liberal voting record that mirrors the job-killing policies of Obama and Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe BDN editorial board said that Cain \u201cfeels no need to run away from or recast her decade-long record.\u201d But, that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s doing.\n\nCain says that she has worked to cut taxes. That\u2019s simply not true. As the chief spokesperson and lead partisan for the liberal Democrats in the Maine House, Cain supported an extremely partisan agenda. She helped push through 102 new sales taxes. With little Republican support, she ushered through new taxes on car repairs, haircuts, movie tickets, and other goods and services. The next year, an outpouring of angry Mainers repealed Emily Cain\u2019s 102 new taxes in a people\u2019s referendum at the ballot box by the wide margin of 61 percent vs. 39 percent.\n\nDuring the 2011 debate over Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s first budget, Cain told the Portland Press Herald\u2019s editorial board about her ability to water down the income tax cuts included in the budget. After the tax cuts passed, she told the editorial board how much she and her liberal allies \u201c[hate] these tax cuts.\u201d Now, running for Congress, Cain is trying to take credit for the tax cuts she \u201chated.\u201d Voters are tired of this kind of political spin.\n\nLast year, Cain helped ram through another sales tax increase on Maine\u2019s working poor. Because of her misguided efforts, today, our families pay a 10 percent higher sales tax when buying a new winter coat for their kids. Moms and dads pay a 14 percent higher meals tax increase when they celebrate their son\u2019s or daughter\u2019s birthday with a restaurant pizza dinner. That\u2019s just not fair.\n\nThe Bangor Daily News praised Cain for her \u201cprudent use of state resources to promote economic growth.\u201d The facts don\u2019t bear that out.\n\nDuring her ten years in the state Legislature, Cain voted repeatedly to expand welfare to able-bodied childless adults while thousands of disabled and elderly sick fellow Mainers were stuck on waiting lists to receive help. That misuse of limited resources resulted in nearly $500 million owed to our hospitals when Augusta simply decided not to pay them for the services provided to the expanded number of welfare beneficiaries.\n\nContrary to the BDN\u2019s views, these imprudent fiscal votes by Cain have helped to kill Maine jobs and drive away our young families. Similar irresponsible behavior in Washington has resulted in our $17 trillion national debt. Maine can\u2019t afford Cain\u2019s voting record of reckless overspending in Congress.\n\nThe person who represents our 2nd District families in Congress should share their values. I was born and raised in a working class Franco-American family right here in central Maine, and so were my parents and grandparents. I scrubbed toilets to work my way through college. For 35 years, I helped grow the economy and create jobs.\n\nI\u2019ve been endorsed by LePage and Sen. Susan Collins. I\u2019ve also been endorsed by the NRA.\n\nCain is from New Jersey. She has no experience creating jobs and has voted against Maine small businesses nearly 70 percent of the time. She would be a rubber stamp to continue Obama\u2019s extreme liberal policies that don\u2019t work.\n\nAnd, Cain has a D+ rating from the NRA.\n\nI ask for your vote on Nov. 4. I\u2019ll work hard and do what\u2019s right in Congress. I\u2019ll fight for Maine\u2019s families and small businesses. I won\u2019t let you down.\n\nBruce Poliquin is the Republican candidate for the U.S. House from Maine\u2019s 2nd District.
