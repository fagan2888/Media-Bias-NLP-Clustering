It said it was facing losses of more than $1 billion in 2015 and 2016.\n\nIn Louisiana, that decision will force about 29,000 people to find a new insurance provider under the federal health care law. Those customers will have to sign up with a new insurer during the 2017 open enrollment period, which runs from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31.\n\nIn a letter to its local customers last month, UnitedHealthcare said members of its so-called \u201cCompass\u201d program would have in-network care available elsewhere in the state. However, the six alternative facilities it listed were all at least an hour\u2019s drive from New Orleans.\n\nAt the time, Ochsner said it was \u201cunable to reach mutually agreeable terms\u201d to remain with UnitedHealthcare\u2019s public health insurance program, although it didn\u2019t rule out reconciliation, saying it was \u201copen to discussions with UnitedHealthcare should anything change.\u201d\n\nEven then, some industry observers expected the two sides to return to the bargaining table to hash out a short-term arrangement.\n\nState-based health insurance exchanges were established as a result of the Affordable Care Act, as was a federal health insurance marketplace for states such as Louisiana that didn\u2019t start exchanges on their own. Coverage was targeted at the uninsured and often offered sizable subsidies to make the insurance affordable for lower-income people.\n\nUnitedHealthcare insures about 13 percent of the more than 214,000 Louisiana residents enrolled in the health insurance exchange. Nationwide, it covers 795,000 people under the exchanges.\n\nFollow Richard Thompson on Twitter, @rthompsonMSY.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Orleans, LA /News/: After weeks in limbo, UnitedHealthcare has reached a deal for Ochsner Health System to continue treating patients enrolled in the insurance company\u2019s \u201cObamacare\u201d health coverage through the end of 2016.
