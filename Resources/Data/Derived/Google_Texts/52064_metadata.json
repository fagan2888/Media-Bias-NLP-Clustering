Indeed, Tennessee has emerged from the recession years better than most. However, state legislators are now considering an expansion of the federal Medicaid program under Obamacare. If approved, Tennessee will fall behind its neighboring states and erase years of smart growth policies.\n\nThis week, Federalism in Acton (FIA), a project of State Budget Solutions, released a new report that irrefutably shows how Medicaid expansion will reverse the recent gains in Tennessee\u2019s private sector. As a result, Tennessee families will bring home less income and will lose jobs.\n\nMedicaid expansion proponents tout the program as a \u201cfree\u201d revenue source that would funnel more money into state coffers. However, as the State Budget Solutions\u2019 FIA report explains, these \u201cfree\u201d dollars come from you, the taxpayer. Simply put, Medicaid expansion funds are not generated from new economic activity. Rather, Medicaid spending is a mere redistribution of taxpayer dollars, while private sector growth remains the only avenue of generating new growth.\n\nGovernor Bill Haslam estimates that expansion of the state\u2019s Medicaid program will cost $1.4 billion, with initial funding coming from redistributed taxpayer dollars from the federal government. Based on FIA\u2019s calculation, the expected downshift to Tennessean\u2019s personal income growth would amount to a whopping $3.6 billion over that time period.\n\nThis loss of annual income to Tennessee families will manifest itself in two very problematic ways \u2014 lower household income and fewer jobs. If these problems were mutually exclusive, it would mean Tennessee residents should expect to see $1,148 less in annual income per household or the loss of 67,433 private sector jobs. Collectively, the impact will fall somewhere in between, resulting in both job and income reductions that will hurt all Tennesseans.\n\nGovernor Haslam\u2019s \u201cstate-based\u201d expansion plan submitted earlier this fall to the Department of Health and Human Services is simply Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion by another name. If accepted, the proposal will have vast financial consequences and unsustainable costs. Taxpayers and their representatives in the legislature should ignore the significant unforeseenfinancial costs that far outweigh any misleading claims of added benefits to Tennessee\u2019s most vulnerable families.\n\nJ.
