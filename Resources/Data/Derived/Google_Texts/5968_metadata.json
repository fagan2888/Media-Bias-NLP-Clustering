A majority, 54 percent, opposes Obamacare, a scant 3 points shy of the high in late 2013 after the botched rollout of healthcare.gov.\n\nIn spite of majority opposition overall, however, 55 percent think the Supreme Court should not block federal subsidies that help some low and moderate income Americans pay for their health insurance. Many fewer, 38 percent, would like to see the Court strike down those subsidies.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of the ACA\u2019s supporters want the Court to rule in favor of keeping the subsidies. But even among opponents of the law overall, this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, finds that four in 10 favor keeping the subsidy system as it stands.\n\nWhile that may sound contradictory, it\u2019s in fact consistent with longstanding research about views of the ACA. Ask about it overall, and people respond chiefly on the basis of the individual mandate, which is broadly unpopular. Ask about individual elements \u2013 such as extending coverage to low-income Americans who\u2019d otherwise lack it \u2013 and support is much higher. The challenge is that one relies on the other.\n\nGroups\n\nViews of the law remain closely tied to partisanship and ideology. Democrats and liberals support it by about 2-1 each. Opposition advances to 51 percent of moderates and 56 percent of political independents, and climbs to 78 percent of Republicans, 67 percent of those who say they\u2019re \u201csomewhat\u201d conservative and 82 percent of strong conservatives.\n\nThe 10-point drop in support in the past year spans most demographic groups. Support is greater among those with more education, and, despite the law\u2019s aim of helping lower-income adults, among those who are financially better off. The law also wins far more support in urban than in suburban or, especially, rural areas, and much more support among nonwhites (54 percent, including 64 percent of blacks) than whites (32 percent).\n\nMethodology\n\nThis ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone May 28-31, 2015, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,001 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points for the full sample, including design effect. Partisan divisions are 30-22-36 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents.\n\nThe survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York, N.Y.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "The Love/Hate View of the Affordable Care Act", "description": "The Love/Hate View of the Affordable Care Act", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/poll-marks-lovehate-view-affordable-care-act/story?id=31566116", "site_name": "ABC News", "type": "article", "description": "Public support for Obamacare tied its all-time low in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll \u2013 even as most Americans say the Supreme Court should not block federal subsidies at the heart of the health care law.\nWith the high court set to rule on the latest challenge to the ACA, the poll reflects...", "title": "The Love/Hate View of the Affordable Care Act"}, "twitter": {"description": "Public support for Obamacare tied its all-time low in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll \u2013 even as most Americans say the Supreme Court should not block federal subsidies at the heart of the health care law.\nWith the high court set to rule on the latest challenge to the ACA, the poll reflects...", "title": "The Love/Hate View of the Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/poll-marks-lovehate-view-affordable-care-act/story?id=31566116", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,31566116", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,31566116", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/poll-marks-lovehate-view-affordable-care-act/story?id=31566116"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "site": "@ABC", "image": {"width": 150, "height": 116}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-08", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,31566116", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/poll-marks-lovehate-view-affordable-care-act/story?id=31566116"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/poll-marks-lovehate-view-affordable-care-act/story?id=31566116", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,31566116", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2015-06-08 07:00:00", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "ACA, health care, Obama, Obamacare, Supreme Court, Affordable Care Act, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "Date": "2015-06-08", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "ACA, health care, Obama, Obamacare, Supreme Court, Affordable Care Act"}, "article_summary": "But even among opponents of the law overall, this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, finds that four in 10 favor keeping the subsidy system as it stands.\nPublic support for Obamacare tied its all-time low in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll \u2013 even as most Americans say the Supreme Court should not block federal subsidies at the heart of the health care law.\nAsk about individual elements \u2013 such as extending coverage to low-income Americans who\u2019d otherwise lack it \u2013 and support is much higher.\nIn spite of majority opposition overall, however, 55 percent think the Supreme Court should not block federal subsidies that help some low and moderate income Americans pay for their health insurance.\nMethodologyThis ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone May 28-31, 2015, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,001 adults."}
