Former UFC heavyweight champion Bas Rutten will be inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in July, the company announced Friday.

Rutten will be inducted into the hall’s Pioneer Era category, which honors fighters who turned pro before the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were adopted on Nov. 17, 2000. He will join Royce Gracie, Dan Severn and Chuck Liddell in the wing.
