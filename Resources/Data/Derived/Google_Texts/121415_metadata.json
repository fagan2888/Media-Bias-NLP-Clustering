The so-called Congressional exemption in the Affordable Act is one of those talking points. It vilifies access to healthcare and government employees at the same time. The Republican \u201csolution\u201d to the non-existent government exemption from the ACA actually creates a government exemption from the ACA.\n\nThe Vitter Amendment is the latest optical illusion brought to you by the Tea Party.\n\nSuperficially, Vitter and the Cruz crowd are right. Employees of Congress are treated differently than people who work for large employers in the private sector. That\u2019s where the truth ends and the lies begin. Congress is not exempt from the Affordable Care Act as Vitter and the Tea Party claim. Unlike other employees, Congressman and their staff have to buy their health insurance through the exchanges. In all other respects, the government as a large employer is treated exactly as any other large employer in the United States.\n\nLike other workers, people who work for congress have employer based health insurance plans. Like other employees, government workers including those who work for congress pay a part of their insurance premiums and their employer (the government) pays the rest.\n\nJohn Hudak of the Brookings Institute explains the intricacies between provisions in the Affordable Care Act and a regulation by the Office of Personnel Management in detail. The bottom line is the ACA and the OPM regulation require Congressman and their staff to buy health insurance on the Exchanges and the government has to pay a share of its employees\u2019 premiums.\n\nThere are two key provisions in the Vitter Amendment. The first extends the ACA requirement that Congress and its staff must buy insurance on the exchange to include the President, the Vice President and political appointees.\n\nThe other component removes the employer contribution that the OPM maintains, meaning Vitter\u2019s Amendent does the complete opposite of it\u2019s claimed objective.\n\nBy removing the employer contribution, the Vitter Amendment sticks it to congressional staff because this amounts to a huge pay cut. One Congressional staffer whose after tax income is $22,800 a year, estimates that the Vitter amendment would cost her $600 a month, or roughly a third of her income.\n\nAs Hudak explains this affects senior staff however, it kicks people with lower incomes and fewer options the hardest.\n\nJunior staffers\u2014staff assistants, legislative coordinators, etc.\u2014are paid the least and have fewer alternative employment options, when compared to their senior colleagues. They are hardworking individuals who often spend their days dealing with angry constituents.The Vitter Amendment targets this group the most. Unlike others who work for large employers they will receive no employer contribution for health care.\n\nThe Vitter Amendment also demoralizes staff and establishes a disincentive for people to enter public service. Several congressional staffers from both parties told the New Yorker in emails, they\u2019ll be looking for a different job if the Vitter Amendment becomes law.\n\nThe bottom line is the Vitter Amendment is a lie, just like everything else the Tea Party Republicans do.\n\nImage: end of the net ..org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican \"solution\" to the non-existent government exemption from the ACA actually creates a government exemption from the ACA.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Adalia Woodbury", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The Republican \"solution\" to the non-existent government exemption from the ACA actually creates a government exemption from the ACA.", "title": "Vitter Amendment - A Pill Too Vitter To Swallow", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/10/18/vitter-amendment-bitter-pill-steals-congressional-staff.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kool-aid-TJ.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-18T10:37:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,affordable care act,david vitter,Obamacare,vitter amendment,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-10-18T10:37:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-18T10:37:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, david vitter, Obamacare, vitter amendment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0636\"", "article_summary": "In all other respects, the government as a large employer is treated exactly as any other large employer in the United States.\nThe bottom line is the Vitter Amendment is a lie, just like everything else the Tea Party Republicans do.\nThey are hardworking individuals who often spend their days dealing with angry constituents.The Vitter Amendment targets this group the most.\nThe Vitter Amendment is the latest optical illusion brought to you by the Tea Party.\nSeveral congressional staffers from both parties told the New Yorker in emails, they\u2019ll be looking for a different job if the Vitter Amendment becomes law."}
