To some degree this makes sense; Hendrix is an incredibly talented and important songwriter, and certainly one of the all-time rock greats. But regarding Hendrix as the beginning and end of a genre can be deceptive.\n\nThe list below proves that rock has been black music from the beginning, long before Hendrix, and has remained black music up to the present day. (Hat tip to Dee at http://blackrockandrollmusic. tumblr.com for the idea for this post.) Basically, black rock music is central to the most critically acclaimed pop of the last 60 years.\n\nRoy Brown, \u201cButcher Pete\u201d 1950\n\n\n\nRoy Brown was one of the great jump blues vocalists, foreshadowing Little Richard in his explosive vocal style, and any number of raunchy rockers in his single-entendre penis jokes (\u201cOh, Pete, he loves that meat!\u201d). Rockabilly is often presented as the beginning of rock. As a result, jump blues performers like Brown and Wynonie Harris, who laid the groundwork for Elvis and Jerry Lee, are mistakenly seen as outliers rather than founders.\n\nLaVern Baker, \u201cSoul on Fire\u201d 1953\n\n\n\nMusicians like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley are, like Hendrix, performers who can be easily slotted into a narrative about white guitar bands. LaVern Baker shows how limited that view is. A major, successful, early rock star, her music was horn- and piano-based rather than rooted in guitar and country. \u201cSoul On Fire\u201d in particular, is in a torch song tradition that has remained part of rock, from Aretha to Joni Mitchell to Journey.\n\nRay Charles, \u201cWhat\u2019d I Say\u201d 1959\n\n\n\nOne of the most massively influential rock records of all time. The rhythmic assault and lascivious lyrics of \u201cWhat\u2019d I Say\u201d convinced Paul McCartney to become a musician; it was the first song performed by the band that would become the Rolling Stones, and the blueprint for black rock artists from James Brown to Aretha Franklin. It became a standard in the repertoire of Jerry Lee Lewis. Yet Charles is rarely mentioned among the seminal early rock artists like Elvis or Little Richard. Instead, he\u2019s pigeonholed as the inventor of soul, as if inventing soul somehow means he can\u2019t have invented rock as well.\n\nHowlin\u2019 Wolf, \u201cMama\u2019s Baby\u201d 1962\n\n\n\nEven playing guitar isn\u2019t necessarily enough to get black artists acknowledged as rockers. Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s harsh, dirty sound, influenced by blues and country, is an essential part of the DNA of heavy rock, and Wolf was recording at the same time as canonical rock stars. Yet he\u2019s called \u201cblues.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s all part of some sort of plot to make \u201cExile on Main Street\u201d look original?\n\nCookies, \u201cWounded\u201d 1967\n\n\n\nGirl-group pop was an essential subgenre in early rock. It was a major influence on rock bands like the Beatles and the Beach Boys, not to mention Ray Charles, with whom many of the Cookies recorded as the Raylettes. This track shows that Beatles and Beach Boys\u2019 influence is coming back around. \u201cWounded\u201d isn\u2019t some embalmed source for the rock music innovations of white-boy geniuses, but a slice of psychedelic rock itself.\n\nOtis Redding, \u201cPapa\u2019s Got a Brand New Bag\u201d 1968\n\n\n\nRedding was a huge Little Richard fan, and performed with Richard\u2019s backing band early in his own career. But, in a quintessentially rock star mode, his influences were eclectic; he\u2019d cover blues and country as well as rock songs like the Stones\u2019 \u201cSatisfaction.\u201d This performance of James Brown\u2019s \u201cPapa\u2019s Got a Brand New Bag\u201d is so tight and fierce it just about turns into metal \u2014 hard rock funk.\n\nFreddie King, \u201cGoing Down\u201d 1971\n\n\n\nOne of the great progenitors of electric guitar rock listened to his disciples on both sides of the Atlantic, and then stepped up to show them he could beat them at their own game. King is supposed to be a blues artist, but if this were recorded by Zeppelin or ZZ Top, there\u2019s little doubt where it would be shelved at your local record store.\n\nMiles Davis, \u201cBlack Satin\u201d 1973\n\n\n\nDavis\u2019 \u201cOn The Corner\u201d was hugely controversial when it came out; his use of tape loops and electronics and the studio as an instrument alienated jazz purists and just about everybody else. The album\u2019s genius has long since been recognized. And yet, though its eclecticism, experimentation and fierceness scream \u201crock!\u201d, \u201cOn the Corner\u201d still never gets mentioned in lists of greatest rock albums, and Miles is never really considered as an important rock musician. But he is.\n\nDonna Summer, \u201cHot Stuff\u201d 1979\n\n\n\nRock and disco are supposed to be sworn enemies. But if the rhythmic funk of Ray Charles and the vocal tradition of LaVern Baker are seen as part of rock, it starts to look like disco is an offshoot rather than an opposite. Donna Summer\u2019s great, swaggering disco-rock fusion in this case isn\u2019t a synthesis of strangers, but a reunification of siblings, separated briefly perhaps, but both raised on gospel, blues, snarling guitars and rhythmic hot stuff.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Mariah Carey to Run-D.M.C., the most critically acclaimed pop of the last 60 years was shaped by black rock VIDEO", "author": "Noah Berlatsky", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From Mariah Carey to Run-D.M.C., the most critically acclaimed pop of the last 60 years was shaped by black rock VIDEO", "title": "19 songs that prove how much pop music owes to black rock", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/05/jimi_hendrix_is_not_a_token_19_songs_to_prove_that_rock_has_always_been_black_music/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/jimi_hendrix.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From Mariah Carey to Run-D.M.C., the most critically acclaimed pop of the last 60 years was shaped by black rock VIDEO", "creator": "@hoodedu", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/jimi_hendrix.jpg", "title": "19 songs that prove how much pop music owes to black rock", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "19 songs that prove how much pop music owes to black rock", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, ceelo green, De La Soul, Freddie King, Jimi Hendrix, jody watley, lists, mariah carey, Miles Davis, Music, otis redding, Ray Charles, Run DMC, Stevie Wonder, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce9ed\"", "article_summary": "Basically, black rock music is central to the most critically acclaimed pop of the last 60 years.\nThe list below proves that rock has been black music from the beginning, long before Hendrix, and has remained black music up to the present day.\n\u201cWounded\u201d isn\u2019t some embalmed source for the rock music innovations of white-boy geniuses, but a slice of psychedelic rock itself.\nCookies, \u201cWounded\u201d 1967Girl-group pop was an essential subgenre in early rock.\nA major, successful, early rock star, her music was horn- and piano-based rather than rooted in guitar and country."}
