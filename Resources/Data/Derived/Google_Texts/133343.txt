UNION COUNTY – Fifteen people were arrested and seven surrendered to sheriff's officers as a result of a child support sweep in Union, Linden, Rahway, Roselle and Hillside, Union County Sheriff Joseph Cryan said in a statement.

Members of the Union County Sheriff’s Office Investigations Division-Family Violence Unit conducted the sweep early Friday morning, the statement said.

Sheriff’s officers arrested 15 people for failure to pay child support for arrears totaling $419,890.42. An additional seven people surrendered to the Sheriff’s Office for arrears totaling $171,792.98.

“Time and time again we are seeing parents struggle because someone has shirked their responsibility,” Cryan said in the statement. “We want to send a message that if you are not paying your obligation for child support, we will pursue you and we will catch you. If this type of enforcement coerces other parents to pay what they owe, it is worth it.”

The roundup was led by Family Violence Unit Commander Lt. Jeffery Coon and Unit Supervisor Sgt. Clifford Meros. All the arrests were made without incident.

Those who were arrested were committed to the Union County Jail pending a Superior Court appearance. The people who surrendered were processed and brought for a Superior Court appearance.
