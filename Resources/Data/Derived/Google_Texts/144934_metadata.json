For a moderately complex office visit, she is paid about the same as [a] nurse practitioner: about $80 from Medicaid and about $160 on average from commercial insurance. Says Dr. Abernethy, \u201cI would love to see every Medicaid patient that comes through my door. If you give people coverage, they should be able to utilize it.\u201d But making it work would extend her workday, and \u201cI have three small children and I miss them.\u201d\n\nA year and a half later, things are about to get a whole lot worse for Dr. Abernethy \u2014 and her colleagues.\n\nThe New Mexico Human Services Department is preparing to implement the Legislature\u2019s mandate that it \u201creduce reimbursement rates paid to Medicaid providers.\u201d The health-care bureaucracy\u2019s plan does not impact prevention or obstetrics, but cuts for inpatient, outpatient, and dental services would range from 1 percent to 8 percent. As the Associated Press noted, the \u201cUniversity of New Mexico Hospital would see the steepest reimbursement reductions \u2014 8 percent for inpatient services and 5 percent for outpatient.\u201d Previously \u201cenhanced\u201d rate for uncompensated care at 29 state hospitals would be reversed.\n\nWhy all the cuts? Medicaid, expanded by Governor Martinez under Obamacare, is spewing a river of red ink. It\u2019s projected to generate a deficit of $417 million in the 2016 and 2017 fiscal years. And the future is likely to be even darker. By 2020, the state estimates that 43 percent of New Mexicans will be signed up for \u201cfree\u201d health care.\n\nLast year, the Legislature\u2019s Health and Human Services Committee asked the Rio Grande Foundation to provide an analysis of Medicaid\u2019s costs and benefits in the Land of Enchantment. Paul Gessing, our organization\u2019s president, explained to legislators that, nationally, \u201cover half of providers no longer accept Medicaid patients,\u201d and of the \u201cdoctors who do accept Medicaid, the provider networks are narrow and nearly one-third face wait times of over a month.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s far-left members assured us that such conditions don\u2019t prevail in New Mexico. Except\u2026 they do. A recent investigation by the Legislative Finance Committee uncovered average Medicaid wait times \u201cfrom three weeks to nearly two months,\u201d as well as \u201csignificantly fewer [primary care providers] accepting new Medicaid patients than has been reported by the [managed care organizations].\u201d\n\nWith reimbursements about to decline, look for even longer wait times and more providers denying services to Medicaid patients. It\u2019s Econ 101 \u2014 a subject the proprietors of New Mexico\u2019s taxpayer-funded, health-care empire consistently flunk.\n\nAnother inconvenient reality willfully ignored by Medicaid\u2019s fans: the research consistently showing that the program generates less-than-impressive outcomes. In Oregon, where Medicaid was broadened prior to Obamacare, a sweeping study concluded that expansion \u201cproduced no statistically significant effects on physical health.\u201d\n\nIneffective and outrageously costly, Medicaid is an albatross around the necks of taxpaying New Mexicans. It\u2019s time for the state to reverse its disastrous expansion. Such a return to fiscal sanity is possible. In the words of the Foundation for Government Accountability\u2019s Jonathan Ingram, options include the elimination of \u201cMedicaid expansion eligibility, effective on a specific date,\u201d or a freeze \u201cat current levels,\u201d allowing \u201cenrollees [to] cycle off as their conditions improve.\u201d Next up: A lobbying effort with other states to implement meaningful, market-oriented reforms of a program that has gotten completely out of control.\n\nTinkering with reimbursement rates can cut costs in the short run, but it\u2019s no long-term solution to New Mexico\u2019s Medicaid mess.
