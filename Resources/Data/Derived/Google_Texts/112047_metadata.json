Portland (19-2) defeated the Broncos 54-40 in last year\u2019s final.\n\nLewiston, which sought its first regional crown since 1966, finishes at 13-8.\n\nJunior guard Nick Gilpin paced Hampden to its 13th consecutive victory at the ACC \u2014 a streak that dates back to the 2011 EM semifinals \u2014 as he scored on a dunk off the game\u2019s opening tip and went on to total 23 points, eight rebounds and seven assists.\n\nBrendan McIntyre added 17 points and seven rebounds for the Broncos while Moore added 10 points, five during the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the two most important baskets of the game may have been back-to-back 3-pointers less than a minute apart by junior guard Jake Black midway through the third quarter after Lewiston had turned the game into a one-sided track meet just before and after intermission to transform a 35-27 deficit into a stunning 48-35 lead.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about the score,\u201d said Gilpin, who was named the tournament\u2019s outstanding player-sportsman. \u201cI was worried about how we couldn\u2019t even get a shot off because they were creating so many turnovers, and if we couldn\u2019t get shots off we couldn\u2019t score enough points to win the game.\u201d\n\nBut Black\u2019s first long-range shot ended Lewiston\u2019s long scoring binge, and the second then closed Hampden\u2019s deficit to 48-41 and served to reinforce the Broncos\u2019 belief that they had withstood the Blue Devils\u2019 best body blow.\n\n\u201cI think it was Jake\u2019s shots, honestly, that got us going,\u201d said McIntyre. \u201cWe were down 13 at that point, and once he hit those two threes it really got the momentum going, they kind of laid back a little bit and we got everything back.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the third quarter Hampden had closed within 48-46, and a reverse layup by Moore around 6-foot-10-inch Lewiston center Trever Irish followed by a mid-range jumper by Moore gave the Broncos a sudden 50-48 lead before Isaiah Harris finally countered for the Blue Devils to tie the game with 5:37 remaining.\n\nQuintarian Brown\u2019s step-back jumper gave Lewiston what turned out to be its last lead at 52-50 before Gilpin went to the basket for a three-point play and McIntyre followed with a reverse layup, again using the rim to protect the ball against the omnipresent Irish.\n\nHampden sealed the game at the free-throw line, making 8 of 10 attempts over the final three minutes.\n\n\u201cYou know they\u2019re going to make a run and we held them off for a while,\u201d said Lewiston coach Tim Farrar, \u201cThey stopped turning it over and locked down in the halfcourt and that made it tough for us.\u201d\n\nHarris led Lewiston with 19 points and eight rebounds while Irish had 12 points and 12 boards. Tykeem Gaines also scored 12 points and Ryan Bell added 10 for the Blue Devils.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 The Hampden Academy boys basketball team was on the verge of getting blown out of Saturday afternoon\u2019s Eastern Maine Class A final.The Lewiston Blue Devils were in the process of scoring 21 unanswered points against the Broncos and showing no signs of letting up.But Hampden\u2019s championship pedigree [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 The Hampden Academy boys basketball team was on the verge of getting blown out of Saturday afternoon\u2019s Eastern Maine Class A final.
