Fiorina returns to attack Clinton's 'lust for power' Trump clinches GOP nomination MORE suggested Tuesday that the Obama administration is treating police as \"the enemy.\"\n\n\"Many of us have been growing more and more concerned at seeing police officers the subject of public vilification, seeing police officers being undermined and hearing from police officers across this country that they are less and less able to do their jobs,\" the Texas senator said during a hearing on Capitol Hill.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"In my view it is deeply harmful, not only for the men and women of law enforcement, but for the safety of the American people, for the federal government to treat police officers as the enemy, for the president or the attorney general to be holding up police officers for vilification,\" Cruz added later.\n\nCruz made the comment while chairing a hearing for the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts.\n\nThe title of the hearings itself, which alluded to a \"War on Police,\" became a hot topic of debate among lawmakers on the panel as well as their witnesses, which included members of the Justice Department, NAACP, a chief of police and members of conservative think tanks.\n\n\"I know there was an effort to make this a neutral title for this hearing, but I think it leans a little bit in a provocative way,\" Sen.
