She vowed to defend the reforms.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine, I will be vigorous in making the case that this law is working, and that families, businesses and taxpayers are better off as a result,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs. Burwell said she\u2019ll also work with states to broaden the appeal of Medicaid expansion \u2014 the law\u2019s second, yet optional, pillar.\n\n\u201cI want to see all 50 states expand in ways that work for their states, and we will work with governors from both parties to try and make that happen,\u201d she said.\n\nRepublicans are flexing their twin majorities in the Congress by filing bills that would chip away at Obamacare\u2019s most unpopular mandates and taxes, or would repeal the overhaul altogether.\n\nEven as the secretary spoke, GOP lawmakers from both chambers were gathering in Hershey, Pennsylvania, for a party retreat that will focus in part on plans to repeal and replace the law.\n\nThe administration, meanwhile, is urging uninsured Americans to sign up for coverage on the law\u2019s online exchanges by Feb. 15.\n\nDisagreements over Mr. Obama\u2019s signature achievement, the secretary said, should not prevent the administration and Congress from working together in other areas, such as using health dollars wisely or preventing drug-overdose deaths.\n\n\u201cI count myself among those who do not believe that disagreements in some areas \u2014 even significant disagreements \u2014 should prevent us from moving forward on others,\u201d Mrs. Burwell said.\n\nShe singled out opioid drug abuse as a bipartisan issue.\n\nWhile painkillers help millions, the pills can be deadly. Doctors wrote 259 million opioid prescriptions in 2012 alone, Mrs. Burwell said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough for every American adult to have a bottle,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's top health official said Thursday that millions of Americans now rely on Obamacare and it is time for Congress to move beyond attempts to dismantle the 2010 law.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s top health official said Thursday that millions of Americans now rely on Obamacare and it is time for Congress to move beyond attempts to dismantle the 2010 law.", "title": "Sylvia Mathews Burwell to GOP-led Congress: Get over Obamacare, focus on common ground", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/15/burwell-gop-led-congress-get-over-over-obamacare/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/31/7b06e0cf457eb933690f6a7067009945.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/31/7b06e0cf457eb933690f6a7067009945.jpg", "description": "President Obama's top health official said Thursday that millions of Americans now rely on Obamacare and it is time for Congress to move beyond attempts to dismantle the 2010 law.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Sylvia Mathews Burwell to GOP-led Congress: Get over Obamacare, focus"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4f2\"", "article_summary": "Mrs. Burwell said she\u2019ll also work with states to broaden the appeal of Medicaid expansion \u2014 the law\u2019s second, yet optional, pillar.\nPresident Obama\u2019s top health official said Thursday that millions of Americans now rely on Obamacare and it is time for Congress to move beyond attempts to dismantle the 2010 law.\n\u201cThese efforts are happening despite increasing evidence that the law is working.\u201dMrs. Burwell said millions more Americans have health insurance, some for the first time, while others are seeing their benefits improve.\nThe administration, meanwhile, is urging uninsured Americans to sign up for coverage on the law\u2019s online exchanges by Feb. 15.\nDoctors wrote 259 million opioid prescriptions in 2012 alone, Mrs. Burwell said."}
