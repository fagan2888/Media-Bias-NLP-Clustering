And road conditions continue to change.\n\n\"I can't stress enough, please don't travel unless it's absolutely necessary,\" said Trooper David Jones with the South Carolina Highway Patrol.

An update Wednesday morning said 269 roads and 143 bridges remained closed.\n\n\"It's still dangerous to drive along these highways in the Midlands,\" Jones said. \"A lot of debris floating down that river, and that debris is hitting the bridge and standing up against it. A large amount of debris is coming against that bridge and could come up and over it.\"\n\nInterstate 95, which had been closed between Florence and Orangeburg, is now open in some areas. The Interstate remains closed between exits 119 and 132, which are the Manning and Route 527 exits in Clarendon County.
