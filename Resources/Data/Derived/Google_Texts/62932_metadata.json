Unfortunately Yes. Obama's ACA Moving Forward\n\n\u201cOf those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people, commencing demagogues and ending tyrants.\u201d \u2013Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 1 (1787)\n\nAt the March 2010 signing ceremony of Barack Obama\u2019s lifetime legislative achievement, the so-called \u201cAffordable Care Act,\u201d Joe Biden was caught on an open mike whispering to Obama, \u201cThis is a big f****** deal.\u201d Clearly, neither Biden nor Obama had any idea how difficult it would be to put their \u201cbig f****** deal\u201d into practice.\n\nThree weeks into the laughably catastrophic failure of ObamaCare\u2019s portal, Healthcare.gov, Obama proclaimed, \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is not just a website. It\u2019s much more.\u201d\n\nThis week, in congressional testimony about that failure, Marilyn Tavenner, who\u2019s responsible for overseeing the ACA technology, reiterated, \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the Affordable Care Act is more than just a website.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it is much more, all of which poses an ominous threat to Essential Liberty, but for the moment, all eyes are on the cascading failures of ObamaCare.\n\nThe Lies and Cancelations:\n\nIn a 2009 health care reform speech before a joint session of Congress, Obama said, \u201cIf you misrepresent what\u2019s in this plan, we will call you out.\u201d This pathetic narcissist won\u2019t admit his own lies and duplicitous deceptions, so we\u2019ll call him out.\n\nOn 26 September, five days before the O'Care rollout, he declared, \u201cI want to speak plainly, clearly, honestly, about what [ObamaCare] means for you and for the people you care about. Let\u2019s start with a fact. About 85% of Americans already have health insurance. If you\u2019re one of these folks, it\u2019s reasonable that you might worry that health care reform includes changes that are a problem for you, especially when you\u2019re bombarded with all sorts of fear mongering. So the first thing you need to know is this. If you already have health care you don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d\n\nOf course, we all now know that his oft-repeated lie \u2013 \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period.\u201d \u2013 was a subterfuge to help push ObamaCare through the Democrat-controlled House and Senate.\n\nTo date, more than 4.1 million Americans have had their insurance policies cancelled. Worse yet, the Obama administration knew in 2010 that more than 90 million policies would be at risk of cancelation.\n\nAt present, Obama is fabricating new lies in an effort to cover up the old lies. Of his prevarications, National Journal\u2019s Ron Fournier, a long-time Obama acolyte from the Associated Press, wrote: \u201cIt might not seem possible that Obama could do more harm to his credibility \u2026 than misleading Americans about health insurance reform. But he can. The president is now misleading the public about his deception.\u201d\n\nFournier also took note of Obama\u2019s pronoun substitution. In the first round of lies, it was all \u201cI.\u201d But in the lies about lies, he has shifted to \u201cWe.\u201d\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) offered his assessment of Obama\u2019s lies: \u201cYou know, the president already has a Nobel Prize for peace; I think he\u2019s shooting for one in fiction.\u201d Indeed, if he wins a Pulitzer for fiction, it will be because he actually earned it this time.\n\nThe Sticker Shock and Awe:\n\nObama promised, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna lower your premiums by $2,500 per family per year.\u201d\n\nWell, not quite. For the truth about O'Care policy replacement costs, this interactive map illustrates how the so-called \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d will alter health insurance premiums. The latest report concludes that premiums will increase in 41 states, with some increases exceeding 100%.\n\nThe Security Breaches:\n\nJohn McAfee, founder of the world\u2019s largest computer security company, offered this assessment of the scope of the Healthcare.gov failure: \u201cGlitch is a minor annoyance. This is a catastrophic failure, not a glitch. There was no security testing, no quality assurance and no system emigration.\u201d McAfee notes that there are now more than 700 look-alike sites successfully scamming those pour souls who think they\u2019re at Healthcare.gov \u2013 giving up lots of personal information. But it\u2019s not just the scammers that folks need to worry about. The information they\u2019ll be providing to the ObamaCare portal itself is at great risk of compromise.\n\nIn addition to the current O'Care debacles, I contend that there are very consequential political silver linings beyond all the lies, cancelations, price increases and security issues.\n\nThe real DemoCare liability is this: From October 1 forward, and with increasing frequency, Americans of every political stripe who have any issue with health care, whether a hangnail or heart transplant, a delay in a doctor\u2019s office or in critical care for a loved one, will tie blame for their discontent like a noose around the necks of Obama and his fellow Democrats, who were and remain solely responsible for forcing this abomination upon the American people.\n\nSo what\u2019s the success story for Obama?\n\nThe fact is, O'Care is achieving Obama\u2019s most coveted political objectives \u2013 both the redistribution of wealth and the centralizing control and regulation of the U.S. economy, as outlined by his Marxist mentor, Saul Alinsky.\n\nDespite the \u201cglitches\u201d plaguing the web launch, and other notable issues undermining whatever credibility Obama has left, his macro agenda for the so-called \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d is on track to become the largest wealth redistribution scheme in American history, and a crushing burden upon the shoulders of free enterprise.\n\nObama\u2019s ACA is the Socialist Democrats' crowning achievement for \u201cfundamentally transforming the United States of America\u201d \u2013 the greatest domestic threat to Liberty since Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s despotic regime.\n\nAs for the two most significant objections to ObamaCare \u2013 the increasing cost of insurance coverage and the forcing of millions of people into part-time employment so employers can avoid the mandates \u2013 Obama will roll out two solutions.\n\nFirst, once enough people have lost their existing insurance, he will launch a populist proposal to substantially increase \u201csubsidies.\u201d\n\nSecond, he will unilaterally create even more regulatory measures to redefine part-time employment as it pertains to avoiding O'Care mandates.\n\nBoth of these measures will be wrapped up in his rhetoric about \u201cfighting for the middle class,\u201d his incessant vows to protect the average American from the ravages of free enterprise, and his efforts to ensure \u201ceconomic justice.\u201d\n\nRegarding objections from his union constituency, HHS quietly announced this week a planned reinsurance tax exemption for big union insurance plans.\n\nObama has already succeeded in swelling the rolls of those who are government dependents.\n\nAccording to the latest census data, while there are 125 million Americans who depend primarily on earnings, there are now 100 million Americans who depend on the government for subsistence. Some 82 million receive Medicaid welfare (and that number is going up as a result of O'Care), almost 50 million receive food and shelter subsidies, and 5 million receive unemployment checks. (Note, these figures do not include the 50 million Americans who receive earned assistance in the form of Social Security, Medicare and Veteran\u2019s benefits.)\n\nObamaCare adds millions to his government-dependent constituency through insurance subsidies.\n\nObamaCare expands the ranks of unionized government employees, much as was the case when the Transportation Security Administration forged its alliance with the Democratic Party.\n\nObamaCare greatly inflates IRS power and scope.\n\nObamaCare hugely increases the expense burden on small businesses \u2013 punishing entrepreneurs and their employees for engaging in free-market capitalism and supporting conservative principles.\n\nObamaCare massively expands the Medicaid entitlement, which will cost taxpayers trillions more.\n\nOh, and did I mention that ObamaCare is going to be a conduit for new (and fraudulent) voter registrations? Indeed, within ObamaCare\u2019s application for insurance subsidies is a checkbox for voter registration.\n\nNow, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility to substantially amend or revoke ObamaCare.\n\nIn 1988, with the support of the AARP, Democrats in the House passed the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act by a vote of 328 to 72. A year later, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-IL), Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, literally had to flee an angry mob of unhappy constituents. The law was repealed 16 months after passage by a vote of 360 to 66.\n\nHowever, the only hope of rolling back ObamaCare is by way of a coalition of conservative and moderate Republicans who can win controlling majorities in the House and Senate in 2014 and the White House in 2016. That means a cease-and-desist order regarding all the self-defeating Republican infighting.\n\nIn the meantime, we must do everything possible to contain Obama\u2019s overt and covert expansion of the ACA.\n\nPro Deo et Constitutione \u2013 Libertas aut Mors\n\nSemper Fortis Vigilate Paratus et Fidelis", "article_metadata": {"description": "ObamaCare is much more than just a website, all of which poses an ominous threat to Essential Liberty.", "csrf-token": "7hKbwu10rJfnNcRdsM/EMHz6xZexgeH/aLtSB1nQWrY=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "ObamaCare is much more than just a website, all of which poses an ominous threat to Essential Liberty.", "title": "ObamaCare Propaganda Success?
