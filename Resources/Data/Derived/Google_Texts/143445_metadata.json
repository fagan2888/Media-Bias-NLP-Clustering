She had no appetite, and her mind galloped as she grasped for an answer to her latest setback.\n\nIn January, almost immediately after she got Medicaid coverage through the Affordable Care Act, she had called a community mental health agency seeking help for the depression and anxiety that had so often consumed her.\n\nNow she was getting therapy for the first time, and it was helping, no question. She just wished she could go more often. The agency, Seven Counties Services, has been deluged with new Medicaid recipients, and Ms. Hall has had to wait up to seven weeks between appointments with her therapist, Erin Riedel, whose caseload has more than doubled.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just awesome,\u201d Ms. Hall said. \u201cBut she\u2019s busy, very busy.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has paved the way for a vast expansion of mental health coverage in America, providing access for millions of people who were previously uninsured or whose policies did not include such coverage before. Under the law, mental health treatment is an \u201cessential\u201d benefit that must be covered by Medicaid and every private plan sold through the new online insurance marketplaces.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe need is widely viewed as great: Nearly one in five Americans has a diagnosable mental illness, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, but most get no treatment. If the law\u2019s goal is met, advocates say, it will reduce not only personal suffering but also exorbitant economic costs, like the higher rate of general health problems among those with mental illnesses, and their lost productivity.\n\nKentucky has been trying to overhaul its mental health system, partly by allowing private psychologists and social workers to accept Medicaid patients for the first time. The change is crucial, state officials say, because 85 percent of the 521,000 Kentuckians who got coverage through the state\u2019s new insurance exchange this year were poor enough to enroll in Medicaid. Previously, only psychologists and social workers at community health centers like Seven Counties, which are quasi-governmental agencies, could provide outpatient therapy to Medicaid recipients here. Now, more than 1,000 private mental health providers statewide have signed up to treat Medicaid enrollees, according to the state.\n\nRemaking Medicine\n\nBut shortfalls in care persist. In Louisville, a city of 600,000 where The New York Times is looking periodically at the law\u2019s impact, most new Medicaid enrollees are flowing to four adult mental health clinics run by Seven Counties. Calls to the agency\u2019s access line, the starting point for new clients, are up by more than 40 percent this year, said Kelley Gannon, its chief operating officer.\n\nSeven Counties declared bankruptcy last year in the face of spiraling pension costs, and a federal judge ruled that the agency could leave the state pension system. Ms. Gannon says the services it provides are not in jeopardy.\n\nThe last time Ms. Hall had seen Ms. Riedel, in late June, they had talked about her plans to return to school with a Pell Grant and work toward an associate degree. But the next day, an eviction notice arrived in Ms. Hall\u2019s mailbox. She had fallen behind on her rent and was being ordered to court. The coping techniques she learned in therapy \u2014 taking long walks and deep, slow breaths, for example \u2014 were not helping. Nor were the antidepressants and mood stabilizer that a Seven Counties psychiatrist prescribed. And her next therapy appointment was still more than four weeks away.\n\nMs. Hall is 52, with spiky, short blond hair and a deeply lined face that attests to a life roiled by stress. Addictions to alcohol and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax ended her marriage and gravely damaged her relationship with her son, who is now 27. She faced losing her small downtown apartment, and with no income at the moment other than a $600 monthly alimony check, her forward momentum was under threat.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t felt this way since I got my divorce,\u201d she said as she stamped out her cigarette, speaking fast and sweating in the damp morning heat. \u201cThen, I went back to Xanax, and I don\u2019t want to do that this time. I want to be able to handle this somehow.\u201d\n\nTreating the Community\n\nTana Jo Wright is doing her part to treat new Medicaid recipients with mental health problems. It is just not as easy as she would like.\n\nPhoto\n\nA licensed clinical social worker, Ms. Wright opened her own practice last fall after working at a busy community clinic in the blighted West End of Louisville. In a tiny rented office with a vase of peacock feathers on her desk, she is seeing 15 clients, several of them new Medicaid recipients.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike their physician counterparts, many private therapists refuse to accept Medicaid, which pays on average about 66 percent of what Medicare does. In addition, some therapists say, the paperwork takes too much time and the poor \u2014 who often experience more violence and trauma than those who are better off \u2014 are too challenging to treat. But Ms. Wright, 47, has a different outlook. She grew up in rural Lebanon, Ky., had a tumultuous relationship with her adoptive parents and was battered by a boyfriend at 16.\n\n\u201cThose experiences told me that people really need someone who will listen to them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I thought: \u2018You can do that. You would be a good therapist because you know what people go through.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe has worked with drug addicts at a methadone clinic, with abused children and teenagers at Seven Counties, and with low-income adults at Family Health Centers, the clinic in the West End. Now that she is building her own practice, she sees more clients with Medicare and private insurance. But she said she remained committed to treating people on Medicaid, motivated by the therapists who agreed to see her when she was struggling.\n\n\u201cI believe in treating the whole community,\u201d Ms. Wright said, \u201cincluding people who can\u2019t afford to pay.\u201d\n\nThe new law is a big opportunity for mental health providers to reach more people of all income levels. But in Kentucky and the 25 other states that chose to expand Medicaid, the biggest expansion of mental health care has been for poor people who may have never had such treatment before.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, private providers face considerable headaches in taking on Medicaid patients, beyond the long-term deterrent of low reimbursement. Ms. Wright, for instance, is still waiting to be approved by some of the managed care companies that provide benefits to Medicaid recipients. Eager to build her client base, Ms. Wright has taken on a handful of new Medicaid enrollees for free while she waits for those companies to approve her paperwork.", "article_metadata": {"tone":
