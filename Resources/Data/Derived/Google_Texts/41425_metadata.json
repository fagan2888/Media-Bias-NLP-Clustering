The loose ends have mostly been tied up, the various theories debunked or proven, and at least in one case the \u2018shippers have been satisfied, but the finale\u2019s most brilliant move was in allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks at the end.\n\nIn fairness, this was no Sopranos ending where the viewer is asked to play \u201cThe Lady or The Tiger.\u201d The show clearly told us that a \u201chappy ending\u201d is in store for Don \u2026 it just didn\u2019t show us how he gets there, and because of the viewers\u2019 history with the show, it didn\u2019t really need to.\n\nDo we really need to see Don coming back from California and winning back his place at McCann Erickson, in the exact same way he won his way back at SC & Partners in the first half of the season? Do we really need to see Don struggle to be a single father? Do we need to see him make another miraculous pitch that ultimately ends up being the historically groundbreaking \u201cI\u2019d Like to Buy the World a Coke\u201d ad?\n\nRelated: Why AMC Won't Miss Mad Men That Much\n\nWe\u2019ve seen it all before, and while there might be joy to be had in yet another Don Draper crawl back from the gutter fueled by his own form of genius, none of it could be quite as satisfying as that enigmatic smile that breaks on Don\u2019s face. Like the Mona Lisa, its meaning says more about the viewer than the subject. Was that Don finding a measure of contentment and enlightenment or simply coming up with the absolutely perfect pitch to get his life back on track in NYC? Was he finding a way to be a good parent to his children, or did he just want back in the game. The answer to these questions is: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThe show has laid clues all season long to this ending. Coke (the soft drink) has been a recurring motif throughout the season, from the carrot used to lure Don into corporate life to the busted Coke machine in Oklahoma. The outfits worn by the denizens of the commune were almost daring you to not think of the iconic ad. As a side joke, the episode includes an early scene of Joan and Richard trying a different kind of coke.\n\nBut the real keys to Don\u2019s path to redemption lie in two therapy scenes. Don doesn\u2019t speak in either \u2014 and for a man who has demonstrated his ability to hypnotize a meeting with his presence, these silences speak volumes about his mental state. In her final scenes, Stephanie Draper confronts her feelings about abandoning her child. For all of the early \u201870s talk of doing what makes you happy, Stephanie knows that on some level she has still abandoned a child that will never forget or possibly forgive her for it. As Betty points out, Don has all but abandoned his own kids in his quest for self.\n\nRelated: Better Call Saul: AMC\u2019s Gutsy Gamble Pays Off\n\nThe finale\u2019s real moment of genius, though, was in handing its final monologue to someone else. Rather than having Jon Hamm\u2019s baritone deliver the speech that at long last bares his soul, he simply watches as another man says the words he can\u2019t articulate. The man, though opposite Don in many ways, shares the same deep insecurities. And what metaphor does the man use? An item sitting on the shelf of a refrigerator. Like, say, a can of\u2026soda.\n\nThe other characters, having reached their point of closure, were all given suitable send-offs. Joan and Peggy are allowed to realize their different dreams, one of independence from the system and the other to be taken seriously within it. Peggy and Stan\u2019s romance may have been a touch rushed, but is anyone unhappy to see them together? Roger and Joan, the other fan favorite couple, were also given an appropriate ending that did not betray their characters. Even Pete\u2019s dreams came true (while Harry Crane remains the same miserable bastard he\u2019s always been).\n\nFor a show that so many predicted to have a dark ending, the finale was honestly kind and generous. We have spent a decade with these characters, and we love them\u2026and this isn\u2019t Game of Thrones. That the ambiguity of the final two scenes allows for a more cynical reading is not a detriment to the show. Its ability to work within ambiguity, subjectivity and self-created illusions is exactly what the show has always been about.\n\nWell played, Mad Men. \u201cA thing like that!\u201d Indeed.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Mad Men went out with an ambiguous smile, where many expected a sharp descent.", "title": "The \u2018Mad Men\u2019 Finale Refuses to Fade to Black", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/18/Mad-Men-Finale-Refuses-Fade-Black", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03212012_Mad_Men_Show_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/18/Mad-Men-Finale-Refuses-Fade-Black", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03212012_Mad_Men_Show_article.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Mad Men went out with an ambiguous smile, where many expected a sharp descent.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1ab\"", "article_summary": "Do we really need to see Don struggle to be a single father?\nMad Men went out with an ambiguous smile, where many expected a sharp descent.\nFor a show that so many predicted to have a dark ending, the finale was honestly kind and generous.\nThe answer to these questions is: \u201cYes.\u201dThe show has laid clues all season long to this ending.\nWell played, Mad Men."}
