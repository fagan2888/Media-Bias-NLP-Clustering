He suggested that taxing individuals would have been politically unpalatable, but taxing the companies worked because Americans didn't understand the difference.\n\nMore On This... Gruber remarks put Obama administration on defense\n\nThis is similar to remarks he made at a separate event around the same time in 2013. In a clip of that event, Gruber said the \"lack of transparency\" in the way the law was crafted was critical. \"Basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass,\" he said.\n\nAfter the first tape surfaced -- prompting Republican outrage -- Gruber went on MSNBC to express regret. On Tuesday, he said: \"I was speaking off the cuff and I basically spoke inappropriately, and I regret having made those comments.\"\n\nBut after Fox News played the second tape, GOP lawmakers said it proves what they've been saying all along.\n\n\"It confirms people's greatest fear about the government,\" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told Fox News on Wednesday. \"Remember, it was Nancy Pelosi who said first you have to pass it before you get to find out what's in it.\n\n\"We knew it was written in a way that it was really deliberately written to deceive the American people, and now people are paying the price.\"\n\nAs Congress returns for a lame-duck session, on the heels of midterm elections where Republicans won control of the Senate, GOP leaders say they will try once again next year to repeal the law -- or least change its most controversial provisions.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., blasted Gruber on Tuesday.\n\n\"I can't even get past the irony of that to even get to the arrogance of him calling our fellow citizens stupid,\" he told Fox News, referring to the administration's past transparency pledges.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "executive", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Law", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-02 12:24:49 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "A new tape has surfaced showing ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber, once again, claiming the health care law's authors took advantage of the stupid American public.", "twitter": {"description": "A new tape has surfaced showing ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber, once again, claiming the health care law's authors took advantage of the stupid American public.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/12/another-tape-surfaces-obamacare-architect-calling-american-people-stupid.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/111214/0/0/111114_obamacare_architect_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Another tape surfaces of ObamaCare architect calling American people \u2018stupid\u2019", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Law\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics/executive\",\"title\":\"Another tape surfaces of ObamaCare architect calling American people \\u2018stupid\\u2019\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/111214/0/0/111114_obamacare_architect_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-12T14:30:08Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/12/another-tape-surfaces-obamacare-architect-calling-american-people-stupid.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"6e27d9bc-c8de-4d72-a2da-772a2fedc5ee\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "A new tape has surfaced showing ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber, once again, claiming the health care law's authors took advantage of the stupid American public.", "dc.identifier": "6e27d9bc-c8de-4d72-a2da-772a2fedc5ee", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "healthcare,law", "description": "A new tape has surfaced showing ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber, once again, claiming the health care law's authors took advantage of the stupid American public.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Another Tape Surfaces Of Obamacare Architect Calling American People \u2018stupid\u2019", "dcterms.created": "2015-02-02 12:24:49 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "A new tape has surfaced showing ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber, once again, claiming the health care law's authors took advantage of the stupid American public.", "title": "Another tape surfaces of ObamaCare architect calling American people \u2018stupid\u2019 | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/12/another-tape-surfaces-obamacare-architect-calling-american-people-stupid.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/111214/0/0/111114_obamacare_architect_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-11-12", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Law\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics/executive\",\"title\":\"Another tape surfaces of ObamaCare architect calling American people \\u2018stupid\\u2019\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/111214/0/0/111114_obamacare_architect_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-12T14:30:08Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/12/another-tape-surfaces-obamacare-architect-calling-american-people-stupid.html\",\"post_id\":\"6e27d9bc-c8de-4d72-a2da-772a2fedc5ee\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "article_summary": "A new tape has surfaced showing Gruber, once again, claiming the health care law's authors took advantage of the \"stupid\" American public.\n\"Basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass,\" he said.\nObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber apparently doesn't think much of the intelligence of the American people.\nIn a clip of that event, Gruber said the \"lack of transparency\" in the way the law was crafted was critical.\nThe tape, played on Fox News' \"The Kelly File,\" showed Gruber speaking at an October 2013 event at Washington University in St. Louis."}
