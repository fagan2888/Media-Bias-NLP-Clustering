Moreover, teenagers who smoked menthols also reported a greater intention to continue smoking.\n\n\"The appeal of menthol cigarettes among youth stems from the perception that they are less harmful than regular cigarettes,\u201d lead researcher Sunday Azagba said in a statement. \u201cThe minty taste helps mask the noxious properties, but the reality is that they are just as dangerous as any unflavored cigarette.\u201d\n\nIn Canada, one in 10 high school students in grades 10 to 12 currently smoke cigarettes, with one-third of them smoking menthols. The Canadian government in 2010 banned the sale of most flavored tobacco products \u2014 including cigars and blunt wraps \u2014 with the exception of the highly popular menthols. And only the province of Alberta has passed a pending law to prohibit sale of the product.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing concern that the high popularity of menthol cigarettes among youth may hinder the recent progress in preventing other young people from smoking because many of them may experiment with menthol rather than unflavored brands,\u201d Azagba said.\n\nLikewise, menthol cigarettes remain popular in the United States as the tobacco industry spent $8.37 billion on advertising and marketing in the U.S. alone in 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although smoking rates have declined among American teenagers during the past decade, 23.3 percent of U.S. high school students smoke cigarettes. However, the CDC seems most critical of the tobacco industry\u2019s targeting of minority groups in the U.S. \u201cAdvertisement and promotion of certain tobacco products appear to be targeted to members of racial/minority communities,\u201d the CDC says in a fact sheet.\n\nThe American Lung Association also says that tobacco companies have long targeted minority groups in the U.S., and \u201cadvertising and promotion of cigarette brands with names such as Rio, Dorado, and American Spirit have been marketed toward Hispanics and American Indians and Alaska Natives.\u201d Azagba says his findings on youth smoking alone warrant bans on flavored tobacco products, especially given that most smokers begin the habit as adolescents.\n\nSource: Azagba S, Minaker L, Sharaf M, et al.
