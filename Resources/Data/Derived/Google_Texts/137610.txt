SUNRISE, fla. — Alex Tanguay has been an NHL player since 1999, but he sounded like a rookie Friday morning.

“Nervous, anxious,” is how the Avalanche forward described his emotions following the team’s morning skate at the BB&T Center, where the team will play the Florida Panthers to kick off a three-game road trip. “I’ve been waiting for this for a while.”

Tanguay has been out since Nov. 2 with knee and hip injuries. He will play on a line with Paul Stastny and Gabe Landeskog, on the right wing. While Tanguay will play against the Panthers, he will get Saturday’s game off against Tampa Bay.

“We don’t want to overdo it right away with Alex,” Avs coach Patrick Roy said. “The plan is to have him take (Saturday) off, then come back Tuesday in Dallas. It’s good to have him back. We were playing so well when he got hurt. It’s nice to have everybody back. This is kind of the lineup we projected, and we have more depth now.”

Roy will move hot rookie Nathan MacKinnon back to center on the third line, playing with Max Talbot and P.A. Parenteau.

Semyon Varlamov will start in goal against Florida veteran Tim Thomas, who beat the Avs in a game at the Pepsi Center earlier this season. The Panthers will be without rookie center and leading scorer Aleksander Barkov, who is hurt. Barkov went second overall to Florida in last year’s NHL draft, one spot behind MacKinnon.
