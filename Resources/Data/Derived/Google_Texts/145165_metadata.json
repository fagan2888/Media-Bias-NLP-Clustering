Reilly, Sean Hannity, Video, Wesley Lowery, Politics News\n\nLast night two reporters, Ryan J. Reilly of the Huffington Post and Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post, were arrested by out-of-control police while covering the out-of-control police situation in Ferguson, Missouri. The two were working inside a McDonald\u2019s when a number of officers came in and asked them for identification. Lowery was recording them, as is his right and job as a journalist. Eventually the officers asked them to gather their things and leave. Lowery was eventually arrested, and slammed against a soda machine, for resisting police orders because he wasn\u2019t sure which door to exit and had to gather his things.\n\nAs I turned, my backpack, which was slung over one shoulder, began to slip. I said, \u201cOfficers, let me just gather my bag.\u201d As I did, one of them said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s take him.\u201d Multiple officers grabbed me. I tried to turn my back to them to assist them in arresting me. I dropped the things from my hands. \u201cMy hands are behind my back,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not resisting. I\u2019m not resisting.\u201d At which point one officer said: \u201cYou\u2019re resisting. Stop resisting.\u201d\n\nReilly, too, was arrested for vaguely resisting/annoying the cops:\n\n\u201cThe officer in question, who I repeatedly later asked for his name, grabbed my things and shoved them into my bag,\u201d said Reilly, who appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll In with Chris Hayes\u201d shortly after his release to recount the arrest. \u201cHe used his finger to put a pressure point on my neck.\u201d \u201cThey essentially acted as a military force. It was incredible,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cThe worst part was he slammed my head against the glass purposefully on the way out of McDonald\u2019s and then sarcastically apologized for it.\u201d\n\nWhat happened was another case of militarized police officers going way out of bounds to prevent the media from covering the war zone that is Ferguson. (See, also: firing tear gas at journalists from Al Jazeera America.) All of these journalists have a right and some would say duty to cover what\u2019s been going on following the police killing of a teenager, Michael Brown. They have a right to ask for police identification and to shoot video of police acting, well, unscrupulously.\n\nAt least that\u2019s one opinion. Another is that of MSNBC \u201cMorning Joe\u201d host Joe Scarborough! He thinks that reporters should do everything the police say even when police are in the wrong. Joe has been there. Whenever the police ask Joe Scarborough to do something, even if it\u2019s something that they\u2019re outside their bounds asking, he says, \u201cyes sir\u201d or \u201cyes ma\u2019am,\u201d because Joe Scarborough is a great American and a great American is Joe Scarborough:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in places where police officers said, \u2018all right you know what, this is cordoned off, you guys need to move along.\u2019 You know what I do? I go, \u2018yes, sir, or yes, ma\u2019am.\u2019 I don\u2019t sit there and have a debate and film the police officer unless I want to get on TV and have people talk about me the next day,\u201d Scarborough said on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cI am sure I am just the worst person in the world for saying this. I can only judge how I would treat my son who is a reporter who, if he were in this position, okay, well, you know what? Next time a police officer tells you that you\u2019ve got to move along because you\u2019ve got riots outside, well, you probably should move along.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Morning Joe\" host takes reporters arrested in Ferguson to task for doing their jobs VIDEO", "title": "Joe Scarborough\u2019s police apologism: Being arrested was the reporters\u2019 own fault", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The \"Morning Joe\" host takes reporters arrested in Ferguson to task for doing their jobs VIDEO", "title": "Joe Scarborough\u2019s police apologism: Being arrested was the reporters\u2019 own fault", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/14/joe_scarboroughs_police_apologism_being_arrested_was_the_reporters_own_fault/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/joe_scarborough3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Morning Joe\" host takes reporters arrested in Ferguson to task for doing their jobs VIDEO", "title": "Joe Scarborough\u2019s police apologism: Being arrested was the reporters\u2019 own fault", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/joe_scarborough3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Newell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ferguson, hacks, Joe Scarborough, Media Criticism, Morning Joe, MSNBC, Police, police abuse, Ryan J.
