Leticia Van de Putte\u2019s remarks at her state party convention, held in June in Dallas.\n\nDuring her keynote address to delegates, Van De Putte criticized her Republican opponent, state Sen. Dan Patrick, and his votes in the Senate. Watch below as Truth Teller analyzes Van de Putte\u2019s speech and incorporates fact checks aggregated by the Tribune and the Post.\n\nInvestment votes\n\n\u201cHe took vote after vote, sometimes the only dissenting vote, against investing in jobs, roads, bridges and water.\u201d \u2014 TRUE\n\nAsked to provide evidence for this claim, the Van de Putte campaign cited several bills from the 2013 legislative session.\n\nThe first, HB 1025, transferred funds from the state\u2019s general revenue fund to the Texas Department of Transportation. It also appropriated $2 billion from the state\u2019s Rainy Day Fund to the state\u2019s newly created Water Implementation Fund for projects to help meet the state\u2019s need for water amid an extended severe drought.\n\nThe Senate Journal shows that Patrick was among three senators who voted against the measure. The Patrick campaign did not respond to requests for comment on Van de Putte\u2019s claim.\n\nVan de Putte\u2019s campaign also pointed to a bill she authored, SB 475, which related to municipalities' authority to ask local voters to reauthorize taxes to fund road improvement and maintenance projects. Patrick was among the four senators who voted against the bill, which was eventually passed and signed into law.\n\nAs for the \"only dissenting vote\" part of her claim, the Van de Putte campaign flagged SB 1476, which created a program to assist veterans hoping to start a business. The Senate Journal for April 18 shows that Patrick was the sole vote against considering the bill, and he was the only \u201cnay\u201d vote against the bill during its final reading in the Senate.\n\nVote against veterans program\n\n\u201cDan was the only vote, the only one in the entire Senate that voted against a veteran entrepreneurship program, a program that assists veterans \u2026 in successfully starting up their own businesses.\u201d \u2014 TRUE\n\nIn this claim, Van de Putte's campaign said she is also referring to SB 1476, which was introduced by state Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, to create the program under the Texas Veterans Commission.\n\nPatrick spokesman Logan Spence told PolitiFact that the senator voted against the bill \u201cbecause it expanded the state\u2019s bureaucracy with a new function that would be more efficiently absorbed in a different agency.\u201d\n\nLegislators eventually passed the bill, which Gov. Rick Perry signed into law.\n\nSchool finance vote\n\n\u201cHe voted for cutting more than $5 billion for Texas neighborhood schools, resulting in nearly 11,000 teachers losing their jobs and increasing class sizes.\u201d \u2014 TRUE\n\nAmid a major budget shortfall in 2011, state lawmakers looking to stretch the dollars available to write a two-year budget cut $5.4 billion for public education.\n\nVan de Putte\u2019s claim that Patrick voted in favor of the budget bill that included the massive cuts to Texas\u2019 public education system is true, according to the Senate Journal.\n\nThe cuts would eventually lead a coalition of school districts to sue the state, arguing that the school finance system and the Legislature\u2019s cuts violated the Texas Constitution, which requires that schools be funded appropriately.\n\nThe second part of her claim is based on figures reported by several news outlets and confirmed by the Texas State Teachers Association. TSTA spokesman Clay Robison told the Houston Chronicle in December 2013 that the massive cuts to public education led schools to lay off about 11,000 teachers.\n\nEqual pay vote\n\n\u201cHe voted against equal pay for equal work for Texas women.\u201d \u2014 TRUE\n\nDuring the 2013 legislative session, state Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, introduced a bill that would have made Texas law mirror protections outlined in the federal Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. It sought to extend the statute of limitations for women who want to sue employers over unfair pay.\n\nCurrent state law requires disparate pay claims to be filed within six months after the discrimination began. Thompson\u2019s proposal would have allowed such claims to be filed when discrimination is discovered.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, a state senator, sponsored the bill in the Senate, where it eventually passed by a slim margin with Patrick among the \u201cnay\u201d votes.\n\nLegislators passed the bill, but Gov. Rick Perry vetoed it. Van de Putte has said she would push for similar legislation in the next legislative session if elected lieutenant governor.\n\nPatrick told news outlets earlier this year that he believes men and women should be paid equally, but he does not support equal pay legislation. He said the \u201cgovernment shouldn\u2019t be calling the shots\u201d when it comes enforcing equal pay.\n\nPerry and Medicaid\n\n\u201cOur hard-earned tax dollars go to California or New Jersey, because our governor refuses to find a Texas way to insure those without health insurance and expand Medicaid.\u201d \u2014 IT\u2019S COMPLICATED\n\nTexas Democrats often criticize Republican leaders for their staunch opposition to expanding Medicaid \u2014 the joint federal-state insurer of children and the disabled \u2014 to cover low-income, uninsured adults under the federal Affordable Care Act. Democrats claim Republicans are leaving federal dollars on the table by forgoing expansion.\n\nIf Texas had expanded Medicaid to cover young adults under President Obama\u2019s health reform law, the federal government would have covered 100 percent of the cost for three years, eventually reducing its coverage to 90 percent. (The federal government currently provides Texas with $60 in matching funds for every $40 the state spends on Medicaid services.)\n\nTo pay for the Medicaid expansion in states like California and New Jersey, the federal government is using taxpayer dollars raised from residents in all states, regardless of whether that state expands Medicaid and receives the federal funds.\n\nTexas would have received about $100 billion in federal funds over 10 years, but it would have had to pay out $15 billion from its own pocket for the expansion.\n\nRepublicans have said the increase in state spending that would be required to finance an expansion outweighs the financial incentives the federal government would provide. Gov. Rick Perry has called the Medicaid system \u201cbroken\u201d and has said it should be reformed instead of expanded. More recently, he called the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion provision \u201cfederal blackmailing.\u201d\n\nPerry directed the state\u2019s Health and Human Services Commission to request a federal block grant that would allow the state to reform the program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With help from The Washington Post&rsquo;s&nbsp;Truth Teller, we&rsquo;re analyzing speeches Texas&rsquo; candidates for lieutenant governor gave at their respective state political party conventions.
