Americans for Tax Reform’s tax-policy director, Ryan Ellis, didn’t mince his words when he called tea-party activists “freaking retarded” in a tweet on Wednesday night:

@freddoso I’ve gotta tell you, man, I’m starting to think these tea party activists are freaking retarded — Ryan Ellis (@RyanLEllis) October 24, 2013

Ellis took issue with “defunders” because he claimed that they had convinced members of the Tea Party that a government shutdown would have defunded Obamacare. Earlier in the evening, he also called Ted Cruz “a despicable man who lies to good people.”

@brianjameswalsh @philipaklein I think I know how everyone must have felt about Aaron Burr. Cruz is a despicable man who lies to good people — Ryan Ellis (@RyanLEllis) October 24, 2013

Ellis brushed off initial backlash to the comments.

Lesson from Twitter tonight: say anything negative about Rafael Eduardo Cruz, be prepared for derp. Lots and lots of derp. — Ryan Ellis (@RyanLEllis) October 24, 2013

@ZacharyGraves i get bored easily. — Ryan Ellis (@RyanLEllis) October 24, 2013

The Madison Project PAC, a grassroots network of conservatives, criticized Ellis for his comments, saying it reflected “what’s wrong with the K Street Republicans in Washington, DC.”

“Instead of fighting for hard-working families that struggle every day to make ends meet, they choose to attack them,” the group’s political director said in a statement. The Madison Project has called on Americans for Tax Reform to apologize.

UPDATE: Ellis apologized for his previous tweet, saying that he should not have chosen the word “retarded”:
