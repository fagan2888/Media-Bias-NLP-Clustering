NEWBURGH HEIGHTS, OH – Newburgh Heights city council members gave their approval for the purchase of police body cameras, Tuesday night.

The vote was unanimous.

Police Chief John Majoy said the cameras are becoming a necessity in modern police work.

He told Fox 8 News, “It is important because it preserves the integrity of the officer. It preserves the integrity of the public. The videos cannot be manipulated. It is designed to help people out.”

Newburgh Heights officers demonstrated the use of the body cameras to city council members. Chief Majoy said the department recommended a specific type of camera after three months of research.

Majoy told council members that in other communities, the cameras resulted in fewer complaints against officers and fewer use of force incidents.

Newburgh Heights will pay three thousand dollars a year for each of the next three years to obtain the cameras.

Chief Majoy hopes the cameras will be in operation early in January.
