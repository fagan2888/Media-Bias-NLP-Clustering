Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has invited newlyweds Todd & Jeff Delmay to accompany her to Washington, D.C. for President Obama’s State of the Union Address on Tuesday, January 20th. Todd & Jeff were the second couple in Florida to marry on January 5th when Judge Sarah Zabel lifted her stay on gay & lesbian marriage. They were plaintiffs, along with Equality Florida Institute & five other gay & lesbian couples in Pareto v. Ruvin, which successfully challenged Florida’s ban on marriage equality. Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz stated, “It is my distinct honor to invite my constituents Todd & Jeff to join me for the President’s State of the Union address at the Capitol next week. Their bold efforts, along with Equality Florida & the other plaintiff couples, helped turn the page on the legal discrimination of the past & start a new chapter in Florida’s history. I’m looking forward to celebrating their marriage & highlighting the ongoing effort to achieve equality for all, next week in Washington.” Todd concluded “When we married last week, little did we know that we’d be spending our honeymoon with our beloved congresswoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, at the State of the Union. We are over the moon with excitement!” A steadfast champion for Florida’s LGBT community, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was honored by Equality Florida with the Voice for Equality award in 2010. She has advocated for repealing the state’s ban on gay adoption & in Washington DC she has been a leader in the LGBT Equality Caucus as well as co-sponsored numerous pieces of legislation to end marriage & workplace discrimination against the LGBT community, including most recently the Respect for Marriage Act.
