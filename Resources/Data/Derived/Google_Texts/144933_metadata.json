The rookie Avalanche defenseman from small-town Canadian roots learned he could do this.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a comfort thing, getting experience up here and a feel for the game,\u201d said Bigras, who has played in 23 consecutive games since being called up from the minors Jan. 13. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a huge jump from where I was last year in junior, and a jump from the AHL as well. I\u2019m getting more and more comfortable and confident with myself and my abilities.\u201d\n\nA year ago at this time, Bigras was playing for the Owen Sound Attack, the Ontario Hockey League team 70 miles east of his hometown of Orillia, Ontario. Orillia is off the banks of Lake Simcoe, and Owen Sound is on the southern end of the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron.\n\nBig cities weren\u2019t Bigras\u2019 thing, and the NHL limelight was startling.\n\n\u201cAlways been in that close-knit community,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky enough to have two good parents who have inspired me to be a good person, and through the small communities I\u2019ve built long-lasting friendships. It\u2019s a humble place to grow up, a place where I\u2019ll never forget my roots.\u201d\n\nBigras, who was Colorado\u2019s second-round draft pick (32nd overall) in 2013, turned pro last spring, playing seven games for the American Hockey League\u2019s Lake Erie Monsters. The Avs\u2019 AHL affiliate switched to the San Antonio Rampage during the off-season, and Bigras started this season in Texas, playing 37 games before his January call-up.\n\nAvs goalie Calvin Pickard knows Bigras \u2014 nicknamed \u201cBigsy\u201d \u2014 the best among his teammates. Both began the season in San Antonio and finished last season in Lake Erie.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a quiet guy, but a great guy, and it\u2019s been nice to see him play well. He\u2019s not shell-shocked at all,\u201d Pickard said of Bigras. \u201cRight from the start, he was one of our go-to guys in San Antonio. He\u2019s not afraid to make a play. Really smooth. Good skater. And a great guy off the ice as well.\u201d\n\nBigras has a goal and two points with the Avs. His first career goal came last week at Minnesota, off a back-door pass from Matt Duchene. Bigras had a career-high 23 shifts in that game.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty awesome. A thrill,\u201d Bigras said of his first NHL goal. \u201cExtremely excited about that. It was a perfect pass by Dutchy. I thanked him for that one.\u201d\n\nBigras is prone to score back-door goals because his skill set allows him to get the green light from coaches to pinch down from the blue line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s knowing when to pick your spots, when to go, and not leave your D-partner vulnerable,\u201d Bigras said. \u201cMy game is very cerebral. I try to pick up as much as I can, learn as much as I can, and use my head out there to make my decisions as far as positioning. I\u2019ve always been a pretty quick study.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers\n\nARIZONA AT COLORADO 7 p.m. Monday, NBCSN; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Shane Doan:\n\nThe veteran winger, and former major junior teammate of Jarom Iginla at Kamloops, has been with the Coyotes since their 1996 arrival from Winnipeg. At age 39, he has a team-leading 24 goals to go with 15 assists. He is making $5.3 million this season and can be an unrestricted free agent July 1. He also might retire, and if that happens, Monday night\u2019s game would be his last in Denver.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nCoyotes:\n\nArizona snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 5-1 victory over Florida at home Saturday night. Playing his first game for the Coyotes, former Avalanche forward Alex Tanguay had two goals and an assist. \u2026 In the wake of that losing streak, the Coyotes are one of five Western Conference teams realistically out of the race for a playoff berth. \u2026 The last time Arizona and Colorado met, Mikkel Boedker\u2019s goal at 4:17 of overtime gave the Coyotes a 2-1 victory in Denver on Dec. 27. Boedker joined the Avalanche a week ago in the trade for Tanguay and two major junior prospects.\n\nAvalanche:\n\nThe team conducted its annual charity brunch Sunday and didn\u2019t practice. \u2026 In the fight for the final wild-card playoff berth in the Western Conference, Minnesota took a two-point lead over the Avalanche into the Wild\u2019s Sunday night home game against St. Louis. \u2026 Coach Patrick Roy said after the Avalanche\u2019s 5-2 loss to Nashville on Saturday: \u201cIt\u2019s a tough loss, let\u2019s not kid ourselves. But right now we need to remain even keel and make sure we remain focused for the next game.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche defenseman Chris Bigras quickly becomes essential player", "title": "Avalanche defenseman Chris Bigras quickly becomes essential player", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/06/avalanche-defenseman-chris-bigras-quickly-becomes-essential-player/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160306__chris-bigrasp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160306__chris-bigrasp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-06T20:38:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:48:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Playing his first game for the Coyotes, former Avalanche forward Alex Tanguay had two goals and an assist.\nNear his 21st birthday last month, and about a month after making his NHL debut, Chris Bigras\u2019 body language turned from precarious to poised.\nBoth began the season in San Antonio and finished last season in Lake Erie.\n\u201cIt\u2019s knowing when to pick your spots, when to go, and not leave your D-partner vulnerable,\u201d Bigras said.\nThe rookie Avalanche defenseman from small-town Canadian roots learned he could do this."}
