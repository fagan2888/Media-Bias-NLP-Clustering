We\u2019re continuing the conversation.\u201d\n\nAfter Gov. Mike Pence met Monday with Burwell, he likewise said the two sides have not reached an agreement on getting federal funding to expand Medicaid in Indiana.\n\nNeither Pence nor Burwell have specified what the disagreements are about.\n\nPence\u2019s proposal is modeled after high-deductible plans with health savings accounts that advocates say give consumers an incentive to make smarter health care spending choices.\n\nBut advocates for the poor say the monthly contributions that recipients would be required to make to their savings accounts amount to premiums, which are not allowed in Medicaid for those making less than 150 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nMichigan and Iowa included monthly contributions for some recipients in their alternative Medicaid plans, but recipients can\u2019t be kicked out for failure to pay.\n\nOther Medicaid rules that Indiana wants waived include not charging more than $8 for getting non-emergency care from an emergency room, beginning coverage up to three months before a person is determined eligible, and providing transportation for non-emergency care.\n\nBurwell said Thursday her department is listening to states that want to try different approaches to expanding Medicaid, which the Supreme Court ruled is optional under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe have to think about what flexibility they need and what they think is the best approach for their state,\u201d she said. \u201cThe governor and his team and our team have been working over a period of a year in good faith on this effort. I think everyone is coming to the table with a real desire to make progress and we\u2019re going to continue to work on it.\u201d\n\nBurwell said the overall success of the Affordable Care Act will be primarily measured by how much it reduces the ranks of the uninsured.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the legislation was passed,\u201d she said.\n\nUnlike in some states, Indiana\u2019s 15 percent uninsured rate for adults hasn\u2019t changed much since major parts of the law began this year, according to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.\n\nThe two main ways the law aimed to reduce the uninsured rate was by expanding Medicaid to those earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level and by creating health exchanges where those who don\u2019t get coverage through an employer or government program can buy insurance.\n\nIndiana\u2019s current eligibility rules for Medicaid are among the toughest in the country.\n\nIn addition, Indiana is challenging the legality of the federal subsidies that have reduced the cost of the premiums for exchange plans. A federal judge heard oral arguments Thursday on the challenge, which Attorney General Greg Zoeller said will protect large employers from being subject to penalties for not offering coverage to workers. That\u2019s because the penalties kick in if a worker receives a subsidy.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1xuHPC0", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "No agreement has been reached, but both sides pledge to continue working.", "og": {"site_name": "Pal-Item", "description": "No agreement has been reached, but both sides pledge to continue working.", "title": "Feds, Indiana will keep after Medicaid plan", "url": "http://www.pal-item.com/story/news/2014/10/09/feds-indiana-will-keep-medicaid-plan/16985981/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/pal-item.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No agreement has been reached, but both sides pledge to continue working.", "creator": "@pi_news", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ef38548b0dfb8dc0c24930b8d072fb645b853720/c=923-0-2858-1935&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Richmond/2014/10/09/sylviaburwell.jpg", "title": "Feds, Indiana will keep after Medicaid plan", "site": "@pi_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=869458565", "fb": {"app_id": 128030483926763}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbe8\"", "article_summary": "Michigan and Iowa included monthly contributions for some recipients in their alternative Medicaid plans, but recipients can\u2019t be kicked out for failure to pay.\nMike Pence met Monday with Burwell, he likewise said the two sides have not reached an agreement on getting federal funding to expand Medicaid in Indiana.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell (Photo: AP file )Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Thursday she will continue to work with Indiana on its alternative Medicaid proposal, although the plan will have to maintain protections for Medicaid beneficiaries.\nPence\u2019s proposal is modeled after high-deductible plans with health savings accounts that advocates say give consumers an incentive to make smarter health care spending choices.\nIn addition, Indiana is challenging the legality of the federal subsidies that have reduced the cost of the premiums for exchange plans."}
