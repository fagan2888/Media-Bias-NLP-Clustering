In a span of minutes, he killed a female classmate and seriously wounded four others, each of them his childhood friends and two of them his relatives, before dying by a bullet from his own gun. A second victim died Sunday night.\n\nMany students interviewed on Friday vividly remembered what happened after the initial shots were fired, as a woman grabbed Jaylen\u2019s arm \u2014 few knew the woman as Ms. Silberberger at the time, perhaps because she is still so new to the school. A few seconds later, they said, they saw Jaylen fall to the ground as he either turned the weapon on himself or shot himself accidentally in the struggle.\n\nLate Saturday, the president of the local teachers\u2019 union released a statement from Ms. Silberberger saying that she has asked for time to heal. Her statement was simple and direct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis teacher did everything possible to protect students,\u201d she said.\n\nThe union president, Randy Davis, said in an interview on Sunday that Ms. Silberberger, who he said is in her 20s, and did her student-teaching here at Marysville-Pilchuck last year, was \u201cvery traumatized,\u201d and was with her family, declining interviews.\n\nOne of the wounded girls, Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, 14, remained in critical condition on Sunday at a hospital in nearby Everett, about half an hour\u2019s drive north of Seattle. A second 14-year-old girl, Gia Soriano, died Sunday night at the hospital. Nate Hatch, 14, who was transported to a hospital in Seattle, remained in serious condition in intensive care, and Andrew Fryberg, 15, also being treated in Seattle, remained in critical condition. The boys were Jaylen\u2019s cousins, family members said.\n\nNeither officials nor relatives have publicly identified the other girl who was killed.\n\nJaylen came from a prominent family on the Tulalip Indian Reservation near Marysville, and the tribe\u2019s chairman, Herman Williams Sr., issued a joint statement on Sunday with the city of Marysville, saying the two governments were collaborating fully in the investigation into the shooting, and the larger response in the community.\n\n\u201cThe Tulalip Tribes and the city of Marysville stand together,\u201d Mr. Williams said in the statement. \u201cOur priority is now on our children and young people.\u201d\n\nHere in Marysville, on the suburban-rural fringe of the Seattle metro area, horses graze near the high school, but strip malls and housing tracts crowd in toward Interstate 5 a few miles away. On Sunday, a chain-link fence on the school grounds had become a destination for grieving and had grown thick with hundreds of flowers, messages and balloons. Many came on Sunday to leave something \u2014 a memento, a candle, flowers \u2014 others to read the tributes or simply stand and cry as a cold rain fell.\n\nJoe Sheldon, 33, a real estate agent from Seattle who said he had never been to Marysville before Sunday, drove up with his daughter, Annika, 7, and his son, Donovan, 9, to leave flowers and say a prayer and talk about loving others. He hugged his children close, squatting down by the fence, and when he stood up, wiped away tears.\n\n\u201cThis just hits too close to home,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news",
