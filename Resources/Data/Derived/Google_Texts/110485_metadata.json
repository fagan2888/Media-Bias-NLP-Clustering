Employers, providers and insurance companies are joining HCP to combat waste and fraud, create efficiencies of healthcare payment processing and access industry-wide data cube analytics.\n\nThompson says he's joining HealthcarePays to combat the lack of cost transparency and rampant waste and fraud that are draining the U.S. healthcare system of hundreds of billions each year.\n\n\"There is little doubt that the future financial well-being of both the federal and state governments depends in, large part, on controlling healthcare payment inefficiencies,\" said Thompson. \"It makes little sense that the U.S. has no overarching healthcare industry payment network to check for fraud and authorize payments by examining all the payments in the system, similar to what is in place in our financial services sector. I'm joining HealthcarePays to establish the first industry-owned network of this kind. The leaders in the areas of employers, health plans and governments are encouraged to join us in this unique opportunity to create healthcare accountability through payment automation.\"\n\nKey healthcare accountability challenges include:\n\nThe National Healthcare Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA), a watchdog group, cites information from the FBI that anywhere between $70 billion and $234 billion is lost annually to healthcare fraud.
