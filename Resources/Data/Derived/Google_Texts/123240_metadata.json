Rivera won the 2013 election by 16 votes, but a court ruled that 30 ballots were illegally cast.\n\nRivera is set to be arraigned on Nov. 18\u201415 days after he squares off again against Letty Lopez in a scheduled rematch.\n\nWhile Rivera remains innocent until proven guilty, the criminal charges against him are a blow to Hinojosa, who has relentlessly criticized Texas\u2019 photo ID law and downplays the potential for election fraud.\n\nLopez\u2019s attorney, Jerad Najvar, said the Weslaco case \u201csets a legal precedent that voting residency requirements and the mail-in ballot rules that protect elderly voters from coercion will be enforced.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical victory that helps fight election fraud across the Rio Grande Valley.\u201d\n\nTwo courts determined that Rivera\u2019s re-election was aided by a string of forgeries, false addresses, and \u201cflexible residencies.\u201d\n\nA complaint filed by Lopez was the basis for the attorney general\u2019s criminal filing against Rivera and Rivera\u2019s son, Lupe Rivera Jr. Lopez alleged false statements and information were listed on voter registrations and mail-in ballot applications.\n\nAmong others, the complaint alleged that votes cast in the names of Ricardo Garcia and Jacqueline Raquel Garcia were fraudulent, as both testified they reside in the town of Mercedes and that their identities were stolen. Mail-in ballots were requested in their names and cast from Rivera\u2019s sister\u2019s address, in Weslaco\u2019s District 5.\n\nJacqueline Raquel Garcia testified that the signature on the carrier envelope for the mail-in ballot was not her own.\n\nAt trial, Hinojosa argued that vote-gathering by so-called \u201cpolitiqueras\u201d was business as usual in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\n\u201cWhat difference does it make where anybody sleeps? These are families in South Texas,\u201d the former Cameron County judge and local party boss told the courts.\n\nMary Helen Flores, president of the nonpartisan Citizens Against Voter Abuse, blasted Hinojosa.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he continually defends people involved in vote manipulation should say a whole lot,\u201d Flores said.\n\nWatchdog.org reported that Rivera disclosed no contributions or expenditures in his latest campaign finance filings.\n\nNajvar questioned Rivera\u2019s failure to list any donations\u2014in-kind or otherwise\u2014for the commissioner\u2019s representation by Hinojosa. Rivera said the Democratic Party boss handled his case pro bono.\n\nHinojosa has not responded to Watchdog\u2019s repeated requests for comment.\n\nOriginally published in Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A client of Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa is facing 16 vote fraud charges in a Rio Grande Valley election.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A client of Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa is facing 16 vote fraud charges in a Rio Grande Valley election.", "title": "Texas Democratic Party Chairman Defends Man Charged With Criminal Vote Fraud", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/democrat-voter-.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-17T16:04:02+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1LS9bxb"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A client of Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa is facing 16 vote fraud charges in a Rio Grande Valley election.", "title": "Texas Democratic Party Chairman Defends Man Charged With Criminal Vote Fraud", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/democrat-voter-.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "elections", "published_time": "2015-10-16T17:47:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-17T16:04:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "vote fraud,texas,rio grande valley,gilberto hinojosa,elections"}, "article_summary": "A client of Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa is facing 16 criminal charges of rigging votes in a Rio Grande Valley election.\nThese are families in South Texas,\u201d the former Cameron County judge and local party boss told the courts.\nRivera won the 2013 election by 16 votes, but a court ruled that 30 ballots were illegally cast.\n\u201cThe fact that he continually defends people involved in vote manipulation should say a whole lot,\u201d Flores said.\nRivera said the Democratic Party boss handled his case pro bono."}
