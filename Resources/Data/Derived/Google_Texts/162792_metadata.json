Pete Sessions (R-TX), reported the CR-Omnibus bill out of committee by a 9 to 4 party line vote late Wednesday afternoon.\n\nIngraham argued that instead of funding the federal government until the end of fiscal year 2015 in September, Congress should \u201cpass a short term continuing resolution to push a budget to February or March, then get back to work department by department in a detailed budgeting process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis [bill],\u201d she said, \u201cis an act of utter disrespect for the normal course of budgeting.\u201d\n\nIngraham began her program with a clip of Speaker Boehner criticizing the rush to pass Obama\u2019s Stimulus Bill in February 2009:\n\nHere we are with 1,100 pages not one member of this body has read. What happened to the promise we are going to let the American people see what\u2019s in this bill for 48 hours?\n\nShe followed that with an audio clip of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s famous statement prior to the passage of Obamacare in March 2010:\n\nWe have to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it.\n\n\u201cJohn Boehner, of course,\u201d Ingraham said, \u201cand the Republican leadership has basically\u2026 thumbed its nose at the conservative base of the Republican party.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe pledged transparency,\u201d she continued, \u201che pledged that once the Republicans were firmly in control\u2026 it would be a new dawn for the way we spend the taxpayers\u2019 money, for the budget process\u2026 that it would be daylight\u2026this was going to be a new day.\u201d\n\nBut Boehner\u2019s promised transparency is now long gone, Ingraham argued.\n\n\u201cWhat happened just a few weeks after this historic mid-term election?\u201d Ingraham asked rhetorically.\n\n\u201cWe have Republicans turning their backs on the very people that built this majority.\u201d The Republican House leadership, she continued, has presented \u201ca $1.1 trillion Omnibus spending bill that is chock-full with pork and giveaways to the left.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo much so,\u201d Ingraham added, \u201cthat Barack Obama said he was pleased to see the progress on the Omnibus spending bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not representation on Capitol Hill right now, this is misrepresentation,\u201d Ingraham maintained.\n\nLike many conservatives who view the Republican leadership\u2019s support for the CR-Omnibus bill a betrayal, Ingraham said that their support for it will have electoral consequences in 2016.\n\n\u201cRight now I think the [Republican] leadership is pretty giddy\u2026. they\u2019re drunk with their own power,\u201d Ingraham said.\n\nBut Ingraham cautioned that their elation may be short-lived.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to wish they had our help in two years,\u201d she noted.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment of truth [for both Republicans and conservatives],\u201d Ingraham argued. The question for conservatives, she said, is: \u201d Will you answer their [the Republican leadership\u2019s] call in 2016 when they\u2019re in trouble in some primaries\u2026. when they need the grassroots?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were only about 60 votes so far of Republicans [in the House] who are going to vote against funding the government [with this bad joke of a bill], \u201d Ingraham said. The Republican leadership thinks, she asserted, that, \u201ca couple of years from now, the base is going to forget about this lamest of lame duck sessions.\u201d\n\nBut according to Ingraham, conservatives have good memories.\n\n\u201cWe will not forget the betrayal,\u201d she said, \u201cand there will come a time where you will come calling on us. You will need us to help you. When that day comes, don\u2019t be surprised if many of those rock-ribbed conservatives across the country\u2026. will not answer the call to help you because you\u2019ve beaten them down so badly. You\u2019ve betrayed them so terribly\u2026you\u2019re not going to betray them a third time.\u201d\n\nConservative icon Richard Viguerie is one of many conservatives who agree with Ingraham.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf any Republican member of Congress votes \u2018YES\u2019 on the \u2018CRomnibus,\u2019 then they own everything in the bill, including Social Security for illegal aliens, Obama\u2019s pro-abortion policies, and busting the spending caps,\u201d Viguerie said on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\u201cConservatives must stop giving betrayals such as these a free pass in the Republican primary,\u201d Viguerie added. \u201cAny Republican who votes for the CR \u2013 Omnibus package should be considered a ripe target for a primary challenge,\u201d Viguerie concluded.\n\nIngraham also detailed a few of the more egregious spending components of the bill, which she said includes $1.5 billion to Department of Health and Human Services for refugee and entrance assistance. \u201cThis money,\u201d Ingraham said \u201cwill fund relocation and handling of \u2018border migrants\u2019 through 2017.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Ingraham said the bill includes \u201c$14 million in new funding for the Department of Education, facilitating the relocation of people who should not be in this country.\u201d In effect, Ingraham argued \u201cRepublicans are funding the next border wave.\u201d\n\nAll told, Ingraham said the bill includes \u201c$2.5 billion to accommodate illegal immigrants and refugees.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt some point,\u201d Ingraham noted, \u201cyou do feel like Charlie Brown one more time taking a run at the football\u2026. We go to kick that ball really hard and we land on the ground.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Laura Ingraham Blasts Republican Leadership Over CR-Omnibus Budget Bill", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Laura Ingraham Blasts Republican Leadership Over CR-Omnibus Budget Bill", "title": "Laura Ingraham Blasts Republican Leadership Over CR-Omnibus Budget Bill - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2012/11/27/Ingraham.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/11/laura-ingraham-blasts-republican-leadership-over-cr-omnibus-budget-bill/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Laura Ingraham Blasts Republican Leadership Over CR-Omnibus Budget Bill", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2012/11/27/Ingraham.png", "title": "Laura Ingraham Blasts Republican Leadership Over CR-Omnibus Budget Bill - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, John Boehner, Laura Ingraham,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Laura Ingraham", "published_time": "2014-12-11T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cRight now I think the [Republican] leadership is pretty giddy\u2026.\n\u201cThis is a moment of truth [for both Republicans and conservatives],\u201d Ingraham argued.\nLike many conservatives who view the Republican leadership\u2019s support for the CR-Omnibus bill a betrayal, Ingraham said that their support for it will have electoral consequences in 2016.\nThe Republican leadership thinks, she asserted, that, \u201ca couple of years from now, the base is going to forget about this lamest of lame duck sessions.\u201dBut according to Ingraham, conservatives have good memories.\nWhat happened to the promise we are going to let the American people see what\u2019s in this bill for 48 hours?"}
