Odom is pregnant and has been with the same Ob/Gyn for five years. Her current coverage under Blue Cross California requires she either pay out of pocket or go elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThere were only two clinics in network that would even consider taking me on at 34 weeks,\u201d Odom said.\n\nBlue Cross of Nebraska covers pregnancy after 16 weeks as continuity of care. Other patients have difficult decisions about their care.\n\nHandke said it\u2019s about cutting costs.\n\n\"Anyone in the hospital today will still be treated as in network no matter when they're discharged. After today, they will continue to have in-network benefits. We also have a continuity of care process for people with conditions like cancer, maternity currently pregnant in the second trimester of pregnancy,\u201d Handke said.\n\nCHI said those who live in Nebraska and want to use one of its Iowa facilities, which would still be in the network. There is also no change to the virtual or quick care.\n\nBCBS said it never wanted to push CHI out and will continue to negotiate to see if they can come to an agreement down the road.\n\nRobertson released a statement on the issue.\n\n\"UniNet's negotiations with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Nebraska are nearing the August 31 deadline imposed by Blue Cross,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt that time, your Nebraska-based physicians and hospitals will go out of network when Blue Cross terminates their contract with 15 hospitals and more than 1,000 providers. Since the end of May, UniNet has been negotiating with Blue Cross on a new contract. On August 22, UniNet offered Blue Cross a contract that would offer patients a health plan that works to lower costs by keeping their members healthy and control chronic health conditions. Blue Cross turned down that offer, our fourth full-length proposal, and did not provide a counter offer. They posted UniNet's offer on their website, but only chose to share half of it - they failed to post the portion that included a savings of over $55 million over the next two years. We fundamentally disagree with the way that Blue Cross intends to maintain and lower costs, with no concern for quality. We are absolutely committed to our patients and continue to offer high-quality healthcare to the region. We will work with our patients individually to ensure they can continue seeing their trusted care team, at costs as close to their in-network benefits as possible. If any of our patients have any questions, they can contact us at 888-245-4442.\"", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 01 Sep 2014 09:19:43 CDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Adrian Whitsett", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "CHI Health, formerly Alegent Health, won\u2019t be an in-network provider for Blue Cross Blue Shield policyholders as of midnight.", "title": "No deal: CHI Health goes 'out-of-network' for BCBS Nebraska members", "url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/blue-cross-blue-shield-insurance-carriers-face-questions-come-midnight/27816944", "image": "http://www.ketv.com/image/view/-/27822460/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/469mbd/-/bcbs-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/blue-cross-blue-shield-insurance-carriers-face-questions-come-midnight/27816944", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "ketv://content/article/27816944", "iphone": "ketv://content/article/27816944", "googleplay": "ketv://content/article/27816944"}, "name": {"ipad": "ketv", "iphone": "ketv", "googleplay": "ketv"}, "id": {"ipad": 505254249, "iphone": 505254249, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}}, "site": "@ketv", "card": "app"}, "description": "CHI Health, formerly Alegent Health, won\u2019t be an in-network provider for Blue Cross Blue Shield policyholders as of midnight.", "al": {"android": {"url": "ketv://content/article/27816944", "app_name": "ketv", "package": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}, "ios": {"url": "ketv://content/article/27816944", "app_store_id": 505254249, "app_name": "ketv"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130967633662636}, "keywords": "Blue Cross Blue Shield, CHI Health Creighton University Medical Center, insurance", "google-site-verification": "a0PMTzs25l6fcC16_88mc37ga4Phf53uYiDWwMp4Ois", "news_keywords": "Blue Cross Blue Shield, CHI Health Creighton University Medical Center, insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9a2\"", "article_summary": "CHI Health, formerly Alegent Health, won\u2019t be an in-network provider for Blue Cross Blue Shield policyholders as of midnight.\n\u201cTheir difference in rates is adding $60 million a year to the cost of our members,\u201d said Lee Handke, senior vice president of Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\"UniNet's negotiations with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Nebraska are nearing the August 31 deadline imposed by Blue Cross,\u201d the statement said.\nBCBS said it wanted to bring Nebraska\u2019s largest health network in line with other providers, which sometimes costs 30 percent less than CHI.\nSome, such as Susan Odom, find themselves in the middle of health care confusion."}
