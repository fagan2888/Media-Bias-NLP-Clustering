The president vetoed on Thursday the annual legislation used to authorize defense programs and the pay and benefits for our troops. Unfortunately, this is but the latest manifestation of the Obama Doctrine that emboldens our enemies, undermines our friends and diminishes our country.

He’s upset that the bill would interfere with his insistence on bringing jihadists from Guantanamo Bay into the United States. Congress has repeatedly determined – usually by lopsided, bipartisan majorities – that that would pose an unacceptable risk to the national security.

President Obama also refuses to reverse his hollowing out of the military unless Congress spends more on already bloated non-defense programs.

Mr. Obama may be indifferent to the cumulative impact of the havoc he is wreaking at home and abroad. But Congress cannot be.

It must provide for the common defense and override this veto.
