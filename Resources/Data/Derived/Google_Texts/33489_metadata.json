It has also exposed the doublespeak from the Obama administration, which, out of fear, avoids using the proper language to describe the war we are in and propagates a dangerous myth about the cause of terrorism.\n\nOn Saturday, in the wake of the Paris attacks, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said that his country was engaged in \u201ca war against terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam, against everything that is aimed at breaking fraternity, freedom, solidarity.\u201d Valls had stated what many in the United States government, and some in Congress refuse to acknowledge. This is not a war against terrorists; terrorism is a tactic to achieve a political end, not an end in itself. This is a war against Islamic extremism, representing a fundamentalist, large minority of Muslims worldwide.\n\n\n\n[SEE: 2014: The Year in Cartoons]\n\nThe rise of the Islamic State group proves that Islamic extremists were following their stated goal: They knew that a campaign of terror to achieve conquest would never work. Ultimately they required territory through old-fashioned invasion. This is what the Taliban achieved in Afghanistan prior to their ouster by the United States, and this is what the Islamic State group is attempting in Iraq and Syria. The West is not engaged in counterterrorism in this part of the world, but rather counter invasion. Ultimately the West will be required to use ground troops to remove them, a cost we would not have had to incur had the proper actions, that were advised, taken place in 2013.\n\nThe first fallacy of the Obama administration is to continue to foster the fantasy that the prime strategy for the U.S. is counterterrorism operations, and therefore avoid any declaration of war against the world of Islamic extremism. This is why the administration is so heavily focused on special operations and drone strikes. This is also why there was \u2013 and is \u2013 the massive drawdown in Iraq and Afghanistan. The administration has used every term other than stating that the war is against Islamic extremism \u2013 from the first presidential term\u2019s use of \u201coverseas contingency operations\u201d and \u201cman-caused disasters\u201d to the White House's upcoming \u201cSummit on Countering Violent Extremism.\u201d\n\n\n\n[MORE: Paris Attacks Reveal Extent of Islamist Threat]\n\nIn the end, this is an act of avoidance that does nothing to advance the Western agenda or mollify its enemies. This leads to the second fallacy that Valls inadvertently exposed. The Obama team has adopted a view propagated by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and President Bill Clinton, which argues that American foreign policy actions cause terrorism. The latest push is over the prison at Guantanamo Bay. The case being made to reduce America as a target is that high-level detainees need to be released, even if it is recognized that a good percentage will not only return to assist in extremism, but also return to actual combat against the United States. What is almost laughable is that so many attacks against U.S. forces, personnel, diplomats and people occurred prior to the existence of the Guantanamo prison \u2013 for instance, the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and the 2000 suicide attack on the USS Cole, not to mention the 9/11 attacks themselves. Does anyone seriously believe that if we closed Guantanamo and even left the Middle East, that the Islamic extremists\u2019 movement would be satisfied? What possible reading of anything that the extremists have written or stated would lead any literate person to believe this? It is so fantastical that it reduces truth to an inconvenient fact.\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the Islamic State]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "World Report [Opinion]", "title": "The Obama Administration Must Recognize Islamic Extremism for What It Is", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The Obama administration needs to stop fooling itself when it comes to Islamic extremism.", "title": "This Is War", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2015/01/17/the-obama-administration-must-recognize-islamic-extremism-for-what-it-is", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/da/d6/c65748e4435dac33e19595e36fe6/150114-obama-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The Obama administration needs to stop fooling itself when it comes to Islamic extremism.", "card": "summary", "title": "The Obama Administration Must Recognize Islamic Extremism for What It Is"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Jan. 17, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lamont Colucci,Islam,Islamic State,Guant\u00e1namo Bay,Obama administration,national security,World Report [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Obama administration needs to stop fooling itself when it comes to Islamic extremism."}, "article_summary": "This is a war against Islamic extremism, representing a fundamentalist, large minority of Muslims worldwide.\n[SEE: 2014: The Year in Cartoons]The rise of the Islamic State group proves that Islamic extremists were following their stated goal: They knew that a campaign of terror to achieve conquest would never work.\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the Islamic State]\nThe first fallacy of the Obama administration is to continue to foster the fantasy that the prime strategy for the U.S. is counterterrorism operations, and therefore avoid any declaration of war against the world of Islamic extremism.\nThis is what the Taliban achieved in Afghanistan prior to their ouster by the United States, and this is what the Islamic State group is attempting in Iraq and Syria."}
