Paul Broun has spent $33,000 of his congressional office budget over the last two years on a specialist in rhetorical skills, according to the above clip from Justin Gray of Channel 2 Action News.\n\nThe video focuses on the expenditure of taxpayer dollars. We\u2019ll focus on where the money went \u2013 to Brett O\u2019Donnell, the former Liberty University debate coach was Michele Bachmann\u2019s top aide when she ran for president in 2012. O\u2019Donnell has also served as a debate coach for George W. Bush and Mitt Romney.\n\nBroun\u2019s office identifies O\u2019Donnell as a vetted staffer:\n\n\u201cIn compliance with all House rules, Brett O\u2019Donnell has been a contract member of Congressman Broun\u2019s official communications team since early 2012. He provides training, as he does with several other Members of Congress, with public speaking, on-camera interviews, and media appearances so that Dr. Broun can best communicate his legislative priorities, issues, and message with his constituents. As stated by the House Administration Committee, O\u2019Donnell\u2019s communications training is in compliance with all House rules.\u201d\n\n***\n\nYou\u2019ll have to forgive state Rep. Jason Spencer, R-Woodbine, for believing HB 707, his bill barring state and local officials from supporting Obamacare in any way, had made the final cut during the final meeting of the Senate Rules Committee on Monday.\n\nSen. Judson Hill, R-Marietta, one of the General Assembly\u2019s most vocal Obamacare critics, had successfully moved to include the bill on the rules calendar for Tuesday and Thursday, the last two days of the session.\n\nBut after Spencer and supporters left the committee meeting, Sen. Cecil Staton, R-Macon, who is not running for re-election and thus doesn\u2019t have to worry about having to go through another Republican primary, successelly moved to table the bill, removing it from considerationon a 10-4 vote, according to our AJC colleague James Salzer.\n\nHB 707 could still surface. It has also been attached to a measure that would create an Alzheimer\u2019s registry.\n\nLate Monday, Spencer issued a press release that announced a 2:30 p.m. Tuesday protest at the state Capitol, juiced by this slightly over-the-top passage:\n\n\u201cThat eleventh hour betrayal effectively killed the bill, but it could still be brought back to life by an amendment of companion legislation,\u201d said Rep. Spencer. \u201cTomorrow, I will identify the Republican Benedict Arnolds, the King George the Third and his myrmidons who ship wrecked his path-breaking, patriotic bill (HB 707) to prevent the federal Leviathan from commandeering the machinery of state government or resources to enforce ill-conceived federal health insurance mandates.\u201d\n\nThe hyperventilation extended to tea partyist Debbie Dooley, whose Monday night email blast included this:\n\n\u201cLame-duck Republican Senator Cecil Staton made a motion to table the bill, it was seconded by Democrat Senator Steve Henson. They effectively killed the People\u2019s bill that has already passed the House and has only two legislative days left to become law. Only an uprising by the People can resuscitate it.\u201d\n\n***\n\nSpeaking of slightly over-the-top: For the last few days, Senate Rules Chairman Jeff Mullis has added a self-mocking twist \u2013 pro wrestling-style entrance music \u2014 to the meetings of his all-important committee, which determines the flow of legislation in that chamber. As captured by our AJC colleague Kristina Torres:\n\n***\n\nThe last Georgia politician able to pull off full clan regalia \u2013 that\u2019s clan with a \u201cc,\u201d as in Scottish \u2013 was U.S. Rep. Larry McDonald, who\u2019s been gone more than 30 years now. But the pleated-skirt look doesn\u2019t look bad on Lauren \u201cBubba\u201d McDonald, a GOP member of the Public Service Commission. From Monday\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade in Savannah:\n\n***\n\nThe fond memories of Georgia GOP trailblazer Howard \u201cBo\u201d Callaway keep coming in. State GOP chair John Padgett praised the former House member for planting the seeds that grew the state Republican Party into the powerful force it is today.\n\n\u201cBecause of his sacrifice, a Georgia Republican holds every statewide constitutional office, including governor,\u201d said Padgett.\n\nThat governor, Nathan Deal, declared Wednesday \u201cBo Callaway Day\u201d in Georgia and has ordered flags flown at half-staff. We hear that his wife, Sandra Deal, will be at the funeral Mass, which will be held at noon Wednesday.\n\n\u201cBo stood up for what he believed in even when the odds and the political system were stacked against him,\u201d said Deal. \u201cGeorgians are all the better for it.\u201d\n\n***\n\nJohn McCallum, a Republican running in the coastal First District to replace U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, is up with his first television ad. It talks about the national debt and shows off his family.\n\nThe Newt Gingrich aide from St. Simons Island is one of several Republicans vying for the seat, including state Sen. Buddy Carter (who\u2019s already on the air), state Rep. Jeff Chapman and surgeon Bob Johnson.\n\nThe McCallum campaign would not reveal the size of the buy or where the spot will air.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/03/18/paul-broun-spends-33k-in-office-cash-on-rhetoric-coach/", "image": "http://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/jolttemplate.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "U.S. Rep.
