Rapid City, SD

A Rapid City man sits in jail Monday facing drug possession charges and is considered a suspect in a shooting death of another man.

Rapid City Police responded to a call of an assault at 3319 Maple Grove Avenue shortly after midnight Monday morning. When police arrived, they found 20-year-old Sean Marshall and a deceased male. The victim appeared to have been shot to death.

Marshall was arrested for Possession of a Controlled Substance and Minor Consuming. He is also considered a suspect in the shooting death.

Twenty-year-old Sydney Wilson of Sioux Falls returned to the scene while officers were there, and was also arrested for drug possession and underage consumption.

The victim's name is not being released at this time. The investigation is ongoing, but authorities want to assure the public that this was not a random act of violence, as everyone involved knew each other.
