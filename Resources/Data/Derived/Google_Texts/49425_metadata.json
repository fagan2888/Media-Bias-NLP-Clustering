I think all of our moms have told us that,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cAll these candidates are going to have to account for their own mouths and their own words.\u201d\n\nSo, he warned all candidates to \u201cproceed with caution.\u201d\n\nAnd he addressed concern about the state of the GOP that Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul expressed after former Texas Gov. Rick Perry became the first to abandoned the race on Friday.\n\n\u201cWhat does it say about GOP when a 3 & half term Gov w/ a successful record of creating jobs bows out as a reality star leads in the polls?\u201d tweeted Paul, who is also seeking the nomination.\n\n\u201cIt says we have 17 candidates running and just by attrition you\u2019re going to have people dropping out,\" Priebus said. \"I mean, look, there\u2019s not enough hard cash to go around.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that we\u2019re going to win, and this is just part of the process,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Reince Priebus, resident dad of the Republican party, thinks after all of the scuffle his kids will eventually be okay.", "title": "Priebus: 'Not concerned' about volatile GOP presidential race", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/reince-priebus-2016-gop-presidential-contest-213581", "image": "http://static.politico.com/ca/23/4ef2f4e54d57805bf84b15e3b7ab/150913-reince-priebus-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Reince Priebus, resident dad of the Republican party, thinks after all of the scuffle his kids will eventually be okay.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4b7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOne of the undiscussed issues is just, you know, controlling the debate,\u201d Priebus told host Jake Tapper, referring the CNN GOP presidential debate Wednesday.\nAP Photo Priebus: 'Not concerned' about volatile GOP presidential raceThe chairman of the Republican National Committee believes all the dust will eventually settle in the crowded, volatile race for the GOP presidential nomination and a Republican will be elected president next year.\n\u201cI\u2019m not concerned,\u201d Reince Priebus said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" about the current division between front-runner Donald Trump and the other GOP presidential contenders.\n\u201cIt says we have 17 candidates running and just by attrition you\u2019re going to have people dropping out,\" Priebus said.\nThe Republican National Committee recently got all candidates \u2014 including Trump, who had initially balked \u2014 to pledge not to mount a third-party presidential bid, if they lost the nomination."}
