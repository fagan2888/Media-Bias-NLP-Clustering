Department of Insurance Director Ray Farmer says he doesn\u2019t know if health insurance premiums will cost more next year.\n\nHealth insurance customers in South Carolina may pay higher premiums next year because Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan closed its doors in 2015.\n\nS.C. Department of Insurance Director Ray Farmer explained that the state\u2019s guaranty fund covered $48 million worth of outstanding insurance claims after Consumers\u2019 Choice shut down.\n\n\u201cIt was more than we were expecting,\u201d Farmer said.\n\nThe guaranty fund is paid for by insurance companies operating in South Carolina, he said, and the companies are allowed to pass off those expenses as higher premiums.\n\n\u201cThat $48 million has been paid by the insurance industry,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cUltimately, our taxpayers will foot the bill.\u201d\n\nConsumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan was a health insurance cooperative set up with a $87.8 million federal loan after the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. Other similar insurance cooperatives, also established by the federal health care law, have recently failed, too.\n\nConsumers\u2019 Choice decided in October that it would close.\n\n\u201cWe were told by the company and others that this would be an orderly run-off,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cThe more we got into it, the worse it appeared.\u201d\n\nPatti Embry-Tautenhan, a spokeswoman for BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, would not say if premiums will be more expensive next year.\n\n\u201cThe exit of Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan has created unexpected and unfortunate financial obligations for existing insurers,\u201d Embry-Tautenhan said in a prepared statement, \u201cand represents another example of upheaval in the exchange marketplace, which continues to affect consumers.\u201d\n\nWhile 2017 health insurance premiums may reflect the Consumers\u2019 Choice closure, Farmer said it\u2019s still too soon to know what prices will look like next year.\n\nHealth insurance companies that plan to sell Affordable Care Act policies in South Carolina next year must submit their proposed rates and plans to the Department of Insurance by May 25. Companies selling \u201coff the exchange,\u201d directly to consumers, must submit their plans and rates by July 11.\n\nThe state agency will review those rates and make them public in October, Farmer said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait to see what the filings show,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no way of knowing what rates for 2017 will be at this point.\u201d\n\nSome analysts expect plans sold through HealthCare.gov will likely be more expensive in 2017.\n\nOpen enrollment for 2017 health plans through the federal insurance marketplace begins Nov. 1. More than 200,000 South Carolinians are enrolled in Obamacare policies this year.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Consumers\u2019 Choice closure may affect 2017 health insurance prices, Your Health, \r\nYour HealthFeatures, \r\nFeatures, Affordable Care Act,Consumers' Choice,Department of Insurance,Health insurance,Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Health insurance customers in South Carolina may pay higher premiums next year because Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan closed its doors in 2015.", "title": "Consumers\u2019 Choice closure may affect 2017 health insurance prices", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/20160517/160519545/consumers-choice-closure-may-affect-2017-health-insurance-prices", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160517/PC1211/160519545/AR/0/AR-160519545.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160517/PC1211/160519545/AR/0/AR-160519545.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health insurance customers in South Carolina may pay higher premiums next year because Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan closed its doors in 2015.", "title": "Consumers\u2019 Choice closure may affect 2017 health insurance prices", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160517/PC1211/160519545/AR/0/AR-160519545.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 160519545}}, "keywords": "Consumers\u2019 Choice closure may affect 2017 health insurance prices , Your Health, \r\nYour HealthFeatures, \r\nFeatures, Affordable Care Act,Consumers' Choice,Department of Insurance,Health insurance,Obamacare", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-17T00:01:00Z", "modified_time": "2016-05-16T12:24:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Health insurance customers in South Carolina may pay higher premiums next year because Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan closed its doors in 2015."}, "article_summary": "Health insurance customers in South Carolina may pay higher premiums next year because Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan closed its doors in 2015.\nS.C.
