Who implements this plan?\"\n\nYou have until April 18 to write your up-to-nine-page manifesto on how good we can possibly have it and the map to get there. This isn\u2019t an invitation to write your own Utopia\u2014and it should perhaps be reminded that the word \"utopia\" is in fact a portmanteau meaning \u201cnowhere,\u201d which only later came to mean some impossible ideal. The goal of the FQXi essay contest is something more substantiated, something \u201ctechnically correct and rigorously argued.\u201d\n\nThat said, the judges are going to give twice as much weight to the essay being compelling and interesting than to it being relevant, so it\u2019s easy to see, say, Huxley beating out a drier section of Marx, for instance. Although, as noted, you\u2019ve only got nine pages, so don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in competition with either one. The judging will be done both by a community\u2014everyone who submitted an essay or is an FQXi member\u2014on FQXi\u2019s site as well as by a secret \u201cpanel of experts.\u201d\n\nJust so you know what you can expect to be up against, last year\u2019s essay prompt was \u201cIt From Bit or Bit From It?\u201d and the top prize was won by a Matthew Leifer, who outlined a derivation of noncontexuality within a generalization of probability theory. Leifer has a PhD in quantum information, and, likely due to the prompt, most of the authors who submitted seemed to be working in physics in some capacity.\n\nBut this year\u2019s much broader prompt opens the door for science fiction writers, as well as, would-be science fiction writers, as it isn\u2019t a question that\u2019s easily limited to one field, but rather could be considered \u201cworldbuilding,\u201d something that science fiction author Neal Stephenson argues is \u201csci-fi\u2019s greatest contribution...showing how new technologies function in a web of social and economic systems,\u201d which is pretty much what this prompt calls for. For what it\u2019s worth, Stephenson also says that science fiction is too pessimistic. There is, of course, also a philosophical angle to the whole question of how to steer humanity, a tradition dating back to Plato\u2019s Republic. Plato's solution was a pretty unattractive sounding city-state run by philosopher kings with only marches and flute music to listen to; still, at least it was an ethos.\n\nAnyway, if you\u2019re reading Motherboard, you\u2019re probably mulling over the future often enough that this should really just roll right off your fingertips.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/your-utopian-vision-of-the-future-could-be-worth-10000", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "twitter": "Your Utopian Vision of the Future Could Be Worth $10,000", "description": "Take your chance at playing Plato.", "image": "http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/11975/1399664020458.jpeg", "site": "@motherboard"}, "keywords": "utopias, essays, fxqi, fabulous prizes", "sailthru.locale": "en_us", "sailthru.tags": "utopias, essays, fxqi, fabulous prizes, MB, en_us, mben", "news_keywords": "utopias, essays, fxqi, fabulous prizes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#7974bd", "sailthru.title": "Your Utopian Vision of the Future Could Be Worth $10,000", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-150x150.png?v20160331200908", "thumbnail": "http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/11975/1399664020458.jpeg", "description": "Take your chance at playing Plato.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-02-25", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-310x150.png?v20160331200908", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-70x70.png?v20160331200908", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-310x310.png?v20160331200908", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/favicons/motherboard/mstile-144x144.png?v20160331200908", "sailthru.description": "Take your chance at playing Plato.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Motherboard", "description": "Take your chance at playing Plato.", "title": "Your Utopian Vision of the Future Could Be Worth $10,000", "locale": "en_us", "image": "http://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/11975/1399664020458.jpeg", "url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/your-utopian-vision-of-the-future-could-be-worth-10000", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-18 19:00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.publish_date": "2014-02-18 19:00:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "eac54d01e7a940c4380d0105a2a58912"}, "sailthru.item_type": "article"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5945\"", "article_summary": "For what it\u2019s worth, Stephenson also says that science fiction is too pessimistic.\nThere is, of course, also a philosophical angle to the whole question of how to steer humanity, a tradition dating back to Plato\u2019s Republic.\nAnyway, if you\u2019re reading Motherboard, you\u2019re probably mulling over the future often enough that this should really just roll right off your fingertips.\nAlthough, as noted, you\u2019ve only got nine pages, so don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in competition with either one.\nYou have until April 18 to write your up-to-nine-page manifesto on how good we can possibly have it and the map to get there."}
