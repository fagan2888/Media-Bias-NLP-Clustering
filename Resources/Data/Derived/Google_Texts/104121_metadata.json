Friday afternoon he tweeted about the rally while claiming members of The LDS Church don't like liars and calling out Ted Cruz as such.\n\n\"Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary\" the candidate tweeted.\n\nWatch FOX 13 for live coverage of Trump's event at 7 p.m. The event will also be streamed live on FOX13now.com. FOX 13 News' Max Roth spoke with some of the folks waiting in line Friday afternoon, see the video above for his report.\n\nAfter the jab at Cruz, who will be in Utah for several events on Saturday, Trump set his sights on Romney.
