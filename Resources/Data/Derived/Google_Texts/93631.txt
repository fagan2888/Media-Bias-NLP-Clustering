The Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services claims that Florida Hospital owes the federal government $11.5 million in Medicare overpayments made between January of 2011 and June of 2012, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

The office recommended that the hospital system pay back the funds and strengthen its compliance with Medicare billing processes. According to the Sentinel, Florida Hospital disputes the claims and plans an appeal.
