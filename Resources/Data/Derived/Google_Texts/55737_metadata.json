Brownback, the son of eastern Kansas pig farmers, got his start in politics as state agriculture secretary. He went to the U.S. Congress in 1994, turning one of Kansas\u2019 congressional districts from blue to red and contributing to the first GOP majority in the House in 42 years. Two years later, when Bob Dole ran for president, Brownback won his vacated Senate seat, thanks in no small part to a last-minute $400,000 ad blitz paid for by an organization linked to Wichita\u2019s billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.\n\nThese days, Kansans will tell you, winning candidates come in one of two flavors: conservative and very conservative. Registered Republicans here outnumber Democrats 2 to 1. But Democrats sometimes sneak through in statewide races. Kathleen Sebelius spent six years as governor before her rocky term as secretary of health and human services. The key is convincing voters that the candidate will be a steadier hand on the government till while avoiding confrontations over God, guns or agriculture. Above all, under no circumstances can a candidate allow him- or herself to be identified as liberal.\n\n\u201cI \u2026 I,\u201d Davis stammered, in response during an interview at a hotel conference center in Wichita, then broke into laughter. He collected himself long enough to issue an emphatic no.\n\nWICHITA, Kan. \u2014 Once a long shot, Kansas Democrat Paul Davis\u2019 campaign to unseat this conservative state\u2019s Republican governor, Sam Brownback, has become surprisingly serious. But you can still get a laugh out of Davis on the trail. Just ask if he\u2019s planning to invite President Barack Obama to campaign with him in the Sunflower State.\n\nRather, the most immediate effect of the tax cuts has been the more predictable one: less money for state services. Kansas collected $310 million less in revenue than planned during the April and May tax season. The state\u2019s nonpartisan legislative research division estimated when the tax cuts were passed that the state would collect $4.5 billion less through 2018. To make up for some of the losses, the state government targeted the pocketbooks of low-income consumers, reducing a planned sales tax cut and eliminating tax rebates for items like food, child care, access for the disabled and alternative-fuel equipment.\n\nThen the results started coming in. Unemployment fell, along with the rest of the country\u2019s, as the economy improved from the worst years of the recession \u2014 thanks in part to the federal stimulus . But contrary to Brownback\u2019s promises, Kansas job growth has lagged all its neighboring states\u2019 except Nebraska\u2019s, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Its population has grown at half the national rate.\n\nBrownback told Kansans in 2012 that over five years the new tax policy would create more than 22,000 jobs beyond normal growth and attract more residents. The governor described the effort on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe as a \u201c real, live experiment \u201d; given Brownback\u2019s national ambitions, many wondered if his real goal was expanding his laboratory to include the other 49 states.\n\nBut the biggest thing going for the Democrat is what\u2019s going against Brownback and the rest of Kansas: the condition of the state budget. For the past three years, the governor has carried out an aggressive plan to remake the state economy. Under a plan co-designed and -promoted by the architect of Ronald Reagan\u2019s supply-side economic policy, Arthur Laffer , the Republican-controlled statehouse slashed the top income tax rate by more than a quarter, from 6.45 percent to 4.8 percent. It also created enormous tax loopholes for businesses. By some readings , an executive could avoid paying any tax on profits or salaries by converting a corporation to a limited-liability company, or LLC.\n\nYet Brownback trails Davis in recent statewide polls by as many as 10 points. In part that\u2019s because Davis, the current minority leader in the Kansas House of Representatives, has reached across the aisle, securing the endorsements of more than 100 current and former Republican officials .\n\nAs a senator, Brownback became nationally known for his opposition to abortion, gay rights and gangsta rap . He also helped train the next generation of Washington conservatives. In the 1990s, future vice presidential candidate and GOP budget guru Rep. Paul Ryan served as Brownback\u2019s legislative director. After a failed bid to secure the 2008 GOP presidential nomination , Brownback returned to Kansas in 2010 to win the governorship in a landslide, carrying 103 of the state\u2019s 105 counties. In the race, he outspent his opponent by 406 percent . Many expected him to sail on to a second term and then resume his quest for the presidency.\n\n\u2018Brownback\u2019s cut us pretty hard on the financial and the educational funding, and what he\u2019s done to the teachers is just disgusting.\u2019\n\nStill, the governor\u2019s campaign remains relentlessly positive. \u201cThe sun is shining in Kansas, and don\u2019t let anyone tell you any different,\u201d Brownback says in one ad. And he has reasons to be confident, at least where his prospects are concerned.\n\n\u201cBrownback\u2019s cut us pretty hard on the financial and the educational funding, and what he\u2019s done to the teachers is just disgusting,\u201d said Clyde Taverner, a Davis supporter from Wichita whose wife is a retired high school language-arts teacher.\n\nBut many Kansans don\u2019t feel that state services are up to par. By far, the most politically damaging problems for Brownback have been in education. Public schools, which educate 95 percent of Kansas schoolchildren, have seen their budgets shrink, contributing to school closings and stoking anger across the state. Earlier this year, the courts stepped in to order the legislature to provide the needed funds.\n\nBrownback\u2019s campaign defends the falling revenue. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you cut taxes,\u201d spokesman John Milburn said at one of the governor\u2019s campaign stops in the capital, Topeka. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re able to provide those services \u2014 which we are \u2014 that\u2019s good governance.\u201d The governor\u2019s plan is still for the income tax rate to ultimately fall to zero, he said.\n\nOne potential problem for the Democrat: Three months out from the election, many Kansans still don\u2019t know who he is. In a Rasmussen poll released Aug. 12, which gave Davis his biggest lead over Brownback, 1 in 5 surveyed voters didn\u2019t recognize Davis\u2019 name.\n\nIt can be tough on the trail too. When Davis and his wife, Stephanie, arrived at the Wichita hotel for his dinner speech to donors, a hotel worker at the entrance politely inquired if they were there to attend the event.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t actually know who Brownback\u2019s competition is,\u201d admitted Jose Wheeler, an African-American maintenance engineer from Wichita who said he usually votes for Democrats. The father of five has, on the other hand, seen some appealing Brownback ads in which the governor defends his management of state finances \u2014 including a claim that the state\u2019s bank account was all but empty when he took office. (That claim has been widely discredited.)\n\nDavis appears to be betting that relative anonymity will help his prospects, perhaps thinking that an anyone-but-Brownback vote will be his best chance. But that risks ceding his image to the governor\u2019s team, which is taking every opportunity to introduce voters to the challenger on their own terms. \u201cDon\u2019t delegate Kansas to an Obama liberal,\u201d an ad from the Republican Governors Association implores. Brownback supporters are also making hay of the fact that Davis hails from Lawrence, home to the University of Kansas, in one of the two counties in the state that Brownback failed to win in 2010. (The other holdout, Wyandotte, is a nearby Kansas City suburb home to a quarter of the state\u2019s African-American population. Those two counties were also the only ones Obama carried in 2012.)\n\nFor many Kansans, distrust of the \u201cliberal lawyer from Lawrence,\u201d as the Brownback campaign repeatedly calls Davis, is almost second nature. At a Wichita car show, the crowd resting in the shade of the Christian Motorcyclists Association booth laughed at the mention of Brownback\u2019s opposition. \u201cI\u2019m for Second Amendment rights, so you can guess who I\u2019m for,\u201d said Dennis, a burly white biker who would give only his first name. (Davis has affirmed his support for gun ownership but has voted against some measures, including one that Brownback signed into law last year that allows concealed handguns to be carried in schools and the state capitol.) Some of Dennis\u2019 fellow biker-missionaries were less enthusiastic \u2014 one, a state employee, noted she hadn\u2019t had a raise in six years. But Dennis was certain the governor could not lose. All he needed to know about Davis, the biker said, was that \u201che\u2019s going to tax us to death.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s Davis\u2019 biggest problem in a nutshell. Kansans may not like the effects of the tax cuts, but they don\u2019t like taxes either. It seems that if voters suspect Davis will tackle the shortfalls by raising income tax rates, then he will be identified as a liberal and lose.\n\nSo Davis is doing everything he can to fight that impression. \u201cWe\u2019re not proposing to raise taxes. We\u2019re proposing to freeze the rates,\u201d he insisted in an interview with Al Jazeera America. Asked if he would reverse Brownback\u2019s much criticized privatization of the state Medicaid system (the doling out of those contracts is reportedly under investigation by the FBI), Davis \u2014 who worked under Sebelius at the state insurance commissioner\u2019s office more than a decade ago \u2014 demurred, saying only that as governor he would review the program.\n\nDavis endorses expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (which Brownback has opposed). But he was quick to call the ACA rollout \u2014 which cost Sebelius her cabinet post \u2014 \u201ca disaster.\u201d As \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d echoed out of the adjoining conference room where he was about to speak, Davis made it clear that he knew what kind of voters he had to court. \u201cPeople are just not seeing the governor\u2019s priorities as reflective of what their priorities are,\u201d he explained. \u201cKansans are conservative by nature.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to reflect that the FBI is reportedly examining contracts with the state Medicaid program, not Medicare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
