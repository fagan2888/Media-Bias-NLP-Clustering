Republicans have scheduled a trio of hearings this morning all related to the security of HealthCare.gov: CMS official Gary Cohen will testify before Energy and Commerce ( http://1.usa.gov/1aZYNLX)....CMS CIO Teresa Fryer and HHS CISO Kevin Charest will sit before House Oversight at the same time ( http://1.usa.gov/JVZ7Vm)....and four private-sector executives will testify to the Science, Space and Technology Committee ( http://1.usa.gov/1d8lNf9). And, of course, the House has scheduled a vote on Rep. Lee Terry\u2019s bill requiring weekly insurance exchange updates, after postponing it last week.\n\nSpeaking of House Oversight, Chairman Darrell Issa says HHS tried last-minute yesterday to schedule a long-promised classified briefing for committee members at 8:15 this morning \u2014 about an hour before their hearing is scheduled to begin. The briefing, Issa says, was supposed to have been held last week. He sent a rather irate letter to HHS Secretary Sebelius last night: http://politico.pro/1b4yR1T\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n--HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters responded by saying \u201cwe regret the chairman\u2019s schedule did not allow for a briefing\u2026but look forward to continuing to work with his office to set up this briefing.\u201d She said officials have told Issa in various letters that they would work to schedule a briefing \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCUMMINGS WANTS SECURITY PROTOCOL \u2014 Maybe Issa and ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings need to go to couples therapy. They\u2019ve been at odds for months over documents related to the security of HealthCare.gov and in the latest development Cummings wants the committee to adopt protocol to ensure sensitive information is kept safe. In a letter to Issa, he highlighted fears from security contractors that public access to material could compromise the site. The letter: http://1.usa.gov/1d6v8Eb\n\nHOUSE JUDICIARY APPROVES ABORTION BAN \u2014 Committee Republicans advanced legislation yesterday that would ban insurance subsidies from being used to buy plans that cover abortion on the exchanges \u2014 their second try at inserting the language of the so-called Stupak amendment into Obamacare. Women can currently use their subsidies to buy plans that cover abortion, but must pay an extra fee that is supposed to fund the actual abortion services. The bill approved yesterday would prohibit them from using subsidies to buy the plans, period. To say Democrats were upset would be an understatement. The Pro story: http://politico.pro/1m7VEzb\n\nGood Thursday morning, PULSE readers. It\u2019s a great day because Congress is making me feel unusually competent. After receiving a million press releases yesterday with the headline \u201cRepresentative so-and-so voted to fund the government,\u201d I think I\u2019ll tweet things like \u201cPaige managed to brush her teeth\u201d or \u201cPaige got out of bed this morning.\u201d Follow me: @pw_cunningham.\n\n\u201cAnd now I need to know is this real love, or is it just PULSE keeping us afloat?\u201d\n\nMARK YOUR OBAMACARE CALENDAR \u2014 It\u2019s hard to keep track of all the moving Obamacare deadlines, so Pro\u2019s Kyle Cheney and Brett Norman have got you covered. \u201cTangled Obamacare due dates got even messier this week as the deadline for February enrollment came Wednesday and more payment deadlines for January coverage were pushed toward the end of the month. But clarity is at least on the horizon for one critical detail: the true number of people who have signed up and then paid their first premiums. Next Tuesday, insurers are due to disclose to CMS how many of the people who signed up for their plans actually sent in checks for that initial premium,\u201d they write. http://politico.pro/1eTtx4a\n\n--As the deadlines come and go, administration officials say customers are still flocking to HealthCare.gov, which drew nearly 600,000 visitors on Monday. The 2014 enrollment season is still set to end March 31 \u2014 at least for now.\n\nSEN.WYDEN INTRODUCES BISPARTISAN CHRONIC CARE BILL \u2014 The legislation would create a voluntary program for Medicare providers where they\u2019d be awarded for better health outcomes and could to use incentives to motivate patients. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)\u2014who\u2019s likely to take over the Finance Committee soon \u2014 introduced it, along with Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and some House members. They rolled it out yesterday about the same time your health team was running around like chickens with our heads cut off, but hey, we still got you covered: http://politico.pro/1hsy3sA\n\nTEXAS\u2019 RESTRICTIONS ON NAVIGATORS has the state\u2019s congressional Democratic caucus really upset, and members are asking Attorney General Eric Holder to intervene. Rules being written by Texas Department of Insurance would require navigators to receive more training than mandated by federal law and pay training fees of up to $800. The caucus wants the DOJ to take legal action to block the rules. \u201cThe state of Texas\u2026they\u2019re on the federal exchange, so these insurance guidelines are interfering with a federal exchange that is governed by federal law,\u201d Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said at a presser yesterday. The letter: http://politico.pro/1gMFDNR\n\nLAWSUIT OVER MARLISE MUNOZ \u2014 It\u2019s been two months since a pregnant Texas woman was pronounced brain dead but kept on respirators to keep her fetus alive. Her husband \u2014 who wants her removed from life support \u2014 filed a lawsuit this week against hospital officials who say following his wishes would require them to violate a state law preventing them from withholding life-sustaining treatment from a pregnant patient. The fetus is now in his or her 21 st week. The New York Times story: http://nyti.ms/1eEgKCf\n\nKINGSDALE BLAMES PUBLIC MISMANAGEMENT \u2014 Stop blaming private-sector contractors for the high-profile flameout of HealthCare.gov and some of the state-run exchanges, prominent Obamacare backer Jon Kingsdale writes in The New England Journal of Medicine. Kingsdale, who led the development of Massachusetts\u2019 insurance exchange, said ACA supporters need to place a lot more of the blame on government that didn\u2019t do its job well. http://politico.pro/1dRx0OB\n\nCheck out the inaugural edition of Capital Health Care, an early-morning email full of scoops and storylines that will inform the daily conversation in New York among health-industry insiders and high-information consumers.

While the agency didn\u2019t guarantee every request would be filled, promising to weigh each one against privacy concerns, the decision has the American Medical Association worried. Disclosures could \u201cunfairly\u201d impact physicians and doctors, said AMA President Ardis Dee Hoven, who urged HHS to only release information for the purpose of improving health care services. Modern Healthcare has the story: http://bit.ly/1dRqwzh\n\nCAFFEINE REPORT COMING FRIDAY \u2014 A hotly-anticipated Institute of Medicine report on the potential health hazards of caffeine consumption is expected to be released Friday, our colleagues over at Pro Agriculture hear. FDA officials have said the report will help inform the agency\u2019s policy and regulatory options going forward.\n\nHEALTH STAFFER SHIFTS \u2014 PULSE learned last night that Monica Popp is moving over to Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn\u2019s office next week, leaving the House Energy and Commerce Committee where she handles Medicaid and Medicare Advantage issues. Josh Trent, longtime health policy advisor to Sen. Tom Coburn, will take over her portfolio at E&C next month.\n\nMOVING ON \u2014 Keith Fontenot is joining Hooper, Lundy & Bookman, PC, where he\u2019ll serve in government relations.

Three committees have already approved slightly different versions. \u201cCongress has a rare opportunity not only to get rid of SGR once and for all, but also to enact bipartisan reforms that will support physicians who improve their delivery of care,\u201d the group wrote. The letter: http://politico.pro/1gNjxej\n\nALL THOSE OBAMACARE RULES \u2014 Those hundreds of pages of rules governing the Affordable Care Act that the administration regularly issues have sort of become the bane of your Pro Health team\u2019s existence. At least the Congressional Research Service has put together a report on the major rules to look for this year and how to keep track of them: http://politico.pro/1aqlRGV\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE READING, By Jennifer Haberkorn:\n\nTennessee state officials are considering a law that would bar state and local governments \u2014 and potentially businesses that do business with them \u2014 from buying health insurance on the exchange, The Tennessean and USA Today report. http://usat.ly/LgUZ3k\n\nIncoming Finance Chairman Ron Wyden tells The Washington Post that the atmosphere around his new post is \"frenzied.\" \u201cIt's a little bit like when [former energy committee chairman] Jeff Bingaman retired and everyone said: \u2018Please announce your energy agenda,'\" he said. http://wapo.st/1aKNH1h\n\nSome employers are finding they can keep selling \"mini med\" plans under the health law as long as they continue to offer a plan that complies with the health law, the Wall Street Journal reports. http://on.wsj.com/1a8RmYC\n\nWellpoint CEO Joe Swedish tells Sarah Kliff at The Post that he believes the health law will \"work out\" over time. http://wapo.st/1eLw7ez\n\nWalter Reed Medical Center is trying to chase down an unknown patient who, because of an error, was told she or he was HIV negative when the patient was actually HIV positive, The New York Times reports. http://nyti.ms/1m8j4En\n\nAmericans for Prosperity began its Montana anti-Obamacare ad blitz on Wednesday, the Billings Gazette reports. http://bit.ly/1fAhzRI\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): While approximately 80 percent of prescription drugs dispensed are generic drugs, the reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a mystery to pharmacists and patients. The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
