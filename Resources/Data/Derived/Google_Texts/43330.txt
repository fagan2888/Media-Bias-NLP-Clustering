On Sunday, December 1st, a terrifying train wreck in the Bronx killed four passengers and injured dozens of others.

Traditionally, in times of national tragedy or natural disaster, politicians are civil enough to curb their overheated rhetoric and tortured metaphors. Not so the five Republican politicians below – including House Speaker John Boehner and 2016 contender Sen. John Thune of South Dakota – who took little notice of the death and destruction caused by the Metro-North derailment in New York and persisted in utilizing the obnoxious hashtag #trainwreck in their criticism of the president's signature healthcare initiative.
