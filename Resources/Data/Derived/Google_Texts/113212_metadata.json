They expect television ad spending to double in the next year and a half as people start to enroll for coverage and the health law remains a top political issue in House, Senate and gubernatorial races in 2014.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat will put ad spending close to the $1 billion mark, Kantar Media projects. And that\u2019s just television \u2014 print and online will boost it even higher.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\nOne reason for the big bucks is there are so many different kinds of stakeholders in the Obamacare fight. It\u2019s not just ideological proponents and opponents battling over messaging with an eye on 2014 voters. Some of the ads are from state and federal governments trying to clear up confusion and get people to enroll in the health insurance exchanges that go live Tuesday. And some are from health insurers and other commercial groups that have a stake in getting people \u2014 potential clients \u2014 to get covered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unprecedented what we\u2019re going to see,\u201d said Dhavan Shah, director of the Mass Communication Research Center at the University of Wisconsin. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be vast amounts of spending to get people inside [the exchanges], \u2026 but you\u2019ve got tremendous political opposition on the right. It cuts both ways.\u201d\n\nStates, insurers and the federal government are all joining the battle playing out over the airwaves and cyberspace to control what people hear about the health care law as the six-month open enrollment season starts. The online ads play a double role; they can both message and, with a simple click, take people directly to the exchange sign-up portals.\n\n( QUIZ: How well do you know Obamacare news?)\n\nAnd politically, both sides are going to try to seize control of the message. There is probably going to be a lot of state-to-state variation on how well the rollout and the first year of health coverage goes \u2014 and part of that will reflect decisions that governors and legislatures have made about whether to run an exchange or have the feds do it and whether to expand Medicaid or leave some of the poorest people in the state uncovered. And that will become campaign fodder.\n\nWith 36 governors races plus a bunch of competitive House and Senate seats for which the health law will be a front-and-center factor, the ad wars will be big and bitter.\n\nNearly a half-billion dollars has been spent on Obamacare-themed advertising since the law passed three and a half years ago. Most of that was for critical ads from the National Republican Congressional Committee, Crossroads GPS and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, according to an analysis by Kantar Media. The Department of Health and Human Services was the only major advertiser on the advocate side, spending nearly $80 million.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: As government shutdown looms, Obamacare exchanges still set for launch)\n\nBut Kantar projects that spending to reach $1 billion by March 2015, the law\u2019s fifth anniversary.\n\nWhere that money gets spent will be determined by the competitiveness of states\u2019 House and Senate races, whether state officials have welcomed the law\u2019s provisions and how many residents stand to benefit from it.\n\n\u201cRepublicans will get Democrats on it; you could have Democrats advertising on it depending on where they are,\u201d said Elizabeth Wilner, vice president of Kantar\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. \u201cThen you overlay that with states that are home to high proportions of uninsured people.\u201d\n\nMedicare and Medicaid are the most comparable to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 but little data exists on how much advertising they generated. And neither program invoked near the level of friction surrounding the health care law. Plus, political culture was different decades before Twitter, cable, the Drudge Report and HuffPo.\n\nRepublicans in Washington may not stop trying to defund, delay or dismantle Obamacare, but the arguments may change after the sign-up starts. Even the president says he expects \u201chiccups\u201d and glitches.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "One reason: There are so many different kinds of players in the Obamacare fight", "title": "Stakeholders spend big on ACA ads", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/stakeholders-ads-obamacare-aca-2014-97588.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/09/29/130929_obamacare_talking_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Campaign Ads (78),Obamacare (544),Affordable Care Act (453),Advertisements (274)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "One reason: There are so many different kinds of players in the Obamacare fight", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Politically, both sides are going to try to seize control of the message | AP Photos Stakeholders spend big on ACA adsIf you think you\u2019re seeing a lot of Obamacare ads right now, just wait until 2014.\nStory Continued BelowThat will put ad spending close to the $1 billion mark, Kantar Media projects.\nAnd neither program invoked near the level of friction surrounding the health care law.\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)One reason for the big bucks is there are so many different kinds of stakeholders in the Obamacare fight.\nWith 36 governors races plus a bunch of competitive House and Senate seats for which the health law will be a front-and-center factor, the ad wars will be big and bitter."}
