By 2013, his second location opened on Peach Orchard Road in south Augusta, and he\u2019s now building his third multimillion dollar facility, set to open at 2851 Washington Road in May.\n\n\u201cOld magazines in the waiting room and a long wait were just things people put up with because that\u2019s what you had to do,\u201d said Newton, an emergency care physician. \u201cWe saw that there was an opportunity to serve people in a way that could be done in a more efficient setting.\u201d\n\nNow, fueled by the Affordable Care Act adding millions of newly-insured people to the market and creating high-deductible coverage plans, Newton sees a bright future for the urgent-care industry.\n\nIn the past year, patient visits in Newton\u2019s two offices have increased by 40 percent to about 700 patients each week, and that has required him to hire more staff, he said.\n\nAccording to the Urgent Care Association of America, 83 percent of urgent care facilities experienced growth in 2013, while about 40 percent noted an increase in the number of patient visits and 60 percent reported adding locations, services or space to accommodate growth.\n\nCurrently, there are more than 6,400 urgent-care locations nationwide.\n\nThough growth in the sector has spiked in the past few years, urgent care got its start, albeit slowly, in the late 1970s and started picking up steam in the 1990s as a viable place to get medical care for patients unable to see their regular physician.\n\nIn recent years, the industry\u2019s growth has been led by patients\u2019 finding it difficult to get primary care, emergency room wait times and overcrowding as well as physicians acting on these needs by opening prompt-care centers in their communities, according to the Urgent Care Association.\n\nThe trade group said private equity firms now see urgent care as a viable business model.\n\nAs health care coverage enrollment continues, states with higher levels of uninsured people, such as Georgia, Texas and California, will likely see more urgent-care activity because of the influx of new patients seeking medical care, said Tine Hansen-Turton, executive director of the Philadelphia-based Convenient Care Association.\n\nThe overall market, she said, remains attractive to hospitals, private physicians and investment groups.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of options now, so it\u2019s a very interesting time in terms of how we are changing health care in this country,\u201d Hansen-Turton said. \u201cI think it\u2019s good from a consumer perspective. It\u2019s very consumer driven.\u201d\n\nUniversity Hospital has been on the front end of the trend. In 1992, the health care system opened its first Prompt Care in Columbia County, later moving the center to Evans in 1994. Also in 1994, University added a Prompt Care in south Augusta that has since morphed into a Primary Care facility.\n\nUniversity is still in growth mode, having added a Prompt Care in Grovetown last year and opening more locations across North Augusta and Aiken later this year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not inexpensive (to build) and they\u2019re not inexpensive to staff, but they\u2019ve been very successful,\u201d said University CEO Jim Davis. \u201cPeople are looking for high-quality care that\u2019s affordable and easily accessible with no appointments. There is a shortage of primary care physicians out there in the market and getting in to (see) one can sometimes be a challenge.\u201d\n\nEach week, about 450 patients file into the two University Prompt Care locations, which average 15-minute wait times, Davis said.\n\nBoth operations run by University Hospital and Newton provide physician oversight, and, equipped with X-ray and lab services, can treat a host of illnesses and injuries that are not life-threatening. Each also gives patients the option of making an online appointment shortly before arrival to ensure a short wait.\n\n\u201cPeople are used to getting things quickly with the Internet,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYou can really move at the speed of light nowadays, and I think people are seeking that in their health care as well.\u201d\n\nThe format also has been picked up in recent years by drugstore chains and big-box retailers that now offer limited-service retail clinics across store locations. These are staffed by nurse practitioners or physician assistants.\n\nCVS introduced Min\u00aduteClinic in 2000 and it is now found in more than 800 stores, with 150 additional locations on the way this year. Walgreens started its Healthcare Clinic in 2006 and has more than 400 sites today. National chains such as Kroger, Target and Wal-Mart also have rolled out with their own walk-in clinic prototypes.\n\nAccording to the Conven\u00adient Care Association, there were more than 1,600 retail health clinics located in high-traffic areas in 2013. By 2016, the national trade organization expects that number to nearly double to 3,000.\n\n\u201cUrgent care, minute clinics and so-called docs-in-a-box are an interesting phenomenon,\u201d said Glenn Landers, associate project director of the Georgia Health Policy Center at Georgia State University, who attributed their rise to strong consumer demand, despite new forms of health care payment threatening their success.\n\n\u201cIndividuals want care when it is convenient for them, in accessible locations, and at lower costs than traditional providers have been able to deliver care,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a boon to working families. And, they might support greater utilization of preventive services. For example, more people might get flu, pneumonia and shingles vaccines if they are available at the local urgent care clinic than if they were not.\u201d\n\nLocally, Newton still sees room for business expansion. In the next two years, he plans to add one or two more MedNow locations and is currently looking in the Grovetown area.\n\nBoth he and Hansen-Turton named telehealth \u2013 a way of using technology to provide medical service to those in remote or rural areas who might not have access to traditional forms of health care \u2013 as the next wave for convenient-care providers.\n\nNewton said he is already considering how best to reach nearby communities such as Waynesboro and Millen, both in Georgia, that likely cannot support a fully-staffed health center but could be connected to a physician via one of his main centers in the Augusta area.\n\n\u201cWe want to be wise about how we expand,\u201d Newton said, \u201cbut there seems to be clearly enough demand.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "Dr. Mark Newton saw a missing link in Augusta's health-care market and the business opportunity it presented.&nbsp;To fill the niche, in 2009 Newton opened his first physician-staffed MedNow Prompt Care in Evans.&nbsp;", "title": "Patients seeking prompt care are fueling industry", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/business/local-business/2015-03-14/patients-seeking-prompt-care-are-fueling-industry", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/14202364.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c5f\"", "article_summary": "In 1992, the health care system opened its first Prompt Care in Columbia County, later moving the center to Evans in 1994.\nAlso in 1994, University added a Prompt Care in south Augusta that has since morphed into a Primary Care facility.\nTo fill the niche, in 2009 Newton opened his first physician-staffed MedNow Prompt Care on North Belair Road in Evans.\nThe trade group said private equity firms now see urgent care as a viable business model.\nAs health care coverage enrollment continues, states with higher levels of uninsured people, such as Georgia, Texas and California, will likely see more urgent-care activity because of the influx of new patients seeking medical care, said Tine Hansen-Turton, executive director of the Philadelphia-based Convenient Care Association."}
