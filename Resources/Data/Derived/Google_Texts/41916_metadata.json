Did that company receive a no-bid contract to build the HealthCare.gov website?\n\nA: Toni Townes-Whitley, a senior vice president at CGI, and Obama graduated from Princeton University in 1985. However, company and government officials say the contract was awarded through a competitive bidding process.\n\nFULL QUESTION\n\nWas CGI the sole bidder on the Obamacare website? Was Toni Townes-Whitley, senior vice president at CGI Federal, the classmate of Michelle Obama at Princeton (class of 1985) and are both members of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni? Did CGI donate $47 million to the Obama campaigns?\n\nFULL ANSWER\n\nAn email forwarded to FactCheck.org several times claims that \u201cFirst Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s Princeton classmate is a top executive at the company that earned the contract to build the failed Obamacare website.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s actually the lead sentence of an Oct. 25 Daily Caller article linking the Obama administration and CGI Federal, the tech firm hired by the administration to build HealthCare.gov.\n\nThat same Daily Caller article said CGI Federal \u201cearned the no-bid contract to build the $678 million Obamacare enrollment website at HealthCare.gov.\u201d\n\nToni Townes-Whitley \u2014 the executive named in the article \u2014 is a senior vice president with CGI Federal. And she graduated from Princeton University in 1985 \u2014 the same year as Michelle Obama.\n\nBut the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services dispute the claim that CGI Federal received a \u201cno-bid\u201d contract. A spokeswoman for the agency said that four companies, including CGI Federal, submitted proposals to build the marketplace website.\n\nPrinceton Connection\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s true that Townes-Whitley works for CGI Federal. She joined the company in May 2010, and is senior vice president of the Civilian Agency Programs Business Unit, according to the CGI website. In her current role, she oversees services to 22 U.S. federal civilian agencies and is \u201cresponsible for sales, client relationships, P&L and member management for CAP\u2019s 1,850+ members across the U.S. and 34 countries internationally.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also true that she and Michelle Obama graduated from Princeton University in 1985, and both are members of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni, according to the alumni group\u2019s website.\n\nObama studied sociology and African-American studies at Princeton, and Townes-Whitley studied economics and public policy at the university\u2019s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. The women belonged to some of the same student groups as well.\n\nObama, then Michelle Robinson, participated in the Organization of Black Unity and the Third World Center, according to a Boston Globe article. And an out-of-date LinkedIn page for Townes-Whitley \u2014 before she began working for CGI Federal \u2014 lists those same groups among her \u201cactivities and societies\u201d while in school.\n\nIn addition, White House visitor records show that Townes-Whitley attended meetings at the White House at least four times between 2010 and 2013. According to the records, she met with Vivek Kundra, former White House chief information officer, in 2010; Danny Werfel, former controller of the Office of Management and Budget, in 2011 and 2013; and Jonathan McBride, assistant to the president and director of presidential personnel, in 2013. The 2010 meeting was described as a forum on IT management reform, according to the records. No description was given for the other meetings.\n\nTownes-Whitley also attended a White House holiday party in 2010. A photo on her Facebook page shows her and her husband, John Whitley, posing with the president and first lady.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know is whether any of those details means that Townes-Whitley had anything to do with CGI Federal receiving a federal contract to work on the HealthCare.gov website as the email could lead readers to believe. That claim isn\u2019t made directly in the Daily Caller article, and the emails it has spawned provide no other information directly linking her to the work order.\n\nWe contacted the first lady\u2019s press office to see if the women knew one another while in school or if they are in contact now. But we didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nHowever, a company official for CGI denied that Townes-Whitley had any role in securing the contract.\n\n\u201cMs. Townes-Whitley is not currently and has never been responsible for the CMS contract as a CGI employee,\u201d said Linda Odorisio, CGI vice president of global communications, in an email to FactCheck.org. \u201cShe also was not involved in CGI business development, proposal development or client meetings related to the CMS FFM program (Healthcare.gov).\u201d\n\nOdorisio said that Townes-Whitley has communicated directly with Michelle Obama on two occasions while working for CGI Federal, both times during social events at the White House attended by hundreds of guests.\n\n\u201cThere was NO DISCUSSION OF CGI\u201d during either conversation, Odorisio wrote. (Capitalizations are her own.)\n\nThe CGI Contract\n\nA portion of the Oct. 25 Daily Caller article that is being forwarded widely in an email claims that CGI Federal \u201cearned the no-bid contract to build the $678 million Obamacare enrollment website at HealthCare.gov.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller got that bit of information from an Oct. 13 report in the Washington Examiner that said \u201cFederal officials considered only one firm to design the Obamacare health insurance exchange website that has performed abysmally since its Oct. 1 debut.\u201d\n\nA portion of that Examiner article also appears as the lead in another chain email going around online.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the CMS did not accept bids from all comers to build the HealthCare.gov website. A Bloomberg report said the administration used an \u201cexpedited bidding system\u201d that limited its choices to just a select few.\n\nBut officials for CGI Federal and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services say it\u2019s not accurate that CGI Federal was the only firm considered for the job.\n\nIn congressional testimony, Cheryl Campbell, a CGI Federal senior vice president, said that the firm received the contract to build the site \u201cthrough a two-step competitive process\u201d that began back in 2007.\n\nCampbell, Oct. 24: CGI Federal obtained the [Federal Facilitated Marketplace] contract through a two-step competitive process. In 2007, through full and open competition, CGI Federal was awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for Enterprise Systems Development (ESD) along with 16 other industry competitors. In 2011, CMS conducted a competition for the FFM cost-reimbursement task order among the ESD contract holders. Of the four bids submitted, CGI Federal was selected by CMS as the \u201cbest value\u201d to the government.\n\nA CMS spokeswoman told FactCheck.org the same thing via email.\n\n\u201cCGI did not receive any sole source awards,\u201d she said. \u201cThey competed for the work on our multiple award contract.\u201d\n\nThe spokeswoman said the competition to build HealthCare.gov was open to the 16 contractors that had been awarded an ID/IQ contract through the process Campbell outlined in her testimony, and, thus, were pre-approved for subsequent task orders.\n\nFour of the 16 companies submitted proposals for the work order to build the marketplace website, the spokeswoman said. Those four were: Quality Software Services Inc., IBM, Computer Science Corporation and CGI Federal.\n\nWe reached out to QSSI, IBM and CSC to confirm that they submitted proposals. CSC referred us to CMS, and we did not hear back from IBM or QSSI.\n\nCGI announced in December 2011, that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight had awarded CGI Federal with an estimated $93.7 million contract to build the website for the federal health insurance exchanges. A press release said that the contract value was \u201cover a two-year base with three, one-year option periods.\u201d\n\nMore than that has been spent already, though.\n\nAt an Oct. 30 congressional hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said a total of $174 million had been spent as of August, including \u201c$118 million on the website itself, and about $56 million has been expended on other IT to support the web.\u201d Sebelius said $197 million had been obligated to CGI Federal through March 2014. That figure is confirmed by government records available at USASpending.gov.\n\nIn addition, CMS communications director Julie Bataille, in a Nov. 1 conference call with reporters, said the total budget for the website project was \u201cin the neighborhood of $630 million.\u201d The CMS spokeswoman told us that amount includes contracts for the HealthCare.gov website, the data services hub that supports the state and federal exchanges and other system hardware.\n\nCampaign Donations\n\nAnother email making the rounds suggests that CGI campaign donations played a role. It says CGI contributed $47 million to President Obama\u2019s campaign and that company executives were \u201clarge campaign bundlers\u201d for the president.\n\nBut the $47 million figure is bogus, and we found no evidence that company executives raised large amounts of money for the president.\n\nCGI\u2019s political action committee \u2014 CGI Technologies and Solutions Inc. PAC \u2014 contributed $128,500 to federal candidates in 2012, according to the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 contribution records. And the majority of that amount, 52 percent, went to Republican candidates. The PAC also contributed $21,000 to federal candidates in 2008, with 67 percent going to Democratic candidates. But Obama didn\u2019t receive contributions from the PAC in either year.\n\nCGI employees, however, have contributed directly to the president before.\n\nTownes-Whitley contributed $1,500 to President Obama\u2019s reelection campaign between 2011 and 2012. CGI President George Schindler donated $1,000 to the campaign also. But Schindler gave $1,000 to Obama\u2019s Republican challenger Mitt Romney as well.\n\nOverall, individuals working for CGI contributed just $27,055 to federal candidates in 2012, according to CRP, and almost 58 percent of that amount went to Republicans.\n\nWe also found no evidence that CGI executives were big bundlers for Obama.\n\nIn 2008 and 2012, the Obama campaign disclosed individuals who raised more than $50,000 for the campaign. None of the \u201cexecutive officers and senior leaders\u201d currently listed on CGI\u2019s U.S. management team or CGI Federal\u2019s management team pages are listed as major bundlers for Obama\u2019s 2008 or 2012 campaigns.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is no evidence that Townes-Whitley\u2019s connection to the first lady, or CGI\u2019s campaign contributions, had anything to do with the contract being awarded to CGI Federal as viral emails suggest.\n\nCompany and government officials say the contract was awarded through a competitive \u2014 yet limited \u2014 process, and that Townes-Whitley was not involved.\n\nIf any evidence to the contrary does surface, we will update this item accordingly.\n\n\u2014 D\u2019Angelo Gore\n\nSources\n\nHowley, Patrick. \u201cMichelle Obama\u2019s Princeton classmate is executive at company that built Obamacare website.\u201d Daily Caller. 25 Oct 2013.\n\nJacobs, Sally. \u201cLearning to be Michelle Obama.\u201d Boston Globe. 15 Jun 2008.\n\nWhite House.
