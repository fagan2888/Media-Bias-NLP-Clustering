But after a joint legislative study committee report on transportation concluded that Georgia\u2019s roads and bridges were in dire need of repair, state lawmakers knew they had to raise money.\n\nSo increasing the gas tax seemed to be a logical solution. But how to do it is less clear.\n\nThe Divide\n\nGeorgia lawmakers are divided between those who argue the tax hike is a necessary evil, and those who warn the gas hike, as it is currently structured, is too high and will spur a whole range of tax increases in other sectors of the economy.\n\nThe proposed legislation, H.B. 170, would consolidate the state\u2019s fixed gas tax of 7.5 cents per gallon and its variable sales tax of 8.8 cents per gallon into one fixed tax rate.\n\nThe result would be a tax of almost 30 cents per gallon of gas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big tax increase,\u201d wrote Erick Erickson, a nationally-recognized political blogger who is from Georgia and lobbying against the measure. \u201cMost amazingly, the House Republicans in Georgia are denying that it is an increase.\u201d\n\nCharlie Harper, a conservative who blogs at Peach Pundit and runs a nonprofit policy group that is advocating in favor of the tax hike, told The Daily Signal today via email that fixing Georgia\u2019s roads and bridges \u201cis not a want, it\u2019s a need.\u201d He said:\n\nThe backlog of maintenance alone requires $500 to $700 million additional spending per year. We almost quit deferred maintenance ten years ago and only expect to resurface less than one percent of our roads per year. We have literally thousands of bridges that need to be replaced and we did 60 last year.\n\nThe legislation, which is currently being debated in the House, would also transfer revenue from a separate gasoline sales tax that goes to localities \u2014 which normally funds a variety of non-transportation needs like education \u2014 to the state to strictly fund transportation needs.\n\nWhile conservatives argue that gas taxes are efficient user fees and a sensible way to raise revenue to pay for infrastructure, some warn that in Georgia\u2019s case, the legislation will force local counties to raise gas taxes even further to compensate for the loss.\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform, a conservative nonprofit advocacy group in Washington, D.C., opposes H.B. 170 for that reason.\n\n\u201cThe total tax on gasoline in Georgia could range as high as 53.6 cents per gallon, well above the U.S. average of 48.29 cents per gallon, wrote Paul Blair, the organization\u2019s state manager. \u201cIf implemented, H.B. 170 could make gasoline sold in Georgia the 9th highest taxed gasoline in the nation. Indexing the gas tax to inflation would make it worse.\u201d\n\nBut Harper argues that under the gas tax bill, \u201clocal governments are not deprived of any existing revenue.\u201d He said:\n\nThey are required on new Special Purpose Local Option Sales Taxes (SPLOSTs) going forward to use any sales taxes collected on gasoline to be used for transportation purposes. Every SPLOST in Georgia is \u2018special\u2019 because they are individual taxes set for special purposes for a specific period of time, and are not to be used for general county obligations. As such, local governments that claim they may have to raise taxes because they can\u2019t in the future tax gasoline for non-transportation purposes are being disingenuous.\n\nEmily Goff, a policy analyst in Transportation and Infrastructure at The Heritage Foundation, said Georgia\u2019s efforts to gain fiscal independence from Washington is a \u201cwin\u201d for federalism and limited government, but warned that those paying the gas tax seemingly for roads and bridges could end up paying for services they might not necessarily use.\n\n\u201cStates can and should handle transportation decisions for all non-federal activities such as local and state roads and bridges, bus and subway systems, and bicycle trails and sidewalks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, states should adhere to a system in which users pay for the system they use, and not squander gas taxes on non-road projects such as transit, for example.\u201d\n\nBut Harper sees no other solution.\n\n\u201cGeorgia can\u2019t continue to be one of the country\u2019s fastest growing states with the lowest highway spending per capita,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not sustainable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As lawmakers consider a bill that would significantly raise taxes on gas, Georgia residents could soon see prices surge at the pump.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As lawmakers consider a bill that would significantly raise taxes on gas, Georgia residents could soon see prices surge at the pump.", "title": "Republicans Are Calling for Higher Gas Taxes in This State", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000052027648_Medium.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1M9XBrE"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As lawmakers consider a bill that would significantly raise taxes on gas, Georgia residents could soon see prices surge at the pump.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000052027648_Medium.jpg"}, "title": "Republicans Are Calling for Higher Gas Taxes in This State", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2015-03-05T16:45:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "gas tax, georgia gas tax, georgia, gax tax hike, economy, taxes, tax reform, transportation"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeddd\"", "article_summary": "While conservatives argue that gas taxes are efficient user fees and a sensible way to raise revenue to pay for infrastructure, some warn that in Georgia\u2019s case, the legislation will force local counties to raise gas taxes even further to compensate for the loss.\nSo increasing the gas tax seemed to be a logical solution.\n170, would consolidate the state\u2019s fixed gas tax of 7.5 cents per gallon and its variable sales tax of 8.8 cents per gallon into one fixed tax rate.\n\u201cBut, states should adhere to a system in which users pay for the system they use, and not squander gas taxes on non-road projects such as transit, for example.\u201dBut Harper sees no other solution.\nAs such, local governments that claim they may have to raise taxes because they can\u2019t in the future tax gasoline for non-transportation purposes are being disingenuous."}
