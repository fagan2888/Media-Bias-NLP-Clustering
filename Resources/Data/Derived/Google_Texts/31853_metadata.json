Young black voters make up an infinitesimal share of the GOP primary electorate,\u201d Jack Pitney, a professor of American politics at Claremont McKenna College in California, wrote in an e-mail to The Christian Science Monitor while voicing that more likely, \u201cthe ad is \u2026 a way of generating talk about Carson that does not focus on his many gaffes or his strident positions on social issues.\u201d\n\nThe speculation comes amid the release of \u201cFreedom,\u201d a 60-second political ad that features hip-hop artist Aspiring Mogul encouraging listeners to \u201cvote, vote,\u201d between snippets of a stump speech from Carson.\n\nAlthough the retired neurosurgeon currently tops major polls in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, he has made a series of controversial comments that have raised eyebrows and created a growing rift between him and the black community. Those comments include comparing President Barack Obama to a psychopath, calling the Affordable Care Act the worst thing \u201csince slavery,\u201d and declaring that homosexuality is a choice.\n\n\u201cHas he lost his sense of who he is?\u201d the Rev. Jamal Bryant, a prominent black pastor in Baltimore, told The Washington Post this spring. \u201cHe does not see he is the next Herman Cain.\u201d\n\nThe Monitor mentioned that Carson\u2019s standing in the polls largely stems from the support of white, rural communities and evangelical Christians, who relate to his emphasis on morality and family. Nevertheless, Henry Olsen, a conservative political analyst, tells the news outlet that the ad has potential to win over black voters in states where they don\u2019t need to align with a particular party.\n\nAccording to the publication, the \u201cFreedom\u201d ad is set to run today, Friday (Nov. 6) in eight urban radio markets, including Miami, Atlanta, Detroit, and Memphis, Tenn.\n\n\u201c[A]ll Southern states except Florida, Kentucky, and North Carolina have no partisan registration,\u201d Mr. Olsen writes in an email to the news outlet. \u201cThus, if Carson can persuade some blacks to cross over for him he\u2019s effectively expanding the GOP voter pool in ways his rivals cannot.\u201d\n\nDescribing the ad, Carson campaign spokesman Doug Watts labeled it as an effort to reach out to young black voters \u201con a level they appreciate and follow.\u201d\n\nWhile this may be true, the rap ad, looks to include elements of the things that have resonated with many of Carson\u2019s supporters.\n\n\u201c[I]f you listen to the message of the ad, it specifically cites the values of personal responsibility, hard work, and innovation. That\u2019s entirely consistent with his broader message regarding the keys to his own success, and what he believes is the best way to attack racism,\u201d Matthew Dickinson, a political science professor at Vermont\u2019s Middlebury College, writes in an e-mail to the Monitor.\n\nLisen below to Ben Carson\u2019s rap (radio) ad:\n\n13 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?
