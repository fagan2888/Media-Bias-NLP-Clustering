In late October, Obama\u2019s score was 43 percent -- a two-percentage-points tumble because of the government shutdown and a glitch-filled Affordable Care Act website rollout.\n\nThough the healthcare public relations nightmare continues to follow the administration, Gallup\u2019s data trends are showing that Obama is losing support among those who earn $90,000 or more annually, have a higher socioeconomic status and have postgraduate degrees. The president\u2019s support among that group was 45 percent the week ended Oct. 27. However, the week of Nov. 18-24 saw that rating drop to 36 percent, according to Gallup.\n\nPhoto: Reuters\n\nPhoto: Reuters Previous Next\n\n[[nid:1486372]]\n\n\u201cBarring any major reversal this week,\u201d researchers wrote, \u201cObama is on track to shed at least two points in November, another month in which problems with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation have dominated the news.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nGallup polled 3,064 adults for this survey between Nov. 18 and 24.
