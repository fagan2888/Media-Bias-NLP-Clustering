It\u2019s a job killer, which also places fixed-income seniors and pretty much every state that voted for Mitt Romney in the crosshairs. Oh, and did I mention that energy costs are set to spike if this new regulatory nightmare is enacted, along with Obamacare premiums. It\u2019s a mess, and it\u2019s a war that President Obama is winning so far.\n\nSean Hackbarth of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce offered the grisly details earlier this month. Yes, some market forces have been at play with coal\u2013and the acceleration of natural gas exploration surely has hurt the industry. But let\u2019s not kid ourselves that Obama\u2019s red tape helped in mending these hits to coal [Bold text indicates Energy Information Administration]:\n\nBut no one can seriously argue that the Obama\u2019s regulatory attacks on coal haven\u2019t played a major role. Here\u2019s one example from the Energy Information Administration: About 30% of the coal capacity that retired in 2015 occurred in April, which is when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule went into effect. This rule was struck down by the Supreme Court in July 2015, but as EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy bragged, the damage was done. \"Over 50 GW of affordable, reliable power plants have been shuttered by an illegally crafted\" mercury rule, writes Heath Knakmuhs of the Institute for 21st Century Energy. Another example is the Goliath of regulatory attacks on coal: EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan. The regulations will force states to abandon reliable coal-fired power plants and reconfigure their electrical systems to reduce U.S. carbon emissions. Thankfully the Supreme Court delayed EPA from implementing it until all legal challenges were settled. A Morning Consult poll found that by more than 2-to-1 Americans support SCOTUS\u2019 action.\n\nYet, if things go south\u2013and coal is eviscerated by this environmental agenda\u2013we\u2019re looking at the cannibalization of at least 125,000 jobs, with $650 billion in lost economic activity over the next ten years. Not to mention scores of local communities ravaged thanks to ineffective and egregiously expensive alternative energy methods adored by the political left.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives (and some Democrats) are doing all they can to prevent the implementation of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan....05/27/2016 8:08:57AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives (and some Democrats) are doing all they can to prevent the implementation of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan...", "title": "Friendly Reminder: Obama Is Winning The War On Coal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/29/friendly-reminder-obama-is-winning-the-war-on-coal-n2134419", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/89/2016-03-29T193440Z_1_LYNXNPEC2S19X_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA-OPIOID.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Conservatives (and some Democrats) are doing all they can to prevent the implementation of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan...", "title": "Friendly Reminder: Obama Is Winning The War On Coal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/29/friendly-reminder-obama-is-winning-the-war-on-coal-n2134419", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/89/2016-03-29T193440Z_1_LYNXNPEC2S19X_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA-OPIOID.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Friendly Reminder: Obama Is Winning The War On Coal , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The regulations will force states to abandon reliable coal-fired power plants and reconfigure their electrical systems to reduce U.S. carbon emissions.\nAnother example is the Goliath of regulatory attacks on coal: EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan.\nIt\u2019s a mess, and it\u2019s a war that President Obama is winning so far.\n\"Over 50 GW of affordable, reliable power plants have been shuttered by an illegally crafted\" mercury rule, writes Heath Knakmuhs of the Institute for 21st Century Energy.\nOh, and did I mention that energy costs are set to spike if this new regulatory nightmare is enacted, along with Obamacare premiums."}
