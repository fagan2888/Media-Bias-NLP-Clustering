I\u2019m not saying I want to do away with it,\u201d Mr. Recchia said in an interview, referring to the model helicopter flying group that victim Roman Pirozek belonged to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying, lets put a moratorium for now, let\u2019s do a thorough investigation to see what exactly transpired, and let\u2019s see what\u2026 rules and regulations we should put in place,\u201d Mr. Recchia said.\n\nThe councilman said he will leave it up to city officials to determine which agency would conduct the investigation \u2014 he suggested the park department or the New York Police Department.\n\n\u201cWas the cause the wind? The glare from the sun, was it a malfunction of the helicopter itself? Was it the remote control?\u201d he said. \u201cIt gets windy out there.\u201d\n\nThe end result could be restricting helicopters from flying beyond a certain height or in certain weather conditions, he said.\n\n\u201cI see these things flying but I never thought something like this could happen,\u201d Mr. Recchia said.\n\nOn Thursday, a law-enforcement official said Mr. Pirozek \u201cwas known to be aggressive in his flying and often executed tricks. He was executing a trick when he was struck.\u201d Mr. Pirozek\u2019s suffered a severe injury to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene. His father was present at the park at the time of the incident.\n\nCalvert Vaux Park is a sanctioned model helicopter flying area by both the city and the Academy of Model Aeronautics, a national model aviation organization. The park is currently undergoing a $30 million renovation, Mr. Recchia said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A city councilman is calling for a temporary ban on remote-controlled helicopters around the city, including Brooklyn's Calvert Vaux Park, where a 19-year-old hobbyist was killed on Thursday when a model helicopter he was flying crashed into his head.", "title": "Ban Model Helicopters Until Hobbyist\u2019s Death is Investigated, Councilman says", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/06/ban-model-helicopters-until-hobbyists-death-is-investigated-councilman-says/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YU509_nyheli_E_20130905182030.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Ban Model Helicopters Until Hobbyist\u2019s Death is Investigated, Councilman says", "description": "A city councilman is calling for a temporary ban on remote-controlled helicopters around the city, including Brooklyn's Calvert Vaux Park, where a 19-year-old hobbyist was killed on Thursday when a model helicopter he was flying crashed into his head.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Tom Namako", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "A city councilman is calling for a temporary ban on remote-controlled helicopters around the city, including Brooklyn's Calvert Vaux Park, where a 19-year-old hobbyist was killed on Thursday when a model helicopter he was flying crashed into his head.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-06T18:13:21-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/06/ban-model-helicopters-until-hobbyists-death-is-investigated-councilman-says/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-18421", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A city councilman is calling for a temporary ban on remote-controlled helicopters around the city, including Brooklyn's Calvert Vaux Park, where a 19-year-old hobbyist was killed on Thursday when a model helicopter he was flying crashed into his head.", "title": "Ban Model Helicopters Until Hobbyist\u2019s Death is Investigated, Councilman says", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/06/ban-model-helicopters-until-hobbyists-death-is-investigated-councilman-says/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-18421", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-06T18:44:17-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Calvert Vaux Park is a sanctioned model helicopter flying area by both the city and the Academy of Model Aeronautics, a national model aviation organization.\nFacebook Roman Pirozek was killed while flying a remote-controlled model helicopter on Thursday.\nOn Thursday, a law-enforcement official said Mr. Pirozek \u201cwas known to be aggressive in his flying and often executed tricks.\nI\u2019m not saying I want to do away with it,\u201d Mr. Recchia said in an interview, referring to the model helicopter flying group that victim Roman Pirozek belonged to.\n\u201cI see these things flying but I never thought something like this could happen,\u201d Mr. Recchia said."}
