The report was also presented at a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C.,\n\nThe report highlights many promising cancer care developments, including new drugs and technologies, declining mortality rates, expanded access to healthcare generally, and a shift towards value-based care. But ASCO also highlights major challenges for patients and physicians, including uneven health insurance coverage, rapidly rising costs, and other barriers to accessing new treatments.\n\n\u201cContinued scientific and medical progress is urgently needed to improve cancer care, but treatment advances will only be as good as our ability to deliver them to patients,\u201d said ASCO President Julie Vose. \u201cIf we hope to achieve Vice President Biden\u2019s goal of doubling the pace of progress, the work of strengthening cancer care delivery has to be pursued just as aggressively as the cancer research agenda.\u201d\n\nThe ASCO report highlights the continued decrease in cancer incidence and mortality rates for key cancers. This progress can be attributed in part to the growing number of novel drugs and technologies, fueled by the nation\u2019s investment in cancer research.\n\nIn 2015, the FDA approved 15 new cancer drugs, as well as the first biosimilar to an existing biological product. FDA also approved several screening and diagnostic tests to help better identify cancers at an early stage, target treatments, and improve outcomes for patients.\n\nThe nation is also recommitting significant resources to cancer research after a ten-year period of stagnant funding: Congress took an important first step by increasing FY2016 federal cancer research funding by 5.34 percent over the previous year; and the government\u2019s moonshot initiative would commit over $700 million and pursue new collaborations to accelerate progress.\n\nAlthough patients face better treatment prospects than ever before, the report cautions that cancer care may be compromised due to the growing complexity of care delivery, inadequate healthcare access and affordability, and other external practice pressures.\n\nThe report highlights a number of issues:\n\n\u25cf Increasing complexity of care delivery\u2014The evolving scientific evidence around individual risk of developing cancer and frequent revisions to screening guidelines, the rapidly advancing field of precision medicine, and an aging U.S. population with changing treatment and other chronic health needs pose new challenges for physicians as they work to deliver consistently high-quality care.\n\n\u25cf Remaining gaps in insurance coverage\u2014The Affordable Care Act has enrolled 17 million Americans, and includes a number of provisions that benefit people with cancer. However, approximately 35 million non-elderly adults remain uninsured, 31 million more are underinsured, and Medicaid expansion is still incomplete. A survey of clinical trial sites also found persistent denials of coverage for the routine costs of clinical trials, despite the Affordable Care Act coverage requirement.\n\n\u25cf Rising cost of cancer care\u2014The escalating cost of cancer care is having an enormous impact on people with cancer and their families. Some estimates suggest that 10 to 20 percent of patients with cancer may not take prescribed treatments because of cost, putting them at risk for poor cancer outcomes and making them more likely to declare bankruptcy than those without cancer.\n\n\u25cf Looming access issues\u2014Three noted trends may impede future access to high-quality cancer care, including: an imbalance between the number of U.S. oncologists practicing in and number of Americans living in rural areas (5.6 percent and 11 percent, respectively); a dramatic increase in the number of cancer patients, a 45 percent increase from 2010 to 2030, largely due to the aging of the U.S. population; and an aging oncology workforce, with 20 percent of oncologists now over the age of 64, and the expected growth in the number of oncologists by 2030 not expected to match the growth in patients.\n\n\u25cf Inconsistent adoption, lack of interoperability of health IT\u2014With the potential to significantly improve the quality of cancer care, the integration of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to significant administrative burdens that reduce physicians\u2019 available time for patient care, research, teaching, and other professional activities. In fact, nearly half (45 percent) of oncology practices surveyed by ASCO cited EHR implementation as the leading practice pressure, surpassing all other pressures in 2015. Further, the common incompatibility of different health IT systems used by providers inhibits the sharing of information that is needed for optimal cancer care.\n\nThe report recommends expanding publicly funded insurance programs to offer consistent and adequate benefits to people living with cancer; testing multiple payment and care delivery models to identify effective solutions; improving value in cancer care by working with stakeholders to develop alternate payment models, as well as clinical guidelines and resources that can help reduce waste and avoid inappropriate treatment; and advancing health information technology that supports efficient, coordinated care, such as electronic health records.\n\nTHE V FOUNDATION for Cancer Research and the WWE announced a multi-year partnership to support cancer research nationally through funds raised by Connor\u2019s Cure.\n\nThe announcement was made at Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, where Connor\u2019s Cure was originally established, with representatives from the hospital, the WWE and The V Foundation. In 2014, Connor\u2019s Cure was created by WWE Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon and WWE\u2019s executive vice president of talent, live events and creative, Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque, as a fund within Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh Foundation to support pediatric brain and spinal cord cancer research.\n\nThe new partnership will expand Connor\u2019s Cure outside of Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh Foundation and support top research centers and hospitals nationwide. Connor\u2019s Cure was established in honor of 8-year-old WWE fan Connor Michalek, a patient at Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC who battled medulloblastoma, a rare tumor that affects the brain and spinal cord. To date, Connor\u2019s Cure has raised nearly $1 million and assisted more than 100 families around the world.\n\nAs a result of the new partnership, funds raised by WWE will support Connor\u2019s Cure through The V Foundation\u2019s grant-making process. In addition, funding will continue to support the research being done at Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC.\n\nPROVIDENCE HEALTH & SERVICES and the Institute for Systems Biology announced an affiliation focused on personalized medicine.\n\nLeroy Hood, will serve as senior vice president and chief science officer of Providence Health & Services, a five-state, not-for-profit health system, and continue as president of the Seattle-based ISB.\n\nProvidence and ISB will establish a number of joint research projects in scientific wellness, employing the approach of dense, dynamic personalized data clouds, including: following and understanding early transitions from wellness to disease; analyzing patient populations longitudinally that are at risk for Alzheimer\u2019s; helping breast cancer patients recover from illness following debilitating therapies; and utilizing novel approaches to successfully treat glioblastoma, an inevitably fatal type of brain tumor.\n\nISB\u2019s goal is to develop metrics to quantify scientific wellness and identify the earliest markers of transition for all common diseases. ISB will remain a separate legal entity with its own brand and identity and board of directors.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "2016-03-18 19:14:59", "description": "Yanai to Lead New Institute for Computational Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nITAI YANAI was named the inaugural director of the Institute for Computational Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, effective May 1.\r\nThe Institute for Computational Medicine will act as the hub for multidisciplinary efforts to reveal patterns in medical data to aid in diagnoses and the design of new treatments.", "generator": "Subhub - http://www.subhub.com", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-18 19:14:59", "dcterms.creator": "The Cancer Letter Publications", "dcterms.type": "SubHub Site", "keywords": ",cancer news, the cancer letter, cancer research, oncology news, medical oncology, cancer policy, drug development, cancer, cancer research funding, cancer funding, clinical cancer letter, NIH, NCI, FDA, CMS, Congress, White House", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Her primary research interests are in health services research, health economics outcomes research, and health policy.\nTHE V FOUNDATION for Cancer Research and the WWE announced a multi-year partnership to support cancer research nationally through funds raised by Connor\u2019s Cure.\nITAI YANAI was named the inaugural director of the Institute for Computational Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, effective May 1.\nShe is a fellow in the American College of Physicians and is board certified in internal medicine and medical oncology.\n\u25cf Rising cost of cancer care\u2014The escalating cost of cancer care is having an enormous impact on people with cancer and their families."}
