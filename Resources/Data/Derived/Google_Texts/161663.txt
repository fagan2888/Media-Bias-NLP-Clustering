Despite challenges posed by offering insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, Highmark remains committed to the market, according to Karen Hanlon, the carrier's executive vice president and CFO.

That was just one take away from Highmark’s 2015 financial report released Friday.

The company finished the year with revenue up five percent from 2014, with an overall operating revenue of $17.7 billion.

But it experienced an operating loss of $565 million, which it attributed to the performance of insurance products it offers through the ACA exchange.

Highmark also reported a deficit of revenue over expenses of $85 million.

Like other companies in the insurance industry, Highmark has struggled with costs related to the ACA. The plans continue to require a high level of medical spending.

Highmark has taken several steps to make the market more sustainable, including cutting reimbursement by 4.5 percent for physicians treating patients covered under ACA plans.

ACA plans are part of the government market division within Highmark. The government market, which also includes Medicare and Medicaid plans, lost $438 million for the year.

The company’s commercial plans remain strong, gaining $217 million in 2015.

Highmark plans in both the commercial and government markets experienced an overall member retention rate of 95 percent, according to a news release.

“Highmark Health is pleased with our strong, consistent year-over year financial performance despite the impact of the ACA population,” David Holmberg, president and CEO of Highmark Health said. “We continue to invest in our core and growing businesses with nearly $500 million in capital investments in 2015 to improve health care quality and access for our members and other health plan members on our platform.”
