Prosecutors identified the shooter as Antonio Roberson.\n\nIn his records request, Wilson asked the Justice Department to provide a recording of a 1999 conversation between Roberson and an undercover informant named Bobby Capies.\n\nWilson said other records in his case showed that the tape exists, with documents referring to how Capies wore an undercover wire in summer 1999 while talking with Roberson about the murders.\n\n\u201cI believe the said body recording was exculpatory and should have been disclosed during the criminal proceedings,\u201d Wilson said in his FOIA request.\n\nAt first, the Justice Department refused to confirm or deny whether the tape existed, citing, among other reasons, privacy concerns about Roberson and the confidential informant, whom officials would not name as Mr. Capies.\n\nBut U.S. District Court Judge James E. Boasberg disagreed. In a ruling, he cited a 2011 article by The Washington Times reporting that both Roberson and Wilson\u2019s other purported associate on the night of the shooting, Antoine Draine, have since died. Privacy protections don\u2019t extend to the dead.\n\nThe judge also said the Justice Department already disclosed that Mr. Capies was an informant.\n\nHe ordered the Justice Department to confirm or deny whether the tape existed, adding, \u201cPlainly, the answer here is yes, the records exist.\u201d\n\nHowever, government attorneys responded in a recent motion by saying they\u2019ve looked in case files but can\u2019t find the recording.\n\nA paralegal said in an affidavit that she searched boxes of case records. She found a disc that mentioned Mr. Capies wearing a body recording device and speaking with Roberson. But, she added, she did not find the actual recording or a transcript.\n\nIn a letter to The Washington Times, Wilson said the recording and transcript should have been turned over years ago and long before his trial.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on that tape will help prove my innocence,\u201d he wrote, adding that searching boxes of case records wasn\u2019t sufficient.\n\n\u201cThey never searched the Metropolitan Police Department files or anywhere else?\u201d he asked.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Justice Department says it can't find a tape recording sought by a federal prisoner who says the evidence will exonerate him in a 1998 double murder", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Justice Department says it can\u2019t find a tape recording sought by a federal prisoner who says the evidence will exonerate him in a 1998 double murder", "title": "Murder convict says missing tape would prove his innocence", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/3/murder-convict-says-missing-tape-would-prove-his-i/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/03/26/justice_building.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/03/26/justice_building.jpg", "description": "The Justice Department says it can't find a tape recording sought by a federal prisoner who says the evidence will exonerate him in a 1998 double murder", "card": "summary", "title": "Murder convict says missing tape would prove his innocence"}, "Author": "Jim McElhatton", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, David Wilson, Department Of Justice, Sabrina Bradley, Antonio Roberson"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhat\u2019s on that tape will help prove my innocence,\u201d he wrote, adding that searching boxes of case records wasn\u2019t sufficient.\nThe judge also said the Justice Department already disclosed that Mr. Capies was an informant.\nA paralegal said in an affidavit that she searched boxes of case records.\nIn his records request, Wilson asked the Justice Department to provide a recording of a 1999 conversation between Roberson and an undercover informant named Bobby Capies.\nIn a letter to The Washington Times, Wilson said the recording and transcript should have been turned over years ago and long before his trial."}
