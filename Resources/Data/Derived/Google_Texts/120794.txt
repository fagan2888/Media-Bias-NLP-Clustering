Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Wisconsin will no longer sell health plans on the marketplace set up through the Affordable Care Act in Milwaukee, Racine and Kenosha counties.

The Milwaukee market — where six other companies are selling health plans on the HealthCare.govwebsite — has emerged as one of the most competitive in the state.

Anthem said it will continue to sell health plans for individuals and their families in 34 Wisconsin counties.

Anthem is not shutting down its individual health plans in Milwaukee County that do not meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. These so-called grandmother plans were sold before Jan. 1, 2014, and are closed to new customers.

New open enrollment for health plans sold on the marketplace starts on Nov. 1.

Separately, Anthem increased its third-quarter profit by 4% as the number of people covered by the health insurer edged slightly higher.

The insurer also boosted its adjusted 2015 net income forecast for the third time this year, to a range of $10.10 to $10.20 per share.

That's up from its July forecast for more than $10 per share, but still below the $10.20 Wall Street was anticipating.

Anthem, which is planning to buy Cigna Corp., reported third-quarter net income of $654.8 million, or $2.43 per share.
