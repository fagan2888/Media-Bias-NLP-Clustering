Late into the evening, Oregon and Alaska followed suit.\n\nThe District of Columbia\u2019s measure to legalize pot was backed by nearly 70 percent of voters. The referendum makes it legal for those 21 and older to grow and possess marijuana in the U.S. capital, but not sell it.\n\nVoters in Oregon and Alaska also said yes to cannabis last night, becoming the third and fourth states respectively to allow the possession\u2014and sale\u2014of pot for recreational use, rather than strictly medical use.\n\nBoth Oregon and Alaska will regulate the marijuana industry similar to alcohol, prohibiting those under 21 from buying, selling or using the substance.\n\nIn Oregon, where the initiative passed with 54 percent support, the law is planned to take effect July 2015.\n\nIn Alaska, where 52 percent voted in favor of legalization, officials now have nine months to draw up regulations before it becomes law.\n\nOregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia followed the lead of Colorado and Washington state, which legalized marijuana by ballot initiative in 2012.\n\nAlthough voters in the nation\u2019s capital made their opinions heard, members of Congress still hold the power to regulate, delay, and/or override the decision, likely pushing back implementation until next year.\n\n>>>Why The Post Is Right to Oppose Legalized Pot in D.C.\n\nIn contrast to last night\u2019s legalization wave, voters in Florida narrowly rejected a measure to legalize medical marijuana, failing to secure the 60 percent needed to approve the proposal.\n\nSupporters call the Nov. 4 election results an important step in the national legalization movement, but not everyone agrees. Cully Stimson, senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, says legalization is a \u201cterrible\u201d public policy.\n\nThis story was updated to reflect the results of Alaska\u2019s ballot initiative.", "article_metadata": {"description": "High on election season, voters in the nation's capital supported an initiative to legalize recreational marijuana.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "High on election season, voters in the nation's capital supported an initiative to legalize recreational marijuana.", "title": "Voters in Washington, D.C., Legalize Recreational Marijuana", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/marijuana-dc-110414.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-27T21:34:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1pjtU2q"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "High on election season, voters in the nation's capital supported an initiative to legalize recreational marijuana.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/marijuana-dc-110414.jpg"}, "title": "Voters in Washington, D.C., Legalize Recreational Marijuana", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "drugs", "published_time": "2014-11-05T00:17:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-27T21:34:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "marijuana legal dc, dc marijuana, dc pot, dc marijuana ballot, marijuana legalization 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde547\"", "article_summary": "Residents of Washington, D.C., overwhelmingly voted to legalize recreational marijuana for adults tonight.\nThe District of Columbia\u2019s measure to legalize pot was backed by nearly 70 percent of voters.\nOregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia followed the lead of Colorado and Washington state, which legalized marijuana by ballot initiative in 2012.\nIn contrast to last night\u2019s legalization wave, voters in Florida narrowly rejected a measure to legalize medical marijuana, failing to secure the 60 percent needed to approve the proposal.\nBoth Oregon and Alaska will regulate the marijuana industry similar to alcohol, prohibiting those under 21 from buying, selling or using the substance."}
