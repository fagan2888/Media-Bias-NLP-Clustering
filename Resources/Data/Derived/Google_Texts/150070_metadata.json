Gov. Nikki Haley recently told The (Columbia, S.C.) State newspaper that she and her husband made more money in 2013 due to \u201ca spike in income from real estate investments.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the Haleys \u201ccollected $70,506 in investment income on real estate last year, up from $3,833 in 2012,\u201d the paper reported.\n\nThat\u2019s a nice chunk of change \u2026 but where did it come from?\n\n\u201cOne investment involves the governor\u2019s father and another is outside the family, said a Haley spokesman, who did not provide any more details,\u201d the paper noted.\n\nMmmm-kay. Wonder if it has anything to do with this?\n\nIn the meantime, though, let\u2019s head over to the public reporting section S.C. State Ethics Commission (SCSEC) website, shall we? Because according to 2013 and 2014 statements of economic interest filed by Haley \u2013 she\u2019s made no money from real estate investments.\n\nNot a dime \u2026\n\nPic: SCSEC\n\nHmmmm \u2026\n\nNo wonder Haley has been such a hypocrite on the income disclosure issue.\n\nCash-related discrepancies are nothing new for this governor.\n\nIn August of 2008, Haley \u2013 then a State Representative \u2013 submitted an employment application to Lexington Medical Center, which wound up employing her for twenty months as a vastly-overpaid \u201cfundraiser.\u201d This job application included a 2007 income estimate which vastly exceeded the amount of money Haley reported to the IRS that year. Specifically, Haley\u2019s application stated that she made $125,000 from her family clothing business in 2007 (a figure that would explain her $300,000 home, Cadillac SUV, etc.).\n\nThe problem? On her federal tax returns, Haley reported making only $22,000 from the \u201cfamily business\u201d that year.\n\nThe initial suspicion was that Haley may have lied on her job application \u2013 although the much more damaging allegation revolves around the possibility that Haley lied on her tax returns.\n\nEither way, the discrepancy was uncovered as part of an independent investigation launched in February 2011 by former Board of Economic Advisors (BEA) Chairman John Rainey. When reporter John O\u2019Connor of The (Columbia, S.C.) State newspaper busted Haley on this discrepancy a month later \u2013 the governor trotted out her chief of staff Tim Pearson to (once again) lie on her behalf.\n\n\u201cShe never said that she made $125,000 from Exotica,\u201d Pearson told The State. \u201cThe application does not have her signature on it \u2026 the governor did not fill out the application that has her making $125,000 a year.\u201d\n\nReally?\n\nIt was later revealed that anyone fraudulently filling out the application online \u201cwould have had to know (Haley\u2019s) social security number, address, job history, past supervisors, job duties, education and other details.\u201d Not only that, they would have had to know the user name and password that Haley (or her phantom) created for the purpose of submitting the application.\n\nIn spite of all that, Haley maintained her denials \u2026\n\n\u201cI had no input on that form,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not sit in front of the computer and fill it out online. I did not sign it. And never did I mention the number 125 to the hospital or to anyone else, because that\u2019s not an accurate number.\u201d\n\nNobody bought Haley\u2019s explanations. In fact, according to a FITS poll published at the time of the scandal, a whopping 96 percent of respondents said they thought Haley was lying. Things got even worse for the governor a few days later when reporter Robert Kittle of WSPA TV 7 (CBS \u2013 Spartanburg) caught her in another lie regarding the password to the account that was used to submit the information.\n\n\u201cThere was no password. The password was where I graduated from high school,\u201d Haley told Kittle (video here).\n\nWow \u2026 talk about an \u201cinsta-contradiction.\u201d\n\nAnyway, over time the scandal died down \u2026 giving way to numerous other Haley missteps. But it\u2019s interesting to see the governor\u2019s income-related issues once again bubbling back up \u2026\n\nPic: Travis Bell Photography", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2014/07/22/nikki-haley-income-issues/", "type": "article", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/nikki-haley-ethics-scandal-625x370.jpg", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "title": "More Nikki Haley Income Issues"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "robots": "noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9959\"", "article_summary": "In the meantime, though, let\u2019s head over to the public reporting section S.C.
