Faced with the backlash, Trump did what he\u2019s been doing with great success, ever since entering the presidential contest in June: He doubled down.\n\nAppearing on a radio talk show broadcast from the early caucus state of Iowa, Trump sung the praises of the Russian military and said he saw great potential through what he imagines would be a very positive relationship between himself and Putin, for the two countries to be a \u201cpositive force\u201d together.\n\nRelated: Why Trump\u2019s Support Is Even Stronger than You Think\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a good instinct about Putin,\u201d Trump said in an interview with host Simon Conway. \u201cI just feel that that\u2019s a guy\u2014and I can analyze people and you\u2019re not always right, and it could be that I won\u2019t like him \u2013 but I\u2019ve always had a good feeling about him\u2026. I know that Obama and him [sic] have never gotten along. I watched the two of them sitting in their two chairs as the press is taking their pictures and you can see there\u2019s hatred in both cases, all right?\u201d\n\nAs the relationship between the U.S. and Russia stands now, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been hurt by Russia and Russia is always beating us out.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said, under President Trump that dynamic would change. And \u2013 like getting Mexico to pay for a border wall \u2013 the change will begin with getting Russia to do the dirty work of getting rid of the terror group ISIS for us.\n\n\u201cRussia is a big powerful country with a powerful military, Trump said. \u201cWe have to knock out ISIS. You know that I\u2019ve been in favor of Russia bombing the hell out of them as soon as the idea was broached.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Top 10 Political Lies of the Year\n\nTrump belittled his opponents for the Republican presidential nomination \u2013 at least in the public eye \u2013 who have argued against allowing Russia to take the lead in fighting ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to spent a million dollars an hour on bombing,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have to bomb\u2026 I\u2019m all for that. But if other people want to do it, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe actually had senators, you know, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, these guys are saying, like, if we let Russia do it, it\u2019s like we\u2019re losing prestige or something. There\u2019s no prestige,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to get rid of ISIS, we want to get rid of them effectively, surgically, fast and strong.\n\n\u201cBut you know, I really believe that Russia and the United States can be a positive force together, as opposed to really working negatively with each other all the time.\u201d\n\nLast week, in a public press conference, Putin praised Trump as a talented man who was the \u201cabsolute leader\u201d in the presidential primary race. To the surprise of some in the media, Trump not only accepted the praise, but seemed to glory in it, saying that is was a \u201cgreat honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond.\u201d\n\nRelated: Donald Trump\u2019s New Role \u2013 Apologist for Vladimir Putin\n\nOver the weekend, Trump appeared on ABC\u2019s This Week, and sparred with host George Stephanopolous over the issue of Putin\u2019s involvement in the deaths of journalists, including investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya.\n\nTrump appeared to rake the most literal possible interpretation of the host\u2019s wording \u2013 that Putin had personally murdered journalists \u2013 and pushed back against that. \u201cI\u2019m saying when you say a man has killed reporters, I\u2019d like you to prove it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m saying it would be a terrible thing if it were true. But I have never seen any information or any proof that he killed reporters.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s state-sponsored media have had a field day with the billionaire former reality television star\u2019s defense of Putin. On Monday, notorious Kremlin mouthpiece RT ran a glowing story with the headline: \u201c\u2018Putin killed reporters?
