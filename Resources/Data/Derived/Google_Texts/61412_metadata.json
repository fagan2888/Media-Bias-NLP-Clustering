The roughly 63 percent decline was nearly double the state average.\n\nOverall, St. Charles Health System\u2019s four Central Oregon hospitals provided half the amount of uncompensated care in 2014 compared to the previous year, according to the health system\u2019s tax form 990, an annual form nonprofit organizations are required to file with the federal government.\n\nHospitals are expected to care for anyone who walks through their doors regardless of their ability to pay. Because of that, health systems like St. Charles expect they won\u2019t get paid for a certain proportion of services, a figure reported on tax forms as uncompensated care.\n\nBut the implementation of the Affordable Care Act has thrown uncompensated care into something of a nosedive both statewide and nationally. A federal report from March estimated uncompensated care fell by an average of 21 percent across all U.S. hospitals in 2014.\n\nThat\u2019s simply because many patients who formerly didn\u2019t have health insurance to help with their bills now have insurance, either through the Oregon Health Plan, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid, or a subsidized plan from the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\n\nIn Central Oregon, the number of people covered under OHP went from about 30,000 before it expanded at the beginning of 2014 to roughly 52,000 people last month.\n\n\u201cIt was just such a fundamental change in the covered lives and the health care landscape with what happened in 2014,\u201d said Jenn Welander, St. Charles\u2019 chief financial officer. \u201cNow we\u2019re basically having a new normal.\u201d\n\nGovernment insurers like Medicare, the federal program for seniors and individuals with disabilities, and Medicaid, the state-federal program for low-income individuals, reimburse providers less than the cost of delivering care, but Welander said it\u2019s better than getting no reimbursement. The federal government currently covers at 100 percent the cost of those who joined Medicaid under the expansion. That support drops to 90 percent in 2017.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint why St. Charles\u2019 drop was so much higher than other Oregon hospitals, but Welander said she suspects it\u2019s partially because St. Charles is the only hospital provider in Central Oregon.\n\nWhereas hospital providers in the Portland or Eugene areas share the duty of providing uncompensated care, St. Charles is the only system here, so the difference might be more dramatic, she said.\n\n\u201cMany of the other markets, they share it,\u201d Welander said, \u201cso no one system would have had that full burden.\u201d\n\nMore eligible for free care\n\nIn response to the drop in uncompensated care, St. Charles dramatically broadened eligibility thresholds for free or discounted care in 2014.\n\nTo qualify for free care, a patient\u2019s annual income can be no more than 250 percent of federal poverty guidelines, or $29,175 for a one-person household. That\u2019s more than double the income limit in 2013, when free care was limited to 100 percent of federal poverty guidelines, or $11,670 for one person.\n\nThe income limit to qualify for discounted care became 400 percent of the federal poverty level in 2014, or $46,680 for a one-person household. In 2013, the limit for discounted care was 300 percent of the federal poverty level, or $35,010 for one person.\n\nThere are still a number of Central Oregonians who don\u2019t qualify for OHP but who still struggle to afford medical care, Welander said.\n\n\u201cSt. Charles felt that it was important in our communities to have a level that was a bit higher than that, because not everyone is eligible for OHP,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that was a change that we made and are committed to.\u201d\n\nDespite the expanded eligibility, however, St. Charles provided less financial assistance for bills in 2014 than 2013: $8.6 million compared with $18 million. Welander said that\u2019s because fewer people needed the help.\n\nEventually, reduced uncompensated care will trickle down from hospitals and benefit everyone, said Stuart Guterman, senior scholar in residence at AcademyHealth, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that researches health policy.\n\nHealth insurers today pay an average of 30 percent more for services than it costs to provide them because hospitals build into contracts the amounts they expect to lose from uncompensated care, he said. Eventually, reduced uncompensated care should cause insurers to pay less for services, eventually bringing down the cost of health insurance, said Guterman, who formerly served as director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 Office of Research, Development, and Information and as a senior analyst at the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\u201cThese things tend to take a while to play out,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Guterman said, \u201cThere needs to be some broader awareness that people ought to be able to see savings in private coverage because of the decrease in uncompensated care to hospitals.\u201d\n\nA strong year\n\nLast year was \u201cstrong\u201d for St. Charles compared with the past six or seven, when the country was in the depths of the Great Recession, Welander said.\n\nThe hospital took in about $620 million in 2014, 11 percent more than the previous year, according to an audited financial statement provided by St. Charles. (The figures in the audited statement differ slightly from the tax form 990, but Welander said they\u2019re more accurate.)\n\nExpenses came to about $582 million, a roughly 7 percent increase from 2013.\n\nThe health system made about $38 million in excess revenue over expenses \u2014 also known as profit \u2014 from its operations in 2014, up from about $12 million the year before.\n\nThe stronger financial outlook St. Charles has seen in recent years has allowed it to invest in things like its hybrid operating room, which opened last spring, and its expanded cancer center, which opened last summer.\n\n\u201cAfter recovering from 2007 and \u201908 and \u201909 and when things were not as good at St. Charles, we\u2019ve been able to start investing in the provision of care,\u201d Welander said, \u201cand I\u2019m proud of that piece.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-383-0304,\n\ntbannow@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The amount of care St. Charles Bend provided but wasn\u2019t paid for dropped more than any other hospital in Oregon between 2013 and 2014, according to state data.
