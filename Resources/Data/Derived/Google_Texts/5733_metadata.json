Liano has been at the receiving end of vicious sprays about her looks, her lateness and, ironically, her aggressive behaviour.\n\nThe women have received a barrage of abuse online for their treatment of Liano in the series, which many have viewed as bullying.\n\nResponding to the women\u2019s concerns, the production company removed a scene where Lydia Schiavello called Gina Liano a dog for fear it could further enflame the situation.\n\n\u201cChyka, she\u2019s a dog. I don\u2019t want to go to bed with someone that\u2019s got fleas. She\u2019s crossed the line, she\u2019s got a gutter mouth,\u201d Schiavello said.\n\nFoxtel has not responded to our request for comment on the matter.\n\nNews.com.au has the original and uncut episode and has recapped it for fans:\n\nBrace yourselves, Real Housewives of Melbourne fans. We\u2019re only a couple of episodes away from the end of the season, and things are getting nasty.\n\nAs episode eight opens, helicopter enthusiast Lydia arrives at her friend Lisa\u2019s house to fill her in on the dramatic goings-on of last week\u2019s trip to Mission Beach.\n\nRealising this is her chance to score a recurring role on the show, Lisa goes hell-for-leather with the sassy quips. She informs Lydia that she hasn\u2019t eaten any carbs since 1964 (a joke that\u2019s rather lost on her: \u201cWow, really?\u201d), and remarks that \u201cyou can never be too rich or too thin.\u201d\n\n\u201cLisa and her one liners? She\u2019s hilarious!\u201d Lydia exclaims.\n\nAudition out of the way, Lisa asks Lydia about her continuing issues with Gina. What exactly is the problem?\n\n\u201cLook, she basically \u2026 she \u2026 arrives late,\u201d is Lydia\u2019s feeble response.\n\nAs the conversation continues, Lisa admits that she\u2019s stressed. She\u2019s taken a leading role in the business she and her husband own, and it\u2019s a high pressure situation \u2014 in the past week alone, she\u2019s had to raise $1 million for a project.\n\n\u201cUltimately, you\u2019ve still got to be a sexy girl and a beautiful wife, because men love that,\u201d is Lydia\u2019s not-exactly-feminist advice. Honestly, the Spice Girls must be rolling in their graves right now.\n\nNext up we\u2019re with Andrea, who\u2019s at Hardie Grant books for a meeting with their Publishing Director, Fran Berry. She\u2019s here to pitch her \u2018how to\u2019 guide for other mums, Wanna Be Like Me? Then Get Off Your Arse And Do Something You Slack Moll (note: may not be actual book title).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had so many different babysitters and nannies, and it\u2019s all of my tips on how you select the perfect babysitter,\u201d she tells Berry.\n\nShe then divulges further details about the book: it\u2019s written in the form of an extended angry letter to a fellow real-life mother who Andrea said had judged her parenting style.\n\nBerry explains that a book written purely out of spite might not make for the most enjoyable read. She also makes this face a lot:\n\nBerry suggests that Andrea start a blog to gain a following, then come back and pitch her book again in, y\u2019know, a few years. OUCH.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, Andrea\u2019s made up her mind: She doesn\u2019t need some so-called \u2018Publishing Editor\u2019 of a \u2018book company\u2019 telling her whether or not she can have a book deal. She\u2019ll publish it herself, haters be damned!\n\nIt\u2019s all business this week, because next we\u2019re with Jackie (ShineShineShine\u2122) and husband Ben as they visit a distillery to discuss their line of pre-mixed cocktails, La Mascara (it\u2019s Italian for \u2018The Mascara\u2019, doncha know).\n\nThe distillery manager, John, gives the couple a wake-up call: they haven\u2019t organised suppliers, packaging, or ingredients. Heck, they haven\u2019t even purchased a domain name for the business. How exactly do they plan to get La Mascara off the ground?\n\nFor the 187th time this series, Jackie utters the words that strike fear into the hearts of men:\n\n\u201cJohn, I don\u2019t know if you know this, but I\u2019m actually a professional psychic.\u201d\n\nJohn tells Jackie and Ben that, psychic or not, there\u2019s just no way they can get everything organised in time for the planned product launch.\n\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t LIKE that answer. I know you\u2019ve got to look at things from a realistic point of view, but I\u2019m a realistic person, and I believe you can have things done today, not yesterday,\u201d says Jackie.\n\nThen she gives him one of her trademark wide-eyed crazy-person smiles to seal the deal.\n\nMeeting adjourned, Jackie and Ben had to the distillery\u2019s lab where chemist Norm, who\u2019ll actually be creating their drinks, crunches the numbers on how much it\u2019ll cost to get product on the shelves: around $129,000 in alcohol taxes alone.\n\n\u201cF**k,\u201d Jackie says, succinctly.\n\nAfterwards, Ben\u2019s reeling from the day\u2019s events.\n\n\u201cThe most shocking thing about visiting the distillery was hearing about all the little details we hadn\u2019t thought about: the bottles, the liquid, bottling them ...\u201d\n\nSo, like, everything ?\n\nNext we head to Armadale, where Lydia and Andrea catch up for a girl\u2019s lunch to gossip, natter, and drag Gina\u2019s good name through the mud. OH FUN!\n\nAndrea announces that she\u2019s decided to distance herself from Gina, which, considering Gina abandoned a luxurious free holiday early so she wouldn\u2019t have to be near Andrea, seems a little like dumping someone after they\u2019ve already broken up with you.\n\n\u201cI feel very sorry for [Gina], because she doesn\u2019t have the forsyth to see what she\u2019s doing,\u201d says Andrea, who has written a book so yes of course she meant to say forsyth and not foresight.\n\nThat evening, the ladies assemble for the opening of Andrea\u2019s newly-renovated skin care clinic, Liberty Belle. She addresses the partygoers with a truly inspiring speech about Her Brave Struggle:\n\n\u201cBehind me was 60sqm of residential apartments, and we\u2019ve now turned it into a world class centre of excellence for cosmetic medicine.\u201d\n\nBeautiful words. We\u2019re sure the people who lived in those apartments would be happy to hear them, whichever bridge they\u2019re sheltering under now.\n\nTalking to the girls after her speech, Andrea has a fun suggestion: \u201cHey, let\u2019s launch into Gina!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at your beautiful event, I think we\u2019re having a really fun night and I think we should go inside and take a look,\u201d says Chyka, prompting a glare from Andrea that says \u2018Why did I even invite you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree, but I\u2019m really glad that silly clown is not here tonight, \u201d says silly clown Lydia.\n\nChyka tries to reason with Lydia, pointing out that she and Gina have been friends for eight years.\n\n\u201cChyka, she\u2019s a dog. I don\u2019t want to go to bed with someone that\u2019s got fleas. She\u2019s crossed the line, she\u2019s got a gutter mouth,\u201d says gutter mouth Lydia.\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019ve got a gutter mouth,\u201d offers Jackie.\n\n\u201cNo, no, but you\u2019re very sophisticated,\u201d counters Lydia, who is obviously now talking CRAZY TALK.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand what has really triggered this: She\u2019s lonely and she\u2019s so ugly. We\u2019re rich, and that would annoy her,\u201d says Lydia, whose comments we\u2019ve helpfully highlighted for your reading pleasure.\n\nAndrea finishes their bitch session by proposing a toast \u201cto health, happiness and friendship.\u201d\n\nThe fivesome then go on a tour of the new facilities, and at one point jokingly restrain Lydia to an operating table.\n\n\u201cI love being tied up,\u201d she purrs. Lydia, we\u2019re sure there are a few viewers who\u2019d be happy to oblige after your comments about Gina.\n\nThe next day, Jackie and Lydia go lingerie shopping. Ben\u2019s taking Jackie on a romantic date, so she wants to buy something noice, different and unusual.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get him all hot and horny. I want to make sure he\u2019s pleased in every way possible,\u201d she says.\n\nJackie tries on a few options \u2014 they\u2019re all subtle, sophisticated looks, as you can see below.\n\n\u201cI looked at her and thought, what beauty. The youth, her beautiful long legs, and this beautiful lace around her private bits was just so sexy \u2026 my god Ben\u2019s lucky,\u201d sighs Lydia, who so far this season has expressed attraction towards her stepson, a helicopter and now another of the housewives.\n\nDelicates purchased, it\u2019s time for Ben and Jackie\u2019s date. Over dinner, he suggests that once La Mascara\u2019s up and running, they should start a family.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put more Bens in the world,\u201d is his way of putting it.\n\nAfter dinner, he surprises her with a boat trip on the Yarra River (although it wasn\u2019t actually a surprise to Jackie: she\u2019s psychic, which you might remember her mentioning once or twice), and the pair start mackin\u2019 on something hectic. It\u2019s a sight to behold.\n\nFor the episode\u2019s climactic scene (\u201cMmm, climactic\u201d \u2014 Lydia, probably), Chyka hosts a grand soiree catered by her company. Everyone\u2019s invited, although Gina hasn\u2019t RSVPed. The others all agree that they can\u2019t imagine she\u2019d dare show her face.\n\n\u201cI was so looking forward to seeing everyone without Gina there,\u201d says Andrea.\n\n\u201cNo Gina equals no drama and no-one running late.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t it ironic (in the Alanis Morissette, not-actually-ironic-at-all sense) that at that very moment, Gina\u2019s at home, getting ready to attend the party and indeed, RUNNING LATE.\n\nGina seems a bit nervous about turning up because she\u2019s busy applying an extra layer of make-up for the occasion.\n\nUnaware of Gina\u2019s imminent arrival, Andrea and Lydia get stuck into slagging her off yet again.\n\n\u201cI understand their anger, but come on ladies \u2014 let\u2019s let go of the past and let\u2019s just move forward,\u201d says Jackie. OK, when Jackie Gillies is the most sensible person in the room something has gone TERRIBLY WRONG.\n\nSuddenly, the crowd parts and Gina emerges, heavily painted game face on. While the others plaster on fake smiles and kiss her hello, Andrea handles the surprise with trademark tact.\n\nThe girls welcome to Gina is stilted to say the least, but she doesn\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve experienced and survived cancer, when you\u2019ve been down in the trenches with your clients who are staring down the barrel of going to jail or losing their children or losing their home, the girls\u2019 behaviour is so trivial that it\u2019s just nonsense,\u201d she says.\n\nAs the housewives settle in to the party, Andrea\u2019s husband appears and makes small talk with Gina (because nobody else seems willing to).\n\nAsking if she had a good time on the Mission Beach holiday, he seems utterly unaware that the getaway culminated in his lovely wife giving Gina the finger and telling her she was too disgusting to look at.\n\n\u201cIt seemed odd that Chris hadn\u2019t heard what had happened at Mission Beach, and how hideously behaved his wife was,\u201d Gina says.\n\nAs the episode ends, Andrea issues an ominous announcement to the viewers at home: \u201cGina and I are still at war.\u201d\n\nAndrea, we\u2019ve got three words for you:\n\nThe Real Housewives of Melbourne screens 8:30pm Sundays on Arena.\n\nPrevious recaps:\n\nReal Housewives episode 7\n\nReal Housewives episode 6\n\nReal Housewives episode 5\n\nReal Housewives episode 4\n\nReal
