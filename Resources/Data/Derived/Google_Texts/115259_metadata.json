Mia Love, on a CPAC panel\n\nThe annual confab of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) started off its 2015 festivities Thursday morning with a nod to diversity, featuring a couple of the GOP\u2019s African-American stars as it began its three-day presentation of conservative speakers.\n\nProbable presidential candidate and former neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson started things off by suggesting that conservatives should try to kill the IRS, which roused the crowd. But otherwise, Carson seemed to be going through the motions, ticking off the usual conservative talking points \u2014 school choice, limited government, killing Obamacare, and fighting \u201cradical Islam.\u201d\n\nCarson, who is known for his over-the-top comparisons and accusations, was surprisingly composed here. His speech came off as so many trite one-liners and empty platitudes. Which is ironic, considering what the next speaker, Utah\u2019s Senator Mike Lee, had to say.\n\nLee has been labeled the most extreme of the Senate\u2019s GOP wingnuts, but he was surprisingly disciplined and, well, dull, as he laid out a hypothetical case for who might make the ideal conservative presidential candidate for 2016.\n\nAnd he did so by listing the things CPAC-goers should not want in candidate.\n\n\u201cWhen conservatives elevate unserious presidential candidates, candidates who are not principled, positive, and proven, it\u2019s not the media\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not the establishment\u2019s fault. It\u2019s our fault, and we can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nThat line got a very tepid response from an audience that yells out hosannas at the least provocation. But then Lee went even farther\u2026\n\n\u201cImagine for a moment the impression this audience could leave a candidate if each of you refused to give a standing ovation to every trite one-liner, every empty platitude, or every hollow political slogan that you hear over the next day and a half \u2014 and yeah you will hear some of those.\u201d\n\nWell, ouch. This audience might as well go home, right? If they are being told not to cheer on hollow political slogans, what the hell else are they going to do?\n\nAnyway, Lee was followed by a panel of \u201cmillennials\u201d to give the GOP some hope that it won\u2019t soon become irrelevant because of inexorable demographic changes.\n\nAnd this was the opportunity for Mia Love, the young, African-American representative from Utah, who is a Mormon, to shine. She\u2019s quite good as a speaker, and she defies many of the stereotypes about both black Americans and Republicans, but it\u2019s hard to see her inspiring a mass shift of black voters to her side.\n\nBut she does try. Repeatedly, she tries to convince listeners that government efforts to help out minority Americans are actually victimizing them, and that the conservative vision of limited government is the best way to \u201cfree\u201d the poor.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones that care about the poor,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Left does the opposite and brings everyone down to the lowest common denominator.\u201d\n\nThe CPAC audience ate that up, and by this time they\u2019d no doubt shaken off Mike Lee\u2019s instructions: They can applaud whatever bullshit gets tossed their way, thank goodness.\n\nVIDEO: Watch this segment of Mike Lee bumming out the CPAC crowd\u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/CPACMiaLove3-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Utah GOP representative Mia Love: \u2018We are the ones that care about the poor\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b13\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are the ones that care about the poor,\u201d she said.\nWhich is ironic, considering what the next speaker, Utah\u2019s Senator Mike Lee, had to say.\nProbable presidential candidate and former neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson started things off by suggesting that conservatives should try to kill the IRS, which roused the crowd.\nVIDEO: Watch this segment of Mike Lee bumming out the CPAC crowd\u2026\n\u201cWhen conservatives elevate unserious presidential candidates, candidates who are not principled, positive, and proven, it\u2019s not the media\u2019s fault."}
