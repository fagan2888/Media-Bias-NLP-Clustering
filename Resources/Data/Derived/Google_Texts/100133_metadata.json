The greasy leather of a cow carcasses\u2019 neck, still stretched out for a drink. And the hot hiss of rain, falling for the first time in two years on a parched bean field: too little, too late.\n\nThe drought, Brazil\u2019s worst in decades, is a catastrophe.\n\nIn economic terms, it was the fourth-worst natural disaster to hit the planet last year, costlier than even the western United States drought, for a total cost of almost $9 billion, according to insurance analyst Aon Benfield, which researches natural disasters worldwide.\n\nAnd in much of the region it\u2019s ongoing.\n\nAdd to that a debilitating water shortage in southeastern Brazil and dry weather is now shaping up to be a major challenge for South America\u2018s largest nation, an agricultural powerhouse, that\u2019s set to host soccer\u2019s World Cup this year and the 2016 Olympics.\n\nDroughts and desertification are also destroying once arable, inhabitable land from North America to Europe to Africa and Asia. Scientists and officials point to the extreme weather patterns as a sign that climate change is here, although some experts insist their region\u2019s case is unconnected to world climate trends.\n\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff promised last August to increase aid to the northeastern Brazilian Sertao region, whose more than 20 million people make it one of the world\u2019s most populated semi-arid zones.\n\nStill, agriculture across much of the Sertao has been decimated. The region has lost more than 26 million tons of crops and millions of cows, goats, sheep and other livestock, estimates the Banco do Nordeste, a regional development bank.\n\nA seven-day road trip by GlobalPost correspondents through the most hard-hit towns of Bahia and Pernambuco states in mid-November offered a window into the human cost of the drought.\n\nOn the road, families described losing practically everything. Residents spoke of clinging to their livelihoods by keeping a few choice animals alive, and resorting to grinding up cactuses to feed their livestock.\n\nPeople are not starving because of the drought.\n\nBrazil\u2019s famous government programs like Bolsa Familia, a monthly cash payment to needy families, are keeping staples like rice and beans on tables across the region. Many rural residents also receive monthly water deliveries.\n\nHistorically, droughts in the northeast have killed thousands of people or led to mass migrations to the cities of the southeast. Just a decade ago, droughts often led to looting as hungry farmers invaded supermarkets to feed their families.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s different.\n\nRural northeastern Brazil isn\u2019t dying, but it is being held back \u2014 its development and modernization delayed until the rains are back to normal.\n\nAs such, the drought exemplifies the broader economic and political challenges facing Brazil. As this vast South American country cools from a decade of \u201cmiracle\u201d growth, economists warn that stagnation awaits Brazil unless Rousseff\u2019s government makes significant investments in infrastructure and education.\n\nThe world is transfixed on the country\u2019s megacities that are racing to get ready for all the games they will be hosting.\n\nInternational media is paying close attention to the severe water shortage near one major host city, Sao Paulo. It prompted Brazil to lower its 2014 fiscal goal this week, Reuters reported. Shrinking reservoirs mean lower production at hydroelectric dams, which is forcing the Brazilian government to spend more on energy.\n\nMeanwhile, the more prolonged drought in the northeast has remained largely obscured from public view outside Brazil.\n\nThis dusty, far-flung region is mainly composed of small, subsistence farms, in addition to some bigger sugar cane and soybean plantations. There are no major soccer stadiums in the Sertao \u2014 which means something like \u201cbackwoods\u201d or \u201coutback\u201d \u2014 and families here said they\u2019ve felt largely forgotten.\n\nBut the plight of the northeast farmer has long been a powerful tool in Brazilian politics, said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, in Washington, DC.\n\nWith a general election set for this October, Brazil\u2019s long-term response to the drought is a key test for the government.\n\nPutting on a stellar World Cup is one thing. Stunning the world with Olympic Games is another. But once the crowds go home, Brazil will still have to show it can provide long-term solutions to residents and voters across the country.\n\n\u201cThe technical resources are there, the solutions are there, so let\u2019s get on with the show and avoid this problem in the future,\u201d Sotero said.\n\n\u201cA country like Brazil, which wants to show the world it has progressed into the middle-class, should have already solved this problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Drought in Brazil\u2013 the biggest disaster you\u2019ve probably never heard of", "title": "Drought in Brazil\u2013 the biggest disaster you\u2019ve probably never heard of", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/14/drought-in-brazil-the-biggest-disaster-youve-probably-never-heard-of/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140215__p_fd9bb40a-8ea3-4631-b965-1504af6d3998lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 429}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140215__p_fd9bb40a-8ea3-4631-b965-1504af6d3998lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-15T04:02:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T22:56:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd170a\"", "article_summary": "Rural northeastern Brazil isn\u2019t dying, but it is being held back \u2014 its development and modernization delayed until the rains are back to normal.\nRECIFE, Brazil \u2014 Northeastern Brazil\u2019s two-year drought is written in textures.\nMeanwhile, the more prolonged drought in the northeast has remained largely obscured from public view outside Brazil.\n\u201cA country like Brazil, which wants to show the world it has progressed into the middle-class, should have already solved this problem.\u201d\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff promised last August to increase aid to the northeastern Brazilian Sertao region, whose more than 20 million people make it one of the world\u2019s most populated semi-arid zones."}
