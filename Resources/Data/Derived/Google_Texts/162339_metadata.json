Gallup interviewed people from January through December 2014 and compared the results with surveys during the same time frame for 2013.\n\nPeople could begin signing up for ACA benefits starting in October 2013, for coverage that began in January 2014. The subsidized benefits are available to those who earn between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level and can\u2019t get coverage through an employer. Many are self-employed or part-time workers.\n\nOne of the newly insured was Lisa Mae Parker, 54, of Parsonsfield, who obtained ACA coverage in 2014 so she could start her cake decorating business.\n\n\u201cI feel like (the ACA) has really helped people,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI\u2019d much rather know my neighbors have coverage and are taken care of.\u201d\n\nThe 4.5 percentage-point drop in 2014 still left about 125,000 adults in the state without health insurance. All of Maine\u2019s children are insured, either through private insurance or MaineCare.\n\nAlthough Maine\u2019s uninsured rate is lower than the national average, it is higher than all of the other New England states except for New Hampshire, where 12.8 percent of the population lacks insurance. At 4.6 percent, Massachusetts, which created a similar health insurance system in 2006 under former Gov. Mitt Romney, has the fewest uninsured residents.\n\n\u201cThis shows that people really value insurance,\u201d said Emily Brostek, executive director of Augusta-based Consumers for Affordable Health Care, a nonprofit specializing in health policy. \u201cBut when we look to our neighbors, Maine is still lagging behind.\u201d\n\nMEDICAID EXPANSION, OTHER FACTORS PLAY ROLE\n\nAlthough New Hampshire currently has a higher percentage of uninsured than Maine, that may not be the case in upcoming years because New Hampshire recently agreed to expand Medicaid under a compromise plan crafted by Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan and a bipartisan group of state lawmakers. Medicaid expansion is a key component of how the law reduces the rolls of the uninsured, but a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2012 changed Medicaid expansion from mandatory for the states to voluntary.\n\nMaine Gov. Paul LePage has vetoed several attempts to participate in the voluntary Medicaid expansion, arguing that the state cannot afford the cost of expansion.\n\nThe states with the lowest uninsured rates \u2013 including Massachusetts, Connecticut and Minnesota \u2013 have all expanded Medicaid, according to the Gallup poll.\n\nBrostek said the uninsured rate\u2019s significant decline is an indication that many who are signing up were previously uninsured, as opposed to people simply switching from a previous plan to the ACA.\n\nThe rebounding economy, people securing health benefits through an employer, and health-care advocates\u2019 grass-roots efforts to sign up Mainers for ACA coverage also could have played roles in the decline, said Mitchell Stein, a Cumberland-based health policy analyst.\n\nFifty-three percent of those eligible for marketplace coverage had signed up in Maine through this year\u2019s Feb. 15 deadline, far above the national average of 37 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nStein said many of the states that did not expand Medicaid have much higher uninsured rates than Maine.\n\n\u201cMaine was starting off from a much better place,\u201d Stein said. For instance, Montana, which did not expand Medicaid, saw its uninsured population decline from 20.7 to 15.8 percent.\n\nSWITCH TO ACA COVERAGE HAS DRAWBACKS\n\nWhen Maine trimmed the Medicaid rolls by tightening eligibility, the number of Mainers who have Medicaid declined from 367,000 to 290,000, according to the LePage administration. Maine\u2019s uninsured rate increased from 14.8 in 2012 to 16.1 in 2013, before the decline to 11.6 percent in 2014.\n\nThat\u2019s an indication that many who were kicked off of Medicaid purchased ACA insurance, a fact often highlighted by the LePage administration. Maine Republicans encouraged people who had lost Medicaid coverage to apply for ACA insurance on healthcare.gov.\n\nStein said that although it\u2019s good that many had the option to purchase marketplace insurance, using that insurance for more than preventive screenings could prove difficult.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re living on the financial edge, you\u2019re one appendectomy away from being bankrupt,\u201d Stein said, explaining that an expensive medical procedure, even for the insured, can result in thousands owed for deductibles and co-payments.\n\nBut Dr. Dora Anne Mills, vice president for clinical affairs at the University of New England, said the drop in the uninsured rate should help control overall health care costs.\n\n\u201cLack of access is one of the major barriers to receiving health care. If you\u2019re afraid of the bill, you\u2019re not going to seek care,\u201d Mills said. \u201cYou are going to have stability in the health care industry and a healthier population.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The number fell to 11.6 percent in 2014, the first year with a health care marketplace, but other factors also may have played a role.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The number fell to 11.6 percent in 2014, the first year with a health care marketplace, but other factors also may have played a role.", "title": "Maine's uninsured rate dropped in first year of Affordable Care Act, poll shows - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Health-Overhaul-Consu_Acco.jpg", "height": 324}, "updated_time": "2015-02-25T09:41:22-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/02/24/number-of-mainers-without-health-insurance-plummets-poll-finds/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The number fell to 11.6 percent in 2014, the first year with a health care marketplace, but other factors also may have played a role.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Health-Overhaul-Consu_Acco.jpg", "title": "Maine's uninsured rate dropped in first year of Affordable Care Act, poll shows - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-02-24T13:13:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-25T09:41:22-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Maine\u2019s uninsured rate dropped by more than one-fourth in 2014, the first full year that subsidized benefits were available through the Affordable Care Act, according to a Gallup poll released Tuesday.\nMaine\u2019s uninsured rate increased from 14.8 in 2012 to 16.1 in 2013, before the decline to 11.6 percent in 2014.\n\u201cYou are going to have stability in the health care industry and a healthier population.\u201d\n\u201cThis shows that people really value insurance,\u201d said Emily Brostek, executive director of Augusta-based Consumers for Affordable Health Care, a nonprofit specializing in health policy.\nBut Dr. Dora Anne Mills, vice president for clinical affairs at the University of New England, said the drop in the uninsured rate should help control overall health care costs."}
