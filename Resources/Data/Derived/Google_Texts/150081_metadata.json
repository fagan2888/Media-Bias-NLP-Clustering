Obviously Obamacare is an extremely polarizing law, but polls that ask simple approve/disapprove questions fail to capture the number of people who disapprove of Obamacare only because it doesn't go far enough. When you break down the answers further, it turns out that, although Obamacare isn't going to win any awards for most popular law ever, it's still reasonably well regarded.
