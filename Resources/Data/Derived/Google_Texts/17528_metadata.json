West Virginia was the only team to beat the Bears in the regular season a year ago before they were the first team left out of the inaugural College Football Playoff.\n\nShelton Gibson had a tying 70-yard catch-and-run touchdown on West Virginia\u2019s third play after Baylor took a 7-0 lead on Seth Russell\u2019s 16-yard touchdown run less than a minute in on the game\u2019s fourth play.\n\nThe Mountaineers (3-3, 0-3) never caught up again after Coleman\u2019s 2-yard touchdown catch on the next drive made it 14-7 and matched Kendall Wright\u2019s school record of 14.\n\n\u201cAgainst a team like Baylor, if you\u2019re not scoring every time, then there\u2019s a chance that they could turn out that way,\u201d said West Virginia quarterback Skyler Howard, who finished 18 of 37 for 289 yards with four touchdowns.\n\nGibson added a 100-yard kickoff return with 1:05 left, right after Baylor (6-0, 3-0) surpassed 60 points for the fifth game in a row on backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham\u2019s 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Trevor Clemons-Valdez.\n\nThe Bears won their Football Bowl Subdivision-best 19th consecutive home game.\n\n\u201cReally good win against really the only Big 12 team that we don\u2019t have a winning record against since 2011,\u201d Baylor coach Art Briles said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal for us as a program. We felt a lot of desire, a lot of need to clear our name. We didn\u2019t feel like we had a good name in West Virginia, so that was kind of our motivating factor.\u201d\n\nWest Virginia was coming off an overtime loss at home against 16th-ranked Oklahoma State.\n\n\u201cAnother hard-fought loss. Won\u2019t back down and keep fighting,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best Baylor team I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nRussell became the only Baylor quarterback other than Robert Griffin III in 2011 to throw for 300 yards and run for 100 in the same game. Russell was 20 of 33 for 380 yards and five touchdown passes, and ran 14 times for 160 yards with another score.\n\nRussell\u2019s FBS-best 27 touchdown passes are within reach of the school record of 37 by Griffin in 2011. With 10 catches for 199 yards, Coleman had his fourth consecutive game with multiple touchdowns and his seventh in a row with at least 100 yards receiving. Howard threw a 35-yard touchdown to David Stills midway through the third quarter, getting West Virginia within 34-24. But Russell then threw touchdown passes of 36 and 52 yards to Jay Lee in a span of just over 4 minutes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that put pressure on him,\u201d Holgorsen said of Howard, who is from Fort Worth, Texas. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to listen, he\u2019s not going to quit fighting. I\u2019m proud of him for his attitude, his work ethic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The No. 2 Bears stiff-armed West Virginia for most of the first three quarters before pulling away to win Saturday at McLane Stadium.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "WACO, Texas \u2014 West Virginia quickly responded to the first and last scores by second-ranked Baylor.
