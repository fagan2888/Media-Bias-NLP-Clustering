President Obama\u2019s health care law envisions them continuing to play an important role going forward, raising the stakes for the problems unmasked in the investigation.\n\n\u201cBecause many of the events that we identified were preventable, our study confirms the need and opportunity for SNFs to significantly reduce the incidence of resident-harm events,\u201d the inspector general concluded.\n\nInvestigators said 22 percent of Medicare patients developed serious medical problems as a result of their stay, many of which required hospitalization to treat.\n\nThe most common mistake investigators found had to do with medication, usually with nursing staff giving patients the wrong kind or wrong dosages, or patients having an allergic reaction to the meds.\n\nMedicare, one of the largest government programs in terms of spending, has often drawn criticism from Capitol Hill lawmakers who say the program isn\u2019t doing enough to combat waste or isn\u2019t transparent.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers have a right to see how their dollars are being spent,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, a leading advocate for spending reform, last year. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a special exception for hard-earned dollars that happen to be spent through Medicare.\u201d\n\nSen. Bill Nelson, Florida Democrat, said at a committee hearing last year that the government must be mindful of the cost of the program and how much mistakes can not only hurt patients, but cost taxpayers.\n\n\u201cAs more and more baby boomers retire and health care costs continue to rise, Medicare spending could reach $1 trillion by 2023,\u201d he said. \u201cReducing hospital readmissions will not only save the Medicare program billions, it will save beneficiaries from potential infection and further out-of-pocket expense.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said they are compiling lists of the most common medical mistakes, and preparing better training for doctors on how to avoid the mishaps.\n\n\u201cCMS fully concurs with [the inspector general] on the importance of identifying avoidable adverse events among nursing-home residents and improving the quality of life and care for nursing-home residents,\u201d a response from the agency said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, will require nursing homes and similar facilities to report their safety records to federal watchdogs. The inspector general said it\u2019s too soon to tell if this will have a noticeable impact on reducing medical mistakes.\n\nIn addition to the harm done to patients, inspectors said, the mistakes were a large financial burden on Medicare for having to pay for hospital treatment.\n\n\u201cMost of these residents died at hospitals rather than in the SNFs where the harm occurred, having been transferred back to the hospitals for higher-level treatment as a result of the event,\u201d the inspector general said.\n\nHospital trips owning to mistakes by medical staff cost taxpayers $2.8 billion in a single year, according to the report. But, the inspector general warned, \u201cthe full costs associated with these events are likely greater than our estimate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "One-third of all Medicare patients treated at skilled nursing facilities suffered some form of harm from medication errors, medical mistakes or infections, according to a government investigation that raises red flags about the quality of America\u2019s health care as the industry transitions to Obamacare.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "One-third of all Medicare patients treated at skilled nursing facilities suffered some form of harm from medication errors, medical mistakes or infections, according to a government investigation that raises red flags about the quality of America\u2019s health care as the industry transitions to Obamacare.", "title": "Obamacare harbinger?
