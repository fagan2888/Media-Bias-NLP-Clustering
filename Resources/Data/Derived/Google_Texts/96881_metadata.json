He owns Truston Technologies, a Lafayette-based company that specializes in marine construction for the Navy.\n\nOne of the root causes of Southwest Louisiana\u2019s coastal problems, Knezek said, is the nation\u2019s construction of the levee system. While the system has protected large cities like Baton Rouge and New Orleans, it has \u201cstarved the rest of the state from necessary nourishment and sediment deposits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need a congressman who can explain that eloquently to the other congressmen so they understand we need their help,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 50-state solution to protect our coast, not just a one-state solution.\u201d\n\nKnezek spoke of how much the local economy depends on the Port of Lake Charles. He said he understands the importance of dredging waterways to their federally authorized dimensions.\n\n\u201cOutside of being a navigation and safety issue, it\u2019s a commerce issue,\u201d he said.\n\nKnezek said the spread of employees between the Alexandria Veterans Affairs facility and the two VA clinics between Lafayette and Lake Charles should be addressed. He said the Alexandria facility has just over 1,200 employees, while 80 employees staff the other two clinics.\n\nKnezek said he opposes the Affordable Care Act and wants the federal government to step out of \u201cevery aspect of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a job preservation mentality for a lot of government employees,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that government employees are bad, it\u2019s that the bureaucracy is continuing to grow our government. At some point you have to say enough is enough.\u201d\n\nHe addressed the July shooting at the Grand 16 movie theater in Lafayette that left three people dead, including the gunman. The problem, he said, is \u201cour lack of attention and failures into the mental health process.\u201d\n\nIf elected, Knezek said he won\u2019t eventually run for governor or the U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our delegation over the last few years, we have lost a significant amount of seniority,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need someone willing to serve long enough.\u201d\n\nCharles Boustany who holds the 3rd District seat, is running for the U.S. Senate seat now held by David Vitter. Vitter is not running for re-election.\n\nThe other Republican candidates for the district seat include Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, former state Rep. Brett Geymann, former U.S. Ambassador Grover Rees, and businessmen Greg Ellison and Gus Rantz.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "American Press, Press, newspaper, paper, media, Lake Charles, Calcasieu, Cameron, Beauregard, Jeff Davis, Allen, Southwest Louisiana, Louisiana, Lake Area, community events in Southwest Louisiana, stories, photography, journalism, reporting, pictures, videos, news, sports, entertainment, life, obits, health, politics, crime, police, festivals, events, breaking, blogs, entertainment, arts, marquee, parish, coverage, McNeese, Cowboys, LSU, Tigers, college football, prep, high school, football, baseball, basketball, soccer, hockey, NASCAR, NFL, Saints, New Orleans, weddings, printing, engagements, anniversaries, shutter bugs, bragging rights, classifieds, advertising, rates, ads, real estate, automobiles, garage sales, comics, sales, retail, local, coupons, discount, deals, Anacoco, Barbe, Basile, Bell City, Bethel Christian, DeQuincy, DeRidder, East Beauregard, Elizabeth, Elton, Evans, Fairview, Grand Lake, Hackberry, Hamilton Christian, Hathaway, Hicks, Hyatt, Iota, Iowa, Jennings, Johnson Bayou, Kinder, Lacassine, LaGrange, Lake Arthur, Leesville, Merryville, Midland, Oakdale, Oberlin, Pickering, Pitkin, Reeves, Rosepine, St. Louis, Sam Houston, Simpson, Singer, South Beauregard, South Cameron, Starks, Sulphur, Vinton, Washington-Marion, Welsh, Westlake, Plainview, Ararat, Belfield, Bell City, Bellevue, Big Woods, Bon Air, Bridge Junction, Brimstone, Buhler, Carlyss, Chalkley, Chloe, DeQuincy, Edgerly, Ged, Gillis, Goosport, Goss, Greinwich Village, Hargrove, Hayes, Hecker, Hipple, Hollywood, Holmwood, Iowa, Lake Charles, Le Bleu, Lockmoor, Lucas, Lunita, Mallard Junction, Manchester, Maplewood, Moss Bluff, Moss Lake, Mossville, Newton, Niblett Bluff, Perkins, Prien, Rose Bluff, Rossignol, Starks, Stegall, Sulphur, Toomey, University Place, Verret, Vinton, Westlake, Cameron, Creole, Gibbstown, Grand Chenier, Grand Lake, Hackberry, Holly Beach, Illinois Plant, Lone Pine, Lowry, North Island, Oak Grove, Peveto Beach, Sweet Lake, Bancroft, Bivens, Bon Ami, Carson, DeRidder, Dry Creek, Fields, Fulton, Gaytine, Gordon, Helme, Hite, Ikes, Juanita, Junction, Kernan, Longville, Ludington, Merryville, Neale, Oretta, Ragley, Seale, Shear, Singer, Sugartown, Tulla, Turps, , Barnsdall, Buller, China, Edna, Elton, Fenton, Fontenot, Foremans Hall, Hathaway, Jennings, Lacassine, Lake Arthur, Niblett, Panchoville, Pine Island, Raymond, Roanoke, Silverwood, Thornwell, Topsy, Welsh, Woodlawn, Bel, Bond, Elder, Elizabeth, Foley, Grant, Hampton, Harmony, Indian Village, Kinder, Lauderdale, Le Blanc, Mittie, Oakdale, Oberlin, Pawnee, Reeves, Reids, Simmons Settlement, Stanley, Ward, Warren Arceneaux, Michael Cooper, Eric Cormier, Bobby Dower, Jim Gazzolo, John Guidroz, Laura Heller, Alex Hickey, Scooter Hobbs, Johnathan Manning, Andrew Perzo, Informer, Natalie Stewart", "google-site-verification": "A7PixE80w7ozjQvQ1VVILSIF1XElrnpDPkBzxNP4PLY", "description": "A candidate for Louisiana\u2019s 3rd Congressional District seat said his main priority would be to maintain navigable waterways and build a coalition to protect Southwest Louisiana\u2019s coastline ...", "p": {"domain_verify": "8346ce6bb2563b1ecb0a1e70c3d14984"}, "title": "Knezek to run for La. 3rd Congressional District"}, "article_summary": "\u201cRight now, we have the attention of the nation for the first time in history to protect our coast,\u201d businessman Erick Knezek told the American Press editorial board Thursday.\nThe other Republican candidates for the district seat include Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, former state Rep.
