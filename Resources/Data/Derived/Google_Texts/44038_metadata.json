Rumors that, you know, he started himself.\n\nCowher is now at it again, sending mixed signals about whether he\u2019ll ever return to the game he left nearly seven years ago.\n\n\u201cI had the best job in the NFL,\u201d Cowher tells Ed Bouchette of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \u201cI realize that, that\u2019s why all the talk about me coming back is just that. I had the best job in the league; I didn\u2019t get out of it to get back in it.\u201d\n\nSo you\u2019re done, right?\n\n\u201cI would never say that,\u201d Cowher said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll feel in two years. Never say \u2018never\u2019 because then you become a hypocrite. I\u2019ve seen too many other people in my profession say \u2018never\u2019 and come back. Always keep doors open in life, that\u2019s the important thing to do.\u201d\n\nHow Cowher feels in the future will depend in large part on when Tom Coughlin stops coaching the Giants. Former Steelers running back Jerome Bettis, who knew (possibly before Cowher did) that 2006 would be Cowher\u2019s final year in Pittsburgh has said repeatedly that Cowher wants to coach the Giants.\n\nCowher will get a taste of the stadium in which the Giants play on Sunday, since he\u2019ll be joining the booth at MetLife Stadium to call the Steelers-Jets game.\n\nThe way things are going in Pittsburgh, maybe Cowher eventually will get another crack at the best job in the league.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In January, Bill Cowher disputed rumors that he plans to coach again.\u00a0 Rumors that, you know, he started himself.
