Included are Mr. Obama\u2019s mentoring as a teen by Communist Party writer Frank Marshall Davis, Mr. Obama\u2019s political \u201ccoming out\u201d at the Chicago home of Weather Underground terrorists Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, his attending for 20 years the church of \u201cblack liberation theology\u201d pastor Jeremiah Wright and his appointing Communist Party \u201ctruther\u201d Van Jones as White House \u201cgreen jobs czar.\u201d\n\nThat just scratches the surface. So, when I viewed the photo last week of Mr. Obama standing with Cuban communists in front of a huge, iconic image of Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara in Havana, I thought of Miss Jackson.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine what Cubans who fled Castro\u2019s regime and lost family members must have felt seeing the American president looking right at home in front of that enormous portrait.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s time for Miss Jackson to update the song, adding verses about Obamacare, our LGBT-enhanced military, the government takeover of student loans, massive spending, the rise of the Free Stuff Army, the authoritarian abuses of the IRS and EPA and other steps along Mr. Obama\u2019s road to socialism.\n\nWhen Cuban dictator Raul Castro chided America for our \u201cdouble standard\u201d on human rights, citing the military prison in Guantanamo Bay and alleged failings in health care, education, and equal pay, Mr. Obama said, \u201cI actually welcome President Castro commenting on some of the areas where he feels we\u2019re falling short.\u201d\n\nThe ghost of Che Guevara must have been laughing in delight.\n\nThe Argentine-born Marxist in the beret with a single star who symbolizes the Cuban revolution has a special place in the hearts of progressives, who regard him as a Latin version of Samuel Adams. Che\u2019s image adorns T-shirts, handbags and many other products.\n\nIn the 2004 film \u201cThe Motorcycle Diaries,\u201d for which Robert Redford was an executive producer, Che is a youthful hedonist and budding idealist who develops a revolutionary zeal to help the poor. Unfortunately, Che chose Vladimir Lenin as a role model instead of someone like Mother Teresa, and he became Fidel Castro\u2019s homicidal enforcer until he was killed in Bolivia in 1967.\n\nIn the interests of historical veracity, here are a few inconvenient facts courtesy of Peruvian writer Alvaro Vargas Llosa, from a 2005 New Republic article, \u201cThe Killing Machine\u201d: \u201cIn April 1967, speaking from experience, [Che] summed up his homicidal idea of justice in his \u2018Message to the Tricontinental\u2019: \u2018hatred as an element of struggle; unbending hatred for the enemy, which pushes a human being beyond his natural limitations, making him into an effective, violent, selective, and cold-blooded killing machine.\u2019\u201d Just the sort of person you want kids to emulate.\n\nFor a time, Guevara ran the notorious La Cabana prison, executing hundreds of people the Castros found troublesome. One surviving inmate recalled early morning executions of many who died shouting \u201c\u2018Long live Christ the King!\u2019\u201d\n\nLater, Guevara presided over mass incarcerations.\n\n\u201cHerded into buses and trucks, the \u2018unfit\u2019 would be transported at gunpoint into concentration camps,\u201d Llosa wrote. \u201c. Some would never return; others would be raped, beaten, or mutilated.\u201d\n\nIn 1961, after the Cuban Missile Crisis ended, a disappointed Guevara told a British communist daily: \u201cIf the rockets had remained, we would have used them all and directed them against the very heart of the United States, including New York.\u201d\n\nMaybe that quote should go on the next Che T-shirt sold in Times Square.\n\nBesides his group shot in front of Che, there\u2019s another enduring image of Mr. Obama\u2019s visit to Cuba. There he is, doing \u201cthe wave\u201d with Raul Castro at a baseball game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays (who won 4-1). The comradely scene unfolded the same day Islamist terrorists slaughtered dozens in Brussels, Belgium, including several Americans. Mr. Obama did devote 51 seconds of his 34-minute Havana remarks to the massacre.\n\nLeaving Cuba, Mr. Obama went to Argentina, where in a Q&A with students, he made an astounding statement of moral equivalence.\n\n\u201cOften in the past there\u2019s been a sharp division between left and right, between capitalist and communist or socialist. Oh, you know, you\u2019re a capitalist Yankee dog, and oh, you know, you\u2019re some crazy communist that\u2019s going to take away everybody\u2019s property. those are interesting intellectual arguments, but I think for your generation, you should be practical and just choose from what works.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time for Victoria Jackson to break out her ukulele again.\n\nObama in Havana\n\n\u2022 Robert Knight is a senior fellow for the American Civil Rights Union.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six years ago, comedienne Victoria Jackson made a funny but serious video playing the ukulele and singing in little girl voice, \"There's a Communist Living in the White House!\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Six years ago, comedienne Victoria Jackson made a funny but serious video playing the ukulele and singing in little girl voice, \u201cThere\u2019s a Communist Living in the White House!\u201d", "title": "ROBERT KNIGHT: Obama\u2019s trip to Cuba enables communists", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/robert-knight-obamas-trip-to-cuba-enables-communis/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/27/3_272016_b3-obama-cuba-che8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/27/3_272016_b3-obama-cuba-che8201.jpg", "description": "Six years ago, comedienne Victoria Jackson made a funny but serious video playing the ukulele and singing in little girl voice, \"There's a Communist Living in the White House!\"", "card": "summary", "title": "ROBERT KNIGHT: Obama\u2019s trip to Cuba enables communists"}, "Author": "Robert Knight", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Victoria Jackson, Havana"}, "article_summary": "Besides his group shot in front of Che, there\u2019s another enduring image of Mr. Obama\u2019s visit to Cuba.\nLeaving Cuba, Mr. Obama went to Argentina, where in a Q&A with students, he made an astounding statement of moral equivalence.\nMr. Obama did devote 51 seconds of his 34-minute Havana remarks to the massacre.\nObama in Havana\u2022 Robert Knight is a senior fellow for the American Civil Rights Union.\nSo, when I viewed the photo last week of Mr. Obama standing with Cuban communists in front of a huge, iconic image of Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara in Havana, I thought of Miss Jackson."}
