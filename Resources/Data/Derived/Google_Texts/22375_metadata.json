But what about within the camp that supported the decision in Hobby Lobby? Was there some conservative vs. libertarian split?\n\nWell, as it happens, one of the icons of the libertarian legal movement, my former professor Richard Epstein, contributed an article to the most recent volume of the Cato Supreme Court Review. He concluded that Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s majority opinion reached the right result for the wrong reason, that the Court should\u2019ve rejected the mandate because the government didn\u2019t have a compelling interest to advance not because it didn\u2019t use the least-restrictive means to advance it.\n\nEpstein wasn\u2019t able to attend our Constitution Day symposium, however, so Ed Whelan \u2013 president of the conservative Ethics & Public Policy Center and noted legal contributor to National Review Online \u2013 took Epstein\u2019s place in discussing Hobby Lobby. Whelan took issue with Epstein\u2019s approach; during the panel [see starting at 35:00] his comments about the Review article were akin to Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s \u201cblistering concurrences\u201d this term, agreeing with little other than the final judgment.\n\nSo this sounds ripe for the libertarian-versus-conservative trope, right? Maybe Epstein focused on liberty and Whelan on religion? Actually not really; (most of) their dispute is more about principle with pragmatism.\n\nWhelan\u2019s main line of attack, which he wrote up for NRO\u2019s Bench Memos blog, is that Epstein failed to take into account the need to get five votes for an ultimate ruling. \u201cThe short answer to Epstein\u2019s argument that Alito should have ruled on this basis is that Alito doesn\u2019t have four colleagues who are Richard Epstein.\u201d\n\nEpstein replied \u2013 which reply Whelan graciously had posted on NRO, along with the rest of their debate \u2013 that they were \u201coperating on different levels.\u201d \u201cWhelan\u2019s short answer is no answer at all. For all I know, Justice Alito could not have garnered even his own vote for the position I espouse.\u201d Epstein argued for the \u201cnecessity for normative analysis.\u201d\n\nWhelan retorted that they were both analyzing the \u201cintellectual and tactical\u201d perspectives of the ruling:\n\nDo I think that Epstein\u2019s \u201cnormative case\u201d is \u201cwrong or correct\u201d? That depends on what Epstein means by the question. If he is asking whether I think it is (to use his phrase) \u201can extravagant abuse of state power\u201d to \u201cforce a religious group to act against its conscience by supplying standardized products that are available in competitive markets,\u201d my answer is a definite yes\u2026 . But if Epstein is asking whether I think that the term compelling governmental interest in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act should be construed according to libertarian principles, I\u2019ll have to express my doubts. Under an original public-meaning approach to statutory interpretation, the relevant inquiry is whether the public meaning of compelling governmental interest at the time that RFRA was enacted would support Epstein\u2019s position. I\u2019m not aware of any showing that it would.\n\nSo here at last we do have some engagement on the same (normative) field of play. Epstein did have one final point to clarify, however, saying that\n\nWhelan\u2019s reading cuts the salami too fine. Justice Alito observes that it is open to \u201cthe Government to assume the cost of providing the four contraceptives at issue to any women who are unable to obtain them under their health-insurance policies due to their employers\u2019 religious objections.\u201d He then adds \u201cWe therefore conclude that this system constitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Government\u2019s aims while providing greater respect for religious liberty\u201d (emphasis added). In my view, this method is not just a viable alternative, but an ideal method which could apply across the board, including the Wheaton College application [which involved a nonprofit religious employer]. Indeed, what would a better accommodation look like? \u2026 It is therefore a far cleaner resolution to rule in favor of Wheaton College on the merits by making it clear, as I have argued, that the state did not satisfy the compelling-interest standard. The fact that Whelan and I can disagree over the correct reading of the Alito opinion shows at the very least the elusive interpretation of a question that need not have been addressed in the first place.\n\nEpstein has one ultimate sur-reply to that, which ends, amusingly: \u201cHow odd that Sotomayor seems to fare better with Epstein than she did with Justice Breyer (who didn\u2019t dissent in Wheaton College).\u201d\n\nI find things to agree with in both writers\u2019 presentation, and I commend this series of writings to anyone who wants to \u201cunpack\u201d (as the academics say) some of the rich debate on Hobby Lobby even among the ruling\u2019s supporters.\n\nIncidentally, I have a book coming out about the case in November; co-authored with David Gans of the Constitutional Accountability Center, we debate the titular question, Religious Liberties for Corporations?
