I hate to be the one who ends the Mitt Romney 2016 talk, but… well, here it is:

That’s then-Governor Mitt Romney, at the ceremony for his health care bill, declaring, “There were contributors from outside government, as you know… Jonathan Gruber at MIT devoted hours and hours to an essential econometric model.”

Jonathan Gruber probably ranks among Republicans’ five most despised figures in the country right now… how would a Romney 2016 bid survive the criticism of working with “the architect of Obamacare” and the man who, to many conservatives, personifies the Obama administration’s arrogance and dishonesty?
