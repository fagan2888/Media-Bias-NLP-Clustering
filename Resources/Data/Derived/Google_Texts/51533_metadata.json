If those credits are eliminated, many Obamacare customers will be unable to afford their coverage and the entire system could collapse. Mr. Obama has long defended the legality of his namesake health care law, but he went further Monday by directly criticizing the Supreme Court for agreeing to hear the case. -- Source\n\nNo related posts.\n\nCopyright 1999-2016 Worthy News.
