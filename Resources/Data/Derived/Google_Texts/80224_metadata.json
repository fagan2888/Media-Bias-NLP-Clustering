And the real reason in many cases is not because you didn't behave well or were exposed to some bad environmental influence, it's just because that person was unlucky. It's losing the lottery.\"\n\nTomasetti said harmful mutations occur for \"no particular reason other than randomness\" as the body's master cells, called stem cells, divide in various tissues.\n\nTomasetti said the study indicates that changing one's lifestyle and habits like smoking to avoid cancer risks may help prevent certain cancers, but may not be as effective for others.\n\n\"Thus, we should focus more research and resources on finding ways to detect such cancers at early, curable stages,\" Tomasetti added.\n\nThe researchers charted the cumulative number of lifetime divisions in the stem cells of a given tissue \u2014 for example, lungs or colon \u2014 and compared that to the lifetime cancer risk in that tissue.\n\nGenerally speaking, tissues that undergo more divisions \u2014 thus increasing the probability of random mutations \u2014 were more prone to tumors.\n\nThe study did not cover all cancer types. Breast and prostate cancer were excluded because the researchers were unable to ascertain reliable stem cell division rates.\n\n(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Mohammad Zargham)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cause of cancer, genetic mutations, hereditary, leukemia, brain cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study looked at 31 different types of cancer and found that 22 of them could be explained mostly by random genetic mutations.", "title": "Two-Thirds of Cancers Are Due to Random Bad Luck", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/real-cause-cancer-over-two-thirds-cancers-are-due-random-bad-luck-not-genetics-or-316038", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/01/snake-eyes-dice-roll.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study looked at 31 different types of cancer and found that 22 of them could be explained mostly by random genetic mutations.", "title": "Two-Thirds of Cancers Are Due to Random Bad Luck", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/real-cause-cancer-over-two-thirds-cancers-are-due-random-bad-luck-not-genetics-or-316038", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/01/snake-eyes-dice-roll.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/01/snake-eyes-dice-roll.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-01-01T16:15:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-01T16:15:55-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study looked at 31 different types of cancer and found that 22 of them could be explained mostly by random genetic mutations."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd736e\"", "article_summary": "Two-thirds of cancer incidence of various types can be blamed on random mutations and not heredity or risky habits like smoking.\nOverall, they attributed 65 percent of cancer incidence to random mutations in genes that can drive cancer growth.\nGenerally speaking, tissues that undergo more divisions \u2014 thus increasing the probability of random mutations \u2014 were more prone to tumors.\nThey looked at 31 cancer types and found that 22 of them, including leukemia and pancreatic, bone, testicular, ovarian and brain cancer, could be explained largely by these random mutations \u2014 essentially biological bad luck.\nThe researchers said on Thursday random DNA mutations accumulating in various parts of the body during ordinary cell division are the prime culprits behind many cancer types."}
