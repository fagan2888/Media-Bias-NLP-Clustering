Bush, Media Criticism, Pew, Polls, presidents, The Fix, Politics News\n\nYesterday afternoon, the Washington Post\u2019s The Fix blog put up a post titled \u201cOn the competency question, Bush has always had Obama beat.\u201d A little while later, this same post appeared with a fresh new title: \u201cOn \u2018getting things done,\u2019 Bush has always had Obama beat.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with changing a headline to better reflect the argument of the post. But the content of the post remained the same, and, as with the original headline, uses public perceptions of a president\u2019s ability to \u201cget things done\u201d and \u201ccompetency\u201d analogously. Are they analogous? Nope. That\u2019s why we\u2019re writing a whole post in response!\n\nThe post compiles Pew data from both the W. Bush and Obama administrations on \u201coverall approval rating\u201d and \u201cthe percentage of people who say he can \u2018get things done\u2019 when he wants to.\u201d For each president, the movements in the two measures track each other in terms of broad ups and downs. Obama\u2019s approval rating and \u201cget things done\u201d percentage have seen their share of ups and downs; Bush\u2019s peak in mid-2003 and then effectively head straight downward for the next three years.\n\nThe Fix\u2019s point, though, is that for Bush, there was always a healthy gap between his approval rating and his \u201cget things done\u201d percentage: Respondents always judged his ability to \u201cget things done\u201d higher than they approved of his presidency. For most of Obama\u2019s presidency, on the other hand, the two measures have typically been closer \u2014 and recently, the percentage of people who think Obama can \u201cget things done\u201d has actually dipped below his overall approval rating.\n\nEven though The Fix uses polling data regarding a president\u2019s ability to \u201cget things done\u201d and even changed its headline to better reflect that, the piece is still littered with this word \u2014 \u201ccompetency\u201d \u2014 as a stand-in. \u201cObama\u2019s competency has long polled slightly higher than his overall approval rating \u2014 until last year,\u201d for example. Then: \u201cA look at Bush\u2019s presidency shows that Americans consistently rated his competency significantly higher than his overall job performance.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not going to argue that Obama is the most \u201ccompetent\u201d president in history and George W. Bush is the least. Neither really seems to make the Presidential All-Star team in that respect. But the question about a president\u2019s ability to \u201cget things done\u201d seems more an issue of how well Washington is working and the state of gridlock at any given time than about an individual president\u2019s competency.\n\nThere was a fair share of partisan battling and gridlock during Bush\u2019s time. But compared to the way it\u2019s been during most of the Obama administration? It makes the W. days look like a Golden Age of Compromise on the Potomac.\n\nAccording to the Pew data, the peak of Bush\u2019s overall approval rating, \u201cgetting things done\u201d figure, and the gap between the two was in mid-2003. And things sure were \u201cgetting done,\u201d then. We launched a fucking ground invasion of Iraq! President Bush and Congress were expanding Medicare to give old people prescription drugs, financed through deficits. A second wave of tax cuts was passing. For better or worse, the Bush administration was getting things done through a relatively cooperative Congress. By 2005-2006, though, the gap between the two measures narrows \u2014 as in, Bush\u2019s \u201cgetting things done\u201d figure collapses downhill more sharply than his also very sharply collapsing approval rating. (There is this one strange moment in the data, though, right around Hurricane Katrina, where Bush\u2019s approval rating instantly collapses while his \u201cgetting things done\u201d figure briefly ticks \u2026 upward? Huh? Points for \u201cgetting done\u201d the instant destruction of a major American city? We can all agree that if anything represents a failure of competency, it was Bush\u2019s handling of Katrina. So if the \u201cgetting things done\u201d figure goes up after that, the two measures can\u2019t be all that analogous.) Aside from that strange Katrina moment, though, the narrowed gap by mid-2006 could represent that Congress was no longer cooperating with him. His second-term domestic agenda, anchored by a partial-privatization of Social Security, didn\u2019t get anywhere, although the government was always properly funded and the debt ceiling was always raised on schedule.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington Post piece suggests a president's ability to \"get things done\" and \"competency\" are analogous.
