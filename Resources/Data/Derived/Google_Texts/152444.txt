For Chris Clark, the adjustment from left tackle, where he has played since college, to right tackle hasn’t been an easy transition.

After Clark started the Broncos’ first five games at right tackle, the Broncos are giving Paul Cornick the job today, according to three NFL sources.

It won’t be the easiest of starting debuts for Cornick as he will be matched up against San Francisco 49ers’ defensive end Justin Smith in the game tonight at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.

The 6-foot-6, 310-pound Cornick is an undrafted free agent from North Dakota State who spent his first two NFL seasons on the practice squads of the New York Jets (2012) and Broncos (2012-13).

He played in 21 offensive snaps last week in the team’s three offensive tackle package (Cornick was officially a tight end) and impressed the Broncos’ coaching staff.

Clark is a left tackle from Southern Mississippi who started 14 games, plus three more in the postseason in relief of the injured Ryan Clady last season. When Clady returned from injury this season, Clark was moved to right tackle where he beat out veteran Winston Justice for the job during the offseason practices.

Clark will be a backup tackle Sunday night.
