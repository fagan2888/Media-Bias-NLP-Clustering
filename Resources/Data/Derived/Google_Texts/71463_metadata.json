It is now at $8.75.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, which some call Obamacare, next year will require employers to provide health insurance coverage their full-time employees. The Massena Arby\u2019s has four full-timers, Lofberg said.\n\nHe said when Sears closed, he saw his business drop by about 20 percent.\n\n\u201cThe anchor store draws customers to the mall and other stores feed off the customers \u2026 it was a nail in the coffin when Sears left,\u201d he said.\n\nFurthermore, Lofberg attributes some of his loss of business to a decrease in value of the Canadian dollar.\n\nLofberg also owns the Potsdam Arby\u2019s, which is not on the chopping block, and said he offered the Massena store\u2019s four full-timers and three part-timers new positions, but doesn\u2019t know if it will work for them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve offered them, but it\u2019s hard with families,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying and fitting them in if we can, if they can get there (Potsdam.)\u201d\n\nHe also operates three Arby\u2019s in Jefferson County.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act, which some call Obamacare, next year will require employers to provide health insurance coverage their full-time employees.\nThe state has been ratcheting up the minimum wage since 2013, which will stop when it hits $9 per hour on Dec. 31.\nHe says the decision to close the Massena location is based on the state\u2019s minimum wage increase, Affordable Care Act mandates and the loss of mall anchor stores.\nHe also owns the Potsdam Arby\u2019s and said that store will remain open.\nThe Massena Arby\u2019s has four full-timers, Lofberg said."}
