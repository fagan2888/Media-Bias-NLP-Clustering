In fact, the analyst noted that ahead of a major election, P/E multiples for managed care companies and EV/EBITDA multiples for hospitals tend to trade at a discount to their 5-year averages heading into the election day.\n\nRelated Link: Credit Suisse Initiates Coverage On Health Care Facilities: HCA, Lifepoint At Outperform, Tenet, Universal Health At Neutral\n\nFidel said P/E multiples are \"well above\" the long-term trend in managed care, while EV/EBITDA multiples are \"slightly above\" the historical average.\n\n\"As the hospital stocks have come down from peak valuations seen earlier this year, we see some opportunities for entry points inside this pullback,\" Fidel wrote. \"However, we view above-average leverage entering a year of potentially rising interest rates and increased political uncertainty as key reasons to be on the sidelines for parts of the group, particularly in the context of our relatively cautious broader sentiment on the MCO/Facilities trading outlook heading into 2016.\"\n\nInitiations And Price Targets\n\nFidel suggested that investors invest in company-specific investment themes, including: 1) a strong market positioning, 2) margin expansion opportunities, and 3) upside potential from capital deployment.\n\nWith that said, the analyst initiated coverage of UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE: UNH), HCA Holdings Inc (NYSE: HCA), Centene Corp (NYSE: CNC), and LifePoint Health Inc (NASDAQ: LPNT) with Outperform ratings.\n\nFidel also initiated coverage of Aetna Inc (NYSE: AET), Humana Inc (NYSE: HUM), Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH), Tenet Healthcare Corp (NYSE: THC), and Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE: UHS) with Neutral ratings.\n\nFinally, the lone stock initiated with an Underperform rating was WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYSE: WCG).\n\nLatest Ratings for UNH Date Firm Action From To Apr 2016 Cleveland Initiates Coverage on Buy Mar 2016 Mizuho Securities Maintains Buy Mar 2016 Credit Suisse Maintains Outperform View More Analyst Ratings for UNH\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nPosted-In: Affordable Care Act Credit Suisse Health Care FacilitiesAnalyst Color Health Care Initiation Analyst Ratings General Best of Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2016 Benzinga.com.
