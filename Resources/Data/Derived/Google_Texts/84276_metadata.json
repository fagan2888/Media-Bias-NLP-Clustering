Drugstore chains face increased competition from mail-order pharmacy services and pharmacies inside grocery store chains.\n\nBut what will it mean for consumers? Here\u2019s how the deal could affect shoppers.\n\nQ: Will stores be closing now?\n\nA: The two companies didn\u2019t say whether they would shutter stores or lay off workers after the deal closes. But they did say that \u201cdecisions will be made over time regarding the integration of the two companies\u201d and that Walgreens \u201cplans to further transform Rite Aid\u2019s stores to better meet consumer needs.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said there will likely be a government review of both chains\u2019 operations and that the Department of Justice will probably require them to get rid of stores in regions where there is a lot of overlap.\n\nIn a call with analysts Wednesday morning, Walgreens Chief Executive Stefano Pessina said the company would not speculate on the number of stores it might have to divest.\n\nWalgreens has about 8,200 stores across the U.S.; Rite Aid operates about 4,600 stores in 31 states.\n\nQ: Why are these companies combining?\n\nA: Hospital operators, physician groups, health insurers and now drugstore chains have all merged in the wake of the Affordable Care Act to try to cut costs and gain more leverage with suppliers.\n\nAnalysts say health insurers want to bulk up to take advantage of increasing revenue from the health law and the rising enrollment of Medicare and Medicaid patients, and health care companies see mergers as a way to deal with limits on earnings under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis year, Rite Aid acquired a small pharmacy benefits manager, which acts as a kind of middleman by processing prescriptions for insurers and negotiating prices with drugstores and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nIn the Wednesday morning call with analysts, Pessina said increased negotiating power with pharmacy benefits managers was not part of the decision. Instead, he said, the deal will increase Walgreens\u2019 footprint in the U.S. and save money by finding synergies with Rite Aid.\n\nQ: Will prices start increasing?\n\nA: Companies could argue that bulking up means more financial muscle to negotiate better deals, but that might not necessarily help consumers, said Carmen Balber, executive director of the advocacy group Consumer Watchdog.\n\nShe said it was \u201cfair to assume\u201d that drug prices could increase for consumers after the merger because there would be fewer companies negotiating with pharmacy benefits managers and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nQ: Will Rite Aid\u2019s name change?\n\nA: Rite Aid will initially continue to operate under its own name after the merger, which is expected to be completed in the second half of next year.\n\nQ: Who will compete with the combined company?\n\nA: CVS Health Corp., the second-biggest drugstore chain, has more than 7,800 stores across the nation.\n\nQ: And what about Thrifty\u2019s ice cream?\n\nA: Walgreens spokesman Phil Caruso said Rite Aid products will be available while the drugstore continues to initially operate under its own name. Other decisions on product lines will be made later, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Change is coming to local drugstores after Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said Tuesday it is buying rival Rite Aid Corp. for about $9.4 billion.
