PATRIOT DAY SALE on Bikram Yoga,\u201d Bikram Arlington tweeted Thursday in commemoration of the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks, WTOP reported.\n\nThe online promotion said, \u201cFreedom Isn\u2019t Free \u2014 And we intend to honor those patriots who have died for our country and morn [sic] the loss of freedom of speech and other rights that died that day.\u201d\n\nThe reaction was swift on Twitter, with people calling the studio\u2019s promotion \u201cdisgusting\u201d and in \u201cpoor taste.\u201d The owner and her husband have apologized, but only after offering excuses and conspiracy theories, comparing the backlash to the scandal surrounding ex-NFL player Ray Rice and refusing to invalidate the promotion.\n\n\u201cThe goal was to point out what date it was and associate to patriotism and to remember it. It\u2019s a shame some of you go to the negative,\u201d the studio tweeted.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be upset, research the term \u2018911 building 7\u2019 and check the news, because they are hearing \u2018chatter\u2019 about us getting hit again,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, owner Zahra Vaezi, 33, said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize people would be so \u2018roar,\u2019 you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like that man who punched his wife,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Rice. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s upsetting. But I think it kind of gets blown out of proportion.\u201d\n\nMs. Vaezi said that her husband, Frank Machnick, came up with the idea. She maintained that her tweets were due to \u201cyoga brain.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever done hot yoga?\u201d Ms. Vaezi asked, The Post reported. \u201cIt\u2019s such an intense practice that you get put into this Zen. You just feel really Zen and peaceful and great. \u2026 You might go and just drive off and not pay attention to all of your surroundings like you should.\u201d\n\nBikram Arlington will not be removing the promotion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s offensive, yes, and I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not trying to incite emotion. I just love yoga,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is still Patriot Day. And I feel like if I do take [the discount] off, I would be saying there\u2019s something wrong with it being Patriot Day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Virginia yoga studio has received a wave of backlash after offering Sept. 11th-inspired discounts.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Virginia yoga studio has received a wave of backlash after offering Sept. 11th-inspired discounts.", "title": "Va. yoga studio offers Sept. 11 discounts: \u20189+11 = 20% OFF!\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/11/va-yoga-studio-offers-september-11-discounts-911-2/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/21/3935b3183c07b818570f6a7067005e38.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/21/3935b3183c07b818570f6a7067005e38.jpg", "description": "A Virginia yoga studio has received a wave of backlash after offering Sept. 11th-inspired discounts.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Va. yoga studio offers Sept. 11 discounts: \u20189+11 = 20% OFF!\u0335"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Zahra Vaezi, Arlington"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb34d\"", "article_summary": "A Virginia yoga studio has received a wave of backlash after offering Sept. 11th-inspired discounts.\nPATRIOT DAY SALE on Bikram Yoga,\u201d Bikram Arlington tweeted Thursday in commemoration of the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks, WTOP reported.\nAnd I feel like if I do take [the discount] off, I would be saying there\u2019s something wrong with it being Patriot Day.\u201d\nShe maintained that her tweets were due to \u201cyoga brain.\u201d\u201cHave you ever done hot yoga?\u201d Ms. Vaezi asked, The Post reported.\n\u201cIt is still Patriot Day."}
