Even if the unpredictable swirling winds off the bay and bitter cold hardly made it a cozy home field.\n\nJerry Rice walked through the stadium several weeks back and soaked in the cheers from every direction, signed autographs and posed for photos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me to come to games. Hearing those cheers again, I want to get back on that field,\u201d Rice said. \u201cThis is where everything started. It\u2019s sort of sad to see it coming to an end because I know next year they\u2019ll be in Santa Clara.\u201d\n\nThe Niners will move into $1.2 billion Levi\u2019s Stadium at team headquarters, while Candlestick waits out its implosion day, likely in late 2014.\n\nEverybody realizes it\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll forever be grateful to have played on that field and shared that field with guys who are in the Hall of Fame and guys who have won championships for this organization,\u201d linebacker Patrick Willis said.\n\nThere\u2019s no debate that a dynasty was born with \u201cThe Catch.\u201d Candlestick\u2019s top-10 football moments have been counted down during each home game this season, with \u201cThe Catch\u201d at No. 1 for the regular-season home finale.\n\nThat 6-yard touchdown reception with 51 seconds left sent San Francisco to a 28-27 win and its first Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cThe funny thing is, I remember the play right before that I missed Freddie Solomon,\u201d Montana recalled this week. \u201cI think I threw it about 3 feet over his head from 5 yards away. He was wide open for a touchdown. I always tell Dwight, \u2018Man, it\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t hit Freddie or The Catch would have never happened.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe 49ers next beat the Bengals for the first of the franchise\u2019s five championships.\n\n\u201cOh, I think back on it all the time. I know what the play was, it was all diagramed,\u201d former 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. said. \u201cIn the far end zone, was Dwight Clark\u2019s catch, which will probably go down in history.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question, as far as the San Francisco 49ers go and our Super Bowl runs and our history of success in the \u201880s and the \u201890s, it started with \u2018The Catch.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe 49ers shared Candlestick with the Giants until the baseball club moved into its downtown waterfront ballpark in 2000.\n\nOakland Athletics manager Bob Melvin attended games at Candlestick as a boy growing up in the Bay Area \u2014 he was in the stands for Mays\u2018 3,000th hit \u2014 and enjoyed being a fan more than he did years later as a major leaguer with the Giants.\n\n\u201cMike Schmidt was hitting and I was catching and he hit a popup over home plate that I really thought at first was going to end up near our dugout, then I thought it would end up over in the other dugout and it ended up right where I started, and I ended up catching it,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cYou\u2019d follow the hot dog wrappers to try to figure out which way the wind was going.\u201d\n\n49ers punter Andy Lee won\u2019t miss the wind, or much else about Candlestick after a decade kicking there.\n\n\u201cBittersweet is probably the best way to put it because there are a lot of great memories that took place there,\u201d Montana said. \u201cBut everyone will admit that it\u2019s not the ultimate in a field you would want to be known for.\u201d\n\nFor all the problems at rundown Candlestick, those who consider it hallowed ground don\u2019t want to hear about the negatives, but the nostalgia.\n\n\u201cIt was our dump, so we could talk bad about it,\u201d Clark said, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t want anybody else to talk bad about it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Monday, Dwight Clark will make a point to walk to the spot of his famous game-winning touchdown known only as \"The Catch\" for probably the final time.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "On Monday, Dwight Clark will make a point to walk to the spot of his famous game-winning touchdown known only as \u201cThe Catch\u201d for probably the final time.", "title": "Candlestick Park finale stirs memories in San Francisco", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/22/candlestick-park-finale-stirs-memories-in-san-fran/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/22/12222013_candlestick-park-finale-sti-p18201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/22/12222013_candlestick-park-finale-sti-p18201.jpg", "description": "On Monday, Dwight Clark will make a point to walk to the spot of his famous game-winning touchdown known only as \"The Catch\" for probably the final time.", "card": "summary", "title": "Candlestick Park finale stirs memories in San Francisco"}, "Author": "Janie McCauley", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Dwight Clark, Super Bowl, Willie Mays"}, "article_summary": "That 6-yard touchdown reception with 51 seconds left sent San Francisco to a 28-27 win and its first Super Bowl.\n\u201cIn the far end zone, was Dwight Clark\u2019s catch, which will probably go down in history.\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Monday, Dwight Clark will make a point to walk to the spot of his famous game-winning touchdown known only as \u201cThe Catch\u201d for probably the final time.\n\u201cBittersweet is probably the best way to put it because there are a lot of great memories that took place there,\u201d Montana said.\n\u201cThis will be the last time I\u2019ll be able to stand on that spot as far as I know,\u201d Clark said."}
