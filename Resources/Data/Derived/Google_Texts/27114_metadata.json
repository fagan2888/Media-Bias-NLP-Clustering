This is particularly true of right-wing notables, something Drudge explained to the hyperventilating left in a subsequent tweet.\n\nDrudge indicated in follow-up tweets that since he is self-employed as proprietor of the Drudge Report, he files as a small business. Drudge followed up with \u201cDazed team Obama media reporters think Opt-Out tax \u2018year away\u2019? Not for small businesses that file Qtr estimates. We\u2019re there NOW, baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a self-employed individual, generally you are required to file an annual return and pay estimated tax quarterly,\u201d the IRS website states.\n\nIRS form (1040-ES) for estimating quarterly taxes specifically recommends adding the mandate penalty to line 12 for \u201cother taxes\u201d \u2014 to pay before the first quarterly deadline of April 15.\n\n\u201cIt is true that thousands of small businesses will be forced to pay ObamaCare taxes quarterly in 2014,\u201d a Senate Budget Committee aide told Breitbart News on Friday afternoon.\n\nAn administration elected by low-information voters is populated with low-information officials who are ignorant of the laws they are charged to enforce even though they often misuse them \u2014 as in the case of IRS targeting of Tea Party groups \u2014 for their own political purposes.\n\nSelf-employed entrepreneurs ranging from Drudge to small-shop proprietors and independent contractors have long been aware of the requirement to estimate their tax liability and send a quarter of it in every three months, and that this amount includes \u201cother taxes\u201d such as the ObamaCare opt-out penalty.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 14.4 million Americans were self-employed in January. Of those, 9.2 million were unincorporated self-employed workers and another 5.2 million were incorporated. All who file quarterly estimated tax payments this year are subject to the ObamaCare individual mandate tax.\n\nWhen you tax something you get less of it, and certainly ObamaCare leaves us with less freedom. We lose the freedom to buy the insurance plans of our own choosing and the freedom to pick our doctors. Our nation was born in revolt against such oppressive taxation. The penalty imposed under ObamaCare for refusing to be compelled to buy a product you don\u2019t want is indeed a tax on our liberty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Reform: Despite White House claims no one has to pay ObamaCare's individual mandate tax until next year, a Web heavyweight points out that self-employed", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Health Reform: Despite White House claims no one has to pay ObamaCare\u2019s individual mandate tax until next year, a Web heavyweight points out that self-employed individuals file their estimate\u2026", "title": "Drudge Exposes Another ObamaCare Lie, Pays \u2018Liberty Tax\u2019", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/obamacare/matt-drudge-pays-obamacare-liberty-tax/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2014-03-24 15:44:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-24T15:44:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "All who file quarterly estimated tax payments this year are subject to the ObamaCare individual mandate tax.\nThe penalty imposed under ObamaCare for refusing to be compelled to buy a product you don\u2019t want is indeed a tax on our liberty.\n\u201cIt is true that thousands of small businesses will be forced to pay ObamaCare taxes quarterly in 2014,\u201d a Senate Budget Committee aide told Breitbart News on Friday afternoon.\nDrudge indicated in follow-up tweets that since he is self-employed as proprietor of the Drudge Report, he files as a small business.\nWe\u2019re there NOW, baby.\u201d\u201cAs a self-employed individual, generally you are required to file an annual return and pay estimated tax quarterly,\u201d the IRS website states."}
