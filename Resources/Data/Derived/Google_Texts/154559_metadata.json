Romero in a release.\n\n\n\nShe has been the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s longest-serving Washington legislative office director in the organization\u2019s history and both the first woman and African-American to hold that position.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the ACLU\u2019s top lobbyist, Laura has led Herculean efforts to enact, block, or repeal legislation that would positively or adversely impact the lives of millions of Americans,\u201d Romero said.\n\n\n\nIn her first few years at the helm, she dramatically increased the group\u2019s K Street profile.\n\n\n\nIn 1998, for example, the ACLU was only spending $200,000 per year on lobbying, according to records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. However, by the mid-2000s, that spending had increased to a peak of more than $4.2 million per year.\n\n\n\nThose figures have fluctuated and leveled out in recent years, hovering around $1.9 million, but still remain at sums remarkable for the nonprofit sector.\n\n\n\n\u201cHer ability to work across the political aisle and with all branches of government, her sharp political acumen, and her exceptional skill at forming and maintaining strong relationships with policy makers and advocacy leaders have helped make the ACLU a uniquely effective force in Washington,\u201d Romero continued.\n\n\n\nMurphy became the ACLU's top lobbyist 17 years ago, though has spent a total of 20 years with the group. There will be a search for her replacement.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Laura Murphy spent two decades at the civil liberties group.", "description": "Laura Murphy spent two decades at the civil liberties group.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
