Ever since Donald Trump dodged Megyn Kelly\u2019s question on his derogatory comments about women at the first debate with his declaration that \u201cthe big problem this country has is being politically correct,\u201d political correctness has been the go-to boogeyman for the entire field of GOP candidates. Whenever challenged on controversial or offensive comments, political correctness is to blame. Whenever the media fact-checks a statement, political correctness and that other boogeyman, \u201cliberal media bias,\u201d is to blame \u2014 and not their factually challenged statements.\n\nAs Milibank writes:\n\n\u201cOnce a pejorative term applied to liberals\u2019 determination not to offend any ethnic or other identity group, it now is used lazily by some conservatives to label everything classified under \u201cthat with which I disagree.\u201d GOP candidates are now using the \u201cpolitically correct\u201d label to shut down debate \u2014 exactly what conservatives complained politically correct liberals were doing in the first place.\u201d\n\nWhen an entire field of candidates tend to thrive on bullshit (especially the current front-runners), it is not at all surprising that they have certain reliable terms that vilify critics of their bullshit and shut down debate. The truth is, Republicans have long utilized a manipulative phraseology, full of euphemisms and doublespeak, used either to shut down criticism and debate, as shown above, or to acerbate the listener\u2019s emotional state \u2014 think \u201cbaby parts\u201d and \u201cdeath panels\u201d \u2014 or provide a positive light on something that is generally frowned upon. (Ergo: Tax-avoiding billionaires become \u201cjob-creators.\u201d) The GOP has become truly masterful at distorting political discussion through language, and at each Republican debate, just about every candidate showcases this manipulation. In George Orwell\u2019s classic essay on this subject, \u201cPolitics and the English Language,\u201d he seems to describe modern Republicans to a tee, repeating the same tired, yet convenient phrases (the phrases have changed, of course). Orwell writes:\n\n\u201cWhen one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases \u2014 bestial, atrocities, iron heel, bloodstained tyranny, free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder \u2014 one often has the curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy: a feeling which suddenly becomes stronger at moments when the light catches the speaker\u2019s spectacles and turns them into blank discs which seem to have no eyes behind them. And this is not altogether fanciful. A speaker who uses that kind of phraseology has gone some distance towards turning himself into a machine.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Between the nascent fascism and the preponderance of doublespeak, could it be any more clear?", "title": "The GOP has become the party from George Orwell\u2019s nightmares", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Between the nascent fascism and the preponderance of doublespeak, could it be any more clear?", "title": "The GOP has become the party from George Orwell\u2019s nightmares", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/27/the_gop_has_become_the_party_from_george_orwells_nightmares/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/orwell_trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Between the nascent fascism and the preponderance of doublespeak, could it be any more clear?", "title": "The GOP has become the party from George Orwell\u2019s nightmares", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/orwell_trump.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Conor Lynch", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, George Orwell, History, Propaganda, The Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Whenever the media fact-checks a statement, political correctness and that other boogeyman, \u201cliberal media bias,\u201d is to blame \u2014 and not their factually challenged statements.\nWhenever challenged on controversial or offensive comments, political correctness is to blame.\n(Ergo: Tax-avoiding billionaires become \u201cjob-creators.\u201d) The GOP has become truly masterful at distorting political discussion through language, and at each Republican debate, just about every candidate showcases this manipulation.\nIn George Orwell\u2019s classic essay on this subject, \u201cPolitics and the English Language,\u201d he seems to describe modern Republicans to a tee, repeating the same tired, yet convenient phrases (the phrases have changed, of course).\nTopics: aol_on, George Orwell, History, Propaganda, The Republican Party, News, Politics NewsIn a recent column by Dana Milbank, the Washington Post columnist addresses what has become the ultimate straw man for Republican presidential candidates this year."}
