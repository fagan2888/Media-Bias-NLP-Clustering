Richard Finkelstein, 62, of the Lakeview neighborhood, intended to purchase a new private insurance policy via the Illinois health insurance exchange with the help of a government subsidy. But his low annual income sent him to Medicaid. Had he known about the asset-recovery provision before signing up, he said he would have purchased a private plan instead, with no strings attached.

More than 200,000 low-income Illinoisans have applied for new coverage under Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance that was expanded in Illinois and several other states as part of the Affordable Care Act.

But for certain members of that group, the new coverage could come with strings attached.

A little-known wrinkle in the federal health insurance expansion could put at risk the house and other assets of those ages 55 to 64 should they require substantial and expensive health care treatments.
