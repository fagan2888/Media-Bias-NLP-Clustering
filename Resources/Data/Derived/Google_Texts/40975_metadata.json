She told Politico the Chamber supports \u201cpro-business\u201d candidates regardless of party affiliation or incumbency status.\n\nBut Politico noted that the move marks a \u201cmajor shift\u201d for the business community, as the Chamber has traditionally avoided targeting sitting lawmakers.\n\nDavid Bozell, president of ForAmerica, said \u201cpreserving\u201d conservative members will be a priority in the upcoming election cycle for both his organization and the entire conservative community.\n\n\u201cIf the Chamber of Commerce wants to pick a fight, then the conservative movement is going to have to be ready, and I\u2019m sure we will be,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group has already started looking into several races, though nothing is official and the targets have yet to be decided, a pocket of Republicans on K Street and Capitol Hill told Politico.\n\n\u201cIf the Chamber of Commerce wants politicians in Washington that increase spending, shill for corporate welfare and enact sweeping amnesty, they should support Democrats,\u201d said Dan Holler, communications director for Heritage Action.\n\nSteve Caldeira, a member of the Chamber\u2019s public affairs committee and CEO of the International Franchise Association, defended the plan, predicting that the Chamber will involve itself early to find candidates who will work in a bipartisan manner to \u201cget things done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that there are still members of the Republican House that are obstructionist, isolationists that would be willing to shut down the government only reinforces that the Chamber and the business community, for that matter, will double down on this winning formula,\u201d he told Politico.\n\nBut efforts will likely face pushback from conservative groups looking to retain influence on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cOur grassroots members stand ready to fight these corporatists who are destroying our country with massive spending, bailouts and debt,\u201d Cuccinelli said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is paving the way to unseat \u201cobstructionist\u201d Republicans in the House.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is paving the way to unseat \u201cobstructionist\u201d Republicans in the House.", "title": "Chamber of Commerce Ready to Primary House Conservatives", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150724_Chamber_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-24T21:57:28+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1IjC2m8"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is paving the way to unseat \u201cobstructionist\u201d Republicans in the House.", "title": "Chamber of Commerce Ready to Primary House Conservatives", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150724_Chamber_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "Congressional Campaigns", "published_time": "2015-07-24T21:21:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-24T21:57:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Chamber of Commerce, Ken Cuccinelli, Dave Bozell, Senate Conservatives Fund"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7fa\"", "article_summary": "The Chamber intends to primary sitting House conservatives who have halted many of its legislative priorities, including immigration reform, the Export-Import Bank\u2019s renewal and a long-term highway bill.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is paving the way to unseat \u201cobstructionist\u201d Republicans in the House who have successfully blocked much of the organization\u2019s agenda.\nShe told Politico the Chamber supports \u201cpro-business\u201d candidates regardless of party affiliation or incumbency status.\n\u201cIf the Chamber of Commerce wants to pick a fight, then the conservative movement is going to have to be ready, and I\u2019m sure we will be,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf the Chamber of Commerce wants politicians in Washington that increase spending, shill for corporate welfare and enact sweeping amnesty, they should support Democrats,\u201d said Dan Holler, communications director for Heritage Action."}
