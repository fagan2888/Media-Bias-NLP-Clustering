The company sells plans in 14 of the health-care law\u2019s new insurance exchanges, in most cases under its Anthem brand.\n\nThe name change will be completed by the end of the year, pending shareholder approval, the company said yesterday in a statement. The next enrollment period for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare begins Nov. 15.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re no longer a health insurer, we\u2019re truly a health plan engaging with individuals as opposed with large blocks of business,\u201d Joseph Swedish, WellPoint\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a phone interview. \u201cThere was this public brand that was a mixed kind of message. Our own employees had difficulty discerning between WellPoint, Anthem and which one is really running the show.\u201d\n\nWellPoint has about 2 million customers who buy the company\u2019s plans directly for themselves and their families, including 769,000 through the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nChanging the Indianapolis-based company\u2019s name will also end confusion for large employers who hire the insurer to manage their health benefits and for state and federal regulators, Swedish said.\n\n\u201cSplit brands work only in certain circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more personal than health-care services. That\u2019s why we felt a singular brand was critically important.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s decision was reported earlier yesterday by The Wall Street Journal.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-12/wellpoint-will-change-name-to-anthem-to-reach-consumers", "description": "WellPoint Inc., the second-largest health insurer in the U.S., plans to change its name to Anthem Inc., the brand under which it sells most of its coverage.", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "title": "WellPoint Will Change Name to Anthem to Reach Consumers"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,Anthem Inc", "news_keywords": "Health,Anthem Inc", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-12/wellpoint-will-change-name-to-anthem-to-reach-consumers", "parsely-title": "WellPoint Will Change Name to Anthem to Reach Consumers", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-08-13T04:01:00.008Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "WellPoint Inc., the second-largest health insurer in the U.S., plans to change its name to Anthem Inc., the brand under which it sells most of its coverage.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Anthem Inc,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-08-13T04:01:00.008Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-12/wellpoint-will-change-name-to-anthem-to-reach-consumers", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "type": "website", "description": "WellPoint Inc., the second-largest health insurer in the U.S., plans to change its name to Anthem Inc., the brand under which it sells most of its coverage.", "title": "WellPoint Will Change Name to Anthem to Reach Consumers"}, "fb": {"status": "WellPoint Inc., the second-largest health insurer in the U.S., plans to change its name to Anthem Inc., the brand under which it sells most of its coverage."}, "parsely-post-id": "NA7SRC6JTSEU01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d0c\"", "article_summary": "WellPoint Inc., the second-largest health insurer in the U.S., plans to change its name to Anthem Inc., the brand under which it sells most of its coverage.\nThe company sells plans in 14 of the health-care law\u2019s new insurance exchanges, in most cases under its Anthem brand.\nWellPoint and other large health insurers find themselves increasingly marketing directly to consumers, as Obamacare requires most uninsured Americans to obtain coverage and employers thrust more responsibility for costs on their workers.\nOur own employees had difficulty discerning between WellPoint, Anthem and which one is really running the show.\u201dWellPoint has about 2 million customers who buy the company\u2019s plans directly for themselves and their families, including 769,000 through the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\nThe name change will be completed by the end of the year, pending shareholder approval, the company said yesterday in a statement."}
