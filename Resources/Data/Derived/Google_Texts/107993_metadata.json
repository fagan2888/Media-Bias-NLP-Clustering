After living most of her life as a male, she is now coming to terms with her transgender identity.\n\n\u201cIt has been difficult to navigate and it has brought more questions than answers in some cases but it has improved my life,\" said Stebbins.\n\nBut now Stebbins fears that a new bill that Kansas lawmakers are currently considering will threaten students who identify as transgender.\n\nIt\u2019s called the Student Physical Privacy Act and it requires students to use the restroom according to the sex they were assigned to at birth, not the gender they identify with, meaning Stebbins would have to use the men\u2019s restroom\n\n\u201cI already have to deal with so much and I attack my own self on a daily basis, that I don\u2019t need that extra violence and if legislators want to protect anyone its trans students that need to be protected,\" said Stebbins.\n\nWomen\u2019s Studies Assistant Professor Dr. Harlan Weaver says the bill would also endanger transgender students.\n\n\u201cThey become more vulnerable to harassment, bullying, and violence because they have to go to different restrooms and have to constantly out themselves, bills like this don\u2019t protect people, they kill people,\" said Weaver.\n\nBut Senator Mary Pilcher-Cook disagrees, in a statement to 13 News she says quote:\n\n\u201cParents have reached out afraid for their children\u2019s safety and they do not want attention for fear of being called a bigot, this legislation ensures accommodations, while still protecting everyone\u2019s privacy rights.\u201d\n\nStebbins disagrees.\n\n\u201cIt leads me to question my place in the state in the future, if this legislation is passed,\" said Stebbins.\n\nIf the bill passes, schools would have to pay $2,500 to students who encounter transgender students in restrooms.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new bill proposed to the Kansas legislature is causing uproar among the transgender community for its restrictions on bathroom usage among transgender students.", "language": "english", "author": "Daniela Leon", "og": {"url": "http://www.wibw.com/content/news/Kansas-bill-proposes-restrictions-on-bathrooms-for-students-who-identify-as-transgender-372885111.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Still0320_000003.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A new bill proposed to the Kansas legislature is causing uproar among the transgender community for its restrictions on bathroom usage among transgender students.", "title": "Kansas bill proposes restrictions on bathrooms for students who identify as transgender"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new bill proposed to the Kansas legislature is causing uproar among the transgender community for its restrictions on bathroom usage among transgender students.", "title": "Kansas bill proposes restrictions on bathrooms for students who identify as transgender", "url": "http://www.wibw.com/content/news/Kansas-bill-proposes-restrictions-on-bathrooms-for-students-who-identify-as-transgender-372885111.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Still0320_000003.jpg", "creator": "@wibw", "site": "@wibw", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Kansas bill proposes restrictions on bathrooms for students who identify as transgender", "fb": {"app_id": 127891188221, "pages": 334421824439}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "xKK4ktPtBfFVLdzIx__cOn-VV5eDQAJ3ZPOJKffAg_I", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Kansas bill proposes restrictions on, bathrooms for students who identify"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24ca\"", "article_summary": "If the bill passes, schools would have to pay $2,500 to students who encounter transgender students in restrooms.\nBut now Stebbins fears that a new bill that Kansas lawmakers are currently considering will threaten students who identify as transgender.\nWomen\u2019s Studies Assistant Professor Dr. Harlan Weaver says the bill would also endanger transgender students.\nAfter living most of her life as a male, she is now coming to terms with her transgender identity.\n\u201cIt has been difficult to navigate and it has brought more questions than answers in some cases but it has improved my life,\" said Stebbins."}
