He has joined with former DHS officials in trying to persuade GOP lawmakers to abandon their effort to use the DHS spending bill as a lever to block implementation of President Obama\u2019s executive orders protecting nearly five million illegal immigrants from deportation.\n\nLast month, the House passed a bill to keep DHS fully funded through the rest of the fiscal year, Sept. 30, but linked it to provisions blocking the department from implementing the executive orders.\n\nRelated: Cruz Says GOP Plays a Losing Hand on DHS Spending\n\nSenate Democrats have insisted on a \u201cclean\u201d bill shorn of the immigration language, which has left Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) six votes shy of the 60-vote super majority needed to pass the legislation. Even if he could somehow push through the House-passed version, Obama has vowed to veto it.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s a legislative and political mess.\n\nRidge and two other former DHS secretaries \u2013 Republican Michael Chertoff and Democrat Janet Napolitano \u2013 recently signed a letter to McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) urging them to avert a spending crisis. The crisis could weaken a department responsible for, among other things, immigration, border security, the Coast Guard, and the Secret Service.\n\n\u201cWe do not question your desire to have a larger debate about the nation's immigration laws,\u201d the three wrote. \u201cHowever, we cannot emphasize enough that the DHS\u2019s responsibilities are much broader than its responsibility to oversee the federal immigration agencies and to protect our borders. And funding for the entire agency should not be put in jeopardy by the debate about immigration.\u201d\n\nA Problem for Ordinary People\n\nDHS Secretary Jeh Johnson says a partial shutdown would be highly disruptive for everyday Americans. White House officials and congressional Democrats last week ramped up their warning that Republicans were threatening the country\u2019s safety at a time of heightened concern about ISIS expanding beyond Syria and Iraq.\n\nRelated: McConnell Blames Senate Dems for \u2018Stuck\u2019 DHS Bill\n\nSome Republicans say the impact of a partial DHS shutdown would be minimal, because most of the department\u2019s 230,000 employees are deemed \u201cessential\u201d and must report for work even without pay.\n\nRidge said he had no doubt most DHS employees will do the right thing and report for work even if the short-term spending runs out this month. He also agreed strongly with congressional Republicans that Obama\u2019s executive orders smack of an \u201cimperial presidency\u201d that has gone far beyond the pale. But he repeatedly criticized members of his own party for using DHS employees as pawns in a chess game to try to block the president\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nHe described their efforts to block the DHS spending bill as \u201cpolitical insanity\u201d and said it would backfire on the GOP, since most Americans will blame the new majority in Congress for precipitating the crisis.\n\n\u201cFrom a political point of view, outside of the Beltway, there is only one party that is going to be held culpable and responsible by Americans, and that\u2019s the Republican Party,\u201d Ridge said.\n\nRelated: How ISIS Could Drag the U.S. Into a Ground Fight\n\nIndeed, according to the latest CNN/ORC poll, 53 percent of Americans said they would blame the GOP-controlled Congress if the DHS must shut down all but essential services. Meanwhile, 30 percent said they would blame Obama and 13 percent said both would be at fault.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t like [Obama\u2019s] immigration policy, then let\u2019s send him \u2026 a piece of legislation that does things your way, not his, and let him veto it,\u201d he added. He said Republicans would be better off leaving the constitutional controversy over Obama\u2019s executive actions to the courts instead of the political arena.\n\nRidge, 69, was named the nation\u2019s first homeland security secretary in early 2003 after President George W. Bush created the department. He currently heads RidgeGlobal, an international security and economic consulting group headquartered in Washington, D.C.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Tom Ridge, the nation\u2019s first secretary of homeland security, said on Tuesday the U.S.", "title": "Tom Ridge Says U.S. Terror Risks Higher Now Than After 9/11", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/18/Tom-Ridge-Says-US-Terror-Risks-Higher-Now-After-911", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/WTC_9_11_2001.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/18/Tom-Ridge-Says-US-Terror-Risks-Higher-Now-After-911", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/WTC_9_11_2001.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Tom Ridge, the nation\u2019s first secretary of homeland security, said on Tuesday the U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde0a5\"", "article_summary": "Ridge, 69, was named the nation\u2019s first homeland security secretary in early 2003 after President George W.
