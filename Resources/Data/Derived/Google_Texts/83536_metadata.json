Each camera is a shiny white metallic box with two lenses like eyes. The camera\u2019s shape and design resemble a robot\u2019s head. Workers on motorized lifts installed seven cameras in a 360-degree cluster on top of City Hall. They put up groups of six atop two light poles at the loading dock, and more at the fire hall and boat harbor. By mid-February, more than 60 cameras watched over the town, and the Dillingham Police Department plans to install 20 more \u2014 all purchased through a $202,000 Homeland Security grant meant primarily to defend against a terrorist attack.\n\nDillingham has a population of 2,500 people. It is only reachable by boat or plane.\n\nAs Radley Balko thoroughly documented in his book \u201cWarrior Cop\u201d the military industrial complex has created a new industry: the police industrial complex. And it\u2019s been quietly militarizing our police agencies for quite a long time. Indeed, he traces this trend back to the early 1980s under the freedom- and liberty-loving Ronald Reagan. The Gipper deemed the drug war to be a real war and easily passed the Military Cooperation With Civilian Law Enforcement Act, \u201cwhich allowed and encouraged the military to give local, state, and federal police access to military bases, research, and equipment.\u201d The police got training from the armed forces to use their new war-making equipment and the military became involved with intelligence and operations in the drug war. Every president since then, including the current one, has reauthorized the program, putting more and more money on the table. Balko wrote, \u201cThen-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney declared in 1989, \u2018The detection and countering of the production, trafficking and use of illegal drugs is a high priority national security mission of the Department of Defense.'\u201d\n\nSo this really isn\u2019t a new thing. But it\u2019s been on steroids since 9/11 with the creation of the new Department of Homeland Security. Needless to say, that was just the tip of the iceberg. Since 9/11 the United States has been spending vast sums of money through DHS to outfit the state and local authorities with surveillance and military gear ostensibly to fight the terrorist threat at home.\n\nWhat we have been seeing in Ferguson, Missouri, these past few days is largely a result of that program \u2014 and an entire industry has grown up around it. Attorney General Eric Holder is reportedly concerned about this deployment of military gear. Where in the world has Eric Holder and every other officeholder who\u2019s expressed dismay these last couple of days been? This equipment didn\u2019t just materialize on its own. As we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s mostly been paid for by the federal government. Indeed, in less than a month a group of militarized police equipment vendors across the nation will be gathering for an annual confab called \u201cUrban Shield\u201d (\u201cCritical training for critical time\u201d) in Oakland, California. It features dozens of sponsors, from the Department of Homeland Security and police agencies all over the country to such vendors as Armored Mobility Inc., which bills itself as \u201cthe Worldwide Leader in Dynamic Mobile Armor and Shields: Today\u2019s threat is rifle rounds and they are coming in bunches, through doors, walls and ceilings! Our Dynamic Armor and Mobile Armored Shields will save lives!!!!\u201d Here\u2019s one of its \u201chighlight\u201d videos:\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security disburses somewhere in the vicinity of $3 billion a year for this sort of thing. Add in the loot that\u2019s legally appropriated by police agencies in the war on drugs and you have a massive incentive to turn the streets of Ferguson, Missouri (or Zuccotti Park) into a scene that looks more like the siege of Fallujah. After all, that\u2019s explicitly what that video is telling these \u201ctroops\u201d they need the Robo-Cop equipment for. And that\u2019s the problem. If you build a police state, the police are going to want to use it. It\u2019s human nature. In fact, according to Balko, they\u2019re commonly using SWAT teams to deliver all search warrants in some jurisdictions now \u2014 no matter what the crime. What else are they going to do? There simply aren\u2019t enough \u201csieges\u201d going on in any given town on any given day to justify all this gear.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since 9/11 we've spent huge sums to outfit local authorities with military gear.
