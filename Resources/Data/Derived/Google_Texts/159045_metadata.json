Its poverty level dropped by one-tenth, and nine of 10 resdents now have health insurance.\n\nBy comparison, the nation as a whole showed gains only in health coverage. \u201cThere was no statistically significant change from 2013 in either real median household income or the official poverty rate,\u201d the bureau reported Thursday.\n\nThe positive economic numbers may help explain why Colorado performed well in another survey category: the movement of people from state to state, according to the bureau\u2019s annual American Community Survey report.\n\nColorado gained 45,396 people more than it lost in one year, ranking behind only four states \u2013 Florida, Texas, South Carolina and Arizona \u2013 in net migration gains.\n\nStill, the report suggests many people are still recovering from the national economic collapse of 2008.\n\nReal median household income \u201cis 6.5 percent lower than in 2007, the year before the nation entered the most recent economic recession,\u201d the report said.\n\nDenver\u2019s income growth stands in contrast to the rest of the West, according to the report, a region that suffered a 4.6 decline in real median income from 2013 to 2014.\n\nThe survey also measures what has become a fast-changing social trend in Colorado and nationwide: same-sex couples.\n\nIn Colorado, the 2014 survey estimates there are now 15,402 same-sex households, a one-third increase in two years. It also found the number who identify themselves as married grew dramatically, from 16 percent to 36 percent since 2012.\n\nThat trend is likely to continue in the aftermath of this year\u2019s victory for gay couples before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nNationally, the numbers of same-sex households grew 22 percent in two years to 783,000, according to the survey.\n\nThe Census survey differs from a recent Colorado report on health-care coverage.\n\nLast week, a Colorado Health Access Survey reported that the uninsured rate in the state plummeted by more than half, from 14.3 percent to 6.7 percent in one year.\n\nThe Census survey showed a more modest decline, from 14.1 percent to 10.3 percent in Colorado. Nationally, it reported a drop from 14.5 percent to 11.7 percent in the number of uninsured Americans.\n\nDeborah Goeken, senior director of communications for the Colorado Health Institute, calls the state survey more accurate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20150917/NEWS02/150919629/", "site_name": "The Durango Herald", "image": "http://durangoherald.com/storyimage/DU/20150917/NEWS02/150919629/AR/0/AR-150919629.jpg?maxw=1000&imageversion=16by9", "type": "article", "title": "Economy looks bright in Denver"}, "fb": {"app_id": 263076300371367, "pages": 205518469520233}}, "article_summary": "Deborah Goeken, senior director of communications for the Colorado Health Institute, calls the state survey more accurate.\nThe median household income in the Denver-metro area grew $3,000 or nearly 5 percent last year, after adjustment for inflation.\nThe Census survey differs from a recent Colorado report on health-care coverage.\nThe positive economic numbers may help explain why Colorado performed well in another survey category: the movement of people from state to state, according to the bureau\u2019s annual American Community Survey report.\nLast week, a Colorado Health Access Survey reported that the uninsured rate in the state plummeted by more than half, from 14.3 percent to 6.7 percent in one year."}
