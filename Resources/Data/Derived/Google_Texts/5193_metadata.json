We plan to seek reaction from lawmakers and industry leaders following Bolger's formal announcement.\n\nAuto insurance reform has been a hot topic in recent years, but lawmakers have been unable to find common ground amid intense debate featuring emotional stories of catastrophic injuries that require long-term care. A proposal introduced last year and backed by Republican Gov. Rick Snyder stalled out on the House floor.\n\nRelated: Plan would cut auto insurance rates, cap personal injury coverage\n\n\"This is an issue that is strangling family's budgets because of legislative inaction,\" Bolger said. \"I think we need to tackle this problem, and I hope we can provide a solution, but I'm under no illusion that it will be easy. This is going to be a difficult issue to resolve.\"\n\nThe Marshall Republican said he listened to opponents and citizens while crafting the new proposal, and he believes it addresses many of the concerns they voiced last year. Read on to see if you agree.\n\n\u2022 10 percent rate reduction: The House Republican proposal would require auto insurance companies to reduce policy premiums by a minimum of 10 percent for two years. While last year's plan would have required a $125 per-car reduction for one year, Bolger said the new percentage proposal would mean more savings for those paying more, and he expects cheaper rates in future years as a result of marketplace competition. A family of four paying $2,500 in auto insurance premiums would be guaranteed savings of $250 in each of those first two years, minus a $25 per policy assessment fee described in greater detail below.\n\n\u2022 $10 million cap on lifetime coverage: Michigan is the only state in the nation that requires unlimited personal injury protection in auto insurance policies, and proposals to cap that coverage have generated heated debate. Last year's plan included a $1 million cap, which Snyder said would cover 99.5 percent of all claims. Bolger is proposing a $10 million cap, which he said would cover 99.99 percent of all claims that have been paid out through the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association. With additional reforms, he thinks few individuals would reach the cap, and those that do would then be covered by a public or private health plan. \"Our goal is that nobody will hit this cap,\" Bolger said, \"but we believe the existence of a cap is important. The reason for that is if somebody has no cap whatsoever, and everything must be covered, then nobody bothers to ask, is this effective? Is this beneficial?\"\n\n\u2022 Health care fee schedule: A key provision of the new House Republican proposal is a fee schedule that would guarantee payments to health care providers at 125 percent of worker' compensation rates if insurance companies pay the claim within 30 days. Bolger said this would incentivize both insurers and health care providers to settle their bills without prolonged legal battles that contribute to policy costs. Health care providers typically charge a set rate for all services, but data suggests that auto insurers end up paying more than private health insurers, according to the non-partisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan. Bolger believes that hospitals are shifting the cost of uncompensated care onto auto insurers but noted that those costs should go down as a result of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. At 125 percent of the worker's comp fee schedule, \"auto insurance would still be the best reimbursement, the best coverage and the best payer,\" he said.\n\n\u2022 It's not 'no-fault' reform: Michigan is a no-fault state, meaning that if you get into a crash, your no-fault insurance pays for damages whether or not you were at fault and limits your ability to sue. While lawmakers have been debating \"no-fault auto insurance reform\" for years, House Republicans argue that phrase doesn't accurately describe what they are trying to do \"We aren't touching the no-fault aspect of auto no-fault,\" said Bolger.\n\n\u2022 $25 HICA charge: The new auto insurance reform proposal, like last year's model, seeks to address a revenue shortfall from the state's new Health Income Claims Assessment tax, which replaced an older use tax model in 2012. That tax is projected to generate more than $100 million a year less than originally anticipated. The House Republican proposal includes a $25 charge per insurance policy to supplement the HICA tax, which is paid on all health insurance claims. \"Auto insurance is a health care provider, and so I think it's important to address, or appropriate to address this shortfall, within this,\" Bolger said. The per-policy charge would put a small dent in the proposed two-year mandatory 10 percent premium reduction.\n\n\u2022 MCCA changes: Critics of auto insurance reform have long questioned the long-term financial assumptions of the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association, which reimburses insurance companies for claims exceeding $530,000 -- and currently mandates that insurers include a $186 premium on every policy. The House Republican proposal seeks to guarantee future transparency by creating a new subset of the MCCA that would process all new claims, be required to post financial data online and hold open meetings. The proposal would establish a new MCCA board that includes equal representation for health care providers. It would establish the MCCA as a \"clearinghouse\" for claims instead of requiring health providers to work with multiple insurers for reimbursement.\n\n\u2022 Low-income, low-cost, low-cap option: Michigan's auto insurance rates are among the highest in the country, and rates are especially exorbitant in urban areas such as Detroit. Bolger is proposing a low-cost option for individuals who earn up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level -- roughly $15,000 a year -- who have received no more than one ticket in the last three years and have not been convicted of a serious driving offense, such as drunk driving. The low-cost policy would cap lifetime personal injury protection at $50,000 and would not cover other individuals injured in an accident, who would have to rely on a private or public health plan. It's not clear how much cheaper the low-cost policies would be, but Bolger's office anticipates savings in the 50 percent range.\n\n\u2022 'Fix it' ticket: It's estimated that one in five Michigan motorists choose to drive without auto insurance rather than pay a premium, a reality that can lead to increased costs for everyone else. While lower premium costs might encourage adoption, Bolger said that separate legislation will address the problem by increasing compliance requirements but also offering uninsured motorists a form of amnesty through a \"fix it\" ticket. Motorists citied for driving without insurance could avoid a fine by purchasing a policy. \"Many times today, you're faced with a penalty, and once people have to pay the penalty, they can't afford to buy the auto insurance they weren't carrying,\" Bolger said.\n\n\u2022 'Reasonably necessary' charges: The proposal contains some cost-cutting measures designed to reign in long-term costs, including attendant care charges. Under the proposal, family members serving as caregivers generally would be limited to working 56 hours per week at $15 per hour, a rate that would be adjusted for inflation every three years. Licensed providers could charge for 24 hours a day. Last year's proposal would have changed Michigan law to guarantee provider payment for \"medically appropriate\" care and services, which frustrated critics, but Bolger said \"we're leaving 'reasonably necessary' in there\" this time around.\n\n\u2022 Fraud prevention: Bolger's proposed legislation would create a fraud authority tasked with investigating and prosecuting fraud or abuse. Democrats and other critics who opposed recent efforts to reform Michigan's auto insurance system have offered support for fraud prevention provisions in previous proposals.\n\nJonathan Oosting is a Capitol reporter for MLive Media Group.
