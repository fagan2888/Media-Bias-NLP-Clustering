Over the past four years, Gov. Chris Christie has bulldogged his way to the top of the dogpile that is national politics. Whether he’ll stay there remains to be seen.

One thing’s for certain: A room with Chris Christie in it is never a dull room. Of all the governors I’ve had the privilege to draw, Christie is probably the most interesting, and that includes the guy who came out of the closet on national television.

Hopefully, the next four (or two) years will be just as compelling as the first four. He’s off to a hell of a start.
