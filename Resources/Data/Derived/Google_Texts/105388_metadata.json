Winners, who spent 10 years in the military, initially visited Denver\u2019s VA Medical Center where she quickly discovered doctors had not been trained to treat transgender patients. She was ultimately denied care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe to somebody who\u2019s not transgender what it\u2019s like to live your entire life in a body you don\u2019t recognize,\u201d she said. \u201cTo go to the place where I felt I could get care, which was the VA, and to be denied was awful. It was so awful, I didn\u2019t step foot in a VA for the next three years.\u201d\n\nEven though she was finishing college, Winners ended up paying for her transition out of pocket at an average annual cost of $1,800.\n\nToday, Winners is employed as an engineer and has health insurance through Kaiser Permanente. The insurer gives transgender clients a list of preferred providers trained in transgender-specific care.\n\n\u201cThe biggest change is actually having a primary care physician that\u2019s not only educated about transgender health care but passionate about advocating for transgender people,\u201d Winners said.\n\nWinners\u2019s latest health care experience is indicative of major ground won by transgender people and their advocates. Even so, her previous experience of exclusion still persists for many in the transgender community.\n\nA new report from LGBTQ rights organization One Colorado entitled Transparent sheds light on the successes and challenges transgender Coloradans have found in the rapidly evolving health care system. The passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare) and Colorado\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid led to some of the more radical changes in accessibility.\n\n\u201cThe ACA includes gender identity in its nondiscrimination clause,\u201d said Leo Kattari, the Health Policy Manager at One Colorado, noting that state statute makes a similar prohibition.\n\n\u201cAt the state level, it gave those of us in Colorado the opportunity to work with the Division of Insurance to release a bulletin saying that exclusions in health care policies targeted to transgender people is discrimination.\u201d\n\nSince March 2013, when bulletin B-4.49 was released, Kattari says transgender patients can no longer be denied care or asked to pay more for it than everyone else.\n\n\u201cTestosterone, for example, was covered for a cis man. But a person who is female to male would go to a doctor for a testosterone prescription and get denied. That\u2019s blatant discrimination,\u201d said Kattari.\n\nThough Colorado is one of just seven states with similar protections for transgender patients, it\u2019s one of 27 states, plus Washington D.C., to expand Medicaid.\n\nKattari noted that the expansion has lead to an 8 percent jump in the number of transgender Coloradans with health care through Medicaid since 2011.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge jump,\u201d Kattari said. \u201cBut income disparity is part of why a lot of folks now qualify for Medicaid.\u201d\n\nIndeed while the new One Colorado report indicates that the overall number of transgender Coloradans with healthcare has jumped from 73 percent to 86 percent since 2011, far fewer of them receive benefits through their employer than cis Coloradans. In fact, transgender people are more than twice as likely to rely on Medicaid, in large part due to astonishing income and employment gaps:\n\nAs a result, though coverage has improved, transgender Coloradans are still uninsured at higher rates than the general population (14 percent to 11 percent) and 40 percent still say cost is their primary barrier to accessing care.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given the history of structural exclusion in health care, just under a third of transgender Coloradans say fear of discrimination is the second-biggest barrier to their accessing care. Kattari notes that discrimination against transgender people is hardly limited to the doctor\u2019s office but extends into the everyday, from navigating social norms surrounding gender presentation and public bathroom use to being routinely addressed with the wrong pronoun. The net effect of exclusion from care and often daily discrimination paints a troubling picture of mental health for those in Colorado\u2019s transgender community.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese high levels of depression and anxiety are not because folks are transgender, but because of repeated experiences of prejudice and stigma,\u201d said Kattari. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a doctor who knows to ask for your preferred name and pronoun or is willing to prescribe hormones. To get access to a provider you trust is hard.\u201d\n\nOne Colorado did find that having an inclusive provider was a serious indicator of better mental health among transgender people, though it didn\u2019t bring patients mental health totally in line with the general population. For example, transgender people with an inclusive provider were half as likely to have attempted suicide in the past year, but still seven times more likely to have attempted than the general population.\n\n\u201cUntil the medical community understands who transgender people are and has studied the data on the health disparities they face, transgender Coloradans\u2019 health care needs will never truly be addressed,\u201d Kattari concluded in the report\u2019s release. \u201cWe have worked hard to begin tackling the barriers that transgender Coloradans face in our health systems, but there is much more work to do to ensure that all of us are receiving the care and the coverage we deserve.\u201d\n\n[Graphics from the Transparent report.
