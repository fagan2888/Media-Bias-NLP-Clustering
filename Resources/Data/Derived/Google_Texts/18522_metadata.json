In both parties, voters are choosing more centrist contenders over their more ideological rivals.\n\nIt might not always seem that way \u2014 Republican front-runner Donald Trump has spouted the campaign\u2019s most extreme rhetoric. However, his positions on Obamacare and Planned Parenthood are less doctrinaire than those of his two main rivals, even as he confounds some GOP conservatives by winning so many conservative votes.\n\nMeanwhile, the most outspokenly conservative contender, Sen. Ted Cruz, has largely failed to expand the evangelical support he used to win Iowa caucuses into the broader backing needed to be nominated \u2014 just like Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum and 2012.\n\nDespite winning his home state of Texas, along with Oklahoma and Alaska, and finishing second in four other states on Tuesday, he failed to score the Southern breakthrough he once counted upon. Cruz actually helped Trump by keeping Marco Rubio from doing better while remaining almost as unacceptable to party leaders as Trump. Now, it\u2019s on to turf less favorable to Cruz in the north.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton\u2019s overwhelming victories over Bernie Sanders in seven of the 11 states make clear that, barring a self-inflicted wound or some legal barrier, Democrats will reject the Pied Piper of Burlington and his effort to mobilize the young, the Left and the disaffected with his message of free education, free health coverage and other governmental goodies.\n\nIn the past, rejection of extremes has enabled both parties to win presidential elections. It\u2019s why Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton succeeded where George McGovern and Walter Mondale failed, and why Richard Nixon won just four years after Barry Goldwater lost.\n\nCruz has cited Ronald Reagan as an example of how an avowedly conservative candidate can win. But Reagan brought to his presidential campaign a patina of pragmatism from eight years as California\u2019s governor.\n\nThe philosophically flexible Trump is clearly a less-rigid conservative than Cruz. But the contrast between the tone of the Democratic and Republican campaigns might offset any potential benefit as we look toward the summer and fall.\n\nThe respectful way with which Clinton and Sanders have focused on issues differences should enable the former Secretary of State to preside over a united party at this July\u2019s Democratic convention.\n\nOn the other hand, the way Trump has denigrated his rivals in highly personal terms, attacked such groups as Mexicans and Muslims and mishandled such matters as last week\u2019s stumble over repudiating Ku Klux Klan support has created havoc within the GOP that will shadow his campaign, even as the party\u2019s nominee.\n\nAt a time when Republicans need to broaden their appeal, Trump could win even fewer votes from non-white Americans than the candidates who lost the past two elections to the nation\u2019s first African-American president.\n\nTrump has, though, shown a greater ability than some past Republicans to attract lower-income, less-educated white voters and many independents or Democrats who are suffering economically. Though white voters are a decreasing portion of the electorate, these voters could help him in some northern industrial states.\n\nAt Tuesday night\u2019s victory celebration, Trump and his new ally, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, sought to set a tone of GOP and national unity. The tone of the Republican campaign will make that a task to test all of the billionaire developer\u2019s salesmanship skills.\n\nTrump remains something of a philosophical mystery. His anti-immigration and anti-abortion rights stances fit the current GOP, but he has also called for health insurance for all, even as he proposes to scrap Obamacare. And he continues to praise Planned Parenthood\u2019s efforts to help women\u2019s health.\n\nBoth Cruz and Rubio would clearly pursue more rigidly conservative policies, just as Sanders is avowedly to the left of Clinton.\n\nOnce again, the American people seem to be heading for a choice between two more centrist courses \u2014 even though the rhetoric indicates otherwise.\n\nCarl P.
