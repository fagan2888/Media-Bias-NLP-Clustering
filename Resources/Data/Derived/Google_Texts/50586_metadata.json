Still, the past year\u2019s steady rise in support for Oculus has greased the wheels for competitors looking to enter the market or court investment capital from hedge funds and Kickstarter technophiles. Oculus is now all but synonymous with 3D wearable displays, though, so anyone looking to capitalize on that company\u2019s success had better have a way of powerfully differentiating themselves.\n\nEnter Avegant, which came out of hiding today to unveil a prototype of the Glyph. Taking a page out of Oculus\u2019 horrible naming handbook, the Avegant Glyph also sounds like a video-game franchise or multi-billion dollar ICBM targeting software. Unlike Oculus, however, Glyph doesn\u2019t feature any display device at all \u2014 with Glyph, the only place the image ever really exists is in your mind. The technology is called Virtual Retinal Display (VRD), and it uses a projector which sends its image directly onto the retina, in much the same way that a CRT television projects a picture onto the glass of the screen. Here, though, there is no slab of glass to absorb and re-emit light into the real world; the only place Glyph\u2019s VRD images ever exist is inside the eye of the user.\n\nIn this way, VRD is really closer to augmented reality (AR) than a traditional display, as images are layered over the real world, edited into the larger pattern of light entering your eye from the scene as a whole. Unlike \u201ctrue\u201d VR displays like Oculus Rift, Glyph will only fill a portion of your vision with its picture. A glance down at your keyboard will still work, as will a glance over to the side at a friend\u2019s face; Glyph is meant to work with the real world, not to completely obscure it. This also makes it more useful for integration into real life \u2014 for instance, as \u201cremote presence\u201d robots come to prominence among executives, it will be important to be able to see what the robot sees without losing orientation in the real world. Neither the Rift nor Google\u2019s Glass can fulfill both those goals, at present.\n\nSince its picture only exists for you, looking away from the Glyph display means the image fundamentally doesn\u2019t exist. That\u2019s one reason VRD has received little attention from mainstream display manufacturers: in VRD, every observer needs their own projector, but most displays are still sold for communal use. It wasn\u2019t until computing, and to a lesser extent media, became such a pervasive and private affair that VRD began to make sense for display. Suddenly, its greatest limitation became a virtue: a VRD image is totally private, and cannot (right now) be viewed by anyone but the intended observer.\n\nThat image will come in the form of two 1280\u00d7800 displays \u2014 though just what that resolution means with this retinal technology, very few people currently know first hand. That story will become clearer as time goes on. Right now, we do know that while the Glyph isn\u2019t specifically designed for immersive gaming, it does have head-tracking capabilities, so it could be used for Oculus-style VR even if that isn\u2019t its main purpose.\n\nGlyph has the general form factor of a set of high-quality headphones, and delivers audio quality to match. With 40mm drivers, Avegant wants to keep the unit to looking like a respectable set of hi-fi cans, rather than like some sort of Cyberman version of a face-hugger. Users should expect an extremely clear sound with low distortion and some respectable (but not mind-blowing) bass boost. By all reports, the phones are more than good enough to justify using Glyph on their own.\n\nBut not, perhaps, buying Glyph. At a projected $500 price point, the device will ultimately sink or swim on the merits of its display. A disappointing three-hour battery life while displaying images will bring down utility on flights and other leisure times. This is doubly disappointing since one of the main advantages of VRD is that it projects only as much light as is needed by the eye, and thus has the ability to be far more energy efficient than normal displays. To be fair, Oculus Rift can\u2019t survive on batteries at all, so Glyph\u2019s short tether is still an improvement. Battery life for pure audio is still unknown.\n\nGlyph is really a portable media center. This isn\u2019t meant to immerse players in a frantic Quake deathmatch, as Oculus is, nor is it designed for everyday functionality like Glass. Rather, it is an intermediate solution for an intermediate audience. Avegant wants to change the way we view media, at least by ourselves. When their Kickstarter campaign launches sometime in early 2014, you\u2019ll have a chance to decide for yourself whether or not they\u2019ve succeeded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new challenger has appeared in the wearable computing arena, and this one has cut out the display aspect entirely, ...", "og": {"url": "http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/164399-avegant-glyph-a-3dvr-headset-that-beams-the-display-directly-onto-your-retina", "image": "http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/glyph-head.jpg", "site_name": "ExtremeTech", "description": "A new challenger has appeared in the wearable computing arena, and this one has cut out the display aspect entirely, opting to send its images directly to your eyes.", "title": "Avegant Glyph: A 3D VR headset that beams the display directly onto your retina | ExtremeTech"}, "twitter": {"domain": "extremetech.com", "description": "A new challenger has appeared in the wearable computing arena, and this one has cut out the display aspect entirely, opting to send its images directly to your eyes.", "title": "Avegant Glyph: A 3D VR headset that beams the display directly onto your retina | ExtremeTech", "url": "http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/164399-avegant-glyph-a-3dvr-headset-that-beams-the-display-directly-onto-your-retina", "image": {"src": "http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/glyph-head.jpg"}, "creator": "@ExtremeTech", "site": "ExtremeTech", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3e3e3e", "zd_ptax": "138,11929,11930,2186,11931,40,7255,360,4797,11928,7508,11932,11933", "zd_ptax_version": "ExtremeTechV1", "server_date": "2016-05-24 2:44:30 pm", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/themes/extremetech/mstile-144x144.png", "live_date": "2013-12-24", "google-site-verification": "bEUo8mwD12wASfxFwnzOt0RKFmEHsxzvy7s5itRySdQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "zdid": 164399}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd66e\"", "article_summary": "Unlike \u201ctrue\u201d VR displays like Oculus Rift, Glyph will only fill a portion of your vision with its picture.\nSince its picture only exists for you, looking away from the Glyph display means the image fundamentally doesn\u2019t exist.\nTo be fair, Oculus Rift can\u2019t survive on batteries at all, so Glyph\u2019s short tether is still an improvement.\nUnlike Oculus, however, Glyph doesn\u2019t feature any display device at all \u2014 with Glyph, the only place the image ever really exists is in your mind.\nSuddenly, its greatest limitation became a virtue: a VRD image is totally private, and cannot (right now) be viewed by anyone but the intended observer."}
