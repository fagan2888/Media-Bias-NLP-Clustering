This restriction is intended to ensure that program participants can remain in their housing after their ESG assistance ends. This restriction also helps ensure that the amount of ESG assistance provided for rental assistance is reasonable, while serving the greatest number of program participants possible.\n\nGranted By: Mark Johnston , Deputy Assistant Secretary for Special Needs, Office of Community Planning and Development .\n\nDate Granted: March 27, 2014 .\n\nReason Waived: Du Page County, Illinois , and the State of West Virginia sufficiently demonstrated their requested waivers were necessary to ensure their program participants could find habitable units in which ESG rental assistance could be used. In addition, the waivers were sufficiently limited to permit Du Page County, IL and the State of West Virginia to assist with rents that are only slightly higher than the FMR and meet HUD's standard of rent reasonableness. HUD determined that the slightly higher rents would not prevent program participants from being able to retain the housing after the assistance ends.\n\nContact: Ann M.

Regulatory Waivers Granted by the Office of Housing-- Federal Housing Administration (FHA)\n\nFor further information about the following regulatory waivers, please see the name of the contact person that immediately follows the description of the waiver granted.\n\n- Regulation: 24 CFR 200.73(c).\n\nProject/Activity: Broadway Townhomes, Camden, N.J. , Project Number: 035-35103.\n\nNature of Requirement: HUD's regulation at 24 CFR 200.73(c) requires that one site contains at least five rental dwelling units. HUD's Handbook 4425.1, Chapter 3, Part 3-7, elaborates on this regulation by stating that the project must be one site and the site may consist of two or more non-contiguous parcels, i.e. a \"scattered site,\" if they meet the requirements outlined in the handbook. In the case of a scattered site, however, a waiver of 24 CFR section 200.73(c) is needed if each noncontiguous parcel does not contain at least five rental dwelling units.\n\nGranted By: Carol J. Galante , Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing\n\nCommissioner.\n\nDate Granted: February 25, 2014 .\n\nReason Waived: Each noncontiguous parcel in the project did not contain at least five units. The project demonstrated marketability and the capability of being managed as a single real estate entity. All of the properties continue to be professionally managed and maintained as a group, have existing housing assistance payment (HAP) contracts and have been allocated low-income housing tax credits. The applicable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provisions related to the tax credits ended in December 2004 ; however, the partnership managing the project executed an extended low-income housing covenant for a total period of 30 years, which ends December 31, 2019 . No physical or other changes to the property were identified which would impact its ongoing recognition as a single project constituting 157 sites containing 175 multifamily rental units. The combined total land area for the (157) parcels in 3.91 acres or 170,295 square feet contained within 10 square blocks.\n\nContact: Theodore K. Toon , Director, Office of Multifamily Housing Development , HTD, Office of Housing , Department of Housing and Urban Development , 451 Seventh Street SW ., Room 6134 , Washington, DC 20410, telephone (202) 402-8386.\n\n- Regulation: 24 CFR 203.32(a) and 24 CFR 203.41(a)(3).\n\nProject/Activity: Downpayment Assistance/Quicken Loans' Employee Down Payment Assistance Program in Detroit, Michigan . Quicken Loans requested authority to provide downpayment assistance loans with restrictions for an amount not to exceed $20,000 per loan to its employees who purchase principal residences with FHA-insured mortgages in downtown Detroit, Michigan , so long as no part of the downpayment assistance loan was used to fund the borrower's minimum required investment for the first mortgage. For each year that an employee maintains employment with Quicken Loans, continues to occupy the property as its principal residence, and does not sell or transfer the home during a five year period, 20 percent of the unpaid principal balance on the down payment assistance loan will be forgiven. Under this waiver Quicken Loans may provide no more than eighty down payment assistance loans over a two year period.\n\nNature of Requirement: HUD's regulation at 24 CFR 203.32(a) prohibits a contractual liability resulting in unpaid obligations in connection with an FHA-insured mortgage insured, and HUD's regulation at 24 CFR203.41(a)(3) prohibits any legal restriction on the conveyance of a property insured by the FHA.\n\nGranted By: Carol J. Galante , Assistant Secretary for Housing-- Federal Housing Commissioner.\n\nDate Granted: January 31, 2014 .\n\nReason Waived: A wavier of the regulation was granted because the Quicken\n\nLoans program is aligned with HUD's focus on assisting Detroit, Michigan with its recovery from bankruptcy. The Quicken Loans program would support Detroit's local economy by encouraging investment in the Detroit housing market, thereby stimulating economic development, increasing tax revenues and renovating the housing stock in downtown Detroit . Furthermore, FHA determined that risk to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund would be minimal due to the limited scope of the program targeting one metropolitan area.\n\nContact: Arlene Nunes , Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Single Family Housing , Office of Housing , Department of Housing and Urban Development , 451 Seventh Street SW ., Room 9266 , Washington, DC 20410, telephone (202) 708-3000.\n\n- Regulation: 24 CFR 219.220(b).\n\nProject/Activity: Pine Grove Apartments , FHA Project Number 023-027NI, Taunton, MA.

Galante , Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner.\n\nDate Granted: January 13, 2014 .\n\nReason Waived: The owner requested and was granted waiver of the requirement to defer repayment of the Flexible Subsidy Operating Assistance Loan to allow the much needed preservation and moderate rehabilitation of the project.

The waiver revised those provisions as follows:\n\n? Properties that are currently HUD-assisted or FHA-insured that will not engage in activities with physical impacts or changes beyond routine maintenance activities or minimal repairs will not have to comply with the environmental tenets.\n\n? Clarification that if, at the time that a project applies for PRAD assistance, the project is under construction or being rehabilitated, the project shall be subject to the environmental review requirements applicable to new construction or rehab if the work has not progressed beyond a stage of construction where modifications can be undertaken to avoid the adverse environmental impacts addressed by the requirement.\n\n? Projects will have the option to evaluate the site for contamination issues either through an assessment process that is detailed in the proposed revision and is similar to the Office of Community Planning and Development's Continuum of Care (a similar rental assistance program) contamination assessment requirements, or through an ASTM E 1527-05 (or most recent edition) Phase I ESA.\n\n? If the project involves an existing property for which a Phase I ESA was prepared previously for a real estate transaction, and that Phase I ESA met ASTM Phase I ESA requirements at the time it was prepared, a new Phase I ESA will not be required for that project.\n\n? Coastal Barrier Resources was removed as an environmental tenet and made a separate requirement because the statutory obligations of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act remain even without a HUD project level review.\n\nGranted by: Carol J. Galante , Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner.\n\nDate Granted: March 14, 2014 .\n\nReason Waived: The waiver responds to concerns raised by the grantees and further aligns the Section 811 Project Rental Assistance Demonstration NOFA with the environmental requirements and environmental policies of the Office of Housing and HUD generally. Properties that are currently HUD-assisted or FHA-insured and will undergo no more that routine maintenance activities or minimal repairs have already undergone applicable environmental reviews at time of the original assistance or insurance, and will not undergo significant new physical changes in connection with the PRA assistance. The optional process for evaluating a site for contamination issues, and the use of existing Phase I ESAs that were ASTM-compliant, will facilitate use of the PRA Demo by permitting less costly methods of assessment for contamination while continuing to protect the health and safety of residents. Revising the reference to the Coastal Barrier Resources Act will not alter the applicable requirement but will simply clarify that the requirement is required by statute.\n\nContact: Catherine M.
