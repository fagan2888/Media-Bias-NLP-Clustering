LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Special Olympic World Games kicked off Saturday in Los Angeles as 6,500 athletes from 165 countries streamed into the Memorial Coliseum to cheers and roars.

The athletes will participate in 25 sports over nine days, ranging from weightlifting to the triathlon. Applause greeted the athletes, including a tiny contingent from Afghanistan.

It was the largest gathering of athletes in Los Angeles since the 1984 Summer Olympics.

First lady Michelle Obama was to deliver the opening message, followed by musical performances by Avril Lavigne, Stevie Wonder, Colombian reggaeton artist J Balvin and others.

Late-night television talk show host Jimmy Kimmel thanked the competitors and the international crowd of spectators for coming and joked about California’s long drought, saying he hoped they brought water.

“That Olympic flame they’re going to light will truly burn forever because we don’t have the water to put it out,” Kimmel said.

Kimmel also praised the athletes. “You remind me of how deeply lazy a man I am,” he said.

Emmy Award-winning choreographer Debbie Allen is directing the three-hour program being broadcast live by ESPN.

The real stars of the show, however, were expected to be the athletes.
