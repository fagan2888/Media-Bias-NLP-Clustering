Additionally, organizers tore down a decrepit farmhouse in August that stood on the 7-acre parcel at the intersection of Routes 3 and 220, where the proposed $775,000 homeless veterans\u2019 shelter would be built.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot of money to raise, but organizers like Warren Ard, a local contractor who served in the Army during the Vietnam War era, said he\u2019s confident they can do it. Volunteers have stepped up to help, doing work like taking down the farmhouse and starting to prepare the site for the new structure.\n\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a veteran out there that calls the street home,\u201d he said recently.\n\nThe name Garry Owen does not refer to a person, Ard said, but to a legend in an Irish tune that dates back to the 1600s. Garryowen is a place in Ireland. The song has been used by the U.S. Army\u2019s 1st and 7th Cavalry Regiments and holds an honored place in military history. Three years ago, Ard and several others formed the Garry Owen Motorcycle Club with the ultimate goal of building and maintaining a shelter for veterans \u2014 but not the kind of shelter that kicks people out during the day or after just a few nights.\n\nIt will be designed to address specific needs of veterans that include substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, broken marriages and a general mistrust of the government that may discourage some to seek help through the Veterans Administration. According to the blueprints for the Garry Owen House, it will be a spacious, one-story building with room for 24 beds and a large gathering room in the center. The veterans will be able to grow vegetables on the land around the facility, Ard said. It would be the only shelter of its kind in the state.\n\nThe plans sounded good to Joseph and Kristen Dorval of Belfast, who learned about the Garry Owen House while they were getting ready for their recent wedding. Joseph Dorval, 31, who served two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan while in the Army and in the Maine Army National Guard, said he decided that instead of getting many small gifts for the couple\u2019s groomsmen and bridesmaids, they felt the money would be better used by donating it to the Garry Owen House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a veteran, and I had a lot of people help me out. They didn\u2019t need to, but they helped me get back into regular society,\u201d Dorval said recently. \u201cThe Garry Owen House \u2014 they\u2019re just helping those guys get the help they need. \u2026 We didn\u2019t just do it to feel good about ourselves. I just figured it was the best use of that money.\u201d\n\nArd said he was deeply appreciative of the Dorvals\u2019 gift.\n\n\u201cIt just shows true American spirit from a veteran who has been through so much,\u201d Ard said Tuesday. \u201cTo still keep giving to his brothers \u2014 it\u2019s a remarkable thing. He went above and beyond the call of duty.\u201d\n\nAnother gift to the shelter came via a charity motorcycle ride over the weekend, which raised nearly $1,500 for the house.\n\nCarle said many other people have indicated they would like to give money to the effort, too. But the group has been waiting until they can find a fiscal agent, which will allow the Garry Owen House board to give a charitable donations letter to donors for tax purposes. She said a representative from a Waldo County nonprofit agency attended a recent board meeting to learn about the new group. Now, Garry Owen House board members are waiting for that nonprofit agency to vote on whether they will become the fiscal agent. They did not want to name the organization until a decision has been made.\n\nBut Ard isn\u2019t waiting. The bearded, motorcycle-riding builder said he\u2019s going to attend the Common Ground Country Fair in Unity later this month to get the word out to a sector of the population perhaps more noted for peace activism.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind them,\u201d he said of the stereotypical Common Ground Country Fair attendee. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to like war. But we have to take care of the men that did go to give them the freedom not to like it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "MONTVILLE, Maine \u2014 Volunteers have cleared land in Montville and have started raising funds for the Garry Owen House, a place that would serve homeless veterans from all over the state.
