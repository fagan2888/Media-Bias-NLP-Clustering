Rand Paul plans to air a television ad in Iowa and New Hampshire during next week's Republican presidential debate â€” a modest bet that intense interest in the televised debates can revive his lagging poll numbers.

The Kentucky senator's campaign has reserved almost $10,000 on CNN in both coveted early primary states during the Sept. 16 debate, according to an ad-tracking source. The first GOP debate, which aired on Fox News Channel, earned record-high ratings.

The spending move comes as Paul tries to stay competitive despite lackluster polling in both states. Recent NBC News/Marist polls in Iowa and New Hampshire showed Paul at just 5 percent in each state, trailing a number of his rivals for the nomination.

Paul isn't the only one hoping to capitalize on the expected high viewership for the debate. In his home state of Kentucky, a group backed by the Republican Governors Association has reserved airtime on CNN to boost Matt Bevin, the GOP candidate in this year's gubernatorial race.
