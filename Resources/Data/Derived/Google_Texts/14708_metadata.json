Whether these stories were traded covertly among women as practical advice or declared publicly as an act of political defiance, the simple act of sharing goes a long way back. But that hasn\u2019t made the choice to talk an easy one. Women who speak out are still targeted for harassment and other threats, and the right to access abortion as basic medical care is as contested as ever. Given the current reproductive health landscape, more storytelling \u2014 in addition to sustained political pressure, funding to local providers and continued focus on the economic and cultural issues that hurt women\u2019s ability to control their own lives \u2014 is an important and necessary thing.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Center for Reproductive Rights launched a new campaign featuring women and men telling stories related to their own reproductive healthcare choices. In addition to a story from Padma Lakshmi on how access to birth control helped her manage her endometriosis, singer Dee Dee Bridgewater shares a powerful and painful account of getting an abortion before Roe v. Wade.\n\nThese are important stories because they\u2019re real stories. Plenty of women take birth control for reasons that aren\u2019t entirely related to pregnancy, just like so many others were forced to seek out dangerous abortions at a time when no other option existed, particularly low-income women of color who couldn\u2019t get the procedure in a hush-hush way from their private doctors. (The same disparities in access exist today.)\n\nBut while hearing these stories, and when listening to Wendy Davis share her own story several weeks ago, I was reminded of how difficult it remains to talk about the full range of experiences that people seeking abortion go through \u2014 the stories that don\u2019t neatly fit into any single narrative.\n\nA few months back, I interviewed a woman named Emily Letts about her decision to film her abortion and post it online. At the time we talked, she said she wanted to challenge stigma around the procedure and demystify the process for people who only think about abortion as an abstract political concept. \u201cSo many of the decisions [women make about abortion] are influenced by the idea that they are not allowed to talk about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea that their family would shame them. The idea that they will be made to feel totally and completely isolated even though they need help and support dealing with an unintended pregnancy.\u201d\n\nIt was through our conversation that, again, this idea of a \u201cgood\u201d abortion story came up:\n\nSalon: We tend to have these narratives \u2014 even within the reproductive rights movement \u2014 of how we\u2019re allowed to talk about abortion. We generally talk about the \u201cgood\u201d abortions. The ones that are sufficiently early on, or the tragic circumstances where a parent finds herself terminating a wanted pregnancy because of a dangerous health complication. And it\u2019s important to tell those stories because those stories are true, but there is a pretty broad range of experience that gets erased when this is how we talk about abortion. Emily Letts: Yeah, absolutely. I did this awesome interview with BBC Radio Service, and it was five women including myself, on international television, sharing our abortion stories, and how we felt about it. And three of the women talk about their regrets and how they\u2019re pro-life now, and then me and another women were saying, \u201cNo, I feel OK about my abortion. I feel great, thanks.\u201d [\u2026] That\u2019s why my clinic invests in having at least three counselors on each day, so we can take the time to talk to you about your decision. How are you coping, how do you feel afterward?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Storytelling campaigns are creating more space to talk honestly, but there's still a long way to go", "title": "Abortion beyond \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d: Why it\u2019s so important to share nuanced stories", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Storytelling campaigns are creating more space to talk honestly, but there's still a long way to go", "title": "Abortion beyond \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d: Why it\u2019s so important to share nuanced stories", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/25/abortion_beyond_good_and_bad_why_its_so_important_to_share_nuanced_stories/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/abortion_rally.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Storytelling campaigns are creating more space to talk honestly, but there's still a long way to go", "title": "Abortion beyond \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d: Why it\u2019s so important to share nuanced stories", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/abortion_rally.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, abortion care, reproductive freedom, reproductive justice, Reproductive Rights", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca0e4\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Abortion, abortion care, reproductive freedom, reproductive justice, Reproductive Rights, Politics NewsWomen have been telling their abortion stories for as long as women have been having abortions.\nOn Wednesday, the Center for Reproductive Rights launched a new campaign featuring women and men telling stories related to their own reproductive healthcare choices.\nAnd three of the women talk about their regrets and how they\u2019re pro-life now, and then me and another women were saying, \u201cNo, I feel OK about my abortion.\n\u201cSo many of the decisions [women make about abortion] are influenced by the idea that they are not allowed to talk about it,\u201d she said.\nA few months back, I interviewed a woman named Emily Letts about her decision to film her abortion and post it online."}
