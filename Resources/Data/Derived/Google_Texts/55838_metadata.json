They don\u2019t want change.\n\n\u201cPeople disagree. I want people to step back and take a look.\u201d\n\nObama said he recognizes people are \u201coutraged\u201d at what they consider government\u2019s ineptitude and corruption. But \u201cif you follow this process \u2026 then we can sort it out. Not everyone is going to be completely happy, but it beats any other system. This is going to work about as well as it can.\u201d\n\nObama took Republican leaders to task for refusing to go through the confirmation process for Garland, saying the \u201cSenate should do its constitutional job.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\n\u201cOur goal is just to make sure the Senate does its job and treats him fairly,\u201d Obama said, noting some Republicans have agreed to meet privately with Garland even though the leadership has maintained it will not hold hearings on his nomination to replace Antonin Scalia, who died in February.\n\nObama said the Senate\u2019s refusal is unprecedented and warned Republican intransigence could lead to more \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d retaliation from Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have a situation in which the Senate says because there\u2019s a Democratic president, we are not going to do our job. \u2026 If that happens, it is almost impossible not to expect the Democrats wouldn\u2019t say the exact same things,\u201d Obama said, adding there would be nothing to stop them from saying if a Republican wins the presidency, they will wait four years to act on a high court nominee.\n\n\u201cI think if they go through the process, they won\u2019t have a rationale to defeat him [Garland],\u201d he said.\n\nObama denied his approach to terrorism is too soft, saying he has \u201ctaken more terrorists off the field\u201d than any previous president, and criticized Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz for promoting carpet-bombing to fight the Islamic State group and banning Muslims from entering the United States, calling such suggestions counterproductive.\n\nObama said his \u201cNo. 1 job\u201d is to protect the American people and his \u201cNo. 1 priority\u201d is to defeat ISIS.\n\n\u201cHow we do it is important,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe have to make sure we abide by our laws. We have to make sure we abide by our values. \u2026 Our approach has to be smart.\u201d\n\nObama said his best day in office was the day healthcare reform passed in 2009, and the worst was the day he visited Newtown, Connecticut, after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre that left 26 people dead, mostly 6 and 7 year olds. His worst mistake, he said was not planning for the aftermath following the intervention in Libya.\n\nWhat is Obama looking forward to most once he leaves office? \u201cBeing able to take a walk outside.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "president obama, barack obama, merrick garland, supreme court nominee merrick garland, republican leaders, mitch mcconnell, constitutional duty, senate hearings, garland nomination, polarization of politics, great recession, economic recovery", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "The president said his administration is not given enough credit for repairing the economy but expects perceptions to change over time.", "title": "US President Barack Obama Laments Political Polarization, Says Republicans, Democrats Need To Listen To Each Other", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/us-president-barack-obama-laments-political-polarization-says-republicans-democrats-2351335", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/04/10/obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president said his administration is not given enough credit for repairing the economy but expects perceptions to change over time.", "title": "US President Barack Obama Laments Political Polarization, Says Republicans, Democrats Need To Listen To Each Other", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/us-president-barack-obama-laments-political-polarization-says-republicans-democrats-2351335", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/04/10/obama.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/04/10/obama.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "National", "published_time": "2016-04-10T12:22:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-10T12:55:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The president said his administration is not given enough credit for repairing the economy but expects perceptions to change over time."}, "article_summary": "President Barack Obama lamented the polarization of U.S. politics, saying if people listen only to those who agree with them, outrage and frustration will grow.\n\u201cThe danger among Republicans and Democrats who increasingly just listen to people who agree them \u2026 we don\u2019t hear each other,\u201d Obama said.\nObama said the Senate\u2019s refusal is unprecedented and warned Republican intransigence could lead to more \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d retaliation from Democrats.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have a situation in which the Senate says because there\u2019s a Democratic president, we are not going to do our job.\n\u2026 If Democrats \u2026 say why didn\u2019t we have a public option [for healthcare] or a single-payer system \u2026 85 percent get healthcare through their jobs."}
