Ramsey, better known as the DJ Dr. Nick Redbone on 103.1 The Edge.\n\nThough Americans have more options today, with online and satellite radio, traditional AM/FM radio continues to reach the overwhelming majority of the American public with 91 percent of Americans ages 12 and older, says a 2014 Pew Research Center analysis of Nielsen Media Research data.\n\n\u201cThe DJs that are doing it successfully have become entertainment brands unto themselves,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cThe Dr. Nick Redbone brand is a 24 hours job and every jock worth his salt is doing the same thing.\u201d\n\nKEDJ plays rock music and receives a 7-day audience of 2,472 listeners, according to the Fall 2014 Eastlan Ratings, a privately held media-research firm headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. KEDJ is owned by Lee Family Broadcasting Group. The company\u2019s top listened to station is KZDX Hot 100, which plays music from the 80s to modern hits. The station brings in a 7-day audience of 4,779 listeners.\n\nEastlan Ratings was formed in 1999 and provides radio audience measurement data to over 450 subscribing radio stations in more than 90 markets across the United States.\n\nRamsey said besides having an on-air presence, having an online presence is just as important. That\u2019s getting a Facebook page, webpage, Twitter and Instagram accounts, and audio platforms like SoundCloud.\n\nMore than half of Americans ages 12 and older have listened to online radio in the past month, according to 2015 survey data from Edison Research, an indication that online listening continues to move rapidly and more of that listening is now being done through mobile devices than through desktops.\n\nLarry Johnson, president and general manager at Locally Owned Radio, and his wife, Stephanie have owned the company since August 2003.\n\n\u201cWe love it. Once you get in your blood, you got it,\u201d Larry said.\n\nOne of the biggest differences since 1985, when Larry got into the business, is that radio was live 24 hours a day. Now a majority of radio is automated.\n\n\u201cJust like every other industry in the world, with computers and the Internet, everything has changed dramatically,\u201d he said. \u201cI can run an entire radio station from a bedroom. We are not live 24 hours a day. We can sound like we are live 24 hours a day, but we are not.\u201d\n\nOne of Locally Owned Radio\u2019s most popular stations is KTPZ Music Monster, which plays top 40 hits and features local DJ Joey Bravo.\n\nKTPZ receives a 7-day audience of 9,064 listeners.\n\n\u201cAll of our stations have been our most popular at one time or another,\u201d Larry said.\n\nAt one time, BOB FM was the top station. It plays a variety of music from the 70s to present-day hits.\n\n\u201cWhere there has been attrition in other media, radio hasn\u2019t really seen that,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI think it\u2019s because it\u2019s free, easy and affordable. You can take it everywhere. You can watch TV in a lot of cars, but you can\u2019t drive while do it.\u201d\n\nIn the Magic Valley, the radio station that tops others in listeners is KEZJ, owned by Townsquare Media. The country station receives a 7-day audience of 13,678 listeners. The company\u2019s news and talk station KLIX AM, received a 7-day audience of 8,158 listeners in 2014. In 2011, KLIX AM had its highest 7-day audience of 11,866. KEZJ\u2019s audience has increased over the years and its numbers are on par with last year\u2019s. KLIX FM plays classic hits and receives a 7-day audience of 5,933 listeners.\n\n\u201cPeople are still driving their cars and listening to the radio when they are at work at home,\u201d Janice Degner, general manager of Townsquare Media said.\n\nDegner said radio trends are also influenced by up-and-coming generations. Kool 96.5 used to play music from the 60s and 70s. Now anything from the 60s is rarely played and the station plays more music from the 70s and 80s.\n\n\u201cThe definition of oldies is changing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe one thing with radio that is different from the rest is that it\u2019s free and it doesn\u2019t cost you anything to listen. It goes everywhere you go.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times-News, http://www.magicvalley.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "These days radio is a lot more than playing songs on a request line.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "These days radio is a lot more than playing songs on a request line.", "title": "Magic Valley radio stations adapt as tastes change", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/22/magic-valley-radio-stations-adapt-as-tastes-change/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/22/8ffcbdd15966a7257f0f6a7067009f09.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/22/8ffcbdd15966a7257f0f6a7067009f09.jpg", "description": "These days radio is a lot more than playing songs on a request line.", "card": "summary", "title": "Magic Valley radio stations adapt as tastes change"}, "Author": "TETONA DUNLAP", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Eastlan Ratings was formed in 1999 and provides radio audience measurement data to over 450 subscribing radio stations in more than 90 markets across the United States.\nLarry Johnson, president and general manager at Locally Owned Radio, and his wife, Stephanie have owned the company since August 2003.\n\u201cWhere there has been attrition in other media, radio hasn\u2019t really seen that,\u201d Larry said.\nNow anything from the 60s is rarely played and the station plays more music from the 70s and 80s.\nThe company\u2019s top listened to station is KZDX Hot 100, which plays music from the 80s to modern hits."}
