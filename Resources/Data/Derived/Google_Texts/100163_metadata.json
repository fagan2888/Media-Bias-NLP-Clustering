The incident was filmed by ABC 7 and is quickly going viral on the internet.\n\nPer ABC 7 reporter Kris Van Cleave's Twitter, Santa is doing okay. There are currently no suspects in the shooting, but it's safe to say the culprit has earned himself a spot on the naughty list this year.\n\n.@DCPoliceDept officers on scene believe pellet gun shots came from a 2nd story window. No suspect in pellet shooting of Santa. Santa is OK \u2014 Kris Van Cleave (@ABC7Kris) December 24, 2013\n\nThis is just really sad. The last place someone should expect to get shot by a pellet gun would be during a charity giveaway. Santa could have been seriously hurt if he had been struck in the face. I'm glad everyone is okay.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Santa is reportedly okay, and wanted to continue with the charity giveaway..05/24/2016 2:10:13AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Santa is reportedly okay, and wanted to continue with the charity giveaway.", "title": "- Santa Shot By Pellet Gun in SE DC", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2013/12/24/santa-shot-by-pellet-gun-in-se-dc-n1768248", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2013/12/24/0.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Santa is reportedly okay, and wanted to continue with the charity giveaway.", "title": "- Santa Shot By Pellet Gun in SE DC", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2013/12/24/santa-shot-by-pellet-gun-in-se-dc-n1768248", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2013/12/24/0.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Santa Shot By Pellet Gun in SE DC, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1717\"", "article_summary": "The last place someone should expect to get shot by a pellet gun would be during a charity giveaway.\nIn a bit of odd news this Christmas Eve, Santa Claus was shot in the back by a pellet gun in Southeast DC during a charity toy giveaway.\n@DCPoliceDept officers on scene believe pellet gun shots came from a 2nd story window.\nNo suspect in pellet shooting of Santa.\nSanta is OK \u2014 Kris Van Cleave (@ABC7Kris) December 24, 2013This is just really sad."}
