He has been busy, seeing 8-10 patients per day in an office at the health department.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of infections, a lot of people in pain who otherwise could not afford treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have been extremely thankful. Tooth pain is very debilitating, Some were ending up in the emergency room at the hospital.\u201d\n\n\n\nTeeth are being saved, thanks to the expanded services, versus having to be pulled, he said.\n\n\n\nAdult patient Savanna Alexander was relieved for the program.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey took great care of me. Now I can eat again,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nThe dental clinic has upgraded its equipment with a $81,000 grant from Colorado Cares. Additional funding from the Colorado Health Foundation allowed them to increase the days there is a dentist in the office.\n\n\n\nThe county dentist office also sees 1,300 children covered by Medicaid per year.\n\n\n\nHealth director Bobbi Lock said low-income residents who do not qualify for Medicaid can also get dental care at the clinic.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe work out a sliding scale price, and they pay in monthly installments,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of times they qualify for Medicaid and don\u2019t realize it.\u201d\n\n\n\nDental hygienists visit local schools twice per year to provide dental services. An additional hygienist was hired to handle the increase in patient services.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty upscale dentist office with an experienced doctor,\u201d Lock said.\n\n\n\nThe expanded Medicaid services for adult dental care is a result of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. It is expected to bring dental coverage to 17.7 million low-income adults by 2018.\n\n\n\nFor more information or to set up a dental appointment, call (970) 564-4764 or (970) 564-4774.\n\n\n\njmimiaga@cortezjournal.com\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Cortez Colorado, Southwest, News, Sports, Business, Education, Classifieds", "og": {"url": "http://www.the-journal.com/article/20150907/NEWS01/150909902/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.the-journal.com/storyimage/CJ/20150907/NEWS01/150909902/AR/0/AR-150909902.jpg?maxw=1000&imageversion=16by9", "site_name": "The Journal", "title": "County dentist serves 290 in 2015"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146444755444595}, "description": "Find breaking news, multimedia, reviews & opinion on Cortez Colorado, business, sports, movies, travel, books, jobs, education, real estate, cars & more."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde352\"", "article_summary": "Since Medicaid expanded to include adult dental services, 290 adults have received care this year at the Montezuma County Health Department.\nThe expanded Medicaid services for adult dental care is a result of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\nThe county dentist office also sees 1,300 children covered by Medicaid per year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty upscale dentist office with an experienced doctor,\u201d Lock said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re anticipating more patients.\u201dDr. Joe Baumgart provides affordable dental care for children and adult patients three times per week, from basic care to root canals and crowns."}
