He is charged with security fraud, security fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy.\n\n\"These charges are a securities and wire fraud trifecta,\" said Michael Harpster, the FBI's special agent in charge of the Criminal Division.\n\n[Also: Senate committee targets Martin Shkreli, big pharma, over sky-high drug prices]\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has also filed a civil lawsuit against Shkreli, according to Andrew Ceresney, director of Enforcement.\n\nShkreli pleaded not guity through his attorney and was released on a $5 million bond, according to published reports.\n\nAlso indicted Thursday was Attorney Evan Greebles, 42, a New York City-based lawyer, who is charged with wire fraud conspiracy.\n\nBoth men used funds from the company Shkreli founded in 2011, Retrophin, to pay investors of two former hedge funds he managed, and masked the money as consultant fees for work that was never performed, according to authorities.\n\nInvestors are out $11 million, Harpster said.\n\n[Also: Daraprim competitor to market $1 pill after Turing chief Martin Shkreli hikes price]\n\nShkreli lied and continued to lie, Capers said.\n\nWhile running the hedge funds MSMB Capital Management, Shkreli took $3 million from investors and lost the money through a series of bad trades, Capers said.\n\n\"He didn't tell his investors he lost their money,\" Capers said.\n\nInstead he founded the MSMB Healthcare Management hedge fund to hide the prior performance, according to Capers.\n\n\"Through those lies he was able to get $5 million from 13 additional investors and lied to them, telling them their investments were performing well,\" he said.\n\n[Also: Turing Pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli defends $750 for Daraprim pill ]\n\nIn a Ponzi-like scheme Shkreli used money from MSMB Healthcare to pay off bad debts from MSMB Capital, according to Capers. He also used the money to found the biotech firm Retrophin in 2011.\n\n\"So he lied to them, he lied to the investors,\" Capers said. \"He lied to them about what he was actually doing with the money.\"\n\nWhen he took Retrophin public a year later, the company did well, Capers said. It was then Shkreli either had to come clean or somehow pay the investors.\n\n\"As he did in the past, he made the wrong choice,\" Capers said. \"He lied, and used Greeble to deceive Retrophin.\"\n\nShkreki used company assets to pay off personal debts, he said.\n\nShkreli was Retrophin's president and CEO until September 30, 2014, when he was ousted. Shkreli currently is CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, a privately-held company he founded after he left Retrophin.\n\nAs chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals he gained infamy and spurred a Congressional investigation into the rising price of prescription drugs, after jacking up the price of the AIDS drug Daraprim from $13.50 a pill to $750.\n\nShkreli stood by the move as necessary to shore up more money for drug research. He later dropped the price for hospitals only.\n\nWhile today's arrest is unrelated to the price hike for Daraprim, the New York Times reported in October that the New York Attorney General is examining whether Turing violated anti-trust laws by restricting distribution of Daraprim in a move to curb competition.\n\nShkreli is also majority owner in the pharmaceutical company KaloBios. He bought the company's outstanding stock as it was about to fold and kept the company in operation. Shares of KaloBios soared more than 600 percent in premarket trade in November.\n\nAfter news broke of Shkreli's arrest, shares were down by 50 percent before being halted indefinitely, pending receipt of additional information requested by the Nasdaq, according to MarketWatch.\n\nThe long term implications for the company are unknown.\n\nFor Shkreli, MarketWatch reports he is losing more than $25 million on stock in KaloBios.\n\nShkreli's online persona hasn't helped him win public favor, either. Often taking to Twitter, the \"pharma bro\" regularly picked fights with anyone who criticised his business practices. He also recently made headlines when it was announced he was the sole owner of a rap album by Wu-Tang Clan. The group only made one copy, which Shkreli bought for $2 million.\n\nThat persona led to an outpouring of scorn on Twitter in Thursday, with many claiming karma had come back to haunt Shkreli.\n\nHere are some of those Tweets:\n\nShkreli\n\nAnd here is the indictment:\n\nSusan Morse contributed to this report.\n\nTwitter: @HenryPowderly", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/martin-shkreli-arrested-securities-fraud-allegedly-played-shell-game-investors-money", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/martin-shkreli-hfn-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Martin Shkreli, the Turing Pharmaceutical CEO reviled by many for hike 5,000 percent price hike of AIDS drug Daraprim, was arrested Thursday on securities fraud, according to several published reports.", "title": "Martin Shkreli arrested for securities fraud, allegedly played shell game with investors' money"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/martin-shkreli-hfn-feature.jpg"}, "title": "Martin Shkreli arrested for securities fraud, allegedly played shell game with investors' money", "description": "Martin Shkreli, the Turing Pharmaceutical CEO reviled by many for hike 5,000 percent price hike of AIDS drug Daraprim, was arrested Thursday on securities fraud, according to several published reports.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Martin Shkreli, the reviled CEO who increased the price of an AIDS drug by 5,000 percent, ran his former hedge fund companies like a Ponzi scheme, said Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capers Thursday in announcing a seven-count indictment against the Turing Pharmaceutical founder.&#13; The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Shkreli, 32, at his Manhattan home Thursday morning.
