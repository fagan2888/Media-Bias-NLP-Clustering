According to an on line article titled \u2013 appropriately enough \u2013 \u201cTake Our Country Back,\u201d a disgruntled American named Chris Cassone was watching Glenn Beck on TV when he was inspired to pick up his guitar and compose a song. And that\u2019s how Cassone\u2019s song, \u201cTake Our Country Back,\u201d was born. Readers are left wondering how many other composers have been similarly inspired by Glenn Beck.\n\n\u201cLittle did he know how far that song would take him,\u201d the article rhapsodizes. Cassone debuted \u201cTake Our Country Back\u201d at a Tea Party rally on March 21, 2009. The lyrics warn listeners that our nation is \u201cunder attack\u201d (by whom?) and admonishes all concerned parties to \u201cdraw a line in the sand so they (who, specifically?) all understand.\u201d The demand that our nation be taken back became both a rallying cry` as well as a demand among Tea Party activists. Outraged by Obamacare, Michele Bachmann proclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s why I am so absolutely confident in 2012\u201d that \u201cAmericans have made the decision that we\u2019re going to take our country back.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly assured audiences on the campaign trail that he will take our country back. The Donald believes the United States needs to be taken back from immigrants, particularly those who aren\u2019t Christians. The Republican Tea Party obsession with our nation being overrun with \u201cforeigners\u201d is nothing new. Native-born American bigots founded the Know-Nothing movement in the 1840s because they were horrified by the waves of immigrants entering the United States. These immigrants weren\u2019t the Latin-Americans and Muslims so reviled by Trump, however. They were German and Irish Catholics. Members of the Know Nothing movement were convinced that these Catholics would never make good Americans and were entering the United States for the sole purpose of undermining our republic. Simply substitute \u201cRepublican Tea Party\u201d for Know Nothing movement and \u201cMuslims\u201d for Catholics and one has Trump and his xenophobic supporters.\n\nDoes the Republican Tea Party want to take our country back to an era when women lacked reproductive freedom of choice? The PoliticusUSA column \u201cProof of the GOP War on Women,\u201d states \u201cRepublican legislators have introduced a wide array of laws designed to either outlaw abortion outright or to discourage it by making ridiculous and sometimes humiliating requirements of women who might consider having a pregnancy terminated.\u201d Should unmarried women even have access to birth control? Some Republican Tea Party members think not. Perhaps these zealots yearn to take us back to a time when shelters for abused women didn\u2019t exist and wives were expected to remain in abusive relationships, even at the risk of their lives.\n\nDoes the Republican Tea Party want to take our country back to an era when unions were weak and workers had few rights? If that\u2019s the case, then we can conclude these extremists are succeeding magnificently. West Virginia\u2019s GOP-dominated legislature just overrode the Democratic governor\u2019s veto of a right to work bill. Over half of our states have now enacted this anti-union measure. Never mind that numerous studies have shown that the decline of unions parallels the decline of the American middle class. We mustn\u2019t inconvenience corporate CEO\u2019s, a/k/a \u201cjob creators,\u201d by empowering their workers through unionization.\n\nWe can safely conclude that the mysterious \u201cthey\u201d who are supposedly menacing our country are immigrants, non-Christians, uppity women who don\u2019t know their place and working people who have the audacity to stand up to their employers. Civil rights supporters are also seen as a threat. Indeed, the web site of Tea Party Crusaders has an entire archive category titled \u201cRace-Baiters.\u201d This columnist thinks that the Republican Tea Party\u2019s promise to take our country back can more accurately be construed as a threat to drag our country down.\n\nJohn J.
