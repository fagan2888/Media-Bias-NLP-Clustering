The company said it could get patients more engaged by \u201cautomating\u201d physician empathy.\n\nIt \u201calmost made me nauseous,\u201d she said. How can you automate something as deeply personal as empathy?\n\nBut Waller needed help. Her physicians, who perform as many as 500 surgeries a year, manage large numbers of patients at various stages of treatment and recovery. They needed a better way to communicate with patients and track their progress.\n\nThe California startup, HealthLoop, told Waller its messaging technology would improve their satisfaction and help keep them out of the hospital. High satisfaction scores and low readmission rates mean higher reimbursements from Medicare, so Waller was intrigued.\n\nSo far, she\u2019s been surprised at patients\u2019 enthusiasm for the personalized \u2014 but automated \u2014 daily emails they receive from their doctor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a limited number of resources in health care. If you do 500 joint replacements in a year, how do you follow up all of those patients every day?\u201d Waller said. The technology \u201callows you to direct your energy to people who need the handholding.\u201d\n\n\u201cAutomating empathy\u201d is a new healthcare buzzword for helping doctors stay in touch with patients before and after medical procedures \u2014 cheaply and with minimal effort from already overextended physicians.\n\nIt may sound like an oxymoron, but it\u2019s a powerful draw for hospitals and other health care providers scrambling to adjust to sweeping changes in how they\u2019re paid for the care they provide. Whether the emails actually trigger an empathetic connection or not, the idea of tailoring regular electronic communications to patients counts as an innovation in health care with potential to save money and improve quality.\n\nStartups like HealthLoop are promising that their technologies will help patients stick to their treatment and recovery regimens, avoid a repeat hospital stay, and be more satisfied with their care. Similar companies in the \u201cpatient engagement\u201d industry include Wellframe, Curaspan, and Infield Health.\n\nHealthLoop\u2019s technology is being tested at reputable medical centers including the Cleveland Clinic, Kaiser Permanente-Southern California, the University of California, San Francisco, and the Newport Orthopedic Institute in Orange County, company officials said.\n\nDoctors can send daily emails with information timed to milestones in surgery prep and recovery and ask patients or caregivers for feedback on specific issues patients may face during recovery.\n\nThe doctors may write their own email scripts, as Newport Orthopedics\u2019 physicians did, or use the company\u2019s suggested content. An online dashboard helps doctors and administrators keep track of which patients are doing well and who might need more follow-up care. Patients can also communicate with office staff about medications and office visits. Their responses to daily emails can trigger a call from the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nA patient might see this message: \u201cHow are you? Let me know so I can make sure you\u2019re okay. I have four questions for you today.\u201d\n\nSuch a call may have been a lifesaver for David Larson, a Huntington Beach retiree. After Larson responded \u201cyes\u201d to an email that asked if he had calf pain after knee surgery, he got a call from his doctor\u2019s office telling him to come in immediately. An ultrasound confirmed he had a blood clot that could have landed him back in the hospital \u2014 or threatened his life. With treatment, the blood clot dissolved and he resumed recovery.\n\n\u201cThere were times when it was like, \u2018Oh brother, they\u2019re contacting me again,\u2019 but none of this would have been caught if it wasn\u2019t for the email,\u201d said Larson, 66. \u201cSo it was more than worth it to me. Now I\u2019m back to walking the dog, surfing, riding a bike.\u201d\n\nHow to keep patients like Larson from hospital readmission because of avoidable complications after a hospital stay has long been one of health care\u2019s most vexing and expensive challenges.\n\nAlmost one of every five Medicare patients discharged from a hospital \u2014 approximately 2.6 million seniors \u2014 must be readmitted within 30 days, at an annual cost of more than $26 billion, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nFor decades, hospitals had no financial incentive to keep patients out of the hospital after they were discharged. But under the Affordable Care Act, financial penalties were established for hospitals with readmission rates higher than the national average for certain conditions.\n\nAlso under the ACA, hospitals are financially rewarded for high scores on patient satisfaction scores and good performance on other quality measures set by CMS.\n\nDoctors\u2019 groups increasingly are affected financially by this sea change, either because they are part-owners in a hospital, as Newport Orthopedics is with Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, or because they participate in other risk-sharing financial partnerships with hospitals.\n\nWith that kind of money at stake, hospitals and other health care providers may be willing to pay for programs like HealthLoop, if the tryouts prove successful. And you could see your own relationship with your physician change as a result, whether you\u2019re on Medicare or not: HealthLoop is aimed at all patients, whatever the payment source.\n\nSome experts worry that health care providers will come to rely too heavily on electronic communication as a cheap substitute for the hard work of improving the doctor-patient relationship and the quality of care that patients get.\n\n\u201cAutomating personalized messages isn\u2019t a terrible thing; we all get some of that in our everyday lives,\u201d said Michael Millenson, a health industry consultant. \u201cThe real question is whether this kind of automated messaging is in conjunction with a cultural change in how doctors think about their patients or not.\u201d\n\nHealth care providers have long experimented with ways to prevent complications that can land a patient back in the hospital, with varying success, said Kristin Carman, vice president of health policy research at the American Institutes for Research. Robo-calls reminding you to take your medicine, for example, don\u2019t seem to be very effective. And the new technologies don\u2019t always address demographic, cultural and language barriers that can prevent patients from communicating with their doctors. For now, HealthLoop is only available in English.\n\nDr. Jordan Shlain, a San Francisco internist, said he founded HealthLoop because he wanted a simple way to keep track of his patients\u2019 progress after a hospital visit or procedure.\n\n\u201cEvery human has the same kind of trajectory of concerns and anxieties with regard to medical situations,\u201d Shlain said.\n\nHealthLoop, based in Mountain View, offers \u201ca digital extension of the doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know your doctor can\u2019t email you every day; you know your doctor usually will not call you. Now you\u2019re in a world where your doctor says I\u2019d like to use this system to stay in touch with you and guide you through your recovery.\u201d\n\nDr. Thomas Vail, professor and chairman of the department of orthopedic surgery at the University of California-San Francisco would agree \u2014 up to a point.\n\nWith his UCSF colleagues, Vail is testing HealthLoop\u2019s system with his patients, and the university will be evaluating whether patients who use it have fewer adverse events than their peers.\n\nUCSF helped create some of the language for the automated emails and has a financial relationship with the company, said Dr. Aenor Sawyer, who directs UCSF\u2019s Skeletal Health Service and is a leader at the university\u2019s Center for Digital Health Innovation.\n\nWhile Vail thinks HealthLoop is potentially promising, he\u2019s cautious about its role in his practice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it substitutes for face-to-face communication,\u201d Vail said, \u201cbut it does help us collectively to not overlook something that might be important.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.
