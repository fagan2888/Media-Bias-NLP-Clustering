The position also requires a certain amount of flexibility to attend daytime committee meetings.\n\nOn Tuesday, the City Council will discuss three possible variations on a council compensation package.\n\nOne would raise the per-meeting compensation to $425 per meeting, making the maximum compensation $22,100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne would establish a base salary of $10,000 a year and keep the per meeting compensation the same, accomplishing a similar result but reflecting the work council members do outside of meetings.\n\nThe last would establish a council salary based on a percentage of area median income.\n\nThis proposal came from Councilman Macon Cowles, who said that if council really wanted to attract a greater diversity of candidates, the job needed to pay enough to support a family in Boulder at a modest level. If council members earned 75 percent of the area median income for a family of three, they would earn $67,125. If they earned 50 percent, they would earn $44,750.\n\nThe other proposed increases would put council members at 25 percent of area median income.\n\nAt a discussion earlier this year of possible ballot measures, other council members balked at the area median income proposal.\n\nCouncilman Sam Weaver said it would make the council a full-time, professional job and lead to council members micro-managing city staff.\n\n\"I don't want the pay to be too high because I still like the model of citizen-legislators, and I think Boulder is of a size where we can still do that,\" he said.\n\nWeaver said he likes the idea of a base salary coupled with per-meeting pay.\n\n\"It acknowledges that we are working harder than we are being paid for, but it doesn't make it a stand-alone job,\" he said.\n\nCouncilwoman Lisa Morzel said she strongly believes council should be a volunteer job, but she also likes the idea of a base salary.\n\n\"I can understand getting compensated a little bit more,\" she said. \"I'm in my 16th year, and I do not know when I've worked so hard and so long. Some people are giving up their annual leave to do this, and they should be compensated.\"\n\nMorzel said she would also like to see council members have part-time staff to help deal with the high volume of emails and other administrative aspects of the job.\n\nThe snort-laugh that Jan Lund emits when asked about a council pay raise reflects the challenge that council members will face in convincing voters.\n\n\"They're all rich anyway,\" he said. \"They don't need the money.\"\n\nPast attempts to increase council compensation have failed.\n\nIn 2007, Boulder voters narrowly rejected a ballot issue that would have raised council members' pay from $170 a meeting to $500 with a $1,000-a-month ceiling. It was defeated by just 49 votes out of nearly 16,300 cast.\n\nIn 2008, a measure that created a monthly salary of $1,000, provided a council member attended at least one meeting, was defeated by a wider margin, with 56.7 percent of voters opposing it.\n\nBut in 2012, voters approved a measure that expanded the number of meetings for which council members could be paid each year from 48 to 52. The City Council meets nearly every week of the year, and the council has been adding more special meetings because of the large number of items on their agenda.\n\nSome council members hope that recent history and a changing electorate mean voters will look more favorably on a pay increase.\n\nKathleen Finlinson, a graduate student, said she would consider it, though she would want to understand better what is involved in the job.\n\n\"It seems cool that you wouldn't have to be super rich to do it,\" she said. \"In principle, it sounds like a good idea.\"\n\nErica Meltzer: 303-473-1355, meltzere@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/meltzere", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28307178/boulder-city-council-may-ask-voters-pay-increase", "sailthru.author": "By Erica Meltzer \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28307178:view"}, "startDate": "2015-06-14T09:30:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Citing the long hours and lack of diversity on the Boulder City Council, council members  may ask voters to authorize a pay increase this November.", "title": "Boulder City Council may ask voters for pay increase", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28307178/boulder-city-council-may-ask-voters-pay-increase", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-06-14T23:36:12-0600", "endDate": "2025-06-13T11:53:26-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Erica MeltzerStaff", "pubDate": "2015-06-13T15:10:37-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-14T09:30:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder City Council may ask voters for pay increase", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "description": "Citing the long hours and lack of diversity on the Boulder City Council, council members  may ask voters to authorize a pay increase this November.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28307178/boulder-city-council-may-ask-voters-pay-increase", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Citing the long hours and lack of diversity on the Boulder City Council, council members  may ask voters to authorize a pay increase this November.", "title": "Boulder City Council may ask voters for pay increase"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "Council members considering several ballot measures, one of which would set $10K annual base salaryRelated Stories Boulder City Council pay raise proposals move forwardIf you go What: Boulder City Council When: 6 p.m. Tuesday Where: Boulder Municipal Building, 1777 Broadway Info: To see the complete memo on council compensation and the rest of the agenda, go to bit.ly/1BchzCICiting the long hours and lack of diversity on the Boulder City Council, council members may ask voters to authorize a pay increase this November.\nOn Tuesday, the City Council will discuss three possible variations on a council compensation package.\nThe snort-laugh that Jan Lund emits when asked about a council pay raise reflects the challenge that council members will face in convincing voters.\nCouncilman Sam Weaver said it would make the council a full-time, professional job and lead to council members micro-managing city staff.\nSome council members hope that recent history and a changing electorate mean voters will look more favorably on a pay increase."}
