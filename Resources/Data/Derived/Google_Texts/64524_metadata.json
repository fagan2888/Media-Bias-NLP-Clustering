Bill Nelson Bill NelsonSenators to House: FAA reauthorization would enhance airport security Dems discuss dropping Wasserman Schultz Grassley worried about FCC box proposal MORE (D-Fla.) and Clare McCaskill (D-Mo.) raised concerns about officials\u2019 reported ability to easily track users\u2019 location without their knowledge or consent \u2014 a feature known as \u201cGod View\u201d at Uber.\n\n\u201cThese reports are disturbing because geolocation data can be used to create intimate profiles of customers, such as where they live, work and socialize,\u201d the senators wrote in a just-released letter to Uber head Travis Kalanick. A similar letter was sent to Lyft CEO Logan Green.\n\nNelson is slated to be the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee next year, and McCaskill is the current chairwoman of the consumer protection subcommittee.\n\nIn their letters, the senators demanded copies of the companies\u2019 documents detailing their data security and privacy protection plans as well as a briefing from top officials about the practices.\n\nThey also pointedly raised the specter of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is required to police unfair and deceptive business practices and is under the jurisdiction of the Commerce panel. The FTC never discloses when it is investigating a company, though many watchers have speculated that it could be looking into Uber and Lyft.\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s cases have cut a wide swath across industries, including social networking sites, mobile handset manufacturers, application developers, rental car companies, retail and drug stores, check cashing companies, and hotel chains,\u201d the senators noted, without directly threatening the companies.\n\nThe companies have been under a microscope in Washington and recently were the target of an inquiry from Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who has been a vocal advocate of new privacy protections for information about people\u2019s locations. Last week, Franken said that he was unsatisfied with Uber\u2019s response to a letter that he sent the company.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The ride companies are facing new criticism from senators.", "description": "The ride companies are facing new criticism from senators.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The ride companies are facing new criticism from senators.", "title": "More trouble for Uber, Lyft on Capitol Hill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/227986-more-trouble-for-uber-lyft", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-23T15:44:25-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-12-23T15:44-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/227986-more-trouble-for-uber-lyft", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-23T15:20-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Uber, Lyft, Federal Trade Commission,Claire McCaskill, Bill Nelson,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-23T15:20:44-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-23T15:44:25-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/227986-more-trouble-for-uber-lyft", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The ride companies are facing new criticism from senators.", "card": "summary", "title": "More trouble for Uber, Lyft on Capitol Hill"}, "dcterms.title": "More trouble for Uber, Lyft on Capitol Hill"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceadb\"", "article_summary": "Uber and Lyft are coming under new criticism from Capitol Hill.\nThe FTC never discloses when it is investigating a company, though many watchers have speculated that it could be looking into Uber and Lyft.\nLast week, Franken said that he was unsatisfied with Uber\u2019s response to a letter that he sent the company.\nraised concerns about officials\u2019 reported ability to easily track users\u2019 location without their knowledge or consent \u2014 a feature known as \u201cGod View\u201d at Uber.\nA similar letter was sent to Lyft CEO Logan Green."}
