Obama bowed to political pressure from his fellow Democrats on Thursday and announced a plan to let insurers renew for one year the health plans for Americans whose policies would be otherwise canceled due to Obamacare. REUTERS/Larry Downing (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS HEALTH TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY) - RTX15DNW\n\n4013361\n\nThe administration says 365,000 people selected commercial health care plans from state and local Obamacare websites by the end of November.\n\nDemocrats cheered the new numbers, which were announced Wednesday, partly because many progressives worry that the Obamacare tax-and-healthcare program may crash and burn their chances in the 2014 election. Since October, Obama\u2019s plunging poll numbers have almost wrecked progressive hopes of big wins in 2014.\n\nThe new claim doesn\u2019t say how many people have pushed their way past faulty and missing software, to actually sign contracts with the insurance companies for the expensive and restricted plans permitted by the Obamacare network.\n\nAlso, before October, officials had expected 1.2 million people to sign up by the end of November, 3 million by the end of December, and seven million by the end of March, 2014.\n\nThe number of plan-selections is also far below the number of plans that have been cancelled by President Barack Obama\u2019s ambitious effort to recreate the nation\u2019s healthcare system. At least 4 million plans have been cancelled so far, and millions more cancellations are expected during the next 12 months.\n\nThe report does not describe how many of the applicants are young and healthy. That\u2019s a critical number, because if too few young and healthy people are paying into the system, then prices for the many older and sicker people will rise drastically in 2015.\n\nThe report suggested that many additional people are pushing their way through the site to buy commercial plans. For example, the reports says that 2,307,283 people have been confirmed eligible to enroll in a plan. Of those, 944,531 are eligible for taxpayer subsidies, and 1,942,601 have not chosen a plan.\n\nAnother 803,077 have been approved for entry into the Medicaid program.\n\nThe report claims that 39 million people visited the state and local Obamacare website.\n\nThe largest number of plan selections have taken place in California, which is home to many of the nation\u2019s poorest and least-skilled people.\n\n107,087 state residents have picked plans, giving the state almost 30 percent of the total sign-ups.\n\nOn the federal Obamacare website, 45,513 plans were picked by New York residents, 17,908 by Florida residents, and 14,038 by people in Texas.\n\nThe report does not use the tainted \u201cObamacare\u201d term, but sticks to the less-damaged term, \u201cHealth Insurance Marketplace.\u201d\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "The sunny report, however, shows signs-ups are far below the goal of 800,000", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The administration says 365,000 people selected commercial health care plans from state and local Obamacare websites by the end of November.
