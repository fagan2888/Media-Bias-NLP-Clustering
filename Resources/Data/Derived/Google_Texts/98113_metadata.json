Acute care hospital operators are reimbursed based on a prospective payment system, or PPS, developed by CMS.\n\nCurrently, the system is based on a per diagnosis type of fee-for-service method. Hospitals are reimbursed based on the quantity and complexity of the services they provide.\n\nIn 3Q14, Universal Health Services\u2019 (UHS) bed occupancy rate\u2014a proxy for the quantity of services provided\u2014for acute care services was one of the highest among its peers at 56%. It was followed by HCA Holdings (HCA) at 54.1%, Tenet Healthcare (THC) at 48.4%, and Community Health Systems (CYH) at 41.9%.\n\nIn the same time period, HCA Holdings and Universal Health Services earned EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) margins of 19.3% and 16%. This was greater than Community Health Systems\u2019 and Tenet Healthcare\u2019s margins. They were 13% and 9.7%, respectively.\n\nThe occupancy rate and EBITDA margins aren\u2019t directly related. Differences in the case mix index or complexity of services provided also affects revenues. A fee-for-service model benefited companies with a higher occupancy rate.\n\nIn case of behavioral health services, CMS uses a per diem type of fee-for-service payment method. Hospitals are reimbursed based on the length of a patient\u2019s stay\u2014adjusted for the complexity of services used. Historically, payers like Medicaid and commercial insurers have been exerting pressure on behavioral health patients to reduce their stays.\n\nAs a result, Universal Health Services\u2019 behavioral health segment witnessed an average length of stay restricted between the range of 12.5 days to 13 days. This led to slow growth in the segment\u2019s revenues.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "cXenseParse": {"mre-primary-ticker": "xlv", "mre-content-type": "Post-Release Earnings Reports", "mre-author": "Manali Pradhan", "mre-industry": "Hospitals", "mre-value-driver": "Earnings Overview", "mre-page-type": "post", "mre-section": "Sector Analysis", "mre-sector": "Healthcare", "mre-secondary-ticker": "cyh"}, "description": "In case of behavioral health services, CMS uses a per diem type of fee-for-service payment method.
