With a $35,000 starting price - less than half Tesla's Model X - the vehicle is critical to the Silicon Valley automaker's growth plans.\n\nThe order is a feather in LG Display's cap as it seeks to expand further into auto electronics which offer higher margins and more stable earnings prospects than consumer products.\n\nThe Model 3 prototype features a huge, tablet-like information screen on the center console, reflecting the trend towards bigger in-car displays that offer more features.\n\n\"LG Display is a sole supplier for the 15-plus inch center display of Model 3,\" said the source, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak on the matter.\n\nAnother company currently provides center information displays for Tesla's Model S and Model X, he added.\n\nAn LG Display spokeswoman declined to comment. A Tesla spokeswoman did not have immediate comment.\n\n($1 = 1,150.1100 won)\n\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Se Young Lee; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) - LG Display will supply information displays for Tesla Motors' new Mo", "title": "LG Display to supply car displays for Tesla Model 3: source", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/01/LG-Display-supply-car-displays-Tesla-Model-3-source", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/tesla-model3_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/01/LG-Display-supply-car-displays-Tesla-Model-3-source", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/tesla-model3_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) - LG Display will supply information displays for Tesla Motors' new Mo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Another company currently provides center information displays for Tesla's Model S and Model X, he added.\nWith a $35,000 starting price - less than half Tesla's Model X - the vehicle is critical to the Silicon Valley automaker's growth plans.\n\"LG Display is a sole supplier for the 15-plus inch center display of Model 3,\" said the source, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak on the matter.\nAn LG Display spokeswoman declined to comment.\nSEOUL (Reuters) - LG Display will supply information displays for Tesla Motors' new Model 3 sedans, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, grabbing a key contract for center consoles from another supplier."}
