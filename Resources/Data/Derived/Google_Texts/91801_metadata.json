Jared Keener, CC BY-ND 2.0\n\nSeptember is national suicide prevention month, with Sept. 10 specifically devoted to raising suicide awareness around the world. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were more than 41,000 suicides in the United States in 2013 \u2014 an average of 113 each day. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) finds over 800,000 people die from suicide, with millions more people affected by suicide bereavement. After cancer and heart disease, suicide takes more lives than any other cause of death.\n\nBetween the years 1988 and 2000, toward the end of which the Surgeon General published a call to action to prevent suicide, the suicide rate seemed to drop; the rate of deaths per 100,000 people went from 12.5 to 10.4. But the rate rose again after that to where, as of 2013, it stands at 12.6. This rate is four times higher among men than women, though women are three times more likely to attempt suicide than men.\n\nIt\u2019s true that as many as 90 percent of suicides are a result of untreated mental health problems, which is largely a result of persistent stigma, but people have thoughts of and attempt suicide without any type of mental illness; a stressful job, relationship, social standing, or even chronic pain can all have harmful psychological effects.\n\n\u2018Shut up and listen\u2019\n\nAlan Ross is the executive director of The Samaritans of New York, the only community-based organization in New York City solely devoted to suicide prevention, according to its website. Samaritans NYC is also part of the world\u2019s oldest and largest suicide prevention network, with over 400 centers in 42 countries. But before Ross was director, he was a volunteer for Samaritans' crisis hotline.\n\n\u201cI replied to an ad in the Village Voice 30 years ago that said \u2018good listeners needed,\u2019 and after five or six years, I found my volunteer work was more rewarding than my actual work [as a freelance writer and consultant],\u201d Ross told Medical Daily. \u201cWhen you are answering calls on a suicide hotline, you never wonder if what you\u2019re doing is worthwhile.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Ross has noticed the national conversation surrounding suicide slightly improve \u2014 suicide is officially on the public health agenda and has received more awareness and funding for new preventive programs. But at the same time, he added, people are still committing suicide at alarming rates, especially young girls and women for reasons experts still don't understand. Suicide research is technically a \u201cyoung field,\u201d so a lot of the challenges and issues attached to the rising rate are \u201cdeeply engrained.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say they\u2019re impossible to overcome. Samaritans has received 1.3 million calls to date, averaging 80, 000 calls each year, giving its volunteers just as many chances to have a dialogue with whoever is on the other end of the line. Timing, as it is with most things, is everything: Samaritans cited research that suggests the majority of people thinking of suicide act within an hour.\n\n\u201cEffective crisis communication is a dialogue [not unlike] a journalistic interview,\u201d Ross explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t let the source go anywhere they want. You have to guide the conversation, with the focus being on the caller, on what they\u2019re thinking and feeling. It\u2019s not a chat line, a dating service, not sports talk \u2014 there\u2019s a reason for the service, and if done properly, it can lead to some alleviation. To some cathartic result.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, Ross told Oprah magazine \u201cthe best listeners allow the other person to open up,\u201d which is something he still believes. But allowing the other person to open up doesn\u2019t necessarily mean volunteers (or you) have to be silent. Asking open-ended questions, like \u201cHow are you dealing with this?\u201d instead of yes or no questions such as, \u201cDo you really think you should let things go on this way?\u201d prevents the other person from feeling judged.\n\nThe latter is a huge component of Ross\u2019 intensive training program at Samaritans' Manhattan center. He said that he teaches volunteers that focusing on what a caller is thinking and feeling is important, because it makes the call about them and what they are going through and not the other way around, which builds rapport.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re answering a hotline in NYC,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with everything from someone having a bad day, a broken heart, emotional problems, mental illness, trauma, substance abuse, victim issues, neglect, and abandonment. You\u2019ve got to learn to shut up and listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you tell the callers what they should do or what to think, or try to give them hope based on your life experience, then it's pretty superficial and about you,\" Ross continued. \"These are complex people with complex issues \u2014 where\u2019s the respect? Where\u2019s the acknowledgement?\u201d\n\n\u2018Help someone get through a moment\u2019\n\nKnowing you have to really listen is one thing, but getting to the right space to do exactly that can be very hard. Ross said several volunteers drop out of the training program after just a few days; Ross said he almost dropped out of the program, and he was previously a communications consultant.\n\n\u201cAfter my second training class, I didn\u2019t know if I could do it,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou have to throw away your own personal thoughts. It\u2019s enjoyable that way because you get to see how your mind works, but most people don\u2019t realize how judgmental they are or how focused they are on problem solving. Depression, emotional upset, and tragic loss are not problems you can solve.\u201d\n\nPut another way: everyone thinks they\u2019re a good singer until you put a microphone in front of them in front of a live audience. \"I'll be honest, 95 percent of the people who come to the hotline aren\u2019t good listeners, which is true for most of the general population,\" Ross said. \u201cI\u2019m over 60. I don\u2019t apologize for making this statement anymore.\u201d\n\nAgain, these challenges can be overcome... if you plan for them. Whether you\u2019re a family member, friend, or health professional, it\u2019s helpful, if not necessary to read up on the best approaches to take in a crisis situation. These approaches will vary depending on the crisis, but generally speaking, Samaritans recommends the seven following steps (which you can read more deeply, here):\n\nHow to respond to someone who is depressed or in crisis. Screen shot via Samaritans of NYC\n\n\u201cPeople are not mysteries to be unraveled,\u201d Ross said. \u201c[That thought process] can create stigma. If people try to help by sharing their attitudes based on their own values and needs, it can have a reverse effect. If they just say, 'Oh, you need help,' you just made yourself powerful and them weak.\u201d\n\nRoss said his volunteers (and again, you) have to learn and remind themselves they're not saving someone\u2019s life \u2014 they're helping him or her get through a moment. It's about the communication process, not the outcome.\n\n\"Learn you\u2019re not in control.\u201d Ross concluded. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in control to help.\"\n\nFor more on what to say to someone who you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, a podcast from the Samaritans of NYC is below.
