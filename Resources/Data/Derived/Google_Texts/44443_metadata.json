But more importantly, it\u2019s because if one of them becomes president, the tax reform that results will reflect not so much his specific ideas as the party\u2019s consensus on what should be done about taxes.\n\nSo to simplify things, here\u2019s what you can expect if a Republican is elected president in November:\n\nIncome tax rates will be cut Investment tax rates will be cut The inheritance tax will be eliminated Corporate income tax rates will be cut Corporations will be given some kind of tax holiday to \u201crepatriate\u201d money they\u2019re holding overseas\n\nAnd that\u2019s basically it. Yes, there will be hundreds of provisions, many of which could be consequential, but those are the important things, and the things almost all Republicans agree on.\n\nLet\u2019s keep in mind that this is the policy area Republicans care more about than any other. There are pockets of conservatives for whom the details of defense policy are important, and others who care a lot about education, and even a few who care a lot about health care. But all of them want to cut taxes. They may get passionate talking about how much they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or how tough they\u2019ll be on border security, or how they\u2019ll totally destroy the Islamic State. But if a Republican is elected in 2016, it is a stone-cold guarantee that changes to the tax code will be at the top of the to-do list for 2017.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that the tax reform we get will be exactly what that president promised during the campaign. For instance, Ted Cruz is proposing what\u2019s essentially a Value Added Tax (VAT). But he won\u2019t get that passed even with a Republican Congress, because it\u2019s controversial within the party.\n\nThat\u2019s critical to understand. It isn\u2019t as though congressional Republicans, who have been waiting to do this for years, will just take the new president\u2019s plan and hold a vote on it. Instead, they\u2019re going to hammer out a complex bill that reflects their common priorities. It will be a product of the party\u2019s consensus on what should be done about taxes, a consensus that has been forming since the last time they cut taxes, during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nYou can make an analogy with the ACA. By the time 2008 came around, Democrats had arrived on a basic agreement on what health care reform would look like. That isn\u2019t to say there was no disagreement within the party. But the outlines had been agreed to by the most powerful people and the wonks within the party: expand Medicaid for those at the bottom, create exchanges for people to buy private insurance, offer subsidies to those in the middle. That\u2019s why the plans offered by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Edwards in that election all followed that outline, and that\u2019s what the Democratic Congress eventually produced.\n\nThe things that I listed above are the essential tax consensus of the GOP at the moment. Some people would add or modify some elements \u2014 Rubio, for instance, would completely eliminate investment taxes while others would merely reduce them, but he would also expand the child tax credit. But the outline is the same, particularly in its effects. Here\u2019s how we can summarize those:\n\nPoor and middle-class people will pay a little less in taxes Wealthy people will pay a lot less in taxes Corporations will pay a lot less in taxes The deficit will explode\n\nRepublicans, who profess to care deeply about deficits, will claim that their tax plan won\u2019t actually cost anything (or will cost very little), because when you cut taxes, you create such a supernova of economic growth that the cost of the cuts is offset by all the new revenue coming in. This is sometimes referred to as a belief in the \u201cTax Fairy\u201d because it has as much evidence to support it as a belief in the Tooth Fairy. It is a fantasy, but their continued insistence that it\u2019s true requires us to address it.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a Ph.D. in economics to remember the history of the last quarter-century. Bill Clinton raised taxes, and Republicans said the country would plunge into recession and the deficit would balloon; instead we had one of the best periods of growth in American history and we actually got to federal budget surplus. Then George W. Bush cut taxes, and Republicans said we\u2019d enter economic nirvana; instead there was incredibly weak job growth culminating in the Great Recession. Barack Obama raised taxes, and Republicans said it would produce economic disaster; instead the deficit was slashed and millions of jobs were created.\n\nSo we don\u2019t actually have to argue about whether the Republican tax plan will increase the deficit, because the theory behind it has been tested again and again, and the results are obvious. If they cut taxes as they\u2019d like, maybe the deficit will go up by a trillion dollars, or five trillion, or eight trillion. We don\u2019t know exactly how much it will go up, but we know it will go up.\n\nAs far as Republicans are concerned, dramatic increases in the deficit are a reasonable price to pay to obtain the moral good of tax cuts. If you think I\u2019m being unfair, ask them whether they believe Bush\u2019s tax cuts were a mistake. They don\u2019t.\n\nYou can agree or disagree. But you don\u2019t have to wonder what will happen if a Republican is elected. There may be other plans that president will be unable or unwilling to follow through on, but I promise you, cutting taxes is one thing he absolutely, positively will do. And we don\u2019t have to wonder what it will look like.
