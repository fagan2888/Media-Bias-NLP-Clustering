He will miss Thursday night\u2019s opener between Super Bowl champion Baltimore and the Broncos.\n\nThe league wanted a longer penalty for the third-year linebacker, but the sides agreed to less than half the season. It will cost Miller about $800,000.\n\n\u201cI made mistakes and my suspension has hurt my team, Broncos fans, and myself,\u201d Miller said when the agreement was reached last month. \u201cI am especially sorry for the effect of my bad decisions on others. I will not make the same mistakes about adhering to the policy in the future. \u201c\n\nTwo players are suspended for eight games: Ravens defensive back Asa Jackson and Cincinnati defensive end DeQuin Evans, under the performance-enhancing drugs policy.\n\nNone of the 20 players has been suspended for violating the personal conduct policy, although Jets running back Mike Goodson was arrested in New Jersey in May on drugs and weapons charges and will miss four games for substance abuse. His case was sent to a grand jury.\n\nAlso suspended under the substance abuse policy for four games each were: Jacksonville receiver Justin Blackmon, Indianapolis receiver LaVon Brazill, New York Giants safety Will Hill, Washington linebacker Rob Jackson, Arizona linebacker Daryl Washington, and Baltimore safety Christian Thompson.\n\nAlso barred for substance abuse, but with lesser suspensions, were: Minnesota fullback Jerome Felton (three games), Cleveland receiver Josh Gordon (two), San Francisco tight end Demarcus Dobbs (one), Rams running back Isaiah Pead (one) and Chiefs offensive lineman Rokevious Watkins (one).\n\nSuspended four games for using performance enhancers were: Seattle linebacker Bruce Irvin, St. Louis linebacker Jo-Lonn Dunbar, Oakland receiver Andre Holmes, Washington defensive lineman Jarvis Jenkins and Minnesota tackle DeMarcus Love.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 Von Miller among 20 suspended NFL players", "title": "Broncos\u2019 Von Miller among 20 suspended NFL players", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/03/broncos-von-miller-among-20-suspended-nfl-players/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130722__von-miller-broncos-072213bp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130722__von-miller-broncos-072213bp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-03T12:21:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:50:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc540\"", "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 Denver All-Pro linebacker Von Miller is among 20 NFL players suspended for the beginning of the NFL season.\nMiller will be out for six games for violating the league\u2019s substance abuse policy.\n\u201cTwo players are suspended for eight games: Ravens defensive back Asa Jackson and Cincinnati defensive end DeQuin Evans, under the performance-enhancing drugs policy.\n\u201cI made mistakes and my suspension has hurt my team, Broncos fans, and myself,\u201d Miller said when the agreement was reached last month.\nThe league wanted a longer penalty for the third-year linebacker, but the sides agreed to less than half the season."}
