How many years have you been in the St. Vrain Valley? 18

What brought you here? What has kept you here? In 1996, I moved back to my hometown of Sherman, Texas, to care for my mother. She only lived for one more year, but it was one of the best years of my life. Then I was faced with a decision to move somewhere. The mountains beckoned, and my dearest friend lived in Boulder.

I've always been a bit of a gypsy and so it freaks me out that I've lived in the same condo for 18 years, and that the longest job I've ever had is one I created for myself. Likelihood is that I would have moved on years ago, except I opened a store, and you just can't pick up and move on so easily.

That said, I have made more friends here than everywhere I've lived combined. I've had awesome opportunities come my way here, such as: performing with Till Death Do Us Party Murder Mysteries for 18 years, fronted two classic rock cover bands and had the pleasure of emceeing many local events. I love what I do in my store. Turns out, I'm really good at helping people find just the perfect outfit, and I really like helping costume people for special themed events. And then there's the dude. There's always a dude, right?

How did the economic downturn affect your business and the way you operate/stock your shop? Because my business is a consignment store, my stock is brought in by customers. When times are tough, customers look to shop cheaper and consignment stores tend to do a little better. I'd like to believe that Rockin' Robin's is the most fun store to visit. I choose clothes for play rather than work, my formals and cocktail wear sparkle all year long, and my jukebox, filled with the greatest songs from the '60s through the '80s, provides a nightclub-like atmosphere so that my customers can "bop while they shop!"

What's your favorite song? "Mississippi Queen!" More cowbell!
