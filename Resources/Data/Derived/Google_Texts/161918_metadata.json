The Grand Old Party lives in an era when men believed that women weren\u2019t smart enough to make their own medical decisions and when women were less valuable economically than men. And Republicans wonder why so few women vote for them.\n\nLast Tuesday was Equal Pay Day, and President Obama used the occasion to issue an executive order that businesses doing business with the federal government couldn\u2019t punish their employees for sharing information about salaries. The next day, the Senate had the chance to extend the requirement to all businesses and came up empty when every single Republican member of the Senate voted to block an up or down vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]\n\nKeep in mind that the Paycheck Fairness Act did not require businesses to pay women at the same rate as men who do the same jobs. The legislation only kept businesses from punishing employees for sharing salary information. Strangely, self styled libertarian Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voted against the bill to give workers more freedom.\n\nData from the U.S. Census shows that women make only 77 cents for every dollar a man makes. And that isn\u2019t likely to change much unless Congress acts to make sure our daughters, sisters and mothers get paid on the level of men who do the same work. The private sector hasn\u2019t moved an inch in the last 20 years to right this wrong. The ratio of female pay to male pay has been struck in the 70 percent range since 1992. Somebody had to do something and that\u2019s what 53 Senate Democrats tried to do last week.\n\nThe headlines after the vote were not pretty for the GOP. The Washington Post headline was \u201cSenate Republicans Block Equal Pay.\u201d And if you think it was only the \u201cliberal media\u201d that dumped on the GOP, the conservative Wall Street Journal ran the same header.\n\n[Read blogger Peter Roff on the GOP's tone deafness on women's issues.]\n\nHey guys! This is what your wives, sisters and children can look forward to because of Republican obstruction: Based on calculations made by the National Women\u2019s Law Center from the Census data, women can expect to earn lose nearly half a million dollars ($464,314 ) due to the pay gap over the course of a 40-year work life. Education doesn\u2019t help either. Women with college or post graduate degrees earn only 71 percent of the money that their male counterparts are paid.\n\nLast week, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, criticized Majority Leader Harry Reid for calling \u201cshow\u201d votes on issues like equal pay. McConnell also described Democratic efforts to secure equal pay as \u201cblowing wet kisses to women.\u201d McConnell voted against similar legislation in 2010 and 2012. McConnell may be the most vulnerable senator up for re-election this year and his formidable challenger is a woman, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. That should be fun to watch. If Grimes does unseat the minority leader, she will be one of the lucky women who earn the same salary as men do.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Congress.]\n\nIf the GOP was a TV show, it would be \u201cThe Flintstones,\" \u201cyour average stone age family.\u201d Along with last week\u2019s vote by the GOP-dominated House to cut spending on child care and nutrition assistance for women and infant children, the GOP is well on the way to losing its own war against women.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Republicans Are Still Behind the Times on Women and Equal Pay", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "When it comes to women's issues, Republican policies and rhetoric are stuck in the prehistoric era.", "title": "Your Stone Age GOP", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/brad-bannon/2014/04/14/republicans-are-still-behind-the-times-on-women-and-equal-pay", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/3a/b1/7412b2aa4c13a5cfaa84c3f371b3/20140408edwas-a.tif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "When it comes to women's issues, Republican policies and rhetoric are stuck in the prehistoric era.", "card": "summary", "title": "Republicans Are Still Behind the Times on Women and Equal Pay"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "April 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Brad Bannon,Republican Party,working women,politics,Paul, Rand,McConnell, Mitch,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "When it comes to women's issues, Republican policies and rhetoric are stuck in the prehistoric era."}, "article_summary": "McConnell also described Democratic efforts to secure equal pay as \u201cblowing wet kisses to women.\u201d McConnell voted against similar legislation in 2010 and 2012.\nAnd Republicans wonder why so few women vote for them.\nKeep in mind that the Paycheck Fairness Act did not require businesses to pay women at the same rate as men who do the same jobs.\nLast week, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, criticized Majority Leader Harry Reid for calling \u201cshow\u201d votes on issues like equal pay.\nThe ratio of female pay to male pay has been struck in the 70 percent range since 1992."}
