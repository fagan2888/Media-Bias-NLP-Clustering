Her grandmother saw the change in light, recognized an omen and ordered her swiftly indoors.\n\n\u201cIt is natural,\u201d Robles said. \u201cBut when I was little, I was scared.\u201d\n\nThey were among about 200 who stood together on the campus at Regis University with telescopes and looked up in awe. Others searched for light-free areas in the mountains such as Horsetooth Reservoir, west of Fort Collins.\n\nSunday\u2019s super blood harvest moon \u2014 visible across the world from Los Angeles to Lahore \u2014 resulted from a rare celestial trifecta. First, this was the first autumnal moon after the equinox Wednesday. Second, because the moon had reached the closest point to Earth (perigee) on its elliptical orbit, astronomers designated it a \u201csupermoon\u201d \u2014 appearing about 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than usual. Third, these events coincided with a total lunar eclipse with Earth aligning between the sun and the moon.\n\nThe chemical composition of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, containing soot and dust, made the refracted sunlight appear orange against the moon.\n\n\u201cThat curved, dark shadow, that is the Earth. That is definitely the curve of our own Earth. The Greeks knew the Earth was round due to the shape of that shadow,\u201d said Regis astrophysics professor Quyen Hart, who hosted the gathering in northwest Denver.\n\nHistorically, volcanic eruptions could make so-called blood moons appear bloodier \u201cif there were more particulates in the atmosphere,\u201d Hart said. \u201cWhat makes sunsets more red are bigger-size particles.\u201d\n\nTraditional and ancient societies often associated blood moons with omens. Some in the western United States on Sunday warned of a possible apocalypse. As far back as the Babylonians, in what is now Iraq, people have tried to anticipate and interpret moons. Savvy rulers who tracked lunar patterns could take advantage and bolster their power.\n\nAstronomers said Sunday\u2019s celestial combination hasn\u2019t happened since 1982 and won\u2019t happen again until 2033.\n\nFor Porshai Campbell, 29, that was motivation to drive her daughter, Ashira, 11, and nephew, Alexander, 8, over to the Regis telescopes. Peering out the car window, they saw the shadow starting shortly after sunset \u2014 \u201cthis is amazing,\u201d \u201cawesome\u201d \u2014 and they calculated how old they\u2019d be at the next super blood moon. And Ashira, pressing her smartphone against the largest telescope, took a picture.\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, bfinley@denverpost.com or @finleybruce", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Thousands of Coloradans view \u201csuper moon\u201d lunar eclipse", "title": "Thousands of Coloradans view \u201csuper moon\u201d lunar eclipse", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/27/thousands-of-coloradans-view-super-moon-lunar-eclipse/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150927__BN20150927_Z00_BNCD28MOONp1.jpg", "height": 431}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150927__BN20150927_Z00_BNCD28MOONp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-27T21:42:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T00:45:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0ec\"", "article_summary": "Sunday\u2019s super blood harvest moon \u2014 visible across the world from Los Angeles to Lahore \u2014 resulted from a rare celestial trifecta.\nHistorically, volcanic eruptions could make so-called blood moons appear bloodier \u201cif there were more particulates in the atmosphere,\u201d Hart said.\n\u201cWhat makes sunsets more red are bigger-size particles.\u201dTraditional and ancient societies often associated blood moons with omens.\nFor Porshai Campbell, 29, that was motivation to drive her daughter, Ashira, 11, and nephew, Alexander, 8, over to the Regis telescopes.\nPeering out the car window, they saw the shadow starting shortly after sunset \u2014 \u201cthis is amazing,\u201d \u201cawesome\u201d \u2014 and they calculated how old they\u2019d be at the next super blood moon."}
