Officials say the Zika virus is transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito. The disease can cause fever, rash, muscle and joint aches and red eyes. These symptoms typically last several days to a week, and hospitalizations are rare. They also advise pregnant women to avoid travel to foreign countries where the virus has been reported.

The OSDH has more information on the Zika virus on its website.
