What is the smartest and dumbest purchase you ever made, and what lesson did you take from them?

MATT HOUGAN: The dumbest purchase I ever made was a brand new, shiny, black Volkswagen Jetta, which I purchased in 2000. I was working my first real job and for the first time had a little bit of money. When my wife’s 10-year old Cabriolet died, I pounced.

The Jetta was a bad car, but that’s not what made it a dumb purchase. What made it a dumb purchase is the fact that I don’t really care about cars.

All else being equal, I’d prefer a nice car to a dull one. Who wouldn’t? But for how much money that Jetta cost, it gave me very little pleasure. When I think of the vacations or experiences or time/savings that $23,000 could have bought, it makes me sad.



I realized the Jetta was a dumb buy within months of purchasing it. I eventually sold it, quit my job and moved to Mexico. I drove a 10-year old Jeep.

As for the best purchase I ever made, that’s pretty easy. When I was 22, my wife (then girlfriend) bought airplane tickets to travel around the world, with stops in Fiji, New Zealand, Thailand and Italy. That trip set the tone for much of what’s made my life great.
