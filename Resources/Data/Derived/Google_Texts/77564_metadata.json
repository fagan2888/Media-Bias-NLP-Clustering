People who don\u2019t meet the Sept. 5 deadline will lose their coverage on Sept. 30.\n\nSome clients of Insure Central Texas in Austin, which helped many Latinos and uninsured sign up for Obamacare, have been receiving notices all summer without a deadline.\n\n\u201cThe deadline is a surprise. We were not aware of the Sept. 5 deadline,\u201d Colvin said.\n\nGenerally, people have had 90 days to fix issues.\n\nAccording to federal officials, 52,700 people in Texas are getting notices on what the government calls \u201ccitizenship/immigration data matching\" issues. Another 93,800 also got notices in Florida. Both are states with heavy Latino and immigrant populations.\n\nA total 310,000 notices are going to people in states with federally run marketplaces. States running their own marketplaces are resolving their own \u201cmismatches.\u201d CMS said the \"mismatches\" can happen when information in the application is different than what the government has on file. In some cases, the problem is as simple as being one number off on an identification number.\n\n\"A data inconsistency does not necessarily mean there is a problem with an individual\u2019s eligibility for enrollment; it means that additional information is needed to verify the information provided in an application,\" CMS said in the release.\n\nFor many of Insure Central Texas' clients, getting in needed paperwork is easier said than done. Many lack access to computers or scanners and literacy in English or in the language of the world of health insurance, Colvin said. Some may have had the right paperwork when they enrolled but couldn't get the documents in the HealthCare.Gov or CuidadodeSalud.gov website.\n\n\u201cThe system didn\u2019t work well and didn\u2019t work during times people enrolled, so we couldn\u2019t upload documents on many days because many times the upload feature would not work,\u201d Colvin said. \u201cEven now, there are some difficulties uploading documents and opening accounts.\u201d\n\nPeople who might have attended enrollment events may have found it difficult to later provide outstanding documents because they were helped in opening the account and so don\u2019t have the user and password information to go back to the account, Colvin said. The federal government is allowing people to mail in documents and Insure Central Texas has been helping with that as well.\n\n\u201cThis is a population that has previously been uninsured. I talked to a representative from Blue Cross Blue Shield who told me the question they used to get was \u2018How much is my deductible?\u2019 The conversation now is \u2018What is a deductible?\u2019\u201d Colvin said.\n\nThe federal government said it has resolved about 450,000 cases with immigration or citizenship issues and is receiving about 60,000 documents a day. People with questions can contact the call center at 1-800-318-2596, the CMS said.\n\nBecause of the large learning curve on health insurance, Insure Central Texas kept its service centers operating even after the Obamacare enrollment period ended at the end of March and has been helping people with a range of issues since then.\n\nAmong them has been that many of their clients do not use banks so they\u2019ve had trouble making payments to insurance companies. Insure Central Texas has had to work with the insurance companies to find out how and where people could send payments by money order.\n\nThe federal government has listed other local groups like Insure Central Texas who can help people who get notices on a website. The nearest group can be found by entering a city and state or zip code.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some 310,000 people are on notice they need added documents, mainly regarding immigration/citizenship status, before a September 5 deadline.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/obamacare-could-end-those-whose-paperwork-incomplete-n179726", "site_name": "NBC News", "image": "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_33/615991/140813-acanotices-sg-1155_630e136b41a78bd557276dc10c559108.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Some 310,000 people are on notice they need added documents, mainly regarding immigration/citizenship status, before a September 5 deadline."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Some 310,000 people are on notice they need added documents, mainly regarding immigration/citizenship status, before a September 5 deadline.", "title": "Obamacare Could End for Those Whose Paperwork Is Incomplete - NBC News", "image": {"src": "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_33/615991/140813-acanotices-sg-1155_630e136b41a78bd557276dc10c559108.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "creator": "NBCNews", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-13", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/obamacare-could-end-those-whose-paperwork-incomplete-n179726", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "News,Latino"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8ef\"", "article_summary": "For many of Insure Central Texas' clients, getting in needed paperwork is easier said than done.\nSome clients of Insure Central Texas in Austin, which helped many Latinos and uninsured sign up for Obamacare, have been receiving notices all summer without a deadline.\nBecause of the large learning curve on health insurance, Insure Central Texas kept its service centers operating even after the Obamacare enrollment period ended at the end of March and has been helping people with a range of issues since then.\nMany lack access to computers or scanners and literacy in English or in the language of the world of health insurance, Colvin said.\nThe federal government is allowing people to mail in documents and Insure Central Texas has been helping with that as well."}
