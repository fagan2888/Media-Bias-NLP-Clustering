If it is put into effect as drafted, several of the state's best hospitals will be crippled or forced to close. And these vulnerable hospitals tend to serve the state's most vulnerable populations in New Jersey's poor cities. Catholic hospitals, in particular, would face potential ruin.\n\n\"You're punishing hospitals, through no fault of their own, even those ranked as having great quality, great outcomes, and high patient satisfaction,\" Sen. Joe Vitale, the legislature's top health care expert, told Horizon's CEO at a packed hearing on Monday.\n\nThe irony is this: The core idea behind Horizon's plan, known as Omnia, makes great sense. The company wants to move beyond the fee-for-service system, which reimburses doctors and hospitals for each procedure they perform. That system drives up health costs by giving providers an incentive to pile up charges for unneeded tests and treatments.\n\nHorizon wants to offer an alternative. It wants to pay providers to care for large groups of patients. If the outcomes are good, and the providers can reduce costs, Horizon promises to share those savings with the providers. The incentives under this \"value-based\" system are more rational -- to provide good care at the lowest possible cost.\n\nThe entire health care system is moving towards that model, nudged along by mandates in Obamacare, and early results showing that it can work.\n\nHere's the problem: Horizon is only offering this option to a select group of hospitals that it chose through a secret scoring process its executives will describe only cryptically. The company will not release the scores it assigned to each hospital, nor will it open this alternative to all hospitals.\n\nIt has instead formed an insider's club of hospitals and doctors it calls \"Tier 1\" providers. If patients agree to join these networks, they will see a hefty 15 percent cut in premiums, and a significant cut in out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIt's clear how the market will respond. Businesses and families facing crushing health care costs will embrace these big discounts, flocking to these Tier 1 hospital systems.\n\nWhich brings us to the Tier 2 hospitals, including most Catholic hospitals and a number of high-quality urban hospitals whose patients are disproportionately poor. These hospitals could lose the few privately insured patients they have, a body blow to their bottom line.\n\n\"This will do tremendous harm,\" says Alexander Hatala, CEO of Lourdes Health system, which runs highly rated hospitals in Trenton and Camden. \"It will force the closure of hospitals in urban areas.\"\n\nMost people will assume a \"Tier 2\" label denotes low-quality care.\n\nYet the opposite is true. On the whole, Tier 2 hospitals rank higher than Tier 1 hospitals on the most respected national ranking, from the Leapfrog Group.\n\nSo why would Horizon form an elite club, and exclude so many top performers? Because, it turns out, Horizon stands to profit more by doing so.\n\nThis Tier 1 group is made up not of the best systems, but mostly of the biggest systems, such as Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Hackensack University Medical Center.\n\nThese big systems have the bargaining power to demand more hefty payments from Horizon for a given medical procedure. Smaller hospitals, even the best ones, get smaller reimbursements for the same procedures.\n\nSo Horizon can cut its own costs more by bringing these big systems into its fold, and its CEO, Bob Marino, concedes that point. He says that those added savings played no role in the selection process. But he will not open the books on this to prove it.\n\n* *\n\nThe notion that a private company can redesign the state's health care system like this, in secret, is plainly offensive, and made possible only by the neglect of our absentee governor. Count this as more collateral damage of his presidential ambitions.\n\nVitale (D-Middlesex) and Sen. Nia Gill (D-Essex) have asked the attorney general to intervene, a long-shot that is nonetheless worth a try. Linda Schwimmer of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, noted in her testimony that the state has tremendous bargaining power with insurers, including Horizon, based on it huge population of public workers and Medicaid patients. The state could have used that leverage to help shape this plan, and still could do so when these contracts next come up for renewal.\n\nThe challenge is to force Horizon to open its books, and to modify this plan so that high quality safety net hospitals are protected.\n\nIt would be a mistake, though, to reject this plan entirely. New Jersey's hospital costs are out of control, the second highest in the country and growing faster than most. That kills jobs, and it puts insurance out of reach for small businesses and families of modest means. Cutting costs is a progressive cause.\n\nBut Horizon's plan needs to be changed. As drafted, it presents a clear danger to good hospitals doing heroic work in areas of greatest need.\n\nFollow The Star-Ledger on Twitter @starledger.
