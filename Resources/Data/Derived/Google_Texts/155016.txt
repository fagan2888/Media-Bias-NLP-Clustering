In a surprise move, Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase switched agents just as he was about to begin the head coach interviewing process.

He had been represented by Bob LaMonte, who is considered an NFL power broker to coaches.

LaMonte represents John Fox and Jack Del Rio of the Broncos, Kansas City’s Andy Reid, San Diego’s Mike McCoy, Washington’s Jay Gruden and former coaches Jon Gruden and Mike Holmgren among several others, as well Denver’s director of pro personnel Tom Heckert.

Gase is now represented by James Sexton, whose clientele includes Tim Tebow among others.

Gase interviewed Friday with the San Francisco 49ers and Atlanta Falcons and was to meet today with the Chicago Bears and Buffalo Bills.
