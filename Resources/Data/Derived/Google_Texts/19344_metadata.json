Wardy told El Paso Inc. that of those 850, fewer than 15 applied for unemployment benefits.\n\nThe remaining 100 workers had jobs in administration or other areas. According to Wardy, about 40 of those workers have applied for unemployment benefits.\n\n\u201cFor every patient, there was a provider who took care of them. For almost every patient who transferred, the provider went with the patient to the new entity,\u201d Wardy said.\n\nTracey Moorhead is president and CEO of the Visiting Nurse Associations of America, based in Washington, D.C. It represents 170 non-profit VNAs nationwide. She said VNAs are struggling nationwide, although not many have had to close their doors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that every home health agency in the country has been significantly and adversely affected by Medicare payment policy at the federal level,\u201d Moorhead said.\n\n\u201cOur agencies,\u201d she said, \u201care being killed \u2013 death by a thousand payment cuts \u2013 but also over-managed into the ground by Medicare oversight.\u201d\n\nWhen the VNA opened in El Paso with just two nurses on Dec. 1, 1967, it was one of the city\u2019s first home health agencies. Reimbursements were generous and the non-profit had no significant competition.\n\nBut \u201cthe die was cast in 2005,\u201d Wardy said.\n\nReimbursements have steadily declined and Wardy estimates there are now more than 150 competing home health care organizations operating in the El Paso region.\n\n\u201cIf you have not developed a competitive organization that runs just like a business, with process improvement, strong performance measurement and extremely strong financial management, you cannot be a provider in today\u2019s environment,\u201d Wardy said.\n\nThe VNA had been just breaking even for years when Molina Healthcare cut the nonprofit\u2019s Medicaid reimbursements by $700,000 in 2012.\n\nIn the meantime, new mandates under the Affordable Care Act were hurting the VNA, Wardy said. The health care law requires organizations with 50 or more employees to provide health insurance benefits to full-time employees or be hit with a penalty.\n\nAlthough the Obama administration delayed the penalty until 2015, Wardy said the VNA would have to eventually provide all its full-time employees with health insurance or pay the penalty, which it could not afford to do.\n\nSo, Wardy said, the VNA had to cut the hours of many of its employees to 29 hours to circumvent the law\u2019s 30-hour definition of a \u201cfull-time\u201d employee.\n\n\u201cThese poor people were already working part-time at minimum wage and we had to cut their hours,\u201d Wardy said. \u201cWe had a 21.4-percent loss in our Medicaid patient population from August 2012 to August 2013.\u201d\n\nLast year, it became apparent to Wardy and the non-profit\u2019s board that the organization was dying and needed hospice care.\n\n\u201cAt what point do we say: Look, the trends are extremely negative. While we still have the opportunity to pay our employees and our obligations, why don\u2019t we do a wind down of our operations so we can leave with some dignity,\u201d Wardy said.\n\nIn October, the non-profit\u2019s board decided the VNA would have to close and began transitioning its patients and health care workers to other home health care providers in El Paso.\n\n\u201cAt that point, we were thinking we close or face bankruptcy,\u201d said board chair Marilyn Munden.\n\nThe VNA transferred its last patient in December, according to Wardy.\n\n\u201cIt went off without a hitch,\u201d he said.\n\nThe non-profit is now operating with 14 administrative employees and plans to end operations completely the end of this month.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nEmail El Paso Inc. reporter Robert Gray at rsgray@elpasoinc.com or call (915) 534-4422 ext. 105.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "El Paso Inc.", "description": "Most of the 850 home health care workers who lost their jobs with the local Visiting Nurse Association when it closed last year have found employment, VNA executives say.After 46 years in operation, the non-profit, at one time the largest home health care organization in El Paso, began winding down its operations in October.", "title": "After shutdown, VNA employees find jobs", "url": "http://www.elpasoinc.com/news/local_news/article_c5cfb868-8124-11e3-9402-0019bb30f31a.html", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/elpasoinc.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/99/19943e00-7f0a-11e3-a0b1-001a4bcf6878/52d875da8d617.preview-300.jpg?resize=300%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Most of the 850 home health care workers who lost their jobs with the local Visiting Nurse Association when it closed last year have found employment, VNA executives say.After 46 years in operation, the non-profit, at one time the largest home health care organization in El Paso, began winding down its operations in October.", "fb": {"app_id": 172555339466240}, "keywords": "local_news,editors_pick", "news_keywords": "local_news,editors_pick"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90ba\"", "article_summary": "The health care law requires organizations with 50 or more employees to provide health insurance benefits to full-time employees or be hit with a penalty.\nOf the 950 employees affected by the VNA\u2019s closing, about 850 were home health care workers.\nMost of the 850 home health care workers who lost their jobs with the local Visiting Nurse Association when it closed last year have found employment, VNA executives say.\nIn the meantime, new mandates under the Affordable Care Act were hurting the VNA, Wardy said.\nIn October, the non-profit\u2019s board decided the VNA would have to close and began transitioning its patients and health care workers to other home health care providers in El Paso."}
