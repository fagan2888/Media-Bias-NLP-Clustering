The present-day Democratic Party has next to nothing to do with Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal or Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society. Today\u2019s Democratic Party is a completely different party, which coalesced between 1968 and 1980. And this half-century-old party has been anti-New Deal from the very beginning.\n\nNow that I have your attention, allow me to explain.\n\nWhile there have been two parties called \u201cthe Democrats\u201d and \u201cthe Republicans\u201d since the mid-19th century, these enduring labels mask the fact that party coalitions change every generation or two. Franklin Roosevelt created a new party under the old name of \u201cthe Democrats\u201d by welding ex-Republican Progressives in the North together with the old Jacksonian Farmer-Labor coalition. The contentious issue of civil rights nearly destroyed the Roosevelt Democrats in 1948 \u2014 and finally wrecked it in 1968, when George Wallace\u2019s third party campaign proved to be a way-station for many working-class whites en route from the Democrats to the Republicans.\n\nToday\u2019s Democratic Party, in contrast, took shape between 1968 and 1980. Although George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential race to Richard Nixon in a landslide, the McGovernites of the \u201cNew Politics\u201d movement wrested control of the Democratic Party from the old state politicians and urban bosses of the Roosevelt-to-Johnson New Deal coalition. Robert Kennedy\u2019s aide Fred Dutton, one of the architects of the disempowerment of the old New Deal elite, called for a new coalition of young people, college-educated suburbanites and minorities in his 1971 book \u201cChanging Sources of Power: Politics in the 1970s.\u201d Sound familiar? That\u2019s because, nearly half a century later, the same groups are the core constituents of today\u2019s Democrats.\n\nJimmy Carter was the first New Politics president (or New Democrat or neoliberal, as they were later called). He was a center-right Southern governor who ran against big government and touted his credentials as a rich businessman. He did not get along with organized labor, one of the key constituencies of the Roosevelt Democrats. His major domestic policy achievement was dismantling New Deal regulation of transportation like trucking and air travel. He appointed a Federal Reserve chairman from Wall Street, Paul Volcker, who created an artificial recession, the worst between the Great Depression and the Great Recession, to cripple American unions, whose wage demands were blamed for inflation.\n\nEven before Carter\u2019s election, the Democratic \u201cclass of \u201974\u201d in Congress wrested power from the old largely Southern politicians of the New Deal era. The northern Irish Catholic-Southern alliance, symbolized by House Speakers Tip O\u2019Neill and Jim Wright, gave way among congressional Democrats to a new Northeastern-West Coast domination, beginning with Democratic House Speaker Tom Foley, of the state of Washington. Many of these younger Democrats were deficit hawks, like Bill Bradley of New York and Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts. Democrats like these supported the 1983 Social Security \u201creform,\u201d which cut Social Security benefits by raising the formal retirement age from 65 to 67. In his 1984 presidential campaign, Carter\u2019s former vice-president, Fritz Mondale, made deficit reduction his central issue.\n\nBill Clinton had worked for McGovern\u2019s campaign in 1972. A center-right Southern governor like Carter, he too combined moderate economic conservatism with social liberalism. Like Carter, Clinton attacked a major New Deal program, teaming up with the Republicans in Congress to abolish a New Deal entitlement, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and replacing it with what conservatives wanted: federal grants to state-based programs. Clinton made deficit reduction rather than public investment central to his presidency. Clinton also supported the dismantling of New Deal regulations of the financial sector, completing the dismantling of the New Deal in the economy that Carter had begun. In the 1994 midterms, many of the remaining Southern \u201cblue dog\u201d Democrats were replaced by Republicans, shifting the regional base of the party even more to the former liberal Republican states of the Northeast and West Coast.\n\nBarack Obama is the third New Politics Democrat in the White House, following Carter and Clinton. His base is the Fred Dutton constituency \u2014 young people, some college-educated whites, and blacks and Latinos. Like Carter and Clinton, he went after a major New Deal program \u2014 the most iconic of them all, Social Security. Obama proposed cutting Social Security by means of inflation adjustments or \u201cchained CPI\u201d as part of a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Republican conservatives. He backed off only after a rebellion from what remains of the Democratic left. Those who call him an \u201cEisenhower Democrat\u201d recognize that he is closer in outlook to penny-pinching, dovish mid-20th century liberal Republicanism than to \u201cguns and butter\u201d Rooseveltian liberalism.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dems taking pride in FDR's historic legacy need to reckon with a basic truth: The party is now firmly anti-New Deal", "author": "Michael Lind", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Dems taking pride in FDR's historic legacy need to reckon with a basic truth: The party is now firmly anti-New Deal", "title": "Democrats vs. the New Deal: Who really runs the party \u2014 and why it might surprise you", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/09/democrats_vs_the_new_deal_who_really_runs_the_party_and_why_it_might_surprise_you/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/04/obama_fdr.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dems taking pride in FDR's historic legacy need to reckon with a basic truth: The party is now firmly anti-New Deal", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/04/obama_fdr.jpg", "title": "Democrats vs. the New Deal: Who really runs the party \u2014 and why it might surprise you", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Democrats vs. the New Deal: Who really runs the party \u2014 and why it might surprise you", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Civil Rights, Economics, Environment, FDR, Foreign policy, GOP, Immigration, Jimmy Carter, New Deal, Social Security, The Left", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ed2\"", "article_summary": "Today\u2019s Democratic Party is a completely different party, which coalesced between 1968 and 1980.\nDemocrats like these supported the 1983 Social Security \u201creform,\u201d which cut Social Security benefits by raising the formal retirement age from 65 to 67.\nThe present-day Democratic Party has next to nothing to do with Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal or Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society.\nObama proposed cutting Social Security by means of inflation adjustments or \u201cchained CPI\u201d as part of a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Republican conservatives.\nToday\u2019s Democratic Party, in contrast, took shape between 1968 and 1980."}
