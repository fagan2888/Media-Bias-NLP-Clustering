The patch would simply authorize the use of current funds from the Highway Trust Fund.\n\nLawmakers hope the patch will open a lane for a multi-year fix to federal highway funding.\n\nOn Monday, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa., said that \u201cthis extension will allow the highway bill process to continue moving forward without shutting down transportation programs and projects across the country.\u201d\n\nLast Thursday, the House Transportation Committee completed a markup of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act, a six-year bill authorizing $325 billion in spending for highways, transit, and safety programs.\n\nShuster called the markup and approval of the STRR Act \u201ca positive step forward,\u201d adding that he looks \u201cforward to House action on the bill and going to conference with the Senate as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nSwitching gears after the markup, Shuster introduced the temporary patch. In the next two days, the House must take accelerated action to ensure that legislation becomes law before spending authorization expires this Thursday.\n\nLast Friday, the White House chided lawmakers for \u201ccongressional inaction\u201d on the issue but signaled that President Obama will support the temporary extension.\n\n\u201cThis country cannot continue to rely on short-term patches as an approach to funding our infrastructure,\u201d Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters. \u201cSo the House and Senate should use this time to finally complete its work on a long-term bill.\u201d\n\nThe current roadmap to a long-term bill requires a congressional conference to reconcile the House STRR Act with the Senate\u2019s DRIVE Act. Passed earlier this summer, the upper chamber\u2019s legislation authorizes six years of spending but funds only three of those years.\n\nStill, Senate leaders seem confident that a highway bill could pass through Congress and become law by the end of November.\n\n\u201cBoth the Senate and the House bills have many similarities that will allow for a very short conference period,\u201d Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee said in a join-statement Friday with Sen. Barbara Boxer, R-Calif.\n\n\u201cWith this milestone, Congress should be able to send a bill to the president\u2019s desk by Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nSome conservatives oppose both the House and Senate highway bills.\n\nMichael Sargent, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation, argues that the bills stall reform and set up \u201cbig-spending bailouts.\u201d\n\nSargent says the patch and the long-term bills fail to \u201cdo anything substantive to fix the broken, top-down system for highway funding that has required over $70 billion in bailouts since 2008.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven worse,\u201d Sargent adds, the current patch \u201ckeeps the door open for legislative mischief such as adding unrelated or other must-pass provision to the highway bill.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers have introduced \"patch\" legislation to provide short-term federal transportation funding and clear the way for a long-term highway bill.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Lawmakers have introduced \"patch\" legislation to provide short-term federal transportation funding and clear the way for a long-term highway bill.", "title": "Patch Gives Congress Time To Pass Long-Term Highway Bill", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/DailySignal-Logo-Stack-BW.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-28T11:55:01+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PQ5YhA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Lawmakers have introduced \"patch\" legislation to provide short-term federal transportation funding and clear the way for a long-term highway bill.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/DailySignal-Logo-Stack-BW.jpg"}, "title": "Patch Gives Congress Time To Pass Long-Term Highway Bill", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "transportation", "published_time": "2015-10-26T15:03:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-28T11:55:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Highway Bill, Patch, Bill Shuster, Jim Inhofe, Barbara Boxer, Transportation Committee"}, "article_summary": "Still, Senate leaders seem confident that a highway bill could pass through Congress and become law by the end of November.\nHouse Republicans introduced legislation late last week to temporarily extend federal transportation funding for three weeks, giving lawmakers more time to work on a long-term highway bill.\nLawmakers hope the patch will open a lane for a multi-year fix to federal highway funding.\nThe funding \u201cpatch,\u201d H.R.\n3819, authorizes federal transportation spending for an additional three weeks by pushing the current expiration date back from October 29 to November 20."}
