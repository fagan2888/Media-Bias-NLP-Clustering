If \u201cit reports that the resources and grassroots support are there, I am in,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t underestimate the obstacles,\u201d said Davis, who left Alabama and has had a complicated political history since he left Congress in 2011.\n\nElected to Congress in 2002, Davis was a classmate of President Barack Obama while at Harvard Law and was an early supporter of his presidential campaign. In fact, during the 2008 Democratic National Convention, he gave one of the nominating speeches in support of Obama.\n\nBut in 2010, everything changed when Davis surprisingly lost the Democratic nomination for governor. Having voted against Obamacare while in the House, Davis battled with certain elements of the black Democratic establishment in Alabama.\n\nAfter his loss, Davis moved to northern Virginia, renounced his membership in the Democratic Party and became a Republican. Not only did he endorse Mitt Romney over Barack Obama in 2012, he delivered a rousing speech in support of the GOP ticket at the national convention in Tampa.\n\nEarlier this year, Davis flirted with the idea of running for Congress in Virginia as a Republican, though ultimately decided against doing so, citing the difficulty of running in a conservative Republican primary.\n\nNow mulling the option of returning to Montgomery, where he was born, Davis realizes his path since leaving Alabama could be problematic.\n\n\u201cI know I will have to explain to African Americans just what this party switching business was about, and why being a Republican doesn\u2019t mean that I have lost my heart for struggling people who can\u2019t catch a break,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Montgomery is 56.6 percent black.\n\nAs for moving back to Alabama from Virginia, Davis also acknowledges that \u201cwhile I spent the first 31 years of my life in Montgomery, and married a Montgomery girl, none of that will spare me the carpetbagger attack.\u201d\n\nShould he run, Davis suggests he will try to distance himself from both the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\n\u201cThe familiar left versus right debate is too exhausted, too stale to manage any of these problems,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe last thing we need is to import the false choices in Washington into a Montgomery election.\u201d\n\nMontgomery has a mayor-council system, and its elections are non-partisan. Todd Strange, the current mayor, has not yet indicated whether he will run for re-election in 2015.\n\n\u201cSo, my campaign won\u2019t rehash what federal policies have and haven\u2019t worked,\u201d Davis said. \u201cInstead, my agenda will be solutions that answer to the test of effectiveness rather than ideological purity.\u201d\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "Former Democratic congressman left party to join GOP", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Artur Davis -- the black politician who memorably left the Democratic Party after serving four terms in Congress and later become a Republican -- is now contemplating a mayoral run in his hometown of", "title": "Black Republican Artur Davis Considering Mayoral Run In Alabama", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/18/black-republican-artur-davis-considering-mayoral-run-in-alabama/", "image": {"width": 548, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Artur-Davis-e1321849057908.jpg", "height": 235}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former Democratic congressman left party to join GOP", "title": "Black Republican Artur Davis Considering Mayoral Run In Alabama Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/18/black-republican-artur-davis-considering-mayoral-run-in-alabama/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Artur-Davis-e1321849057908.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-18 13:49:57", "sailthru.title": "Black Republican Artur Davis Considering Mayoral Run In Alabama", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "artur davis", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "alex-pappas", "sailthru.description": "Artur Davis -- the black politician who memorably left the Democratic Party after serving four terms in Congress and later become a Republican -- is now contemplating a mayoral run in his hometown of", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Artur-Davis-e1321849057908.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb0e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t underestimate the obstacles,\u201d said Davis, who left Alabama and has had a complicated political history since he left Congress in 2011.\nAfter his loss, Davis moved to northern Virginia, renounced his membership in the Democratic Party and became a Republican.\n4260040Artur Davis \u2014 the black politician who memorably left the Democratic Party after serving four terms in Congress and later become a Republican \u2014 is now contemplating a mayoral run in his hometown of Montgomery, Ala.\nHaving voted against Obamacare while in the House, Davis battled with certain elements of the black Democratic establishment in Alabama.\nIn an op-ed, Davis said he plans to set up an exploratory committee for the 2015 Montgomery mayoral race."}
