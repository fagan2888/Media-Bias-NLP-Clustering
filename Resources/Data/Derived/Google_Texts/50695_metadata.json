Under this proposal, he would pay the company about $4,000 per student who enrolls in the program.\n\nLewiston gets $5,927 for each student in pre-kindergarten through eighth grade and $6,437 for high school students through the state\u2019s funding formula, so the district is likely to save money if the program is approved by the Lewiston School Board and students enroll.\n\nAs of Sept. 2, there were three students from the Lewiston Public Schools who were enrolled at Maine Connections Academy, the new virtual charter school. Four students from Bangor and seven from Portland enrolled.\n\nConnections Academy was paid to support 25 virtual charter schools in 23 states in the 2013-14 school year, according to its website.\n\nThe company is owned by Pearson PLC, a London-based, publicly traded publishing company that is responsible for many standardized tests and textbooks used in the U.S.\n\nIf the Lewiston program starts this year, the students who enroll will be taught by teachers who work for Pearson and are most likely located in other states, Webster said. Students in the program would be able to take classes at the Lewiston schools as well.\n\n\u201cI applaud them for trying to do that,\u201d Karl Francis, the principal of Maine Connections Academy said. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon [for Connections Academy] to be in more than one school in a state.\u201d\n\nThere are now six charter schools in Maine, the first of which opened in 2012. Maine can authorize a total of 10 charter schools. Three groups applied in August for the four remaining spots.\n\nCharter schools are funded through the school districts where the students would otherwise attend. School districts with students who attend a charter school pay the charter school an allocation, which includes state and local funding, for each student.\n\nFrom the school district perspective, a problem with the money-following-student system is that the majority of costs associated with running a school are not per pupil. A district that has five high school students attending the new charter school, for example, can\u2019t eliminate a teacher at its high school. Its heating costs haven\u2019t dropped, and it still fields the same number of sports teams and runs the same number of buses.\n\nIn Maine, the number of students enrolled in public schools goes down by hundreds every year, and the presence of charter schools has increased the competition for those students. During the 2006-07 school year there were 199,567; last year, there were 184,367, according to the Department of Education.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that the existence of charter schools in Maine is forcing public school districts to look at how they can compete in this new marketplace,\u201d Webster said. \u201cIf the public is showing that online education has value to it, then if we\u2019re going to compete, we need to offer it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "BANGOR, Maine \u2014 A week into the school year, Maine\u2019s first virtual charter school has enrolled close to 300 students, many of whom would otherwise be attending their community\u2019s traditional public schools.
