Advocates of the Affordable Care Act often framed its passage as a moral imperative for a nation with millions of uninsured citizens. Fittingly, it’s been determined that the regulations that make up Obamacare are more than eight times the size of the Gutenberg Bible.

CNS News reports on the 10,516 pages in the Federal Register that make up Obamacare regulations:

Since March 2010, when President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and its companion Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA), the administration has published in the Federal Register 109 final regulations governing how Obamacare will be implemented. These regulations add up to 10,516 pages in the Federal Register—or more than eight times as many pages as there are in the Gutenberg Bible, which has 642 two-sided leaves or 1,286 pages. … The 109 final Obamacare rules that have been published in the Federal Register so far take up 10,516 pages in the register. These pages carry an average of about 1,000 words each. So, the final Obamacare regulations published so far amount to approximately 10,516,000 words.

CNS News’s conclusion is the best approximation it could make because some pages have more words than others.
