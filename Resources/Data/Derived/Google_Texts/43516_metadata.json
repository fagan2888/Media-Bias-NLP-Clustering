Before that, she was interim CFO and consultant to Allegheny Health Network as part of Deloitte Financial Advisory Services, Laurent said.\n\nShe has more than 30 years of health care operating, financial and consulting experience, according to the network's website. Allen declined comment through Laurent.\n\nSeparately, Allegheny Health parent Highmark Health confirmed it eliminated the position held by Randy Staggers,its senior vice president of administrative services and financial operations. Spokesman Aaron Billger declined further comment.\n\nStaggers' LinkedIn page indicated that he held the position since January 2012. He could not be reached.\n\nHighmark recently disclosed an operating loss of $171 million for the first half of 2015, compared to a gain of $12 million during the same period last year. The insurer attributed the loss to higher-than-expected medical claims from people who signed up for health plans through the Affordable Care Act's online exchange. It reported a loss of $16 million for Allegheny Health Network.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Insurance Department is awaiting Highmark Health's corrective action plan for Allegheny Health Network. State officials told Highmark a preliminary plan lacked necessary details for approval. Highmark and Allegheny Health Network officials said Tuesday they'll meet all requirements in their final plan, which is due Sept. 30.\n\nBen Schmitt is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
