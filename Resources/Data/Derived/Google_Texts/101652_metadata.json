In one corner of the room, Santa Claus posed for pictures with children while others frolicked with each other.\n\nBuy Photo Clothing for men, women and children were available at the Christmas dinner and the clothing was as popular as the free meal provided.

Some stay all day,\" said Joe Rua, an organizer of the event. \"We've had some people coming for three or four years. They love the fellowship, the warm atmosphere.\"\n\nThe project was the brainchild of Gail and Michael Rua, Sr., inspired by their granddaughter: One Christmas, she simply asked what she could do to help others.\n\nThat year, they posted signs in areas with large homeless populations but only got 14 people to Manahawkin Lake Park. The next year -- the first hosted by St. Mary's -- there were more volunteers than guests, Rua said.\n\n\"After that, it just kind of blew up,\" Rua said. \"It's really beyond what we ever expected.\"\n\nThe Ruas' guests came from all different faiths and backgrounds. Some came out of economic hardship -- the toys and clothes they receive at St. Mary's are the only ones they'll receive all year. Others simply came because they didn't want to spend the holiday alone.\n\nBuy Photo Kylee Campbell, 2 of Barnegat peers out from behind her plate as she waits in line for her dinner.

Can I spend it with you?'\"\n\nFor Rua, the annual dinner -- a yearlong source of stress with a three-hour payoff -- is a welcome reminder of the \"meaning of Christmas,\" a way to find hope amid the gloom and doom.\n\n\"Sometimes, you have this dim kind of perception of what the world is,\" Rua said. \"Sometimes, the meaning of Christmas is commercialized. But then you see something like this generosity. It really moves you.\"\n\nBuy Photo Heather Tatur, Brianna Otto, 11, and Mikayla Rua, 11, all of Stafford, pick out toys from age and gender specific tables as children visit with Santa.
