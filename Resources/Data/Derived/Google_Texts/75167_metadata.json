But Judge John P. O\u2019Donnell must also decide whether prosecutors proved it was Brelo alone who killed Russell and Williams.\n\nThirteen officers fired at Russell\u2019s car that night but only Brelo was charged criminally because, prosecutors contend, Brelo fired his final rounds when Russell and Williams were alive but incapacitated and no longer a threat. Deputy coroners have testified they cannot definitively say which shots killed the pair or which officers fired them.\n\nDefense attorneys have argued that it doesn\u2019t matter, that Brelo\u2019s final shots were justified because the threat didn\u2019t end until he reached into the Malibu and removed the keys from the ignition. They\u2019ve also argued, and testimony from experts have confirmed, that Brelo was not the only officer firing during what is being referred to at trial as a second barrage of bullets that came 4 seconds after the first.\n\nThe Cleveland case recalls a July 2004 high-speed chase that began in West Memphis, Arkansas, and ended with the fatal shooting of two people inside a car in neighboring Memphis, Tennessee. Three West Memphis officers were charged with reckless homicide in the death of a female passenger described as the driver\u2019s girlfriend. She was shot once in the back of the head after her boyfriend knocked two cruisers out of his way and tried to drive off after the chase was thought to have ended. While the boyfriend was shot 17 times, prosecutors did not file charges in his death.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Facts, law in Memphis case similar to Cleveland cop shooting", "author": "Mark Gillispie", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Facts, law in Memphis case similar to Cleveland cop shooting", "title": "Facts, law in Memphis case similar to Cleveland cop shooting", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/19/facts_law_in_memphis_case_similar_to_cleveland_cop_shooting/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/cleveland-police-shooting.jpeg12-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Facts, law in Memphis case similar to Cleveland cop shooting", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/cleveland-police-shooting.jpeg12-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Facts, law in Memphis case similar to Cleveland cop shooting", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Facts, law in Memphis case similar to Cleveland cop shooting", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd424e\"", "article_summary": "But Judge John P.
