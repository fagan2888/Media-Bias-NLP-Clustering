Fox News host Bill Hemmer on Wednesday found a new reason to dislike President Barack Obama’s health care reform law: It’s offered in 150 languages.

At a briefing on Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius had noted that call centers were prepared to answer questions about the health care law in 150 languages.

Sebelius told MSNBC that the translators were necessary “to answer questions, help people understand some of the terminology.”

“There’s also a report that says there’s 150 different languages available to those who wanted to sign up!” Hemmer exclaimed following a Fox News report about glitches during the first day of Obamacare enrollment. “Where does that happen?”

“I got an idea,” the Fox News host continued. “How about English?”

“English, that would be a good start,” co-host Martha MacCallum agreed.

And Hemmer wasn’t the only Fox News host who was unable to understand the need for multiple languages.

The Five host Dana Perino tweeted that she was also having trouble wrapping her head around the concept.

“Offering Obamacare in 150 languages is absurd. If someone can’t speak enough English to fill in forms, what will they explain to a doctor?” Perino wrote.

Slate’s Matthew Yglesias pointed out that many doctors in the United States were multilingual or provided translators to their clients.

“Last but by no means least in many ways navigating health insurance forms is more complicated than explaining some basic symptons [sic] to a doctor,” he added.
