If there's a luxury we wish we had, it's definitely a menu that reads our minds. Enter: Pizza Hut.

The Washington Post reported the pizza chain has been testing special eye-tracking tablets in 300 locations in the UK since October, in which diners receive pizza reommendations based on the ingredients they stare at longest. There are 20 different ingredients and 4,896 possible combinations. Should your eyes betray you, there's also a restart button.

"Finally the indecisive orderer and the prolonged menu peruser can cut time and always get it right," a Pizza Hut spokesperson said in a statement, "so that the focus of dining can be on the most important part â€” the enjoyment of eating!"

Tobii Technology, an eye technology firm from Sweden, developed the menu for Pizza Hut using retina-scanning development and otherwise psychological research. Testing is still ongoing in the UK, but if it's a hit with diners, there may be an opportunity to expand to the United States in the future.

Even if the tablets are a bust, there's something to be said for chain restaurants keeping up with technology. David C. Novak, the CEO of Yum! Brands, who owns Pizza Hut, told The Post, "our goal is to not only catch the competition on the digital front, but to surpass it in 2015."
