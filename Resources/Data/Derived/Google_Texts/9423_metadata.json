That suggests that the average American family may be spending too much, according to a new analysis by Interest.com.\n\nThe site, a service of Bankrate.com, looked at whether families earning the median income in 25 of the country\u2019s largest metro areas could afford to pay that much.\n\nIt found that the expense of car payments and insurance would strain the median family\u2019s budget in 24 of 25 cities. Only median-income households in Washington, D.C., can afford to purchase a new car at that average sale price.\n\nTo calculate affordability, the website used the 20/4/10 rule, which assumes a down payment of at least 20 percent; financing lasting no longer than four years; and principal, interest and insurance not exceeding 10 percent of a household\u2019s gross income. (Washington fared the best because at $88,200, its median household income is the highest.)\n\nOf course, car buyers routinely make smaller down payments, take a longer-term loans, and agree to payments that take a bigger chunk out of the household budget.\n\nRelated; The Worst Cars at the 2014 Detroit Auto Show\n\n\u201cToo many families are spending way too much on new cars and trucks,\u201d Interest.com managing editor Mike Sante said in a statement. \u201cJust because you can manage the monthly payment doesn\u2019t mean you should let a $30,000 or $40,000 ride gobble up such a huge share of your paycheck.\u201d\n\nThere are also many well-reviewed new cars that cost less than the $32,000 average. Consumer Reports\u2019 list of the best new cars for less than $25,000 includes cars by Honda, Kia, Mazda, Subaru, and Toyota, among others.\n\nUsing Interest.com\u2019s affordability calculations, a $25,000 car would be affordable in Boston, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., but still out of reach for median-income families in most large cities. In Tampa, where the household income is $44,200, cars become unaffordable at $14,200.\n\nNew car prices are up nearly 2 percent year-over-year, while used car prices are down by about the same amount. Whether you\u2019re purchasing new or used, be sure to shop around for a loan; car manufacturers charge 42 percent lower interest rates on average than banks, but 10 percent higher than credit unions, found a report by WalletHub.com.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Among residents of the country\u2019s largest cities, only median-income households in Washington, D.C., can afford to purchase a new car.", "title": "Big City Car Buyers Spending More Than They Can Afford", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/12/Big-City-Car-Buyers-Spending-More-They-Can-Afford", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/01142014_Green_Cars_Detroit_8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/12/Big-City-Car-Buyers-Spending-More-They-Can-Afford", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/01142014_Green_Cars_Detroit_8.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Among residents of the country\u2019s largest cities, only median-income households in Washington, D.C., can afford to purchase a new car.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b67\"", "article_summary": "New car prices are up nearly 2 percent year-over-year, while used car prices are down by about the same amount.\nIt found that the expense of car payments and insurance would strain the median family\u2019s budget in 24 of 25 cities.\n(Washington fared the best because at $88,200, its median household income is the highest.)\nOnly median-income households in Washington, D.C., can afford to purchase a new car at that average sale price.\nThe site, a service of Bankrate.com, looked at whether families earning the median income in 25 of the country\u2019s largest metro areas could afford to pay that much."}
