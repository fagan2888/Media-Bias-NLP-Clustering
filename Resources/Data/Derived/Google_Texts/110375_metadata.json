Under the law, insurers must give subsidy-eligible enrollees who fall behind on payments a 90-day \u201cgrace period\u201d before cancelling their policies.\n\nWhile insurers must cover bills for the first 30 days, they may hold off paying those bills for the next 60 -- and ultimately, deny payment if the patient doesn't catch up on premiums. That means doctors and hospitals face the prospect of not getting paid for their services, or having to seek payment directly from their patients.\n\nThat\u2019s a big incentive for providers to help pay those premiums.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation where patients will be better off and the providers are better off as well if patients are able to maintain coverage,\u201d said Mark Rukavina, a Massachusetts-based expert on medical debt who consults for the hospital industry. \u201cBut it does raise questions.\u201d\n\nInsurers argue that if federal regulators permit such programs, they should bar hospitals from selecting participants based on their health, or from directly paying the premiums.\n\n\"If third parties provide incentives to gain coverage only once someone is sick, that will -- as the administration has warned -- clearly lead to a less healthy risk pool and put upward pressure on premiums for everyone,\u201d said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the trade group, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP).\n\nBut Gold of the New York hospital group thinks insurers\u2019 concerns are overblown. He says insurers have already calculated into their rates that a certain percentage of policyholders will be sicker than average.\n\n\u201cIf a couple of people who show up at hospitals or other providers have a premium lapse, I don\u2019t understand why someone making them whole [by paying their premiums] would skew the risk pool,\u201d he said.\n\nHospitals Try To Allay Fears\n\nTo avoid problems, hospitals are drafting selection criteria tied to income level -- and are paying consumers\u2019 premiums for an entire year, rather than simply when they lapse.\n\nIn the Wisconsin program, for example, eligible residents must live in Dane County, earn between 100 percent and 150 percent of the federal poverty level \u2013 about $11,490 to $17,235 for an individual\u2014 and enroll in a subsidized silver plan.\n\nThe program, called HealthConnect, pays the difference between the subsidy and the cost of the plan for the entire year, which could be as little as $20 to $50 a month for individuals, although it runs higher for families. Money for the program comes from the University of Wisconsin-Madison health system.\n\nIn South Florida, meanwhile, \u201cwe\u2019re not talking about making premium payments for those who enrolled, then fell behind, but only [for] first-time buyers,\u201d said Linda Quick of hospital group, which has not yet finalized its plans.\n\nThe association plans to enlist several local United Way chapters to help find and enroll eligible residents.\n\nStill, Quick acknowledges that getting the program off the ground may be difficult because of the cost to hospitals.\n\n\u201cI have a couple of systems where we\u2019re talking about half a million dollars\u201d in contributions, she said.\n\nAnd the enrollees who are helped may never need hospital care, in which case those facilities would see no return on their investment.\n\nRegulators Send Mixed Messages\n\nTo date, the administration has said insurers must accept payments toward premiums and other costs from government programs such as the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, which helps provide medical services and defrays costs for people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nBut it has been less clear about the role hospitals and other health care providers might play.\n\nLast October, a letter from the administration to Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., indicated that hospitals and drugmakers could help subsidized policyholders pay their premiums.\n\nBut that was quickly followed by a Nov. 4 online FAQ discouraging such \u201cthird party payments\u201d by hospitals and others because they could \u201cskew the risk pool.\u201d\n\nAfter protests by patient groups, another advisory said insurers could also accept premium payments from not-for-profit foundations which set financial eligibility criteria and do not consider enrollees\u2019 health status.\n\nAn interim final rule in March left out any mention of payments by charitable foundations, although it reiterated concern about payments made directly by hospitals.\n\nBoth the insurance industry and hospital groups are seeking clarification.\n\nAHIP, the insurers\u2019 trade lobby, has asked the government not to allow hospital-affiliated foundations to run aid programs. The funds \u201cmust be donated to a legally independent foundation that is separate from the organization with a potential financial interest,\u201d AHIP said.\n\nThe hospital industry, meanwhile, wants insurers to be required to accept premium payments made by health systems, as well as by their foundations.\n\n\u201cAny effort to limit the ability of hospitals or hospital-affiliated foundations to help individuals in need to obtain access to health insurance coverage is bad public policy,\u201d wrote Rich Umbdenstock, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Consumer", "description": "Low-income consumers struggling to pay their premiums may soon be able to get help from their local hospital or United Way.
