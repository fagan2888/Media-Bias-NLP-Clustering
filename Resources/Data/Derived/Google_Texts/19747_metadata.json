And that's exactly what they will be counting on in the days ahead.\n\nTheir party controls every branch of state government: the administration, Senate, Assembly and state Supreme Court. Given all that power by the voters, they have had the ability to reshape our government. They passed Act 10, right to work, tuition freezes, tax cuts, concealed carry, voter ID requirements. They replaced a liberal chief justice with a conservative one. They redrew the lines of legislative districts to virtually ensure they will stay in power for years to come.\n\nOur open records laws neither hindered nor threatened them.\n\nBut that wasn't enough. It never is.\n\nI can't overstate how important it is that we stop this assault on open government in its tracks. Even if you trust one party to do the right thing at all times, when no one is watching, remember that if these changes are approved, the other party also will be able to operate in secret, wherever and whenever they are in control. You will know less about what the County Board is up to, the Common Council, the secret deliberations of your village board and local school board.\n\nThanks to public records requests we could report on hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars being offered to a conservative propaganda and fundraising outfit masquerading as a sportsmen's group. (You stopped it cold.) We could tell you Gogebic Mining Co. poured money into Republican campaigns, and then helped rewrite state mining regulations.\n\nWe could tell you state tribes gave mightily to Democrats and then received generous gaming contracts. We could connect the dots on massive, unregulated fraud in state subsidized childcare during the last administration. That fraud didn't stop until you lit up the phones in Madison, and reforms you demanded continue to save taxpayers tens of millions of dollars every year.\n\nPlease ask yourself: Why would legislators no longer want the public to see their communications while writing new laws and regulations? Why would they want to exempt from public view a host of records created by the governor's administration, state agencies and local governments and put new limits on public access to information about dismissed criminal charges? Why would they want to give themselves a broad special legal privilege that would allow them to refrain from releasing records when they are sued, and bar current and former staff from disclosing information?\n\nWhy would they want a level of legal privilege and operational secrecy beyond what any other state in America allows?\n\nWhose interests are they seeking to serve? Yours?\n\nThese are the Republican leaders who voted Thursday to keep you in the dark about the public's business: Sen. Alberta Darling of River Hills; Rep. John Nygren of Marinette, Sen. Leah Vukmir of Wauwatosa; Rep. Dale Kooyenga of Brookfield; Sen. Sheila Harsdorf of River Falls; Sen. Howard Marklein of Spring Green; Sen. Luther Olsen of Ripon; Sen. Tom Tiffany of Hazelhurst; Rep. Mary Czaja of Irma; Rep. Dean Knudson of Hudson; Rep. Amy Loudenbeck of Clinton; and Rep. Michael Schraa of Oshkosh.\n\nFortunately, there are only 12 of them. It takes many more lawmakers to pass a bill that the governor must then sign into law.\n\nPlease call on your lawmakers to remove all changes to state open records law from the budget bill. If they want to change the records law, they should do it in an honorable way with a separate proposal that includes public notice and hearings.\n\nPlease call on Gov. Walker to veto any changes to the state open records law that remain in the budget when it arrives at his desk.\n\nPlease lend your moral support to those lawmakers and officials who publicly oppose these changes, on both sides of the aisle.\n\nOur nation's founders built checks and balances into our system of government for a reason. This is one of those times to use every lever they gave us.\n\nI began writing this column on the blessings brought to us by Independence Day, and had collected some quotes to go with it. They seem even more appropriate now:\n\n\"The liberties of people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.\" \u2014Patrick Henry\n\n\"Educate and inform the whole mass of the people... They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.\" \u2014 Thomas Jefferson\n\n\"The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.\" \u2014Alexis de Tocqueville\n\n\"Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government.\" \u2014Hugo Black\n\n\"The only security of all is in a free press. The force of public opinion cannot be resisted when permitted freely to be expressed. The agitation it produces must be submitted to. It is necessary, to keep the waters pure.\" \u2014 Thomas Jefferson\n\n\"A popular government without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.\" \u2014 James Madison\n\n\"Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair; the rest is in the hands of God.\" \u2014George Washington\n\nGeorge Stanley is the editor of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
