It was better-attended than other similar rallies in the four years since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have discretion over whether they expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, commonly called \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nDavid Jordan, executive director of Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, urged those in attendance to tell legislators they want Kansas to join the 31 states that have expanded access to the public health insurance program.\n\n\u201cToday the hard work starts,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cWe need to work collectively in every single legislative district to make sure legislators are hearing the concerns that were brought forth today.\u201d\n\nAll of the seats in the Kansas House and Senate are subject to this year\u2019s primary election in August and general election in November.\n\nThe Alliance for a Healthy Kansas was formed this year to coordinate an expansion push that so far has been splintered among several interest groups. The state\u2019s hospitals, which have lost millions in federal dollars because of the decision not to expand Medicaid, previously led the lobbying effort.\n\nJordan said his coalition plans to activate a grassroots push by focusing not only on the economic hit to hospitals but also on the 150,000 Kansans estimated to be eligible for Medicaid coverage under expansion.\n\nAs a nonprofit, the alliance cannot endorse candidates. But Jordan said the group is likely to fund letter-writing campaigns and other efforts to draw attention to Medicaid expansion as an issue for voters and candidates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we will have mailers,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nMedicaid in Kansas is a privatized program called KanCare administered by three private insurance companies. It\u2019s currently available only to pregnant women, children and people with disabilities who meet certain income limits.\n\nExpansion under the ACA would extend access to Kansans who make less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which is annual income of $16,242 for an individual and $33,465 for a family of four.\n\nRobert Schremmer, a Catholic priest and vicar general of the Dodge City Diocese, said all major religions make care for the poor one of their main tenets.\n\nHe used the parable of the Good Samaritan to illustrate his support for expansion at Monday\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cExpanding KanCare shows compassion to vulnerable people,\u201d Schremmer said.\n\nMarcillene Dover, a Wichita State University student who has told legislators about her struggle to get health care coverage to treat her multiple sclerosis, sat in the front row as Schremmer made his remarks.\n\nTwo prominent members of Topeka\u2019s medical community said during the rally that expanding Medicaid would improve health outcomes by encouraging Kansans to seek preventive care before their health problems become crises.\n\nAlice Weingartner, executive director of the Shawnee County Health Center, said 42 percent of the Kansans served by safety net clinics like hers have no insurance.\n\nEric Voth, vice president of primary care at Stormont Vail Health, said Kansans without health coverage often turn to emergency rooms for routine medical care. That\u2019s costly, he said, and causes long ER waits that compromise the safety of patients with medical emergencies.\n\nRepublican leaders who oppose Medicaid expansion have consistently said they\u2019re concerned about the cost. States eventually will shoulder 10 percent of the bill for expansion, with the federal government picking up the rest of the tab.\n\nBut Voth noted that Kansas has turned down more than $1 billion for refusing the first three years of expansion, which are fully federally funded.\n\nHe questioned whether legislators would consider turning away federal dollars in similar amounts for things like military bases and highways.\n\nVoth said the decision in Kansas has been more about the politics of a law spearheaded by a Democratic president than about fiscal conservatism.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really critical that we cast off this great hysteria of \u2018Obamacare,\u2019\u201d he said to loud applause. \u201cThere are so many elements of health care that have nothing to do with Obamacare that it\u2019s time that we embrace the things that will move us forward.\u201d\n\nAndy Marso is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.
