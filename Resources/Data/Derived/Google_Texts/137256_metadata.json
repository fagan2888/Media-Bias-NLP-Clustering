Sadly, that isn\u2019t the case for Alice Vaticano, 85. Sitting in a wheelchair, she was abandoned and forgotten by a skycap, who failed to roll her to the appropriate passenger gate at Newark Liberty International Airport. The elderly woman, who suffers from diabetes, sat there for 11 hours before anyone noticed her, the NY Daily News reported. Because of her diabetic condition, she became forgetful and unaware of her surroundings.\n\nDiabetic Distress\n\nBecause Vaticano is a diabetic her condition could easily have spun out of control due to not eating. When a diabetic fails to eat at regular intervals, her blood glucose level will plummet and this may lead to a hypoglycemic spiral. When hypoglycemia occurs, a diabetic will experience dizziness, weakness, headache, and shakiness. If Vaticano\u2019s blood glucose levels had dropped too low, she might have lost consciousness. In the very worst of such cases, a diabetic may even fall into a coma.\n\nIn Vaticano's case, her diabetic condition certainly explains her confusion and inability to help herself in the midst of busy Newark Airport. How, though, did she become helpless and lost within the busy airport in the first place? After spending time with family on the East Coast, Vaticano\u2019s misery began when her daughter drove her to Newark airport, arriving two hours ahead of time, for a flight back to Denver where she resides. Her daughter did not have permission to take Vaticano through inspection to the gate, so she asked a skycap to escort her mother, who was in a wheel chair and is considered a special needs passenger.\n\nYet, the skycap didn\u2019t perform her duty and Vaticano ended up lost like misplaced luggage. Time passed. She missed her flight home on Southwest airlines.\n\nWhen her mother didn\u2019t get off the plane in Denver, Donna Vaticano, another daughter, alerted Southwest employees. As the hours ticked by, her daughter\u2019s fears escalated. Finally, employees located Vaticano and escorted her to the passenger gate of a flight home to Denver. As a consolation prize, the airline gave her $200 in travel vouchers.\n\nSouthwest, in a statement, said skycaps are not employees of the airline. They blamed the debacle on a \u201cprocessing error\u201d occurring at check-in, where gate staff should have been alerted that a special need passenger would need assistance to board the aircraft. \u201cI want answers. What the heck happened?\u201d Vaticano\u2019s daughter told CBS News. To some, the daughter\u2019s distress may seem overly dramatic, but considering her mother's diabetic condition, her dismay is justified.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "diabetes, alice vaticano, airport", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Wheel-chair bound Alice Vaticano, 85, was abandoned by a skycap, who failed to roll the diabetic woman to the appropriate passenger gate at Newark Liberty International Airport.", "title": "Diabetic Woman In Wheelchair 'Lost' At Newark Airport", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/unclaimed-baggage-85-year-old-diabetic-woman-wheelchair-lost-newark-airport-300440", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/rtxvwng.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wheel-chair bound Alice Vaticano, 85, was abandoned by a skycap, who failed to roll the diabetic woman to the appropriate passenger gate at Newark Liberty International Airport.", "title": "Diabetic Woman In Wheelchair 'Lost' At Newark Airport", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/unclaimed-baggage-85-year-old-diabetic-woman-wheelchair-lost-newark-airport-300440", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/rtxvwng.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/rtxvwng.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-08-28T17:36:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-28T17:36:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Wheel-chair bound Alice Vaticano, 85, was abandoned by a skycap, who failed to roll the diabetic woman to the appropriate passenger gate at Newark Liberty International Airport."}, "article_summary": "To some, the daughter\u2019s distress may seem overly dramatic, but considering her mother's diabetic condition, her dismay is justified.\nBecause of her diabetic condition, she became forgetful and unaware of her surroundings.\nIn Vaticano's case, her diabetic condition certainly explains her confusion and inability to help herself in the midst of busy Newark Airport.\nDiabetic DistressBecause Vaticano is a diabetic her condition could easily have spun out of control due to not eating.\nSitting in a wheelchair, she was abandoned and forgotten by a skycap, who failed to roll her to the appropriate passenger gate at Newark Liberty International Airport."}
