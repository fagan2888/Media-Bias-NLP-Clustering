I remember enjoying them, but they didn\u2019t have a big impact on me. Archie, Betty, Veronica, Jughead and the rest of the gang are clearly part of the collective unconscious, but they\u2019ve never felt like essential reading. When I drifted away from comics for a while, books like \u201cMaus\u201d and \u201cWatchmen\u201d and \u201cDaredevil: Born Again\u201d stayed with me, but my Archies were the first to go. They felt disposable because the characters never changed. Nobody played it safer than Archie Comics.\n\nThose days are a distant memory. Archie Comics is now known for taking wild chances and daring approaches that put Marvel and DC to shame. The debut of \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d and the announcement of the batshit crossover \u201cArchie Meets Predator\u201d highlight what\u2019s been apparent for years now: The company formerly known for the squarest and most unchanging characters in comics has become one of the most adventurous and exciting publishers. From the zombie apocalypse to a forthcoming story by Lena Dunham, today\u2019s Archie Comics are anything but disposable or predictable. Improbably, anything goes in Riverdale.\n\nA brand new series\u2014\u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d\u2014is the latest evidence of Archie\u2019s willingness to take a radical new direction with an old character. Sabrina has been popular for decades, perhaps even more than Archie Andrews himself, thanks to the successful Sabrina series that aired on ABC and the WB. But Sabrina\u2019s adventures, like Archie\u2019s, have usually been fairly innocent teenage fare. Not anymore. Sabrina and her world have taken a more serious and historical turn in the new series written by Archie\u2019s Chief Creative Officer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and illustrated by Robert Hack: they bring surprising gravitas and depth to the concept of a teenage witch, giving Sabrina a backstory full of tragedy while keeping the teen shenanigans. Hack\u2019s art reminds me a little of Tula Lotay\u2019s surreal, boundary-smashing work on \u201cSupreme Blue Rose.\u201d There\u2019s a dreamy feel\u2014or maybe I should say a nightmarish feel\u2014that also fits the series\u2019 specific historical setting, starting in 1951 with Sabrina\u2019s birth. The best trick in this magic-filled book is that even in an older setting with darker horror, Sabrina is still Sabrina.\n\nThat trick was perfected in the ongoing series that inspired this new spin on Sabrina: \u201cAfterlife with Archie,\u201d which makes Riverdale\u2019s zombie contagion feel appropriately deadly while maintaining the essence of the characters. \u201cAfterlife\u201d is a genuinely moving comic and a helluva accomplishment, thanks in no small part to the moody, evocative art of Francesco Francavilla, whose visuals create a recognizable yet new Riverdale that\u2019s about as safe as the prison from \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d The critical and commercial success of \u201cAfterlife\u201d led to \u201cSabrina,\u201d much as the title of \u201cAfterlife\u201d plays on \u201cLife with Archie\u201d\u2014a series that followed two parallel versions of Archie: one who married Betty and one who married Veronica. Both universes culminated in the death of Archie earlier this year. Marriage, death, zombies, alternate universes: Archie has embraced the biggest possibilities of both real life and comic books.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Archie used to be the safest, squarest comic book franchise out there.
