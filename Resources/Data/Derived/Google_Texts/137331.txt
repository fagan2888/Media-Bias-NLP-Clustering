Blue Cross Blue Shield customers who buy individual policies under the Affordable Care Act will likely see big increases in their health insurance premiums next year, though group rates aren't expected to go up as much.

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska, the state's dominant carrier, is predicting members statewide will see average premium increase of eight to nine percent next year. But the company says some employer groups and people who have a Medicare supplement will not see their monthly rates go up and may even see them decrease.

Nearly 80 percent of the company's business in the state is in the group market. But those who bought individual policies under the Affordable Care Act could see premium increases averaging 19.5 percent.
