In fact, this has already started to happen. \u201cThe Republican Party's gonna have one of the most important, biggest mandates I can recall a party ever having,\u201d Rush Limbaugh said Monday. \u201cIt is going to have won for one reason: To stop Obama.\u201d Future Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Ted Cruz already agree on the first step: Repeal Obamacare via the reconciliation process. At Reason, Peter Suderman expressed a similar sentiment, although he explicitly rejects the idea that the election gives Republicans a mandate. \u201c[N]o matter which way the election goes, this isn't just a generalized rejection of Obama, although favorable impressions of the president recently hit a record low,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt's a rejection of Obama's policies.\u201d (Emphasis his)\n\nTo some extent, this is true. Obama is unpopular and has been a drag on Democratic candidates this year. But the Democratic Party is defending seats in deep red states and has a well-documented midterm turnout problem. How much of the Republican victory Tuesday is a rebuke of Obama\u2019s policies versus the inevitable result of those structural factors? The answer to this question will determine whether Americans are giving Republicans a mandate\u2014and it\u2019s much murkier than conservatives admit.\n\nThe midterms are largely confirming what we\u2019ve already known. Obama\u2019s approval rating has settled in the low 40s and voters disapprove of him across a wide array of issues. It\u2019s not surprising that Democrats must distance themselves from Obama\u2014and his policies\u2014in Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, and Alaska. But Republican candidates have been unable to challenge Democratic candidates in Michigan and Oregon\u2014blue states where the GOP had hopes of competing. Obama stumped for Gary Peters in Detroit a few days ago and Jeff Merkley, the Democratic incumbent in Oregon, said in October, \u201cCertainly, anytime the president would like to come to Oregon, I\u2019d love to show him around and talk to him about the issues we have here.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Republican argument for a mandate rests on competitive elections in three purple states\u2014Iowa, New Hampshire and Colorado. Conservatives may argue that this is enough to give the GOP a mandate. But these victories\u2014if they happen\u2014will all be by tight margins. In 2010, midterm races in those three states had combined 3.2 million votes. If all three Republican candidates win this year, their combined margin of victory will be a few hundred thousand votes.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "If Republicans capture the Senate majority tonight, as experts expect, conservatives will quickly try to translate those results into a governing mandate.
