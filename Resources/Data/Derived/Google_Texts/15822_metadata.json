Between soccer tournaments, shredding slushy slopes and watching the Rockies slowly implode, the Denver-based professional organizer knows that it\u2019s tough to commit a precious weekend to spring cleaning. But that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cNobody likes to file, and most people\u2019s filing systems are kind of a mess,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you really need to try to do an annual or biannual purge of your home. Put it on the calendar, get the family involved, touch everything and remember what you\u2019re using and aren\u2019t using.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be an exact science, but Dyer says that cleaning out basements, binders and filing cabinets \u2014 especially right after Tax Day \u2014 is a necessary evil. In an attempt to grease those organizational wheels, here are a few tips from Dyer and a couple local financial pros on what needs to stick around and what can finally meet the bottom of the recycling bin this spring. Manila folders not included.\n\nWhat to toss\n\nGreeting cards: Sure, 1997 may have been a great year, but do you really need to remember how many cards you received on Feb. 14? Probably not, Dyer says. \u201cIf the person is giving the sentiment, keep it. If Hallmark is, let it go.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s artwork: News flash \u2014 Johnny isn\u2019t opening an exhibition at the Denver Art Museum anytime soon. But if it\u2019s too painful for parents to let go of their angel\u2019s masterpieces, Dyer recommends having somebody else go through the works and make the decision on their behalf. \u201cIt sounds heartless, but most people would want to keep everything, so really it\u2019s more about being pragmatic,\u201d she says.\n\nCollege term papers: Getting an advanced degree is difficult. People know that, and filling a bookshelf with notes, term papers and charts from the graduating class of \u201991 does nothing but confirm what friends, family and co-workers already know: You\u2019re smart. \u201cPeople think they are going to refer back to it, but they don\u2019t,\u201d Dyer says. \u201cIf they really need that information, they\u2019ll consult a more recent book or colleague.\u201d\n\nReceipts that are illegible: Keeping receipts is almost always a good idea \u2014 particularly if you\u2019re self-employed or a small business owner. But unless receipts are stored in a climate-controlled space, chances are some of the details are long gone. \u201cUsually within two years those thermal receipts are blank \u2014 especially if they\u2019re exposed to some kind of sun or other environmental factors,\u201d says Victor Amaya, one of the founders of ClearPath Accountants in Littleton. \u201cWe tell clients to constantly save their stuff electronically.\u201d Amaya recommends the NeatReceipts portable scanner, which runs for about $180.\n\nWhat to keep\n\nAll financial documents, for at least three years: That\u2019s the minimum statute of limitations for most IRS audits, though there are some exceptions that can result in investigations dating back seven years. To err on the side of not inducing a yearlong headache, most money managers suggest holding on to hard copies of your W-2, 1099 and 1040 forms for a period that allows them to combat a worse-case scenario.\n\n\u201cWe usually tell clients to keep five-seven years of returns and any deductions they make during that time, too,\u201d Amaya says. Typically a dreaded audit dating back more than five years spawns from filing a claim for a loss on worthless-securities or bad-debt deduction, according to the IRS website, or if you\u2019re not accounting for over 25 percent of your income.\n\n(If you overtly skipped a return for a given year, or filed something blatantly fraudulent, the audit clock is unlimited. Don\u2019t do that.)\n\nFor state returns, the Colorado Department of Revenue has up to four years to pursue an audit. And heads up: Colorado was the second-most audited state in the country in 2014, according to a study of 1.4 million returns by TaxAudit.com. Yikes.\n\nProof of home improvements: Any home renovations that change the value of a property need to be documented in order to properly appraise, and tax, a house upon changing hands. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking a deduction for adding a home office, you\u2019ll want to hold on to that,\u201d says Herb White, a financial planner in Denver.\n\nHealth insurance cards: Nobody really knows how important this will be , but with about 16.4 million formerly uninsured people now enrolled in Obamacare, everybody agrees that holding on to proof of insurance is a wise move. If you purchased health insurance through the federal marketplace, the letter you receive in the mail with your form 1095-A should be sufficient proof, according to Amaya.\n\nMileage logs: Amaya recommends keeping logs for as long as you\u2019re in business, and updating miles in a Microsoft Excel document daily.\u201dThe people that get the most audits are those with side business like a Schedule C, and they always get asked for their mileage logs,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Time to take on that file purge", "title": "Time to take on that file purge", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/24/time-to-take-on-that-file-purge/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150424__20150427_C1_FE27SMCOVERp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150424__20150427_C1_FE27SMCOVERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-24T16:54:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T13:56:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Personal finance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1042\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut you really need to try to do an annual or biannual purge of your home.\n\u201cWe tell clients to constantly save their stuff electronically.\u201d Amaya recommends the NeatReceipts portable scanner, which runs for about $180.\nWhat to tossGreeting cards: Sure, 1997 may have been a great year, but do you really need to remember how many cards you received on Feb. 14?\nBut if it\u2019s too painful for parents to let go of their angel\u2019s masterpieces, Dyer recommends having somebody else go through the works and make the decision on their behalf.\n\u201cNobody likes to file, and most people\u2019s filing systems are kind of a mess,\u201d she says."}
