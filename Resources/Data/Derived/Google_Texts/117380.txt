SAN DIEGO (AP) — Lily James has transformed from a princess into a zombie slayer.

The star of “Cinderella” was at Comic-Con on Saturday to show off footage from her latest film, “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.”

The fairy-tale princess and zombie-killer have more in common than it might seem, James said.

“Both of them are so strong and independent and fierce,” she said. “And to get to play women like that is just so wonderful because it doesn’t always happen and they don’t always exist in film.”

In “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,” set for release next year, James plays Elizabeth Bennett, one of five killer zombie-slayers “who push the men aside and stride into a hoard of the undead.”

The 26-year-old actress said she enjoyed learning to fight and perform stunts for the role, adding, “I’m hoping that ‘Cinderella 2′ might have zombies in it.”
