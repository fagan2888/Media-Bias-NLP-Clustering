There's a place at Gilcrease Museum that looks like a lot of fun.\n\nThere are real animal skins on the wall, you can actually touch. Getting your hands on stuff is a big part of the children's section at Gilcrease.\n\n\"It's wonderful, the kids site is our interactive multimedia area for families and adults if they want to go in,\" said Sarah Wright, the associate curator for family and youth programs.\n\nSarah is excited about a re-designed exhibit especially for kids. There's an area that focuses on a couple of our senses. Take a whiff from the containers on a table. You might get fresh earth - or you might get something not so pleasant.\n\nYou can also make bird sounds and match 'em to the picture. Gobble gobble? Must be a turkey.\n\nThere is a lot of fun stuff to do.\n\n\"We've got a puppet stage; we've got computer games; we've got a wonderful ready nook and art activities in there,\" associate curator Sarah Wright said.\n\nThe folks at Bass Pro provided a real birch bark canoe. Kids can pretend they're paddling down the river, tracking animals as they go. All the animals they're \"tracking\" are native to Oklahoma.\n\nIf you go to the Gilcrease kids' site, you'll never be up the creek without a paddle - they appear to have plenty of them. The kids' site is open during normal museum hours.\n\nThe museum is closed Mondays and on Christmas Day, open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on other days.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "With Christmas vacation here, what do you do with the kids?
