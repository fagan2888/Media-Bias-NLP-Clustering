In an appearance on Sunday’s broadcast of Fox News Sunday, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, insisted that if it meant shutting down the government in order to defund Planned Parenthood for its “butchery,” then that would be necessary.

She pointed out congressional Democrats resist federal funding for women’s health centers that do not provide federal funding.

“I find it fascinating that Democrats will never support taxpayer funding, for example, for a women’s health center right next door to a Planned Parenthood that would provide all those same services and also provide women an alternative to abortion,” Fiorina said.

Fiorina went on to argue that the circumstances are different now than they were to prior government shutdown and not taking a stand on this calls into question the values of the Republican Party.

“Something very important has changed since the last government shutdown,” she said. “What’s changed is the Republican Party has historic majorities in the House and we now control the majority in the Senate. A lot of people worked really hard out there in the nation to make that happen. I was one of them. And I think people worked hard because they expected a change based on that majority.”

“I do think that people want to know, ‘What do we stand for? What does our party stand for? What do I stand for?'” she added.
