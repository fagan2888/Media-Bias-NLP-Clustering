She has three young boys. She pays $2,500 every month for child care. That\u2019s more than her mortgage.\n\nThis month in Northern Virginia, I met several moms and dads who told me similar stories.\n\nIn every state in the country, child care for two kids now costs more than the average rent. You read that right \u2014 child care costs more than housing. And in many states, it\u2019s even more expensive than college tuition.\n\nFor parents who need to work, this is more than an inconvenience. It\u2019s a crisis.\n\nAnd it\u2019s particularly urgent in the District, which is now the priciest child-care market in America.\n\nA recent national survey found that more than three-quarters of mothers and half of fathers say they\u2019ve had to pass up work opportunities, switch jobs or even quit working because there was no other way to pay for child care. But working fewer hours or dropping out of the workforce altogether can have long-term consequences for families\u2019 incomes.\n\nA lack of quality child care can be dangerous, too. In 2014, nine children in Virginia died in unlicensed day-care centers. Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) recently signed a bill to improve statewide safety standards, but without more federal funding, there\u2019s only so much that states can do.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to make investing in child care a national priority, especially for young parents, many of whom are trying to pay off student loans.\n\nI remember how difficult it was when Chelsea was born. I was a young lawyer in Arkansas trying to start a career. Bill was working hard all the time. We did everything we could to put our daughter first, and we had all kinds of advantages that many families didn\u2019t. Still, it was a juggling act.\n\nToday\u2019s families have it worse. Child care, college and housing costs have skyrocketed while incomes have barely budged. And workplace policies haven\u2019t changed even though families have, with women earning more of the family income than ever and men doing much more to care for kids and aging parents.\n\nMany workers don\u2019t have paid family leave. Many women don\u2019t even get a single paid day off to give birth. The pressures are so intense that some workers worry that taking an earned vacation day will be seen as slacking off.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took aim at Republican presidential front-runner and presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump's tax plan. (Reuters)\n\nIt\u2019s not supposed to be easy, but it shouldn\u2019t be this hard.\n\nAs president, I would work to make quality, affordable child care available to all families.\n\nI\u2019m committed to increasing federal investments and incentivizing states so that no family ever has to pay more than 10 percent of its income for child care. This is a big idea, and I\u2019m determined to fight for it.\n\nLet\u2019s double our investment in programs I helped develop as first lady: Early Head Start and the Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership program. These programs bring an evidenced-based curriculum to child care and make sure kids get the best possible start in life, no matter how much money their families have.\n\nLet\u2019s lighten the burden on the one-quarter of college students who are parents by providing scholarships of up to $1,500 per year for child care.\n\nAnd because none of this would be possible without talented and hardworking child-care professionals, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re paying them a decent wage, too.\n\nIn addition to affordable child care, working parents deserve the security of knowing they won\u2019t lose income \u2014 or their jobs \u2014 for taking care of themselves or a loved one. One dad in Virginia told me that to stay home for his newborn\u2019s early days, he had to cobble together sick days and vacation days. Many people can\u2019t do even that.\n\nIt\u2019s time we stopped being the only advanced economy in the world that doesn\u2019t offer workers paid family leave. That\u2019s why I strongly support the paid family leave proposal the D.C. Council is pursuing. We should encourage states and local communities to take action as long as Congress refuses to act.\n\nUnder my plan, working Americans would earn up to seven days of paid sick leave each year. They would be guaranteed up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave to care for a new baby or sick family member or to recover from an illness or injury. And we can fully fund this program by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share of taxes.\n\nIt\u2019s all too easy for \u201ckitchen table issues\u201d such as these to get overlooked in our politics. But they matter to families. They matter to kids. And they\u2019ve been the work of my life.\n\nSo until America\u2019s moms and dads can sleep a little easier, I\u2019m going to keep bringing them up.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "hillary clinton, child care, child care costs, early chidlhood education, preschool, children, families, paid leave, paid family leave, dc paid leave bill", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "We\u2019ve got to make investing in child care a national priority.", "title": "Hillary Clinton: Child care now costs more than rent.
