Friends and family gathered in Kemper Co. Saturday in remembrance of a loved one who died in battle.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, and the local VFW chapter has chosen to pay a special tribute to Leon Hamner who died in action in 1968 in Punam Province, South Vietnam. The event included several prayers, guest speakers and a special three rifle volley.

"People are very solemn in remembering Leon. Today there was lots of his brothers and sisters that were here, his family, and people that graduated with Leon from high school, and they remember him fondly,‚Äù Junior Vice Commander Dennis Hopper says.

Members of the VFW say they feel events like these help shine a more positive light on what was once a controversial topic.
