Consumers are advised to stop using the lamp immediately and contact IKEA for a free repair kit.\n\nThe recall involves all products in the SMILA wall-mounted lamps. The UCSC said in an advisory released last week that at least two reports have indicated a strangulation hazard. \u201cA 16-month-old child in a crib died after getting entangled in the lamp\u2019s cord. In a separate incident, a 15-month-old child in a crib became entangled in the lamp\u2019s cord and nearly strangled,\u201d the agency wrote. \u201cIn both incidents, which occurred in Europe, the lamp cord was pulled into the crib by the infants.\u201d\n\nThe SMILA series was sold exclusively at IKEA stores, in IKEA\u2019s catalogue, and online between July 1999 and May 2013. The series features eight different designs: a blue star, a yellow moon, a pink flower, a white flower, a red heart, a green bug, a blue seashell, and an orange seahorse. Additional details can be found on the CPSC\u2019s website.\n\nIn a news release, IKEA apologized for the incidents and asked consumers to contact their customer service for a free repair kit. \u201cCustomers are asked to contact customer service at (888) 966-4532 to receive a repair kit free of charge,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cThe repair kit contains safety instructions and self-adhesive fasteners for attaching the lamp cord to the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cIKEA reminds customers that any corded product such as a window covering or a blind can present a strangulation hazard,\u201d they added. \u201cAccessible cords should always be kept out of reach of young children.\u201d\n\nThe CPSC estimates that 4 million units have been sold in the U.S. and Canada. A total of 23 million have been sold worldwide.
