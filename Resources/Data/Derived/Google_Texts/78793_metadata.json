As I held the real Bwa Bwa aloft, attempting to capture his inscrutable expression in butter icing, I asked myself how it was that yet again, my life had been taken over by fairy bread, musical chairs, and the Mission Impossible equivalent of cake-making.\n\nHosting a child's party is a bit like being cast into Dante's Inferno for 2\u00bd hours, but with the tormenting duties being handled by sugared-up littlies instead of demons. Each time I have to organise one, I'm haunted by the fear that it could end up like the infamous shindig of 2012, where one of the more \"lively\" boys started whacking the guests with the pinata stick, our pass-the-parcel was one layer short, leaving a single child prize-less and weeping, and most of the guests came down with gastro, conveniently blamed on a bug that was going around, but more likely caused by the cheap, poorly thawed party pies I served.\n\nMany of the ills of modern society are perpetuated by these events. Party games have been perverted by the fact that every child must now be a winner, robbing them of a chance to learn resilience. The obscene amounts of sugar they gorge act as a gateway to a lifetime of obesity and diabetes. And the amount of money we throw at their birthdays, pandering to our little darlings' every desire, ensures that we are breeding a generation of entitled brats.\n\nOf course, the day after the party, when my child declares the event to have been the best party ever, I quickly forget the pain. Yet even then, there's one aspect of the festivities that continues to haunt me, cutting through the post-party glow. It's the amount of junk and waste that the event has generated, including several wheelie bins' worth of packaging and wrapping, and a house scattered with the cheap plastic trinkets that we stuffed into their party bags and handed out as prizes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI promised myself I wouldn't use disposable plastic junk this year, because I know that it inevitably ends up as landfill. Then, in the last minute rush to arrange everything, I caved in and bought a bunch of luminous headbands, crappy necklaces, plastic flutes, and little containers of bubble mixture. All of which was used for about 40 seconds before it either broke, or was discarded.\n\nOf course I could have used lollies as prizes, and stuffed the party bags with sugar too, but the parents would hate me for it. If I go to the other extreme, and give out carrot sticks and carob, then the children would hate me, and declare the party lame. And there is a limit to how much resilience I want to teach my kids.\n\nDisposable crap isn't unique to kids' parties. During the festive season, our lives are awash with landfill: the wrapping and packaging, the cheap decorations, the reindeer antlers you wore to your office Christmas party, and the luminous bands sold at fireworks displays on New Year's Eve \u2013 each item seemingly small and inconsequential, but with collectively profound consequences for our planet.\n\nThe irony in all this is that this supposedly disposable rubbish isn't going away for a long, long time. Instead, it travels into our waterways and fills our tips, slowly choking the sea, infecting our food chain, and polluting our soil.\n\nYet we've become so accustomed to disposable junk, that doing away with it seems impossible. We may resolve to make a change, to wrap our presents in newspaper, or refuse a plastic lid on our take-away coffee, but in the end it all becomes a bit too hard, and we slip back into our bad, but convenient ways.\n\nI was going to end my column on that depressing note, arguing that ultimately, our planet may be destroyed by a billion small acts of apathy. Then my daughter came home from a classmate's birthday party, without any lollies or plastic junk. Instead, she was carrying a small clay pot, a little bag of soil, and a sachet of seeds, with instructions on how to grow a plant. Where I'd lazily planted trinkets, seeds of our planet's extinction, someone else had handed out a present that could be nurtured and grown. And my daughter loved it. All it took was some imagination, and a little effort.\n\nTwitter: @monicadux", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Entertainment", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "The presents have been unwrapped and the plastic is mostly broken.
