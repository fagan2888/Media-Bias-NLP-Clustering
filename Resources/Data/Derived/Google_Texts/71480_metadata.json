Nau\n\nPrinceton University Press, $35, 329 pages\n\nAfter a full century\u2019s steady string of wars, each related to the others as in a continuing narrative, one political scientist has undertaken to categorize them and their warrior practitioners.\n\nThe few who pay attention will ask \u201cWho cares? War is war. Does any one of them require a methodology niche?\u201d\n\nLeave it to a political-science professor (one from George Washington University) to sort it out in \u201cConservative Internationalism: Armed Diplomacy Under Jefferson, Polk, Truman, and Reagan.\u201d\n\nThough Henry R. Nau may not end up advancing his own foreign-policy dictionary far beyond academia, he has presented a useful reference work for researchers attempting to determine what inspires U.S. presidents to go to war and what dissuades them.\n\nOf the several designations that Mr. Nau analyzes, \u201cconservative internationalism,\u201d which aims at a decentralized world of democratic civil societies, is linked to the foreign-policy approaches of four presidents.\n\nFurther, when Mr. Nau gets into history, his book takes off like a rocket ship.\n\nThomas Jefferson, our third president and also the first \u201cconservative internationalist\u201d (as defined by the author) understood the importance of \u201cprinciple.\u201d Without it, he argued, no use of armaments and war was either credible or effective. Add to that Jefferson\u2019s expansionist zeal that world freedom \u201cwould grow\u201d not only by defending, \u201cbut spreading liberty.\u201d\n\nToo much foreign intervention against a republican government, he was convinced, would be a \u201cplayground for despots, and reinforce domestic tyranny.\u201d\n\nHad Jefferson not consistently leaned toward the export of freedom, according to Mr. Nau, \u201cit is doubtful that he would have sat at the table with French revolutionaries in Paris to design a charter of rights [including freedom of the press] or maneuvered so patiently\u201d [to close the deal on the Louisiana Purchase] which \u201cdoubled the domain of American freedom,\u201d the crown jewel in Jefferson\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cJames K. Polk was without question one of the most ambitious and successful presidents in American history,\u201d declares Mr. Nau.\n\nIndeed, here is a man who not only had a plan to advance the young nation that elected him, but President Polk made himself a lame duck by announcing his intent to serve only one term. In those four years, his \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d was underway as he pushed the U.S. boundaries westward, and thus cemented the destiny that would increase these United States of America from coast to coast, truly a power to be reckoned with in the world.\n\nThe highly pivotal presidency of Polk, arguably worthy of more credit than some historians have chosen to accord him, has been criticized for in some instances using military force when diplomacy would have sufficed. This included such forays as the annexation of Texas, a war with Mexico and a conflict with the British over Oregon.\n\nHarry S. Truman\u2019s time in office, from the end of World War II and well into the Cold War, was notable in part for his having to clean up the negative fallout from the altogether too trusting relationship between his predecessor, Franklin Roosevelt, and Soviet leader Josef Stalin. The latter was finally recognized as no less power-mad than Adolf Hitler.\n\nTruman\u2019s diplomacy was of the blunt variety. When he confronted Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov about Russia\u2019s failure to keep promises on Polish freedom or lack thereof, the Soviet official said he had never been talked to like that in his life. To which Truman responded, \u201cCarry out your agreements, and you won\u2019t get talked to like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man from Missouri\u201d built up our military despite a war-weary America, although his Korean \u201cpolice action\u201d was less popular than was Truman\u2019s forbidding obsession against Soviet expansionism.\n\nThe stormy domestic political flare-ups over communist infiltration at home and the communist takeover of China from our wartime pro-Western Chinese ally (both on Truman\u2019s watch) rate barely a mention by Mr. Nau. He does credit Truman with creating NATO and preventing Western Europe from going communist.\n\nRonald Reagan was easily the most transformative president since FDR.\n\nHe was totally different from his recent predecessors who had either tried to build on FDR\u2019s New Deal (Lyndon Johnson) or, in a defensive crouch agreed to live with it (Dwight Eisenhower).\n\nThe author writes that Reagan, who entered office secretly intending to bring down the Soviet Union without firing a shot, was enabled in that endeavor by a strengthened military and robust economy.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Reagan approach compares with two of the other foreign-policy methods defined by Mr. Nau: \u201cRealism\u201d and \u201cliberal internationalism\u201d favor \u201cbalance of power\u201d while Reagan\u2019s \u201cconservative internationalism\u201d seeks out competition of ideas. For Reagan, \u201cmoral equivalence\u201d and \u201cpeaceful coexistence\u201d are out; tilting the balance of power toward freedom is in.\n\nThe Gipper himself probably said it best: \u201cHere\u2019s our foreign policy: We win. They lose.\u201d\n\nWes Vernon\u2019s decades-long broadcast career ended after completing 25 years with CBS Radio.
