By one stroke of the presidential pen, the tide of history has risen, never to recede again.\n\nHow many times has the press greeted a decision by President Obama with this breathless cry? It happened again last week when he reversed nearly 50 years of U.S. policy toward communist Cuba.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama hails \u2018new chapter\u2019 in diplomatic relations with Cuba\n\nColumnist Eugene Robinson called the move a \u201chistoric opening.\u201d But he and others should hold their applause until something positive happens in Cuba. For a presidential act to be truly historic, something besides U.S. policy has to change.\n\nCase in point: Last year\u2019s announcement that the U.S. would once again engage in direct nuclear talks with Iran met with great fanfare. George Stephanopoulos eagerly opened ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Nov. 24, 2013, with: \u201cBreaking overnight an historic deal a landmark path to freeze Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d Yet there is still no breakthrough. The talks have been extended again so negotiators can keep talking. Meanwhile Iran continues to process nuclear fuel and is closer to acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\nThat\u2019s not historic. It\u2019s just more of the same.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama climate change deal with China a stretch, analysts say\n\nThen there\u2019s the 2013 deal with Russia on Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. When announced, you\u2019d have thought we\u2019d reached a new Promised Land of arms control. CNN\u2019s story led with this: \u201cRussia and the United States, in their third day of talks in Switzerland, said Saturday they have reached a groundbreaking deal on a framework to eliminate Syria\u2019s chemical weapons.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Syria wound up getting rid of some old chemical stocks it apparently could spare. But the deal did nothing to stop the carnage in Syria. The Huffington Post recently reported that at least 67,000 people have perished in Syria this year. What appeared to be a historic breakthrough merely enabled Mr. Obama to climb down from his threat of bombing Syria.\n\nWhat about Mr. Obama\u2019s promise to eliminate all nuclear weapons? On his first overseas trip just weeks after taking office, that\u2019s what he pledged to do. After developing his famous \u201cglobal zero\u201d policy on nuclear weapons, in 2010 he signed the New START treaty with Russia to reduce nuclear arsenals. As if on cue, the press\u2019s history-making machinery clicked into gear. Mr. Stephanopoulos and his \u201cGood Morning America\u201d co-host, Robin Roberts, called it \u201clandmark\u201d and \u201chistoric.\u201d The \u201cToday\u201d show\u2019s Meredith Vieira and Matt Lauer hailed the \u201clandmark treaty\u201d as \u201ca major move in [Obama\u2019s] push for a nuclear-free world.\u201d\n\nWhat has happened since? The U.S. has indeed reduced the size of its nuclear arsenal, but Russia has modernized and grown its own. Moscow has openly violated the Reagan-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force agreement. And despite U.N. sanctions, North Korea, already a nuclear power, has conducted two additional nuclear tests and successfully launched a long-range ballistic missile. The world is still very far away from Mr. Obama\u2019s \u2014 and Mr. Lauer\u2019s \u2014 dream of a nuclear-free world.\n\nPerhaps the best example of historical hype is the colossal failure of Mr. Obama\u2019s 2009 \u201creset\u201d policy with Russia, unveiled by Hillary Rodham Clinton with a mislabeled big red button. Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine. The \u201creset\u201d has quietly slipped into the memory hole the administration and the press reserve for the policy failures they had once welcomed as a World Historical Event.\n\nSomething larger than sycophancy is going on. The president came to Washington with a grand progressive vision of transforming America and the world. Every clack of the historical gear moved in a progressive ideological direction, regardless of the actual outcome, and thus was deemed \u201chistoric\u201d before anything had actually happened.\n\nThe problem is this: Mr. Obama keeps knocking on history\u2019s door but no one is answering. All the frontloaded credit he gets for his \u201cbold\u201d decisions covers up the fact that little or no positive change happens. If anything, we are slipping backwards.\n\nThat is not the \u201chistory\u201d \u2014 excuse me, the \u201cchange\u201d \u2014 Americans had hoped for.\n\n\u2022 A former assistant secretary of state, Kim R.
