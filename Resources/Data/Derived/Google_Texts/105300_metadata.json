Occasionally, they\u2019re used as a foil on conservative cable news shows, where overpaid hosts sneer derisively at their endemic \u201claziness.\u201d Sometimes, members of Congress will trot them out as straw men to drum up support in rural districts.\n\nThese are not your struggling baristas with their undergraduate degrees and mountains of debt, or your former-newsmen- turned-retail-drones . They\u2019re not \u201covereducated and underemployed.\u201d No, this demographic group, the undereducated and underemployed, are in far more dire straits. This subset of millennials might not look like the \u201cGen Y\u201d that\u2019s commonly portrayed in the media \u2014 this site included. They aren\u2019t the duck-faced \u201cRich Kids of Instagram,\u201d the Lena Dunhams or the Mark Zuckerbergs that we use as generational stand-ins (rather than, say, wealthy and successful millennials LeBron James and Kendrick Lamar).\n\nThese millennials \u2014 young, undereducated, poor and, all too often, minorities \u2014 exist in a state of permanent crisis, victims of a new economic disenfranchisement that took root in the Great Recession and, in the years since, has stubbornly remained. We\u2019re only now beginning to grasp its full scope \u2014 and its potential implications for our nation\u2019s future.\n\nA recent Pew Research study, \u201cThe Rising Cost of Not Going to College,\u201d has made some of the more troubling realities that these kids face exceptionally clear: As an increasingly large share of young Americans earn degrees from institutions of higher learning, the remaining millennials are getting left further and further behind. Americans aged 25-32 without any time at college earn $17,500 less per year than their college-educated peers.\n\nAlternatively, by looking at the recent employment figures of people aged 16-24, the Brookings Institution has cast a light upon the tenuous fates of the undereducated underemployed, a group still experiencing levels of unemployment and underemployment that haven\u2019t existed in this country since the Second World War. The study focuses on \u201clabor force underutilization,\u201d a measure that attempts to quantify underemployment by grouping the \u201cofficially\u201d unemployed with those who desire employment (but have stopped actively looking) and those who are working part-time (but would prefer more hours).\n\nYouth unemployment historically tracks at twice the national average, regardless of the economy\u2019s health. While 7 percent unemployment is certainly a national crisis, it also augurs an even bigger issue \u2014 a staggeringly high underemployment rate for young Americans. Seven years past the recession, the youth underutilization rate remains stubbornly high: above 40 percent for 16-19-year-olds, and nearly 30 percent for millennials aged 20-24.\n\nPut more plainly, none have it worse than undereducated millennials. Among this group, almost half are either unemployed, have given up on the labor market entirely, or been forced to work low-wage, part-time gigs:\n\n(Credit: Brookings Institution)\n\nIf America could reduce unemployment from 7 percent (roughly where it stands now) to 5 percent (slightly below the historic average), we could immediately bring youth underemployment back to pre-recession levels, delivering hundreds of thousands of millennials from endemic poverty and spiraling, self-perpetuating joblessness.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's an entire generation in dire trouble -- poor, young, undereducated.
