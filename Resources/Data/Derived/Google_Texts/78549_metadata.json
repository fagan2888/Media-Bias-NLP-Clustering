The people of this community depended on it.\u201d\n\nThree years after Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s administration began bolstering rural hospitals with millions more dollars, three of them, including Southern Palmetto, have closed in 10 months.\n\nMarlboro Park Hospital in Bennettsville shut down in May. Williamsburg County Hospital was forced to close in October due to building damage caused by rain. And, after 60 years in Barnwell County, staff at Southern Palmetto Hospital treated patients for the final time in January.\n\n\u201cIt scared me,\u201d said Amber Cornett, who works at Common Grounds coffee shop in town. \u201cI have two young children. If something happens to them, what am I supposed to do? ... They could die in transit to another hospital.\u201d\n\nTransformation Fund\n\nThese closures and the problems they present aren\u2019t unique to South Carolina. The North Carolina Rural Health Research Program reports 71 rural hospitals have closed across the country since 2010 as patients move to bigger cities or seek treatment outside small towns at larger medical centers. The smartest health care minds haven\u2019t figured out how to keep these facilities open or even agreed if some rural communities justify full-fledged hospitals.\n\nOne of Haley\u2019s solutions \u2014 a $40 million hospital \u201cTransformation Fund\u201d \u2014 will expire this summer. S.C. Medicaid Director Christian Soura said he will not ask the Legislature to renew the program, which was meant to encourage larger hospitals to forge partnerships with the smaller, struggling facilities. To date, only $8 million of the $40 million has been spent.\n\n\u201cI suspect right now we won\u2019t get all the way to $40 (million),\u201d Soura said.\n\nThe Legislature also has approved for several years a multi-million dollar program that allows Soura\u2019s agency to reimburse rural hospitals for almost all the uncompensated care that they give away for free to uninsured patients. But that financial cushion hasn\u2019t ensured the rural hospitals\u2019 survival either \u2014 a problem made clear by three back-to-back closures.\n\n\u201cThose three happened to hit in this particular time frame, but it\u2019s part of a larger trend we\u2019ve seen across the country,\u201d Soura said. \u201cCertainly we\u2019re concerned about it.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem in Barnwell, he pointed out, was that patients there weren\u2019t using Southern Palmetto even before the hospital closed.\n\n\u201cThey were voting with their feet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get people who lived there to go there.\u201d\n\nApproximately 95 percent of Barnwell patients covered by private health insurance plans passed over the local hospital, he said, for out-of-town care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to make the math work at that point.\u201d\n\nHaley\u2019s office directed all questions for this article to Soura\u2019s agency.\n\n\u2018Ongoing viability\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Graham Adams, executive director of the S.C. Office of Rural Health, is worried that more rural hospitals will close.\n\n\u201cThere are still some hospitals that are very concerned about their ongoing viability,\u201d Adams said.\n\nApproximately 60 hospitals operate in South Carolina. Roughly one-third of them are designated rural by the state Medicaid agency.\n\n\u201cI think that the state needs to continue to work with smaller rural communities to figure out how to best meet the needs at the local level and to do everything we can to prevent the hospital from closing,\u201d Adams said. \u201cBut if it does close, that\u2019s where the state can be helpful.\u201d\n\nConservative state leaders, including Haley, have pushed back against the federal Affordable Care Act, most notably by declining billions of federal dollars that could have been used to expand eligibility for the low-income Medicaid program in the Palmetto State.\n\nMost adults without dependent children do not qualify for Medicaid in this state, even if they fall below the poverty line.\n\nMedicaid expansion would extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 224,000 South Carolinians.\n\n\u201cIf that gets some traction, it would solve a lot of our state\u2019s problems,\u201d Adams said.\n\nUrgent care option\n\nEven though Williamsburg County Hospital in Kingstree closed due to water damage, the facility laid off a \u201clarge portion\u201d of its staff this month. The decision was \u201cextremely difficult, but necessary because of a lack of insurance funds,\u201d an announcement on the hospital\u2019s website explained.\n\nWilliamsburg County Hospital hopes to open a \u201ctemporary modular hospital\u201d soon. For now, only a mobile emergency room exists on site.\n\nConnie Dozier, who owns a bakery next door to the hospital, said an ER alone isn\u2019t sufficient.\n\n\u201cI really honestly feel that we need a full medical building \u2014 not just the emergency room,\u201d Dozier said. \u201cWe have so many elderly people in the area who may not be able to travel to other locations to get medical attention.\u201d\n\nBut patient care isn\u2019t the only casualty in Kingstree. Dozier\u2019s bakery business has suffered, too, since the hospital closed.\n\nHospital employees used to call in lunch orders or stop by in the afternoon for a slice of cake.\n\n\u201cWe have definitely seen a decline in that since they have closed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hope it will come back.\u201d\n\nIn Barnwell, the Bradford pear trees are blooming outside Southern Palmetto Hospital and the American flag still flies on the pole out front, but no one there expects the facility to reopen. The People-Sentinel in Barnwell reported earlier this month that a health clinic will consider opening an urgent care center in town.\n\n\u201cThat would be awesome,\u201d said Cornett, who works at the coffee shop in Barnwell.\n\nOtherwise, she said she would drive her children an hour each way to Aiken for medical care, if necessary.\n\n\u2018A huge loss\u2019\n\nRural hospitals not only provide emergency health care to residents in small towns. They also employ a lot of people.\n\nWhen Bamberg County Hospital closed in 2012, the county changed, said Bakari Sellers, an attorney and former state lawmaker.\n\n\u201cWe lost so many jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about people who are making $7.50 an hour. We\u2019re talking about skilled labor.\u201d\n\nThose professionals leave a county when a rural hospital closes, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people completely understand. ... If you have a heart attack now (in Bamberg), you die,\u201d he said. \u201cThese hospitals are the lifeblood of many of these small communities.\u201d\n\nBlack said his county has changed since the hospital closed, too.\n\nThe police chief must now pay his officers overtime because it takes them longer to drive to hospitals in Allendale or Aiken to interview crime victims.\n\nPrimary care patients have felt the impact, too, he said.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that most people don\u2019t know \u2014 I didn\u2019t even know \u2014 when the hospital left, the hospital had the only X-ray machine in Barnwell,\u201d he said. Local doctors in town would send patients to the hospital for routine X-rays. That\u2019s impossible now.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge loss,\u201d Black said. \u201cNow they\u2019ve got to send you to Aiken, Allendale, Orangeburg, somewhere else.\u201d\n\nBlack said that residents in big cities must have a hard time imagining the inconvenience of a two-hour round trip for a simple X-ray.\n\n\u201cCharleston is like Greenville \u2014 there\u2019s a hospital on every corner it seems,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at 843-937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Barnwell and other small towns face new reality after rural hospitals close, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Barnwell County,Christian Soura,hospital,Medicaid expansion,Nikki Haley,rural communities", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Barnwell \u2014 Police Chief Reuben Black found out that Southern Palmetto Hospital was shutting down in January just like most people in this small town did \u2014 on Facebook.", "title": "Barnwell and other small towns face new reality after rural hospitals close", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20160319/160329979/barnwell-and-other-small-towns-face-new-reality-after-rural-hospitals-close", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160319/PC16/160329979/AR/0/AR-160329979.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160319/PC16/160329979/AR/0/AR-160329979.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Barnwell \u2014 Police Chief Reuben Black found out that Southern Palmetto Hospital was shutting down in January just like most people in this small town did \u2014 on Facebook.", "title": "Barnwell and other small towns face new reality after rural hospitals close", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160319/PC16/160329979/AR/0/AR-160329979.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 160329979}}, "keywords": "Barnwell and other small towns face new reality after rural hospitals close , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Barnwell County,Christian Soura,hospital,Medicaid expansion,Nikki Haley,rural communities", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T11:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2016-03-18T18:36:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Barnwell \u2014 Police Chief Reuben Black found out that Southern Palmetto Hospital was shutting down in January just like most people in this small town did \u2014 on Facebook."}, "article_summary": "\u2018Ongoing viability\u2019Meanwhile, Graham Adams, executive director of the S.C.
