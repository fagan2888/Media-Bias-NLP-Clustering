He was also Chief of Wichita police for the day; that act was made possible by the Make-A-Wish foundation.\n\n\"It's a dream come true,\" said Chris Hecox, father of Junior Hecox.\n\nThe recruit class for the Wichita Police Department gave Hecox an electric toy car as a present after the parade. The toy car was altered to look like a Dodge Charger police car.\n\n\"Woah! I got a car,\" Hecox said when the present was revealed.\n\n\"He always has a smile on his face... you can tell it made him happy. He loves it,\" said Recruit Officer Jason Halloran of the Wichita Police Department recruit class.\n\nIn addition to the parade, over 100 bike helmets were given to children at the parade.\n\nOfficers say their goal is to cut down on head injuries children sustain while riding their bikes.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The second annual Support Local Law Enforcement parade gave onlookers and one child a special day", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "The second annual Support Local Law Enforcement parade gave onlookers and one child a special day", "title": "Law enforcement support parade ends with surprise for young boy", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Law-Enforcement-support-parade-ends-with-surprise-for-sick-child-376855121.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/3FC/D68/3FCD6877CB594BD29E86A19CEEBE84A6", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/538/B48/538B489F2BC745FC848D97DFE795362B.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The second annual Support Local Law Enforcement parade gave onlookers and one child a special day", "title": "Law enforcement support parade ends with surprise for young boy", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Law-Enforcement-support-parade-ends-with-surprise-for-sick-child-376855121.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/LEO+Parade+Surprise.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Law enforcement support parade ends with surprise for young boy", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Law enforcement support parade ends, with surprise for young boy"}, "article_summary": "The second annual Support Local Law Enforcement parade gave onlookers and one child a special day.\nThe toy car was altered to look like a Dodge Charger police car.\nThe recruit class for the Wichita Police Department gave Hecox an electric toy car as a present after the parade.\nIn addition to the parade, over 100 bike helmets were given to children at the parade.\nI got a car,\" Hecox said when the present was revealed."}
