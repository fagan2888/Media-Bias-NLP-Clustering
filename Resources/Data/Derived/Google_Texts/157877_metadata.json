More on those in a moment.\n\nDuring their debate Thursday night, the Republican presidential aspirants took their obligatory shots at Obamacare. Ted Cruz tipped his hat to the \"the single moms who are working two and three jobs, 28, 29 hours a week because their hours have been forcibly reduced because of Obamacare,\" which he called \"the biggest job-killer in America.\" He promised to \"repeal every word,\" a pledge echoed by Marco Rubio.\n\n20 million uninsured adults have gained health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act as of early 2016. \u2014 Department of Health and Human Services\n\nEarlier in the day, Donald Trump released his own healthcare plan, taking a swipe at \"the incredible economic burden\" of the Affordable Care Act. His proposal turned out to be largely a rehash of Republican shibboleths such as allowing the sale of policies across state lines, elimination of the individual mandate, and expansion of health savings accounts, the tax benefits of which flow disproportionately to the rich.

The trend includes every ethnic group and both genders; for whites and non-Hispanic blacks, the reduction in the uninsured rate exceeds 50%, and for Hispanics the rate has come down from 41.8% to 30.5%.\n\nWhat about the employment effect cited by Cruz? It's not visible in the real numbers. Since the Affordable Care Act was signed on March 23, 2010, full-time employment growth has been strong and the number of people employed part-time for economic reasons has consistently fallen.\n\njobs Federal Reserve of St. Louis Since 2010, the U.S. has experienced an almost unbroken string of months with job growth.
