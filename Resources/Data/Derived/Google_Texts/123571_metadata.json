Cadmus Community Corp., of Richmond, Virginia, requires employees and their spouses to submit to health-risk assessments to obtain health insurance.\n\nAt Iowa-based Principal Financial Group Inc., workers have access to health screening programs, which are optional -- but employees who participate receive a discount.\n\nSeveral federal courts have declared the mandatory health screenings perfectly legal.\n\nIn a 2015 case filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of an employee of a Wisconsin company who refused the health screenings, the government argued the employer\u2019s wellness program didn't comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, which limits companies from requiring medical exams or personal health information from workers.\n\nEssential Elements of Well-Being Purpose: liking what you do each day and being motivated to achieve your goals\n\nliking what you do each day and being motivated to achieve your goals Social: having supportive relationships and love in your life\n\nhaving supportive relationships and love in your life Financial: managing your economic life to reduce stress and increase security\n\nmanaging your economic life to reduce stress and increase security Community: liking where you live, feeling safe, and having pride in your community\n\nliking where you live, feeling safe, and having pride in your community Physical: having good health and enough energy to get things done daily Source: Gallup-Healthways\n\nDenying employer-sponsored coverage if screenings aren\u2019t completed by the employee crosses the line from voluntary to coercive, the EEOC contended in court.\n\nA federal judge in Madison, Wisconsin, disagreed, ruling on Dec. 31 that employers can deny coverage without violating the ADA, as long as the data collected from the wellness program is used for the purposes of overall health coverage. This follows on the heels of a 2012 case, in which a federal appeals court in Atlanta found in favor of an employer as well, using the same reasoning about the ADA to affirm a lower court ruling.\n\nA legal precedent is being created. As Christopher Kuczynski of the EEOC told npr.org, \"Limited incentives are permissible \u2026 as long as the maximum incentive for participating doesn\u2019t exceed 30 percent of the total cost of coverage.\"\n\n\"Incentive\" must be in air quotes, because these policies are not incentivizing but penalizing.\n\nEmployees should be able to choose whether they participate in health programs, but their health care coverage should not be dependent on it. The nature of one\u2019s health is personal and private, and should be kept entirely separate from the workplace.\n\nYet in some companies, it\u2019s either participate in the medical screenings that the company provides, or move to a more expensive government health care set-up.\n\nDo wellness programs even work?\n\nAbout 60 percent of U.S. companies now offer some kind of wellness initiative, up from just 36 percent in 2009, according to the Rand Corp. Implementing such programs has grown into a $6-billion-a-year industry, according to study results released in 2014 by Rand, which tracked PepsiCo\u2019s employee wellness program for six years.\n\nThe Rand study results were mixed, with benefits seen in chronic illnesses but not in health maintenance. The study found that helping employees manage chronic illnesses saved $3.78 in medical costs for every dollar PepsiCo invested in the effort. This disease management \u2014 cutting the number and length of hospital stays \u2014 accounted for about 87 percent of PepsiCo\u2019s total cost savings. Still, only about 13 percent of employees participated.\n\nAmong the far larger number of PepsiCo employees who were healthy and trying to maintain that through diet and exercise, the results were less impressive.\n\nRelated Content MomZette Why We\u2019re So Cold at Work In a nutshell, it's about body heat\n\n\"The lifestyle-management component of the program \u2014 while delivering benefits \u2014 did not provide more savings than it cost to offer,\" said Soeren Mattke, the Rand senior scientist who led the study, Rand.org reported.\n\nWith these unimpressive results for the average healthy person, why the push to infringe on employee rights?\n\n\"You're seeing a real tension to basically 'incent' people to live healthier lives so that they can use insurance less, and lose less days at work, and be more productive,\" Paul Secunda, a professor of law at Marquette University who specializes in labor and benefits law, told Bloombergnews.com. \"On the other hand, there's the medical privacy concerns of individuals.\"\n\n\"My employer wouldn\u2019t like to hear this, but I would not participate in any sort of 'medical data collecting' through any wellness program they offered, because I don\u2019t know who has access to it, and how they might use it against me,\" said one New York telecommunications professional. \"What if they said, \u2018Oh, he has high blood pressure, so we can\u2019t give him that big project?\u2019 That is my health business to handle with my own doctor.\"\n\n\"This is an almost laughable example of why big government doesn\u2019t work,\" Amy Ridenour, chairman of The National Center for Public Policy Research, told LifeZette. \"On the one hand, Obamacare pushed corporations into nannying the health care of its workers. On the other, the same federal government that adopted and administers Obamacare claims it is illegal for corporations to nanny its workers.\"\n\nShe added, \"One almost sympathizes with the big corporations that are upset with this decision \u2014 until one remembers that big corporations are in bed with big government half the time.\"\n\nThis article has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The term \"employee wellness program\" once had a nice, friendly, relationship-building ring to it.
