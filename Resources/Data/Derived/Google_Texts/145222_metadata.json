For stubborn holdouts like me, these ballet flats in candy colors are a walkable, breathable summer option. The leather-top, rubber-soled flats have what the maker calls \"proprietary pluggz grounding technology,\" with padded memory foam arches and heels, moisture wicking, anti-microbial lining and a \"trampoline heel\" for extra support, stability and comfort. The company claims its technology fights inflammation by, in effect, conducting electrons from the earth to recharge your feet \u2014 instead of insulating them as other cusioned soles do. I don't know about that, but I can testify that I wore a pair comfortably from work to tai chi class, and from a morning of moving furniture to a long afternoon walk on asphalt. My finicky feet felt better than they have in anything else \u2014 even Mephistos. And maybe there's something to that conductivity claim: When you drive a car in these flats, you become aware of feeling the engine's vibation, in a pleasant, massage-like way. Nine colors, $129.\n\n--Barbara Peters Smith", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2117\"", "article_summary": "For stubborn holdouts like me, these ballet flats in candy colors are a walkable, breathable summer option.\nThe leather-top, rubber-soled flats have what the maker calls \"proprietary pluggz grounding technology,\" with padded memory foam arches and heels, moisture wicking, anti-microbial lining and a \"trampoline heel\" for extra support, stability and comfort.\nAnd maybe there's something to that conductivity claim: When you drive a car in these flats, you become aware of feeling the engine's vibation, in a pleasant, massage-like way.\nMy finicky feet felt better than they have in anything else \u2014 even Mephistos.\nThe company claims its technology fights inflammation by, in effect, conducting electrons from the earth to recharge your feet \u2014 instead of insulating them as other cusioned soles do."}
