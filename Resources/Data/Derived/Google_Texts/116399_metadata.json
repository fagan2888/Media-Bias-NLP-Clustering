Peters, a Democrat, and Terri Lynn Land, a Republican, are the presumptive nominees for retiring U.S. Sen. Carl Levin's seat.\n\n\"We're surprised that [Peters] is here with the president, continuing to repeat the 'lie of the year,'\" Hagerstrom said while holding up a sign with the Twitter hashtag #LOTY. \"He is showing his support for these policies that are costing us jobs.\"\n\nThe group also singled out Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer for his support. AFP claims that 225,000 Michigan residents have lost their insurance due to the Affordable Care Act which took effect last October.\n\nSchauer has repeatedly defended his vote on Obamacare. He argued that it was already helping young people, such as MSU students, who can stay on their parent's health care plan through age 26.\n\n\"I know Republicans like to make issues of all of these things,\" Schauer, a former Congressman, said. \"My concern, and my concern on everything in Congress, was making sure that people had a health care safety net there for their family when they needed it.\"\n\n\n\nMLive reporter Jonathan Oosting contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Jay Scott Smith on Twitter: @JayScottSmith.
