You know what they say: Those who don\u2019t are doomed to repeat it and all that. What they never tell you is how important it is to learn the right lesson. Otherwise you\u2019ll just follow your first mistake with a bigger one. That\u2019s the part that trips us up.\n\nFrance, for example, made two great mistakes during the 20th century. The first was going to war against Germany in 1914. (Germany declared war first, but only after France announced it would fight to defend Russia.) It was perhaps the bloodiest, most pointless war in history to that point. Much of it was fought, devastatingly, on French soil. France lost close to 2 million dead, about 4.4% of its population.\n\nThe second French mistake was deciding not to fight the next time Germany invaded, in 1940. Resisting the first time had been calamitous. They\u2019d learned their lesson. How bad could it be to sit back this time and just let the Germans march in?\n\nThe late King Hussein of Jordan also made two big mistakes. The first was in June 1967, when he joined Egypt and Syria in their six-day war against Israel. He ended up losing the West Bank. The second was in 1973, when Egypt and Syria again fought Israel and Hussein sat it out. He\u2019d learned his lesson. This time Israel took a beating before pushing back the invaders, and Egypt and Syria were each able to regain some of the land they\u2019d lost in 1967. Not Hussein. In 1974 the Arab League annulled his claim to the West Bank and bestowed it on the PLO.\n\nAmerica has made two big mistakes so far in the 21st century. The first mistake was going to war against Iraq in 2003. Initially it was meant to retaliate for the September 11 attacks. But Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 \u2014 that was Al Qaeda, which was Iraq\u2019s enemy. Next the goal was to interdict Iraq\u2019s nuclear weapons program. But there wasn\u2019t one. Then it was to inspire other Arab peoples to overthrow their dictators. That part actually worked in the end, though not the way we\u2019d hoped.\n\nHow big a mistake was it? Well, Ariel Sharon warned President Bush early in 2002 that if he invaded Iraq and removed Saddam Hussein, three things would happen: He\u2019d get bogged down in a bloody, decade-long quagmire; he\u2019d split Iraq into warring tribes of Sunnis, Shi\u2019ites and Kurds; and he\u2019d turn Iran into a regional superpower by removing its worst enemy, Saddam. (I heard this in identical accounts from three aides who were there \u2014 an American and two Israelis.) And that\u2019s just what happened.\n\nAs for Al Qaeda, it managed to enter Iraq in America\u2019s wake and set up a local branch, which eventually renamed itself the Islamic State in Iraq. You know the rest.\n\nAnd our second mistake? That\u2019s taken a long time to become evident. Learning from our first mistake, we went to the polls in 2008 and elected a president who was everything that George W. Bush wasn\u2019t. Barack Obama was professorial, erudite and thoughtful where Bush was rough-hewn and inarticulate. He was measured, cautious, even-keeled where Bush was impulsive. Above all, he promised to extricate us from our long nightmare of failed Asian ground wars and never railroad us into another. No more boots on Asian soil.\n\nNow, in 2014, the genocidal lunatics unleashed by our first folly are beheading and crucifying their way across two failed states, burying children alive and selling girls into slavery. They\u2019re establishing a proudly medieval empire, using ultramodern weaponry \u2014 tanks, artillery, even jet fighters \u2014 they\u2019ve seized from our feckless clients. But we\u2019re not muddying our boots to clean up our mess. We\u2019ve learned our lesson.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. Obama promised to learn the lessons of the Bush era at home, too. He vowed to transcend the poisonous divisions that paralyzed Washington and bring us together to tackle our crises \u2014 a broken economy, a broken healthcare system, a broken immigration system and, worst of all, a plague of cynicism that left us convinced our very governing system was broken and couldn\u2019t fix anything.\n\nObama told us we were better than that. \u201cWe are not a collection of red states and blue states \u2014 we are the United States of America,\u201d he said in his victory speech after the Iowa caucuses in January 2008.\n\nThe idea thrilled us. We gave him a landslide victory that November. He won not just the White House but commanding control of Congress, including a veto-proof 60-seat Senate majority. Here\u2019s the baton, we told him. Lead us. Fix the economy so it doesn\u2019t tank again. Put us back to work. Save our homes from a tsunami of bank foreclosures. Fix the healthcare system. Save the climate. We\u2019ve let the fat cats trample us for too long. Get Congress working. Make like Harry Truman and give \u2019em hell.\n\nUnfortunately for Obama, and for us, he believed his own rhetoric. He really thought he could end Washington\u2019s trench warfare and inspire cooperation.\n\nBoy, was he wrong. All it took was a determined Republican minority, a couple of conservative Democratic senators and hundreds of millions of dollars in relentlessly hostile messaging and lobbying to gum up the works. Climate legislation died in the Senate. Immigration reform never even got to the floor. Obama managed to bail out the failing big banks, but not the homeowners facing eviction. He passed a huge-looking stimulus that got the economy moving, sort of, but it wasn\u2019t big enough to put millions of unemployed back to work. It ended up looking like a gigantic spending spree that bought little.\n\nHis victories hardly looked better: watered-down financial regulatory reform that few understood, and a health-care reform so hopelessly convoluted and so thoroughly maligned by the end that it made him less popular than ever. The result was his midterm shellacking in 2010. He lost the House of Representatives. Republicans took over 12 statehouses, letting them control those states\u2019 congressional redistricting and voting rules, giving the shellacking a semi-permanent sheen. He won reelection in 2012, but with an asterisk: an unprecedented six-year-long lame duck presidency.\n\nThus it is that we approach Obama\u2019s second midterms preparing to punish the president who promised to fix our problems and couldn\u2019t by rewarding the folks who created the problems and prevented him from fixing them.\n\nWe won\u2019t be fooled twice. We\u2019ve learned our lesson.\n\nContact J.J.
