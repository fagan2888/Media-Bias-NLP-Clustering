People chatting (Photo: miakievy, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Upon reading through the Sept. 4 edition of the Sheboygan Press, I was shocked and dismayed to see the cartoon on the top right half of A4. The cartoon depicts an older couple, presumably in an art gallery, viewing a depiction of the hold of a slave ship, slaves lying beside each other with no room to move, breathe, or eat, let alone use a bathroom. The speech bubble over the man states, “Must be where the airlines got their idea for passenger seating.”

There are numerous concerns with this particular cartoon. Let me draw your attention to the most obvious concern: I have flown commercial and in coach seating many times in the course of my life. Sometimes it’s pleasant, sometimes not. We all have dealt with cramped leg space, cheap snacks and the occasional obnoxious passenger. In all of my time flying, I have never once compared my experience to that of a slave ship hold. To do so is not only disrespectful, but it sells far short the horrific conditions that I imagine when I look at that famous scene depicted in your cartoon.

Commercial flight cannot and must not be compared to human cargo destined for a life of slave labor and inhumane conditions. When we get off of a flight, pleasant or not, we are off to vacations, business meetings or visiting loved ones. The slaves in these holds had no such hope. I know this cartoon was meant to be satire on the seat spacing of our airlines, but you exercised at best poor taste and ignorance, and at worst, you perpetuated the idea that we can not only forget the dehumanization of a whole people group in our own country and can use it as a cheap play on a rather trivial problem.
