Take the 2008 Senate contest, for instance. Begich did not even have to get his loafers dirty. Democrat-cum-Republican Vic Vickers did that for him. He showed up from Florida all on his own ostensibly to run in the GOP primary against then-Sen. Ted Stevens - spent more than $1 million, in fact -- and muddied Stevens as a crook. Stevens had been convicted in a fixed Justice Department case later tossed out. Vickers made negative campaigning an art form.
