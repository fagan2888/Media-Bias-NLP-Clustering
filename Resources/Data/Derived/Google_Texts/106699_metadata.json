The professor who threatened a student journalist with mob violence and the famous poop swastika incident likely have not helped matters.\n\nThe year-to-year decrease from applications for 2016 enrollment compared to 2015 is nearly five percent, reports Columbia, Mo. ABC affiliate KMIZ.\n\nMizzou\u2019s enrollment management office sent a memorandum detailing the application decline to professors and administrators earlier this week.\n\nIn terms of hard numbers, Missouri\u2019s flagship taxpayer-funded university has seen 914 fewer freshman applications this year compared to last year.\n\nApplications for fall 2016 from potential students who are black have dropped 19 percent compared to fall 2015.\n\nApplications from prospective graduate students have also fallen 19 percent.\n\nMizzou has seen a 7.7 percent reduction in applications from students with composite ACT scores of 30 or higher (typically the 95th percentile).\n\nProspective students from Missouri are applying at about the same rate. However, deposits for actual enrollment among Show Me State residents are currently down nearly 10 percent.\n\nApplications from would-be students from other states are down a whopping 25 percent compared to 2015.\n\nThe days-long protest on Mizzou\u2019s Columbia, Mo. campus centered on Jonathan Butler, a twentysomething graduate student. The son of a millionaire railroad executive went on a six-day hunger strike in November.\n\nButler\u2019s goal, which he achieved, was to force then-MU system president Tim Wolfe to resign.\n\nButler\u2019s protest gained strong momentum when he convinced 32 University of Missouri football players to pledge to boycott all team activities until Wolfe quit his job. (Ultimately, the team missed a single practice.) (RELATED: University Of Missouri Football Players BOYCOTT FOOTBALL Over Black Activist\u2019s Hunger Strike)\n\nIn a letter to school officials posted (but no longer visible) on his Facebook page, Butler indicated that he began his hunger strike because someone in a pickup truck allegedly shouted a racist insult at a black student government member, because state law prevents Planned Parenthood from performing on-campus abortions and because someone drew a swastika with human feces in a dormitory bathroom. (RELATED: Here Is The Police Report From The Mizzou Poop Swastika Incident)\n\nGroups of protesters marched across the University of Missouri campus for several days \u2014 and camped out in tents on a quad \u2014 in response to Butler\u2019s hunger strike. The protesters have called themselves Concerned Student 1950. (The name relates to the year the first black student matriculated at Mizzou.)\n\nDuring the protests, Melissa A. Click, a taxpayer-funded assistant professor of mass media at Mizzou, was caught on camera threatening a photojournalism student with mob violence, shaking his camera and attempting to deprive him of his First Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cHey, who wants to help me get this reporter out of here?\u201d Click shouted to the crowd. \u201cI need some muscle over here.\u201d (RELATED: Meet The Sick Mizzou Media Professor Who Threatened A Reporter With MOB VIOLENCE)\n\n\u201cRacism lives at the University of Missouri,\u201d a protester shouted during a typical day of protest, according to the Columbia Missourian. \u201cTwo black, female students \u2014 including myself \u2014 were called the n-word by four white males while being recorded outside of the rec center,\u201d another protester yelled while standing on a chair in a crowded dining hall.\n\nDelusional students eventually became so dizzy with racism that they saw imaginary people wearing Ku Klux Klan hoods.

Nevertheless, Butler has concluded, \u201cas a collection of incidents at the university, they are his responsibility to address.\u201d\n\nIn the summer, prior to Butler\u2019s decision to go on a hunger strike because of racism allegations, the graduate student\u2019s substantially different agenda focused on a change in University of Missouri policy that ended subsidized health insurance for graduate students. To Butler\u2019s chagrin, school officials also stopped offering some grad student tuition waivers and tore down some graduate student housing.\n\nThe Columbia Daily Tribune shows a robust-looking Butler acting as a self-appointed \u201cchant leader\u201d during a \u201cday of action\u201d on Aug. 26. He carried a large bullhorn.\n\nSchool officials had cited the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 as the reason they were forced to stop subsidizing grad student health insurance.\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter.
