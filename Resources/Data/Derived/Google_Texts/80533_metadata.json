Under strict rules officers should be liable for arrest themselves if they use their powers to enforce elements of the new guidelines.\n\nHowever, police regulators are weak and rarely act to curtail attacks on free speech. As a result there is little to prevent Police Scotland rounding up those who break the rules it has laid down.\n\nThis is not the first time Police Scotland has threatened social media users. In 2014 it investigated the social commenter Katie Hopkins for making a joke about Ebola.\n\nIn the face of allegations that it was bullying Hopkins the service Tweeted: \"Please be aware that we will continue to monitor comments on social media & any offensive comments will be investigated.\"\n\nPlease be aware that we will continue to monitor comments on social media & any offensive comments will be investigated. \u2014 Police Scotland (@policescotland) December 30, 2014\n\nSam Hooper, from the Conservatives for Liberty group said: \"Let\u2019s call a spade a spade: this is tyranny. When an enforcement arm of the state can post jocular messages on social media warning citizens to be on their best, blandest and most inoffensive behavior on pain of arrest, we do not live in a free society any more.\"\n\nPolice Scotland was created in 2013 by the left-wing Scottish National Party government, abolishing forces previously independent of each other.
