(AP) - University of Connecticut scientists researching everything from speech to genomics are coming together to become part of a new institute for the study of the brain.\n\nThe Connecticut Institute for Brain and Cognitive Science opens at the end of this month, when a $1 million state grant kicks in.\n\nThat\u2019s part of about $15 million the school and state have committed over the next 15 years to fund new faculty positions, equipment, lab space, fellowship support for students and staff.\n\nScientists plan to study myriad issues there, such as what goes on in the brain of someone with dyslexia and how the brain rewires itself after an injury.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really an untapped frontier to try to understand the brain, because it is so complex,\u201d said Mun Choi, the university\u2019s provost.\n\nThe institute was conceived more than two years ago, when the school was forming an academic plan, and deciding where to invest limited resources. Officials identified brain and cognitive science as an area where UConn could become a national leader.\n\nAlex Martin, a cognitive scientist at the National Institutes of Health, reviewed the initial proposal and concluded the school is an ideal place for a brain institute, because it already has leading experts in fields including neuropsychology and linguistics who are working on understand how the brain processes information.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge there are very few programs that operate on the scale proposed here,\u201d he said.\n\nGerry Altmann, a former longtime editor of the journal \u201cCognition,\u201d was recruited to be the institute\u2019s co-director three years ago from the University of York in England. Martin said Altmann is widely recognized as an expert in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience, which will help put UConn on the map.\n\nAltmann said he was drawn by the idea of working across disciplines at a large school such as UConn, where scientists who study how people process language can work alongside scientists discovering how proteins inside neurons work in the brain to help produce behavior.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re interested in at UConn is understanding in particular kinds of behavior, what are the components in the brain - areas or genetic influences or properties - that may be involved in things like helping people recognize faces or sounds or letters,\u201d Altmann said.\n\nThe school last month finished installing a specialized functional magnetic resonance imaging machine to help researchers understand what is going on in the brain. Subjects will be given tasks, such as reading, and the MRI will show through the flow of blood, how different parts of the brain are working together to perform that function.\n\n\u201cIf we can get a better understanding in real time how the brain\u2019s neuro-circuitry actually works and how to stimulate certain portions of the brain using stimuli such as radio waves, we can better pinpoint how the brain functions,\u201d said Choi.\n\nPreviously, scientists from UConn would have to travel to schools such as Brown and Yale to do their imaging work.\n\nThe machine, which will come online later this year, has been installed in Communication Sciences Building. A permanent home for the brain institute is still a few years away, Altmann said.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, we are putting together an infrastructure that will give faculty and students the time and funding to work across labs, departments and disciplines,\u201d he said. \u201cThat way we build up a collaborative network that is already functioning, so that when we do have premises there is already a functioning structure to put there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "University of Connecticut scientists researching everything from speech to genomics are coming together to become part of a new institute for the study of the brain.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/7/uconn-opening-institute-for-brain-and-cognitive-st/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "University of Connecticut scientists researching everything from speech to genomics are coming together to become part of a new institute for the study of the brain.", "title": "UConn opening institute for brain and cognitive studies"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "University of Connecticut scientists researching everything from speech to genomics are coming together to become part of a new institute for the study of the brain.", "card": "summary", "title": "UConn opening institute for brain and cognitive studies"}, "Author": "PAT EATON-ROBB", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The Connecticut Institute for Brain and Cognitive Science opens at the end of this month, when a $1 million state grant kicks in.\nA permanent home for the brain institute is still a few years away, Altmann said.\nOfficials identified brain and cognitive science as an area where UConn could become a national leader.\nMartin said Altmann is widely recognized as an expert in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience, which will help put UConn on the map.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really an untapped frontier to try to understand the brain, because it is so complex,\u201d said Mun Choi, the university\u2019s provost."}
