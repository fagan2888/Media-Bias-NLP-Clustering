SCARBOROUGH, Maine — A 36-year-old man is going back to prison for three years after being convicted Friday of a variety of offenses related to a pair of young girls who came to his hotel room to get a tattoo.

Joshua Grant pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual contact, two counts of placing a tattoo on people under 18 years old, two counts of placing a tattoo without a license, two counts of aggravated unlawful furnishing of drugs, and two counts of possession of sexually explicit materials, according to the Scarborough Police Department’s Facebook page.

He was sentenced to five years with all but three years suspended and was placed on probation for two years. Grant is also required to register as a sex offender for life.

Grant is also facing a revocation of his federal supervised release, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Bangor. Grant, who was a Carmel resident in 2009, was on supervised release following his conviction in 2009 for a felon in possession of a firearm. He received 30 months in federal prison and then was on supervised release for 30 months.

According to federal court papers, Scarborough police officers searched his room at the Downeaster Motel in March 2013 after two 14-year-old girls reported that they had received tattoos from Grant at the room in Scarborough.

Court documents stated that the two Westbrook middle school students contacted Grant through Facebook expressing an interest in getting tattoos. Grant picked up the two girls at a convenience store and took them to his room after purchasing some alcoholic beverages.

The court papers detail what he did in the room including requiring one of the girls to take a shower after he put a tattoo on her buttocks.

One of the girls returned the following day for another tattoo and during that procedure he touched the outside of her vagina.
