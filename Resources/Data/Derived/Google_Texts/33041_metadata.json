You gotta problem with that?\n\nUS Attorney Preet Bharara apparently does, judging from his reaction to last week\u2019s remarkable, 6,400-word essay in The New York Times detailing gubernatorial interference with an investigating commission Cuomo very publicly imposed on Albany 13 months ago \u2014 only to disband it when it started putting heat on him.\n\nEven Cuomo doesn\u2019t dispute that he stuck his thumb in the soup. But he says it was his very own commission \u2014 and that he was free to compromise it, or to kill it, whenever.\n\nSo he did. So there.\n\nBut Bharara, every corrupt New York pol\u2019s monster under the bed, takes exception: \u201cIf other people aren\u2019t going to [fight official misconduct], then we\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s our main mission.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s legal pettifoggers are, well, pettifogging.

Their increasingly frequent indictments and convictions, from the governor\u2019s perspective, simply underscored how little he himself had accomplished in that respect.\n\nFast forward to a year ago, after Cuomo\u2019s third legislative session failed yet again to produce significant anti-corruption legislation.\n\nOnce more the governor reached for the bludgeon: He appointed a special anti-corruption commission under the state\u2019s 107-year-old Moreland Act \u2014 properly employed, that\u2019s Albany\u2019s version of the nuclear option \u2014 and handed it a very clear mandate.\n\n\u201cAnything (the commission) wants to look at, they can look at \u2014 me, the lieutenant governor, the attorney general, the comptroller, any senator, any assemblyman,\u201d declared Cuomo.
