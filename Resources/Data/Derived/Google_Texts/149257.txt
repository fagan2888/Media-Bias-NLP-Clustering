Criminal charges are pending following a wreck that killed three people on Interstate 40 in eastern Hickman County on Friday afternoon, according to the Tennessee Highway Patrol.

Troopers did not specify who the potential citations and criminal charges were directed at in a preliminary report filed by the THP.

The wreck that closed westbound lanes of I-40 for hours is now believed to have involved three cars and injured six people, the report said.

The three people killed in the wreck were identified in the report as William Shelburne, 22, Claire Shelburne, 19, and Laura Shelburne, 50. All three were Bon Aqua residents.

The crash allegedly occurred when a 2008 Toyota Tacoma driven east by Andrew Martin, 37, of El Paso, Texas, tried to change lanes and struck a bobtail tractor trailer driven by Charlie Barber, 47, of Centerville, the report said. The bobtail tractor trailer was trying to overtake Martin's car, investigators said.

Barber's tractor trailer then crossed over the highway median and struck the 2000 Mercury Marquis driven by William Shelburne head-on, the report said. In addition to the three fatalities, two others in the car — Terry Shelburne, 51, and Abel Shelburne, 13 — were hospitalized.

Barber and a 6-year-old girl were injured after the tractor trailer overturned into the highway's westbound lanes. Martin and a 7-year-old boy were also hurt when his Toyota Tacoma flipped over into a ditch on the other side of the road.

Investigators said alcohol and drugs were not thought to be factors in the wreck.
