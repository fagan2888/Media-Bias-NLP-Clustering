WASHINGTON — At a Wednesday press conference on Obamacare, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor called the Internal Revenue Service’s targeting of conservative groups applying for status as social welfare organizations “the hallmark of authoritarian nations — not the United States of America.”

“For those who oppose or support Obamacare, the ability for them to speak for or against it should be protected — yet the Obama administration is moving forward with rules crafted by bureaucrats to silence opposing speech and criticism,” Cantor said.

“Frankly,” he went on, “that is the hallmark of authoritarian nations — not the United States of America.”

“Whether you disagree with the president or agree with him, your speech should be protected in America, and the House will act to ensure that organizations on all sides of an issue can continue to educate citizens, register voters, and promote the common good,” he said.

The House is expected to vote Wednesday on on a bill that would prohibit the IRS from moving forward with a rule to apply a stricter definition of what groups can qualify as a social welfare organization, called the “Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014.” Conservatives say the rule would put a chill on free speech.
