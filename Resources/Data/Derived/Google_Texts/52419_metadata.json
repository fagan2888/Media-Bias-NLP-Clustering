We\u2019re excited, but also a little scared\u2014especially about the costs. How can we make sure we\u2019re financially prepared?\n\n\u2014 A Reader\n\nDear Reader,\n\nCongratulations! First on your baby\u2014and second on your forward thinking. There\u2019s no doubt that having a child is a huge financial responsibility. But being prepared isn\u2019t just about having enough money tucked away. It\u2019s also about planning and putting safeguards in place.\n\nHere\u2019s a checklist that can help you set your growing family on a path toward financial security:\n\n1. Get a Social Security number for your child. You\u2019ll need this to get your child\u2019s health insurance, to open a bank account for him or her, or to apply for government benefits. It\u2019s easiest to apply for a Social Security number when you apply for a birth certificate.\n\n2. Make adequate health insurance a priority. If you have insurance through your work, make sure you have the best combination of deductibles and coverage. Then notify your employer as soon as your child is born. If you need to provide your own insurance, check out what\u2019s available under the Affordable Care Act either through the federal exchange or your state\u2019s exchange.\n\n3. Build an emergency fund. This is even more important when you have a child. Try to keep enough cash in an easily accessible account to cover three-to-six months\u2019 worth of necessary expenses. If you\u2019re hit with an illness or job loss, it will help pay the bills until you get back on your feet.\n\n4. Look into life insurance. A term life insurance policy is generally low-cost and easy to get. Think about having enough coverage to at least pay off your mortgage and debts, and cover your child\u2019s education.\n\n5. Create a will. If you have a lot of assets, a will or trust will help ensure they\u2019re distributed according to your wishes. But even if you don\u2019t, a will is essential to name a guardian for minor children. If you don\u2019t put it in writing, the state could decide who would care for your child.\n\n6. Complete an advance healthcare directive. This designates the type of care you want in a life-threatening situation, and also allows you to appoint someone to make medical decisions for you if you can\u2019t speak for yourself. It can be your spouse or anyone you choose. Just be sure it\u2019s someone you trust and who\u2019s comfortable with the role. Protecting yourself with this safeguard ultimately protects your kids, as well.\n\n7. Start saving for education. Everyone thinks about saving for college but what about a private elementary or high school? A college savings account such as a 529 plan should be a priority, but also think about an Education Savings Account, which can be used for elementary or secondary school, too.\n\n8. Plan for the extras. While you\u2019re focusing on savings, don\u2019t forget about extras such as music lessons, gymnastics training, summer camps\u2014even family vacations. Having savings to cover these things will help you make choices that don\u2019t break your budget.\n\n9. Start your kids\u2019 financial education early. A trip to the store, handling an allowance, saving for something special\u2014all of these provide opportunities to pass on your own values while teaching your kids the value of money.\n\n10. Don\u2019t neglect your retirement account. This is as important for your children as it is for you. (In fact, it should be your number one savings goal\u2014even before education.) Contribute to a 401(k) to get the company match and open an IRA. Your kids will be financially independent one day. Make sure you\u2019re equally independent.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do all this at once, or necessarily all yourself. Your employer might match a portion of your retirement savings, as well as offer tax-advantaged accounts that let you pay for health and child care expenses with before-tax dollars. Grandparents might be willing to chip in on education. The main thing is to plan ahead, so you can enjoy every precious moment with your new baby.\n\nThis column is no substitute for an individualized recommendation, tax, legal or personalized investment advice.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2013 CHARLES SCHWAB & CO., INC.
