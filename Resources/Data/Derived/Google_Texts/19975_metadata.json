Though most of its equipment is updated, there are still glitches in the technology that have caused serious communication problems that agents have had to work around, the report said.\n\nOn top of that, the GAO said the DHS never developed a way to monitor whether the system works as intended, so it can\u2019t technically determine whether the billion-dollar investment was actually worth the money.\n\nThe GAO said DHS \"could not make a definitive determination on operational suitability, and since CBP agents and officers are currently using radio systems on a daily basis, a performance monitoring plan would help CBP identify issues experienced by current CBP users and actions that could address those identified issues.\"\n\nRelated: DHS Whistleblowers Save $100 Million a Year\n\nThe GAO blamed DHS for not verifying that the system is works as intended and explaining how it\u2019s being managed.\n\n\u201cWithout such information, the report said, \"ICE does not have the ability to determine whether its technology investments are meeting user needs and contributing to achieving the agency's mission.\"\n\nGAO recommended that DHS develop a way to monitor the system\u2019s effectiveness. The department concurred with the auditors\u2019 recommendations and said it is already working on a solution.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is one of the worst offending agencies for government waste.
