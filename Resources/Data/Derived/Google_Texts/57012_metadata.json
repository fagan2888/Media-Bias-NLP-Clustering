The EEOC has filed three lawsuits against private sector employees alleging they violated Title VII by discriminating against transgender workers.\n\nThe EEOC's next logical step is to sue a private employer alleging sexual orientation discrimination violates Title VII, Feldblum said during an American Bar Association-sponsored webinar. That step is likely \u201ccoming soon,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a case involving a gay federal air traffic controller, a divided EEOC last year ruled for the first time that discrimination based on sexual orientation is \u201cinherently\u201d sex discrimination under Title VII .\n\nThe EEOC subsequently filed amicus briefs in two pending cases in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, asserting that in litigation involving private employers and state and local governments, Title VII likewise bars bias based on sexual orientation .\n\nAlthough two federal appeals courts have allowed Title VII sex discrimination claims to proceed when gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender workers alleged bias based on gender stereotyping, no federal circuit has ruled Title VII prohibits bias based on sexual orientation. Instead, most federal courts have said Title VII simply doesn't address sexual orientation bias, reasoning that it differs from bias based on an individual's sex.\n\nThe EEOC since 2014 has sued three private employers under Title VII on behalf of transgender workers alleging sex discrimination based on gender identity. Two of those cases have settled, and the third is pending in a federal district court in Michigan .\n\nExisting Federal, State Coverage\n\nWorkers alleging sexual orientation discrimination by private employers have been obtaining some relief through the EEOC's administrative process, Feldblum said.\n\nDuring the past three fiscal years, 3,340 individuals alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity have filed EEOC charges, Feldblum said. The EEOC has resolved 2,316 of those charges, meaning the agency issued right-to-sue letters or the charges were settled through mediation or after the EEOC investigated, Feldblum said.\n\nThe EEOC has obtained approximately $6.5 million in monetary relief for workers alleging sexual orientation and/or gender identity bias and gotten hundreds of employers to change their policies so LGBT discrimination would not recur, Feldblum said.\n\nThe EEOC historically has \u201cbeen ahead of the courts\u201d in identifying new forms of discrimination under Title VII, Feldblum said. The courts \u201coften defer\u201d to the agency's interpretations of the act, and she hopes that will be true regarding the EEOC's view that bias based on sexual orientation or gender identity is sex discrimination, Feldblum said.\n\nThe courts \u201cmay not necessarily agree\u201d with the EEOC, Feldblum said, but she added that she is pleased by \u201crecent positive trends\u201d in the courts finding LGBT individuals protected from discrimination.\n\nSome 22 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and 19 states plus the District also bar bias based on gender identity, said Edward Reeves, an attorney representing employers with Stoel Rives LLP in Portland, Ore.\n\nObama's Order Expanded Protection\n\nPresident Barack Obama in 2014 issued an executive order that expanded protections against employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, said Adam Romero, senior counsel to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law in Los Angeles.\n\nExecutive Order 13,672 amended a prior executive order that barred discrimination based on sexual orientation in federal civilian employment by adding gender identity, Romero said. The order also amended Executive Order 11,246 to prohibit federal contractors or subcontractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation or gender identity .\n\nThe ban on LGBT discrimination by federal contractors covers about 35 percent of the U.S. workforce, Romero said. It extends protection against sexual orientation bias to about 11 million workers not currently shielded by state or local laws, he said.\n\nThe executive order's ban on gender identity discrimination by contractors extends protection to about 14 million workers who weren't protected against such bias by state or local laws, Romero said.\n\nObama's executive order and many of the state anti-discrimination laws recognize religious exemptions, said Reeves.\n\nSo \u201cbona fide\u201d churches or other religious institutions are excused from the anti-discrimination provision regarding jobs that are \u201cclosely connected\u201d to the entity's religious mission, Reeves said.\n\nMany states that shield individuals from gender identity bias also require \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d for transgender employees, focused on their health and safety while they are transitioning in the workplace, Reeves said.\n\nLegal Arguments Reviewed\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 49 FEP Cases 954 (1989), in which the court said employment decisions based on \u201cgender stereotyping\u201d could be sex discrimination, opened an avenue for LGBT individuals to pursue Title VII sex discrimination claims.\n\nThe Sixth and Eleventh circuits have allowed Title VII sex bias claims by transgender workers to proceed based on the theory they were discriminated against for failure to conform with gender norms, said Gregory Nevins, counsel and workplace fairness program strategist for Lambda Legal in Atlanta.\n\nSome federal district courts also have permitted Title VII claims by transgender workers to advance when they rely on the gender stereotyping theory, Nevins said.\n\nBut other federal courts considering Title VII claims based on sexual orientation or transgender status have limited sexual stereotyping to behaviors observable in the workplace, such as how an individual dresses, walks or speaks, Nevins said.\n\nThose courts effectively are ruling a Title VII claim asserting the gender stereotyping theory must show employment decisions were based on the same criteria Price Waterhouse used to deny partnership to Ann Hopkins, that she didn't dress, talk, act or present herself in ways appropriate for a woman, he said.\n\nGender stereotyping isn't so limited and can include stereotypes related to behavior outside the workplace, Nevins said. For example, the most basic stereotype affecting gay men is that men should be attracted to women and only women, he said.\n\nCourts that rule Title VII's sex discrimination ban can't be interpreted to include bias based on sexual orientation or transgender status also typically say Congress never considered the issue in 1964 or when subsequently amending the act, Nevins said.\n\nBut Justice Antonin Scalia's opinion for a unanimous court in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 76 FEP Cases 21 (1998), which held same-sex harassment claims are cognizable under Title VII, said the act's language can reach claims Congress may never have contemplated when passing the law, Nevins said.\n\nThat same logic could support a conclusion that bias based on \u201csex\u201d includes discrimination against a male worker for being attracted to men or against a female worker for being attracted to women, Nevins said.\n\nThat Congress has failed to pass proposed legislation that would amend Title VII to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity doesn't mean the act's current sex discrimination ban can't be interpreted to reach such bias, Nevins said.\n\nAn analogy to case law recognizing Title VII's ban on racial bias is violated if a white employee, for example, is discriminated against because he's married to a black spouse also could help, Nevins said. As in those race bias cases, a male employee alleging discrimination because of his association with a male spouse would be claiming bias based on sex in the same way the white employee would be alleging bias based on race, he said.\n\nWhether courts find any of these arguments convincing as a reason to rule Title VII prohibits bias based on sexual orientation or transgender status remains to be seen, Nevins said.\n\nBest Practices for Employers\n\nAs for workplace best practices regarding sexual orientation and gender identity, Reeves said employers should have \u201can appropriate conduct policy\u201d and enforce it.\n\nSuch a policy should emphasize that all employees, applicants and customers are entitled to be treated with \u201cdignity and respect\u201d and set \u201ca higher standard\u201d than merely what the law requires to avoid harassment claims, he said.\n\nThe employer's policy should make clear employees are expected not to discriminate or harass others based on sexual orientation or gender identity, Reeves said.\n\nRegarding employees making gender transitions, Reeves recommended that employers take a \u201ccase-by-case approach.\u201d They should involve the transitioning employee in decisions about how to deal with dress codes, restroom use and informing co-workers and customers about the changes, Reeves said.\n\nThe EEOC has issued guidelines for federal agencies on how to treat employees undergoing gender transitions and an Office of Personnel Management document also provides \u201cvery useful guidance,\u201d Reeves said. Both are helpful for private employers as well as federal agencies, he said.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015), which held state law bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, means many employers have to alter their employee benefits policies, said Teresa Renaker of Renaker Hasselman LLP in San Francisco.\n\nEmployers providing a welfare benefits plan that includes coverage for employees' opposite-sex spouses must also now provide the same coverage for employees' same-sex spouses, Renaker said.\n\nSimilarly, non-mandatory spousal benefits in an employee pension plan must be offered on an equal basis to employees with same-sex spouses, she said.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services last September issued a proposed rule that interprets Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which bars sex discrimination in covered health-care plans, to prohibit bias based on gender identity.\n\nEmployers that offer health-care benefits therefore should avoid \u201cblanket exclusions\u201d for coverage of treatments related to gender transitions, Renaker said. Such exclusions historically have been based on \u201cstigma\u201d rather than on the treatments' costs, she said.\n\nEmployers also should avoid \u201cgender-based necessity denials\u201d of health plan coverage, such as automatic denials of gynecological care because a female transgender employee was born male, Renaker said.\n\nSimilarly, employers should avoid medical necessity denials of health-care coverage for gender transition-related care, such as hormone treatments, she said.\n\nAll these issues are dealt with in the HHS proposed rule interpreting the ACA, she said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kevin McGowan in Washington at kmcgowan@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Susan J.
