Mayor de Blasio hasn\u2019t been. Fifteen months into his term, it suddenly dawns that the Health and Hospitals Corp.\u2019s 11 major medical centers are hemorrhaging hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Without radical treatment, they are terminal.\n\nReflecting the gravity of the crisis, HHC Commissioner Dr. Ram Raju promised his workforce, \u201cThe Health and Hospitals Corp. must and will survive.\u201d Then, he presented a rescue plan whose success would hinge on beating incredibly tough odds.\n\nLandmark institutions like Bellevue, Kings County, North Central Bronx and Elmhurst Medical Center face dire futures thanks to accelerating changes in the health-care marketplace, including Obamacare. Yet the mayor has raised no warnings about the looming crisis, let alone offered a vision for maintaining the nation\u2019s largest public health-care system.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s distance is all the more remarkable given the months and the millions he wasted tilting his lance at the lost cause of Long Island College Hospital when pretending that he could pull a failed hospital back from the brink.\n\nHHC President Dr. Ram Raju (Debbie Egan-Chin/Daily News)\n\nRaju envisions luring patients who have never set foot in public hospitals away from name-brand private powerhouses. Five years from now, he wants to see 2 million New Yorkers walk in HHC\u2019s doors, up from the current 1.4 million, including many more privately insured individuals.\n\nAnd he wants to double enrollment in the HHC-sponsored MetroPlus insurance plan, whose membership now numbers half a million, mostly Medicaid patients. Droves of private shoppers would have to choose MetroPlus via the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange \u2014 a mighty leap from the 27,000 signed up for 2015.\n\nEven then, Raju is counting on most of those enrollees signing up with an HHC doctor as their primary-care physician. Oh, and he\u2019ll have to raise an additional $300 million a year.\n\nThe challenges are monumental. Here\u2019s hoping that Raju has more success than de Blasio did at LICH, which essentially vanished after the shouting died.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Editorials", "twitter": {"description": "The city\u2019s top doctor on Tuesday pronounced the municipal hospitals in critical financial condition.", "title": "Editorial: Paging Doctor de Blasio", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-paging-doctor-de-blasio-article-1.2176871", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2176869.1428448111!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hhc8e-2-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "new york city healthcare, bill de blasio, new york city doctors,", "parsely-author": "Editorials", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "new york city healthcare, bill de blasio, new york city doctors,", "nydn_tags": "bill de blasio", "news_keywords": "new york city healthcare, bill de blasio, new york city doctors,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-paging-doctor-de-blasio-article-1.2176871", "parsely-title": "Editorial: Paging Doctor de Blasio", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-07T19:13:32-0400", "sailthru.title": "Editorial: Paging Doctor de Blasio", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-04-07T23:13:32", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2176869.1428448111!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hhc8e-2-web.jpg", "description": "The city\u2019s top doctor on Tuesday pronounced the municipal hospitals in critical financial condition.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "The city\u2019s top doctor on Tuesday pronounced the municipal hospitals in critical financial condition.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "The city\u2019s top doctor on Tuesday pronounced the municipal hospitals in critical financial condition.", "title": "Editorial: Paging Doctor de Blasio", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-paging-doctor-de-blasio-article-1.2176871", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2176869.1428448111!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hhc8e-2-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "bill de blasio", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2176869.1428448111!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hhc8e-2-web.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Editorials", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe11bc\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s hoping that Raju has more success than de Blasio did at LICH, which essentially vanished after the shouting died.\nHHC President Dr. Ram Raju (Debbie Egan-Chin/Daily News)Raju envisions luring patients who have never set foot in public hospitals away from name-brand private powerhouses.\nEven then, Raju is counting on most of those enrollees signing up with an HHC doctor as their primary-care physician.\nThe city\u2019s top doctor on Tuesday pronounced the municipal hospitals in critical financial condition \u2014 and says New Yorkers will have to step up to save them.\nAnd he wants to double enrollment in the HHC-sponsored MetroPlus insurance plan, whose membership now numbers half a million, mostly Medicaid patients."}
