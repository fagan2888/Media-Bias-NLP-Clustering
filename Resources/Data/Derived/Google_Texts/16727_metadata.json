The news comes a month after HBO programming president Michael Lombardo noted publicly that he'd be \"shocked\" if the series didn't return. The hold-up has been creator Aaron Sorkin, who will need to pen the Steve Jobs film script before turning his attention back to Newsroom.\n\nThe Sorkin creation, set behind the scenes at a cable news show, will have no shortage of news events to cover in a third season, including the Newtown School shooting (December, 2012) and the Boston Marathon massacre (April, 2013). The series\u2019 second season, which bowed on July 14, will end with a two-parter taking place on election night on Sept. 15.\n\nThough the series has found itself on the receiving end of media criticism since its debut, it has performed for HBO. In addition to decent ratings -- the season two premiere lured 2.2 million, up four percent from the season one premiere -- Newsroom has delivered a passionate, elite viewership that includes such bold-face names as Dan Rather and Brian Williams, and the kind of high-brow conversation that comes with it.\n\nTHR COVER: Aaron Sorkin Reveals Depth of 'Newsroom' Angst, Season 2 Reboot, A-List Consultants\n\n\"We're enormously happy with the show,\" Lombardo said of the series during the press presentation in late July. A few months earlier, he had been more specific about the allure during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter: \u201cIt felt like the show was hitting a smart, adult audience that many of our dramas weren\u2019t,\" he noted. \"For a thinking audience, it\u2019s appointment viewing.\" (The premium cable network\u2019s other dramas include genre hits True Blood and Game of Thrones.)\n\nDaniels' tweet comes on the heels of him breaking into the particularly competitive lead drama actor category in this year\u2019s Emmy race. On the day of his nomination, Daniels told THR: \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018we absolutely love you\u2019 and \u2018we absolutely hate you\u2019 to The Newsroom, and this is a stamp of approval that says we\u2019re not going anywhere. And all of us want to be doing this for years.\u201d Recurring star Jane Fonda also nabbed a nomination for her role as Leona Lansing, CEO of Atlantis World Media, which owns the cable network on which McAvoy\u2019s News Night airs.\n\nIn a THR cover story from mid-June, Sorkin spoke at length about the changes he had in store for the show's second season, including an overarching legal storyline that spans all nine episodes. The latter was inspired by a 1998 CNN news segment alleging, among other things, that the U.S. had used sarin nerve gas that killed more than 100 men, women and children in Laos during the Vietnam War. The report -- a heavily promoted story for a new CNN/Time series called NewsStand -- was later discredited and the network vilified.\n\n\"I hope some of the people who were turned off by the show last year take a second look and maybe are a little bit happier,\" said the show's creator, who has multiple Emmys and an Oscar to his name. \"But you're playing a dangerous game if you write to try to change people's minds.\"\n\nUpdate: In a statement on Wednesday, HBO says \"We are excited about proceeding to a Season 3 and are continuing our conversations with Aaron about schedules.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Lacey Rose,Erik Hayden", "description": "The HBO drama, created by Aaron Sorkin, has two episodes left in its sophomore season.", "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "description": "The HBO drama, created by Aaron Sorkin, has two episodes left in its sophomore season.", "title": "Jeff Daniels: 'The Newsroom' Returning for Season 3", "url": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jeff-daniels-newsroom-returning-season-620110", "image": {"width": 349, "identifier": "//cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/2013/06/Newsroom_4_p.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 466}, "type": "website"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-03 21:32:20", "sailthru.title": "Jeff Daniels: 'The Newsroom' Returning for Season 3", "fb": {"admins": 3111204}, "sailthru.vertical": "Live Feed", "sailthru.tags": "Live Feed, Television, THE NEWSROOM", "sailthru.channel": "Live Feed", "sailthru.description": "The HBO drama, created by Aaron Sorkin, has two episodes left in its sophomore season.", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca3c9\"", "article_summary": "The series\u2019 second season, which bowed on July 14, will end with a two-parter taking place on election night on Sept. 15.\nOn Tuesday night, Jeff Daniels tweeted that The Newsroom was picked up by HBO.\n#Newsroom coming back for a Season 3,\" the actor, who plays anchor Will McAvoy, wrote.\nTHR COVER: Aaron Sorkin Reveals Depth of 'Newsroom' Angst, Season 2 Reboot, A-List Consultants\"We're enormously happy with the show,\" Lombardo said of the series during the press presentation in late July.\nThe hold-up has been creator Aaron Sorkin, who will need to pen the Steve Jobs film script before turning his attention back to Newsroom."}
