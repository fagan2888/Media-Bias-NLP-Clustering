In an interview with The Daily Signal, Hennessy said:\n\nThe goal is to let everyone in the area know that those places are open, and to generate commerce in the area. A lot of them are very small. \u2026 The little shops are left on their own.\n\nMany damaged businesses in Ferguson boarded up broken windows and doors but remain open for business. Because many of the storefronts are covered with plywood, some local customers aren\u2019t aware that the shops are open; they may confuse store hours written on the makeshift \u201cwindows\u201d with graffiti.\n\n>>> An Interactive Timeline of the Fallout in Ferguson\n\nHennessy, though, hopes the \u201cbuycott\u201d will motivate consumers:\n\nIt\u2019s going to take time for Ferguson to recover, and we want to do what we can to help them out. The effects of something like this \u2026 is a black eye on the entire community. I don\u2019t want Ferguson to fail because of this as a city. \u2026 We want to do what we can to support Ferguson so that it makes a strong comeback.\n\nHennessy, a supporter of The Heritage Foundation and its advocacy arm, Heritage Action for America, said he expects approximately 20 shoppers from St. Louis County to participate in the Ferguson \u201cbuycott.\u201d However, he hopes to see more than 50 attend.\n\n\u201dWe want to do what we can to support Ferguson so that it makes a strong comeback,\u201d says @WHennessy\n\nShoppers are asked to meet on West Florissant Street at 5 p.m. to shop for an hour and visit two to three stores each. The group plans to visit 20 stores altogether, including the Ferguson Bicycle Shop, Whistle Stop Depot and Sportsprint.\n\nBecause the situation in the St. Louis suburb remains fluid as protests continue, Hennessy said \u201cbuycott\u201d participants will respect the wishes of law enforcement. If police instruct them not to shop, he said, they\u2019ll refrain.\n\n>>> Americans Disapprove of the Media\u2019s Coverage of Ferguson\n\nThe Aug. 9 death of Michael Brown, 18, who was shot and killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, led to protests in the streets followed by nighttime riots and looting. More than 30 local businesses were damaged in the violence. One, a QuikTrip convenience store, burned to the ground.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo., some area residents hope to help the town begin to recover with a show of support for looted and damaged businesses.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Amid civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo., some area residents hope to help the town begin to recover with a show of support for looted and damaged businesses.", "title": "Neighbors Head to Ferguson.
