Ryan (R-WI) complained over the weekend that the GOP essentially lacks \u201cthe vision thing.\u201d He warned that his party would be permanently consigned to second-place status in presidential politics unless it somehow elevates its game on public policy and demonstrates that it can lead.\n\nRyan was highly reluctant to succeed John Boehner as speaker because the job is arguably one of the toughest and most frustrating position in Washington, with a small gaggle of about 40 right-wing conservatives frequently calling the tune. But since taking the gavel from Boehner last Thursday, he has sharply criticized the GOP controlled House, saying that it is \u201cbroken\u201d and dysfunctional. And during high profile appearances on all five major Sunday news programs, Ryan complained that the Republicans have been consumed by \u201ctactics\u201d at the expense of visionary leadership.\n\nRelated: Paul Ryan Flexes His Conservative Muscles in Contrast to Boehner\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been too timid on policy, we\u2019ve been too timid on vision \u2013 we have none,\u201d Ryan said during an interview on Fox News Sunday. \u201cWe have to have a vision and offer an alternative to this country so that they can see that if we get the chance to lead, if we get the presidency and if we keep Congress, this is what it will look like; this is how we\u2019ll fix the problems working families are facing.\u201d\n\nRyan, the former chair of the House Budget and Ways and Means Committees and a highly regarded conservative thinker, promised to put forth a \u201cbold,\u201d detailed policy agenda for the GOP that could be used by Republican presidential candidates heading into the teeth of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that we are a successful opposition party,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t like the direction the country is headed, not only do we use the tools that we have to be a successful opposition party, but we have to be\u2026a proposition party.\u201d\n\nThat includes coming up with creative ways to overhaul the tax code, replace the Affordable Care Act, address the \u201croot causes\u201d of poverty and provide sustained economic growth.\n\nRelated: The New Budget Deal Is Washington Vote Buying at Its Finest\n\n\u201cThis is where we have fallen down, and I think this is what unifies the Republicans \u2013 which is to show the country how we would do things differently,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough it may a while before we get a full look at the new Ryan policy doctrine, he offered a few insights to his views during his talk show appearances:\n\nImmigration Reform\n\nImmigration reform is off the table as long as President Obama is in office. Ryan made good on his pledge to conservatives to slam the door on bringing any immigration bill to the floor until well after the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, on this issue, you cannot trust this president,\u201d Ryan told CNN, noting that Obama sought to end-run Congress last year by issuing two executive orders designed to give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants and their children.\n\nRelated: Boehner\u2019s Last Stand \u2014 A Budget Deal That Raises the Debt Ceiling\n\nRyan was criticized by conservatives for previously backing immigration reforms, but now is firmly in the conservative camp in opposing any action as long as a Democrat is in the White House. With Obama\u2019s executive orders hopelessly tied up in court by conservatives, all avenues to reform have been cut off.\n\nNo Government Shutdowns\n\nAnother government shutdown is not in the cards under his watch. Even with the two-year budget agreement approved last week, Congress still must write specific appropriations bills by early December in order to divvy up the funds over the coming fiscal year. Ryan refused to side with the Freedom Caucus for a rider to a spending bill that would defund Planned Parenthood because of a controversy over its sale of aborted fetal body parts. Knowing that Obama would veto that bill, Ryan said, \u201cBeing an effective opposition party means being honest with people up front about what it is you can and cannot achieve.\u201d\n\nThe Hastert Rule\n\nThe Hastert Rule is no longer written in stone. While issues such as immigration would require majority consent of the House Republican Conference before the leadership could move ahead, Ryan may have to move ahead on others by striking a compromise with the Democrats \u2013 just as Boehner did last week in winning passage of the new budget.\n\nUnder the so-called \u201cHastert Rule\u201d \u2013 an informal House governing principle used by the Republicans since the mid-1990s and named for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) \u2013 the speaker does not allow a floor vote on a bill unless a majority of the majority party supports the measure.\n\nRelated: Boehner Ready to Exit a Historically Feeble Congress\n\nFamily First\n\nRyan made it clear before seeking the speakership that he would not allow it to interfere with his weekends home in Janesville, Wisconsin with his wife and three young children. But the conservative Republican said he would not support paid family leave legislation favored by President Obama and the Democrats because it would constitute a new entitlement program that would add to the debt.\n\nJohn Roberts, the Fox News Sunday host, noted that many Americans would like to see Ryan make it a priority to pass a paid family leave bill. But Ryan brushed him back, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think people asked me to be Speaker so that I can take more money from hardworking taxpayers to create some new federal entitlement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think people want to have members of Congress who represent them, that are like them.\u201d\n\nA House Undivided\n\nHe views himself as a potential unifying force \u2013 one who not only can unite the GOP conference but who can occasionally find common ground with the Democrats. \u201cIf I pick up where John Boehner left off, then I think we won\u2019t be successful,\u201d he said during an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cThat\u2019s not a discredit to John Boehner, that\u2019s just a discredit to the way the job has been done.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so I think this job has to be done differently. And that's why I say it's a new day. We're starting over. We have a clean slate. And we're going to go on offense.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Newly ensconced House Speaker Paul D.", "title": "Can Paul Ryan Turn Around the Party of No?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/02/Can-Paul-Ryan-Turn-Around-Party-No", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/paul_ryan_gavel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/02/Can-Paul-Ryan-Turn-Around-Party-No", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/paul_ryan_gavel.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Newly ensconced House Speaker Paul D.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Related: Paul Ryan Flexes His Conservative Muscles in Contrast to Boehner\u201cWe\u2019ve been too timid on policy, we\u2019ve been too timid on vision \u2013 we have none,\u201d Ryan said during an interview on Fox News Sunday.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that we are a successful opposition party,\u201d he said.\nKnowing that Obama would veto that bill, Ryan said, \u201cBeing an effective opposition party means being honest with people up front about what it is you can and cannot achieve.\u201dThe Hastert RuleThe Hastert Rule is no longer written in stone.\nAnd during high profile appearances on all five major Sunday news programs, Ryan complained that the Republicans have been consumed by \u201ctactics\u201d at the expense of visionary leadership.\nRyan made good on his pledge to conservatives to slam the door on bringing any immigration bill to the floor until well after the 2016 presidential election."}
