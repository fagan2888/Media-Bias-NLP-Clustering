Go for it, because it all depends on the target of the lawsuits.\n\nAbbott, the presumed GOP frontrunner for governor, made a stump stop in Amarillo this past week at Oliver Saddle Shop.\n\nOne of his selling points?\n\nAbbott has filed 29 lawsuits against the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThe thing I may be best known for are the lawsuits I have filed against Barack Obama and his administration,\u201d said Abbott, a comment that drew applause and appreciative hollers. \u201cI have filed \u2014 already \u2014 29 lawsuits against Barack Obama and his administration.\u201d\n\nAbbott pointed out the \u201cchallenge\u201d he waged against Obamacare (time will tell if the \u201caffordable\u201d part of the Affordable Care Act is an accurate term) and the \u201cmultitude\u201d of lawsuits he has waged against the Environmental Protection Agency \u201cthat is trying to impose job-killing regulations on the robust energy industry in the state of Texas.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuits are just a symbol of a larger battle, and even if the attorney general was preaching to the Amarillo choir and only trying to score political points, he has a point that will resonate.\n\nThere are many, especially in Texas, that agree with Abbott\u2019s description of the federal government as having a \u201cheavy hand\u201d and being \u201coverreaching\u201d in its quest to control more and more of our lives. Abbott may have been using politician-speak (which hardly makes him unique among Republicans or Democrats), but there\u2019s still an element of legitimacy to what he says \u2014 if you look past the lawsuits to the reasons behind them.\n\nA pat on the back\n\nTo gas prices: Hard to believe, but gas prices deserve a pat on the back. I recently saw gas for less than $3 a gallon \u2014 provided you had a discount card, which I, conveniently, did not. Still, gas for less than $3 a gallon makes it a lot easier to fill up the tank.\n\nA kick in the pants\n\nTo the national debt: It is amazing that this country is some $17 trillion in debt, but most of us just shrug.\n\nSooner or later, someone is going to have to pay this bill. It is as simple as that. What is disappointing is the level of apathy about what this means for the future.\n\nDave Henry is AGN Media director of commentary.
