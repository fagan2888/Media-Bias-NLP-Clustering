She said the time felt right to donate much of the collection to the library.\n\n\"A lot of these albums stuck in our family because we enjoyed looking at them. At family reunions, the albums would come out.\" Schricker said. \"I'm happy to have them in Boulder where they belong. Martin would be happy.\"\n\nThe albums are dedicated to area communities such as Ward, Louisville and Eldora, infrastructure like Barker Dam, railroads and Boulder streetcars and events including the \"Boulder Fire of 1907.\" The glass plate negatives cover categories including wagons, and Boulder's old fire department \"hose teams.\"\n\n\"He was a hoarder but he was a neat hoarder,\" Schricker said of her great uncle.\n\nSchricker's family still has a number of artifacts, including some guns, from the early days of Boulder County. Those are expected to be donated to the Boulder History Museum once it relocates to its new location, the former Masonic Lodge located at 2205 Broadway, next door to the Carnegie Library.\n\nNow in the hands of Carnegie Branch manager Wendy Hall and archivist Marti Anderson, Schricker's donation -- which also included a box with thousands of loose negatives -- will now be sorted, catalogued and checked for duplicates of photos already housed at the library.\n\nHall said she woke up at 6 a.m. Friday because of her excitement over the incoming donation, and she hopes others with pictures and artifacts from the area's early history will also consider a donation to the library.\n\n\"We know there are other collections out there that will help us document Boulder County's history and we encourage people to donate them so they are accessible to everyone who is researching,\" Hall said. \"To think there are still photos from 150 years ago that we don't have and no one has seen, to us, is very exciting.\"\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Joe Rubino at 303-473-1328, rubinoj@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/JoeCarmenRubino.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url":
