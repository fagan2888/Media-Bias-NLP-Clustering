(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nThe week before Labor Day may be a quiet one in Washington. But in the nation\u2019s capital and across the country, legions of lawyers and lobbyists are scrambling to weigh in one of the most consequential regulations of Obama\u2019s second term: An update to the Fair Labor Standards Act that would make 4.6 million more people eligible for overtime.\n\nThe comment period ends Friday on the rule, and the outcome could have more of a direct impact on Americans\u2019 earnings as almost any federal law that\u2019s passed since the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s no accident: As the Obama Administration has resorted to executive action as an end run around a gridlocked and hostile Congress, lobbyists have turned their attention to the more complex and obscure world of cabinet agencies, because rule-making and regulation is where today\u2019s policy-making wars are fought.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s a different kind of warfare. Unlike the legislative process, where lobbying and dealmaking are more accepted, rulemaking is supposed to rest on an agency\u2019s discretion, guided by technical analyses of economic impacts. Nevertheless, they\u2019re still subject to outside influence \u2014 and on the most important rules, interested parties on all sides try their darndest to have an impact.\n\nAt the same time, Internet-based transparency measures have made it ever-easier for the general population to pick over proposals and tell regulators what they think. As a result, what used to be relatively insular, back-room affairs have become pitched public battles, generating mountains of input. In a few cases, at least.\n\n\u201cThere have always been a small subset of rules that capture a lot of attention,\u201d says Cary Coglianese, director of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe big difference today is that instead of getting a few thousand comments, they can generate a few hundred thousand.\u201d\n\nTake the new overtime rule. Both businesses and worker advocates have been mobilizing since March 2014, when President Obama directed the Labor Department to revisit the regulations. The Bush administration\u2019s 2004 update drew 75,028 comments over a 90-day window, which was a lot for the time. With the comment period closing on Friday, the change this time has drawn 154,712 comments, during just a 60-day window.\n\nWhile a far greater response than your run-of-the-mill rule generates, that\u2019s peanuts compared to this year\u2019s blockbusters: The Federal Communications Commission\u2019s net neutrality rule garnered 3.7 million comments, and the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s clean power plants rule drew 4.3 million.\n\nThe greater participation doesn\u2019t necessarily manifest only because these rules have potentially such far-reaching consequences. Rather, it\u2019s because coordinated campaigns on both sides have focused and channeled activists\u2019 attention.\n\nThe overtime rule fight began years ago, as soon as the financial crisis settled down, when activists started asking the Obama administration to raise the salary threshold below which even white-collar managers are entitled to make time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours a week. With few upwards adjustments for decades, the regulation has come to cover only 8 percent of the salaried workforce, and employers can ask white collar workers who make more than $23,660 per year to put in long hours without extra pay.\n\n\u201cThere is a large core group that has been working on this for years,\u201d says Judy Conti, federal advocacy coordinator at the National Employment Law Project. \u201cIt might sound like a wonky D.C. issue, but this is something that\u2019s going to restore peoples\u2019 lives, make sure to put more money in peoples\u2019 pockets.\u201d\n\nThe group first started by laying a foundation of economic analysis to support the idea of raising the overtime salary threshold. They started with a built-in advantage: The chief economist at the Department of Labor came from the main think tank that has been leading that research, the Economic Policy Institute, and others in high positions also have backgrounds in worker advocacy.\n\nNevertheless, outside pressure became necessary towards the end of last year, as the process of developing the rule dragged on, and advocates worried it wouldn't end up as strong as they wanted.\n\n\u201cWe heard that they were coming in with a threshold that was much lower,\u201d says Ross Eisenbrey, a vice president at EPI who has played a key role in the overtime push. \u201cAnd when we raised a ruckus, they rethought it, and came in with a higher number and had to redo their economic analysis.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, EPI and the Center for American Progress were bringing in reinforcements from across the progressive spectrum, including women\u2019s groups, civil rights organizations and unions. As soon as the rule was proposed in early July, they launched a dedicated Website, FixOvertime.org, through which people could file comments with the Department of Labor directly.\n\nIt worked. Groups sent it out on their e-mail lists, creating massive volume: Social Security Works contributed 15,000 supportive comments, the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees generated 24,000, and Credo Action \u2014 a wireless phone company with a liberal bent \u2014 sent a whopping 50,000.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an election, however; comment volume alone doesn\u2019t determine the outcome. Agencies only have to show that they responded to substantive arguments. \"In terms of the content of the information, there isn\u2019t a lot of new information that these mass mailings are generating,\u201d Coglianese says. \u201cThere\u2019s no regulator that\u2019s tallying that up and saying 85 percent favor this and 15 percent don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBut even if they\u2019re not contributing new information, CAP\u2019s Anna Chu says the comments help give people in the administration the confidence to stand firm. \u201cOnce the proposal\u2019s out there, one of the things is to make sure that it doesn\u2019t get watered down,\u201d says Chu. \u201cIt\u2019s not final yet. And we want to make sure we keep it where it is.\u201d\n\nBecause of the delay in getting the rule into proposal form, advocates have an additional sense of urgency to get it done. Congress has a certain amount of time to override the rule through the Congressional Review Act, and if Obama isn\u2019t around to veto it, the whole thing could be invalidated. If that happens, the department would be barred from attempting to regulate in that area again \u2014 like was at the outset of the Bush administration in the 2000s, when Republicans rolled back a rule aimed at curbing repetitive motion stress that Bill Clinton\u2019s Labor Department had finalized.\n\n\"If President Trump or Walker were presented with a resolution of disapproval, they would sign it,\u201d Eisenbrey says. \u201cAnd if they did, it would have really devastating consequences.\u201d\n\nEven with a friendly administration, progressives know they have to defend new rules because businesses and Republicans are trying hard to shoot them down.\n\nThey have a few heavy hitters in their corner. In the overtime case, all four Wage and Hour Administrators who served in George W. Bush\u2019s Department of Labor are now working for employer-side law firms, helping major employers to head off a drastic change to a rule they helped update or administer just eleven years ago. They argue the Obama overhaul is coming too soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unseemly,\u201d says one of the Bush veterans, Paul DeCamp, who is writing official comments on behalf of organizations he declines to name, as well as for his own firm, Jackson Lewis. \u201cWhen the department is seen as acting based on politics, the courts are showing less and less deference to what the department thinks.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Littler Mendelson\u2019s Tammy McCutchen heading up the Chamber of Commerce\u2019s effort, and Seyfarth Shaw\u2019s Alex Passantino serving as general counsel for the Partnership to Protect Workplace Opportunity, a purpose-built coalition of trade associations representing everyone from auto dealers to travel agents. The only Bush-era Wage and Hour Administrator not actively advocating is Al Robinson, who has been fielding questions about the rule from Ogletree Deakins.\n\nThe campaign followed a now-familiar playbook. Initially, employer coalitions worked with Republican legislators to hold congressional hearings and send letters expressing opposition to the administration\u2019s proposal. Although Congress has no formal role in the process, agencies have to pay attention, because lawmakers do have several points of leverage: Angry legislators could bar funding for implementation of the new rule, or even change the agency\u2019s statutory authority.\n\nWhen the overtime rule came out, it appeared that business input may have worked: The department proposed no change to the \u201cduties test,\u201d which governs what tasks might exempt a worker from overtime. Employers had emphasized that changing that part of the Bush-era standard would be confusing and lead to more litigation. Still opponents were not satisfied, saying a move to essentially double the level above which white-collar workers would be exempt from overtime \u2014 from $23,660 per year to $50,440 \u2014 suggests their concerns were not taken seriously enough.\n\n\"I just believe they were primarily ignored, and there\u2019s an agenda, and the agenda is clear, and it\u2019s not favorable to business,\u201d says Bill Thorne, senior vice president for communications and public affairs at the National Retail Federation, which has put perhaps the most energy of anyone into the overtime fight.\n\nAfter the rule dropped, the NRF brought 200 business owners to Capitol Hill to tell legislators how it would impact them, and put out studies illustrating the cost to employers and negative effects on employees. The federation spent more money lobbying in the second quarter of 2015 than it has since records start appearing in 2000 \u2014 although it\u2019s not broken out by issue or by agency, the overtime campaign likely took up a large chunk of the total.\n\nMeanwhile, both sides have tried to claim the allegiance of the non-profit sector, which is torn between a belief that the rule might help low-income people and the recognition that complying with it could strain their own budgets. Accordingly, many nonprofits have avoided allying themselves with either side.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do politics. We can\u2019t be dragged into it,\u201d says David Thompson, vice president of public policy for the National Council of Nonprofits. \u201cThe business community would love for us to be a shield. The labor community would love for us to be a champion.\u201d\n\nWhen all the comments are filed and grievances aired, all that matters is the Labor Department\u2019s convictions\u2014 weighed against the possibility that pursuing them might lead to outsized negative consequences down the road. So far, there isn\u2019t a proposal to cut off funding for implementation of the rule or revoke any of the Department\u2019s authority. But rules do end up getting snagged in court, as the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s landmark air quality rule did in June. Given any legal opening, just one key comment overlooked, the overtime rule could be challenged as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over, and these things have a way of dragging on,\u201d says Thorne, of NRF.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article said the Department of Labor proposed raising the salary threshold above which white collar managers are entitled to overtime pay; in fact the Department proposed raising the threshold below which managers must receive overtime.
