With so many people willing to help, the Rescue Mission had to turn away volunteers.\n\n\"It's hard to turn them away,\" said Chambers.\n\nFor months volunteers have been looking forward to giving back.\n\nBrenda Parker and Vicki Iseminger, volunteers from Hancock Bank said, \"This is the first year we've done it and we hope it will be an ongoing thing.\"\n\n\"It's not my first time, but I do it yearly,\" said Siples.\n\nJim and Karen Rodi, first time volunteers said, \"Our family's not coming in until Saturday, so we're providing some time.\"\n\nEach table was assigned four of those volunteers who waited on their peers hand and foot.\n\nIt was a simple gesture that made those who can't afford to eat in a restaurant, feel like a king or queen.\n\n\"All the servers and everybody that came out was awesome and great,\" said Duncan.\n\nWhether you were giving or receiving, everyone walked away with a full stomach and a life long memory.\n\n'We're just thrilled to be here,\" said Iseminger. \"We just want to love on these people we want them to know that they're important they're special and that God loves them.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "While many people sat around their tables Thursday in their homes filled with holiday spirit, some didn't have that luxury.\nTo make those less fortunate feel at home in their community, the Panama City Rescue Mission stepped up to the plate, and handed them out.", "language": "english", "author": "Samantha Read", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Panama-City-Rescue-Mission-Feeds-Hundreds-355119791.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/RESCUE+MISSION11.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "While many people sat around their tables Thursday in their homes filled with holiday spirit, some didn't have that luxury.\nTo make those less fortunate feel at home in their community, the Panama City Rescue Mission stepped up to the plate, and handed them out.", "title": "Panama City Rescue Mission feeds hundreds"}, "twitter": {"description": "While many people sat around their tables Thursday in their homes filled with holiday spirit, some didn't have that luxury.\nTo make those less fortunate feel at home in their community, the Panama City Rescue Mission stepped up to the plate, and handed them out.", "title": "Panama City Rescue Mission feeds hundreds", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Panama-City-Rescue-Mission-Feeds-Hundreds-355119791.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/RESCUE+MISSION11.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Panama City Rescue Mission feeds hundreds", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Panama City Rescue Mission feeds"}, "article_summary": "To make those less fortunate feel at home in their community, the Panama City Rescue Mission stepped up to the plate, and handed them out.\nThose words, thank you, are the reason the Panama City Rescue Mission has once again hosted an outstanding Thanksgiving meal, free to the community.\nWith so many people willing to help, the Rescue Mission had to turn away volunteers.\nFor weeks the Rescue Mission has been preparing a Thanksgiving feast for more than 700 people, and even children understand why.\n\"Thank you,\" said Jason Duncan, who spent his Thanksgiving at the Rescue Mission."}
