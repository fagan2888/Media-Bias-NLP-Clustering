Fred Upton exaggerated the impact of the Affordable Care Act when he claimed that \u201cperhaps as many as 80 to 90 million Americans with employer-based health care are going to lose their plans\u201d by late this year.\n\nUpton doesn\u2019t mean that those millions of Americans would no longer have health insurance through their employers. And these workers won\u2019t be receiving cancellation notices in the mail. Instead, he\u2019s talking about health plans losing grandfathered status, which means they are exempted from some requirements of the Affordable Care Act because they existed before the law was enacted.\n\nThe claim, which other Republican lawmakers have repeated, is based on the premise that half of all employer plans were expected to lose grandfathered status in 2013, and more would do so in 2014. But all employer plans are expected to eventually lose such status, and most workers are already on non-grandfathered policies \u2014 without incident. Many plans have been and will be merely modified without employees even knowing it, particularly for those working at large firms.\n\nIt\u2019s true that some businesses will send workers to the state or federal exchanges, the most direct case of \u201closing\u201d an employer plan \u2014 but there won\u2019t be 80 million of those workers.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that those with employer-based insurance would decline by a net 7 million in 2019 compared with what would have happened in the absence of the Affordable Care Act, with 11 million losing an offer of insurance from an employer, 3 million choosing to get their insurance from another source, and 7 million gaining insurance at work.\n\nNo \u2018Pink Slips\u2019\n\nUpton made his claim on Fox News on Dec. 11. \u201cPeople are not able to keep the health care plan that they want,\u201d he said, adding that those who buy their own coverage in the individual market were having their current policies canceled because they didn\u2019t meet the law\u2019s coverage requirements. \u201cAnd we know that by a year from now, tens of millions, perhaps as many as 80 to 90 million Americans with employer-based health care are going to lose their plans as well,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Mike Rogers, also of Michigan, used the 80 million figure on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Dec. 1, saying that 80 million people \u201care going to get pink slips.\u201d No, they won\u2019t.\n\nUpton\u2019s office directed us to a column on Forbes.com by contributor Avik Roy \u2014 a former health care adviser to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute \u2014 who criticized President Obama\u2019s claim that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan,\u201d saying it wasn\u2019t true and the administration had known it. (We\u2019ve long debunked the president\u2019s claim as well.) Roy explained that the Obama administration had given a mid-range estimate back in 2010 that about half of employer plans would have lost grandfathered status by the end of 2013. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 158 million people (non-elderly) had employment-based coverage in 2013, so half of employer plans would be about 80 million people.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s estimates were also cumulative for 2013, with an estimated 38 percent of employer plans already losing grandfathered status in 2012.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research & Educational Trust\u2019s Employer Health Benefits Survey, those mid-range estimates may have been too low, and the majority of insured workers (52 percent) were already on non-grandfathered plans in 2012. For 2013, 64 percent of insured workers were on non-grandfathered plans, with the remainder, 36 percent, still on plans that had retained grandfathered status. That would be about 57 million Americans who were still on employer plans with grandfathered status in 2013.\n\nBut employers regularly make changes to health plans, and if employers significantly change workers\u2019 cost sharing or employer premium contributions for a grandfathered plan, it\u2019s no longer grandfathered. In at least some cases, plans will be \u2014 or already were \u2014 modified. In other cases, employers may elect a new health plan from their insurer.\n\n\u201cEmployers change plans all the time,\u201d Gary Claxton, vice president and director of the Health Care Marketplace Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told FactCheck.org. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be notified if your plan is grandfathered. But you get a lot of notices,\u201d so workers may not be aware of it. That is, unless employees think they should be getting something that they\u2019re not, such as preventive coverage with no cost-sharing, a benefit of the law that grandfathered plans don\u2019t have to provide.\n\nAnd the reverse is true: Many employees may not be aware that their plan wasn\u2019t grandfathered and changes were made. \u201cTypically, the moderate-sized employers would pick an insurance company that would provide benefits,\u201d says Sabrina Corlette, senior research fellow and project director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. \u201cEven if that insurance company is no longer providing a grandfathered plan, that doesn\u2019t mean the employer is dropping coverage entirely. \u2026 It\u2019s probably just getting a slightly different plan.\u201d\n\nUpton\u2019s office also pointed to an American Enterprise Institute online post that referred to the administration\u2019s 2010 estimates on grandfathering, saying: \u201cBased on the administration\u2019s own estimates from 2010, [AEI economist Stan] Veuger projects that tens of millions of people with employer-based insurance policies will be \u2018affected\u2019 by Obamacare, their plans either modified or cancelled.\u201d\n\nOf course, a \u201cmodified\u201d plan is not the same thing as a plan being \u201ccancelled.\u201d And, as we already noted, employer plans are modified regularly, in the normal course of business.\n\nVeuger said in an email to FactCheck.org that it was difficult to give a more precise estimate than \u201ctens of millions,\u201d because the estimate depends on \u201cwhat assumptions you make, what constitutes a material change, and how many current plans meet what requirements.\u201d\n\nUpton\u2019s office also included quotes from the conservative American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Scott Gottlieb, who wrote that many small businesses, with up to 50 employees, had renewed their non-grandfathered health plans early in 2013, so they won\u2019t face some of the law\u2019s requirements for 2014 until next fall. \u201cStarting in October 2014, many employees of small businesses will start getting the same notices that are now being mailed to individuals, informing [them] that their existing health plans are also being cancelled,\u201d he predicted.\n\nNon-grandfathered small group plans face more potential changes than large group plans, as we\u2019ll explain. And since small businesses can use the exchanges and some would be eligible for tax credits (as would their lower-wage workers), some employers may switch to those policies. Gottlieb didn\u2019t give an estimate for how many workers he thought could be affected. As we said, the nonpartisan CBO estimated that those with employer-based insurance would decline by a net 7 million in 2019.\n\nGrandfathered No More\n\nLet\u2019s step back and look at what a grandfathered plan is and how it might change once it loses that status.\n\nEmployer plans that existed in March 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, had grandfathered status. That doesn\u2019t mean those plans were completely immune from requirements under the law. Like other health policies, grandfathered plans had to eliminate annual and lifetime caps on essential coverage, provide coverage for dependents up to age 26, issue rebates if they failed to spend 80 percent or 85 percent (for large group plans) of premiums on medical costs, and eliminate coverage exclusions for preexisting conditions. If \u201closing\u201d a health plan is defined as any change in coverage, then most Americans would have already \u201clost\u201d their plans, minus any cancellation notice. And people would \u201close\u201d their plans all the time, with or without the ACA.\n\nBut there are other requirements under the law that grandfathered plans don\u2019t have to worry about: They\u2019re exempted from covering preventive benefits without cost sharing \u2014 such as cancer screenings, and having an external appeals process for policyholders whose claims were denied. In the small group market (for firms with up to 50 workers), plans also have to cover the law\u2019s essential health benefits, which include mental health services and prescription drugs, and they can\u2019t rate policies based on health status. They\u2019re also subject to federal or state review of premium increases greater than 10 percent. In 2016, the law requires the small group market to include businesses with up to 100 employees.\n\nLosing grandfathered status could be a bigger deal for small employers, because of these additional requirements. If the small group was healthy, it would want to continue pricing based on health status; whereas, if a small group policy includes those with health conditions, it might be better to give up grandfathering status, as KFF\u2019s Claxton explained.\n\nIn fact, workers at large firms were less likely than those at small firms to still be on a grandfathered plan in 2013. Just 30 percent of covered workers at firms with 200 or more employees had a grandfathered plan; 49 percent at firms with three to 199 employees had grandfathered policies, according to the KFF/HRET survey.\n\nAccording to administration regulations, insurance plans can lose grandfathered status if any one of these changes are made:\n\nThe benefits for diagnosing or treating a health condition are eliminated.\n\nThe employer contribution to premiums is decreased by more than 5 percent points.\n\nCost-sharing requirements are increased above a certain amount (deductibles are increased by more than medical inflation plus 15 percentage points).\n\nWorkers with health insurance also could switch from a grandfathered plan to another non-grandfathered policy by simply changing jobs or selecting a different plan during open enrollment with their current employer.\n\nEmployers make changes to policies in light of rising medical costs. But in some cases, says Claxton, \u201cinsurers may not have allowed employers to keep a grandfathered plan.\u201d The insurer could have stopped offering it.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many employers think it\u2019s that important\u201d to keep grandfathered status, says Claxton. \u201cFor a large employer, it\u2019s not terribly important.\u201d\n\nTimothy S. Jost, a health care expert who holds the Robert L. Willett Family Professorship of Law at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, agrees. \u201cIn the large group market, there are very few changes that are going to be happening in 2014,\u201d he told FactCheck.org. Once a large employer plan loses grandfathered status, it would have to cover preventive services with no cost sharing and add an external appeals process \u2014 \u201cnot huge, radical expensive changes,\u201d Jost says.\n\nSmall employers may face bigger changes, since they\u2019ll also have to cover essential health benefits, as defined by the administration. Jost says most plans cover these anyway. \u201cLiterally it is not true that 80 to 90 million people are losing their coverage,\u201d he says.\n\nWe asked Aon Hewitt, a human resources consulting and insurance brokerage firm, how concerned businesses were with keeping grandfathered health plans. J.D. Piro, a senior vice president on health and benefits, told us in an email that keeping grandfathered status will be a priority for some employers, but for many, making changes to their plans was more important \u201cespecially if the plans already comply with most of the ACA rules.\u201d\n\nPiro: Based on our observations, it is not a matter of if an employer plan will lose grandfathered status, but when. We expect most employer plans will lose grandfathered status due to actions around annual enrollment. Redesigning plans or changing deductibles and copayments will trigger the loss of grandfathering. For many employers, making these changes is more important than maintaining grandfathered status, especially if the plans already comply with most of the ACA rules. For some employers, however, retaining grandfathered status will be a priority.\n\nThere will be some workers, particularly at small businesses, who may feel the effects of their policies losing grandfathered status \u2014 especially if their employer decides to switch insurance carriers, get coverage from the exchanges, or drop coverage. Other workers may not even notice a modification in their policies. Certainly 80 million or 90 million aren\u2019t going to \u201close\u201d their health plans or \u201cget pink slips\u201d in 2014 by no longer having grandfathered plans.\n\n\u2014 Lori Robertson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Obama administration\u2019s estimates were also cumulative for 2013, with an estimated 38 percent of employer plans already losing grandfathered status in 2012.\nBut all employer plans are expected to eventually lose such status, and most workers are already on non-grandfathered policies \u2014 without incident.\nIt\u2019s true that some businesses will send workers to the state or federal exchanges, the most direct case of \u201closing\u201d an employer plan \u2014 but there won\u2019t be 80 million of those workers.\nFor 2013, 64 percent of insured workers were on non-grandfathered plans, with the remainder, 36 percent, still on plans that had retained grandfathered status.\nWe expect most employer plans will lose grandfathered status due to actions around annual enrollment."}
