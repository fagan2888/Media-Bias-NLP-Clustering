A new study just adds one more benefit to that already lengthy list: Eating wild blueberries in particular, known as \u201cbilberries,\u201d can help reduce the negative effects of a high-fat diet and fight obesity.The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Eastern Finland, and found that bilberries were beneficial for improving blood pressure and nutrition-derived inflammatory responses. Low-grade inflammation as well as high blood pressure are often linked to obesity and obesity-related diseases such as diabetes. \u201cLow-grade metabolic inflammation and hypertension are primary mechanisms involved in obesity-associated adverse health effects,\u201d the authors wrote in the abstract. \u201cBerries, especially Nordic wild blueberries (bilberries), represent an important source of dietary anthocyanins, a group of polyphenols with potential beneficial effects to combat obesity-associated metabolic disturbances.\u201d\n\nFor the study, the researchers fed mice a high-fat diet for three months. Different groups of mice had diets containing either five percent or 10 percent of freeze-dried bilberries, and the researchers examined the effects, focusing particularly on inflammatory cell and cytokine levels, systolic blood pressure, glucose tolerance, insulin, and weight gain. They found that the mice placed on a high-fat diet gained more weight, and experienced negative changes in glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as higher blood pressure \u2014 of course. But the bilberries actually lowered the inflammation associated with a high-fat diet and improved their outlooks.\u201cBilberries constitute an integral part of the Nordic diet and they could be better utilized also elsewhere in the world,\u201d the University of Eastern Finland press release said. \u201cBilberries are associated with several beneficial health effects and their use involves plenty of traditional wisdom.\u201dBilberries aren\u2019t quite the same as blueberries. They\u2019re native to Northern Europe and are relatives of blueberries. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, bilberries have been used for hundreds of years in both jams and pies, and in medicine. Because they contain plant pigments called anthocyanosides, which serve as antioxidants, bilberries offset free radicals in the body and prevent damage to cells.\n\nWhile the study doesn\u2019t give you a green light to go ahead and eat a fatty diet filled with mac and cheese and hamburgers, just to devour several cups of bilberries right after, it\u2019s comforting to know that eating certain fruits can help you out after a night of cheating on your diet.Source: Mykk\u00e4nen OT, Huotari A, Herzig K-H, et al.
