The other is $20,000 raise given to city Treasurer Adam Cloud that nobody seems to remember. And, soon, Hartford will have a new mayor in place to deal with both.\n\nWNPR spoke with Mayor-elect Luke Bronin to get his take. When it comes to the stadium, he was clear -- the developer, the team, and the city have to come together to make sure a playable field is made ready by April. But he's not interested in spending anymore city money.\n\n\"I have no intention or desire to spend more money on a stadium that the taxpayers of the city of Hartford have already spent upwards of $60 million on,\" Bronin said.\n\nAs for Cloud, the city council may take up a measure to rescind his new raise Monday night. In November, Cloud got a $20,000 raise that was retroactive to July. He said the council approved it in its budget. But no one on the council remembers doing so. Neither does outgoing Mayor Pedro Segarra.\n\nBronin wouldn't say whether he supported the council measure. But he stressed transparency.\n\n\"That's a discussion that Treasurer Cloud should have with the city council, the city council which he said adopted that budget,\" Bronin said. \"For me, I want to understand better how this all came about.\"\n\nCloud has tried to get a raise from the city before. The council approved it, but Segarra vetoed it.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Two issues are swirling in the capital city -- one is whether the new minor league baseball stadium will be finished on time and on budget.
