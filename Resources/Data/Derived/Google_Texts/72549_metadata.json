He spoke with Drudge.\n\nDuring the impromptu interview, Drudge recounted a meeting with an unnamed Supreme Court justice.\n\n\u201cI had a Supreme Court judge tell me \u2014 to my face \u2014 it\u2019s over for me. That\u2019s it Matt; it\u2019s over. They\u2019ve got the votes now to enforce copyright law. You\u2019re out of there.\u201d\n\nDrudge urged Americans to \u201cbe your greatest now\u201d because \u201ctime is limited.\u201d Clearly, Drudge was not particularly optimistic.\n\nDrudge continued to recount the judge\u2019s words. \u201cThey\u2019re getting ready for these decisions to come. You thought Obamacare was shocking? Wait until copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines \u2026\u201d\n\nAfter Scalia was found lying in unwrinkled bedclothes and a pillow over his head, Jones insinuated that the aforementioned judge was none other than Antonin Scalia.\n\n\u201cLike a Supreme Court justice, just last year, told Matt Drudge at dinner, \u2018No, they\u2019ve told us they\u2019re banning free speech next year\u2019\u2026 And now somebody\u2019s dead. I\u2019m not allowed to tell you which Supreme Court justice, but I think you can figure it out,\u201d Jones remarked.\n\nScalia was easily the most public originalist on the bench. He routinely made trips to national news outlets for interviews, and he frequently warned of impending tyranny.\n\nIn 2013, Scalia gave a speech in which he described the fall of Germany \u2014 at the time \u201cthe most advanced country in the world\u201d \u2014 as occurring largely because \u201cjudges began to interpret the law in ways that reflected \u2018the spirit of the age.\u2019 \u201d Scalia delivered a variation of the speech on numerous occasions.\n\nScalia understandably took a security detail with him almost always, but declined one for his hunting trip to Cibolo Creek in southwestern Texas. The owner of the ranch, John Poindexter, was surprised when Scalia did not join him for breakfast. Poindexter came back after lunch and again received no response from the bedroom, at which point he unlocked the door and found the judge dead.\n\n\u201cWe discovered the judge in bed, a pillow over his head. His bed clothes were unwrinkled,\u201d Poindexter noted. The ranch owner, who happened to donate to Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns, made no insinuation that he suspected foul play.\n\nDespite the authorities quickly labeling the death a result of \u201cnatural causes,\u201d myriad activists are concerned that Scalia could, conceivably, have been killed. William Gheen claimed \u201cthe horrid reactions and comments expressed by many liberals online illustrate that Scalia was hated by many people.\u201d\n\nGheen continued by explaining the significance of the death in terms of the 2016 docket. \u201cScalia\u2019s death means the Supreme Court is now very likely to rubber stamp Obama\u2019s unconstitutional amnesty orders \u2026 and take deep left turns on abortion, gun rights, or anything the liberals have ever dreamed of.\u201d\n\nPerhaps those decisions would have gone politically left with the judge alive, as Scalia himself predicted in his dire warning to Matt Drudge. Now that he\u2019s gone, those decisions will face no serious opposition whatever.\n\nThe repercussions alone beg the question. Was Scalia assassinated?\n\nIf Scalia was killed by the forces who want a politically left agenda to sweep through during Obama\u2019s final year, though, why would the assassins leave a pillow on top of Scalia\u2019s head?\n\nPerhaps the elites are dog whistling to the last few pockets of informed, empathetic citizens who realize how much trouble we\u2019re in.\n\nThe message is this: \u201cIf you try to stand against our agenda and we can\u2019t intimidate you, we\u2019ll just kill you. We\u2019ll even leave a note on your dead body that reads, \u2018Yeah, we killed him, what the hell are you gonna do about it?\u2019\u201d\n\nThen again \u2014 maybe Scalia did have a heart attack right as he was getting into bed and the agony didn\u2019t cause him to writhe about or make any effort to stay alive. Instead, maybe he seized a nearby pillow and calmly released it onto his face as he died, so as not to disturb his pajama palls.\n\nEither way, a colossus has been toppled.\n\nLet\u2019s say Obama ignores the Democrat resolution that bans presidents from making Supreme Court recess appointments. Let\u2019s say he makes a nomination. Let\u2019s say the Republicans block it. If Hillary becomes president, she will nominate Obama. Hillary said just last year that \u201che\u2019d definitely make for a great Supreme Court justice.\u201d\n\nThis could not happen without a Supreme Court judge retiring or dying. This is why the left is blithely applauding his demise on every social platform.\n\nScalia died right on time.\n\nGraham Helsabeck is an Asheboro native.
