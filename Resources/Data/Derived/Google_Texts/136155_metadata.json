All of a sudden, every kid was getting a Common Core education. The whole thing just materialized before we got a chance to think about it!\n\nIt seems that way, right? Well, that\u2019s because it is that way. By design.\n\nThrough a combination of lavish spending by Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates and swift movement by the Obama administration, the Common Core standards that have now become so controversial were instituted pretty much before anyone knew what was happening. And of course \u2013 this is the Obama administration we\u2019re talking about \u2013 without the cumbersome, annoying intrusion of democratic processes.\n\nThat\u2019s the point of a superb article published recently in the Washington Post.
