Clearly \u2013 you cannot trust them. They are people\u2019s opinions based on things like how polite the receptionist is \u2013 NOT helpful when it comes to the need for real care.\n\nSecond \u2013 that there are ways to find a doctor and his or her credentials online that are safe and useful, including information about malpractice.\n\nAnd finally \u2013 that just because a doctor is nice, does not mean he or she is competent \u2013 and vice versa. If you ask a friend for a referral to a doctor, and that friend uses the word \u201cnice\u201d \u2013 dig deeper!\n\nAs we move into 2014, and the Affordable Care Act kicks in, finding the right doctor is bound to become more difficult. But that does not mean we can or should take shortcuts.
