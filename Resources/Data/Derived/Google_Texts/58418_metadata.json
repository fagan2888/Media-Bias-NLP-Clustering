But most of the time these activities are cut short as his body, stricken with sickle cell anemia since birth, fills with pain.\n\n\"It just randomly happens,\" Newsome of Des Moines said. \"There's no really preventing it or seeing it coming.\"\n\nGetting insurance to cover his health care adequately all of these years has not been easy, but at least he has has had insurance the past year. Some other African-American families in Iowa with low incomes do not, adding to difficulties they face getting health care.\n\nA University of Iowa Public Policy Center study in December 2013 put the problem into perspective, showing that African-American and Latino Iowans do not have the same access to adequate health care that Asian and white Iowans have.\n\nThe Public Policy Center went on to say in its report, which used data from a child and family health survey conducted in fall 2010 and spring 2011, that Iowa's African-Americans and Latinos are more likely to need medical care, even though they are more unlikely than Asian or white Iowans to receive it.\n\nThe disparities are a result of varying factors, the Public Policy Center report said, including a lower quality of care in general, higher-than-normal unmet need for care, poor diets, a higher likelihood to seek care from a hospital emergency room, and fewer safe and supportive neighborhoods.\n\nSocial aspects, including someone's poverty level, neighborhood, culture or race, account for 90 percent of what affects health status, the study's authors concluded.\n\n\"The causes of health disparity vary, but we need to look beyond health care,\" said Dr. Peter Damiano, the director of the Iowa Public Policy Center and its health policy research program. \"Iowa needs to be looking at behavior, genetics and environment.\"\n\nDisparity is defined as a lack of similarity or equality.\n\nNewsome's mother, Charice Williams, did not have health insurance for herself or her children until she signed up under the Affordable Care Act in 2013.\n\n\"Even though I am low-income, I am still over income for things. Everything goes by your gross income instead of what you really bring home as your net pay,\" said Williams, who works part time for the city of Des Moines so that she can spend time caring for her son.\n\nThe Public Policy Center study focused on the several factors that create the disparity, including overall health status, insurance coverage, need and access to care, lifestyle, and family and social environment.\n\nThe study pointed out that more than 90 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander and white children in Iowa had an overall health rating of \"excellent\" or \"very good.\" This compares with a 76 percent health rating in the same categories for African-American children and 69 percent for Hispanic children in the state.\n\nA lifetime of dealing with illness\n\nNewsome was 3 years old before Williams learned that the seizures he was suffering from were related to sickle cell anemia, a genetic disease that primarily afflicts African-Americans. It results in an insufficient supply of healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen through the body.\n\n\"Usually I start hurting in my legs, arms or back, and the pain just progresses,\" Newsome said. \"I try to handle it as well as I can at home, but it usually gets to a point where it's intolerable, so we go to the hospital.\"\n\nAccording to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, sickle cell anemia affects 70,000 to 100,000 people in the United States. The disease is found in 1 of every 500 African-American births, the institute said.\n\nNo cure exists. Sickle cell anemia is treated with strong pain medications and fluids. Newsome takes a minimum of 22 pills a day, although that number can go up depending on how persistent and extreme the pain is.\n\nNewsome's immediate future has been graduating this month from a Des Moines Public Schools-run accelerated program for students with chronic illnesses, and a bone marrow transplant in early 2015.\n\nWilliams receives Title 19 benefits through the state to help pay for her son's medication.\n\nWilliams said she is fortunate to have Blank Children's Hospital's medical team in Des Moines, but the care comes at a price. The family has to make difficult decisions when it comes to money each month. \"When he's really sick and I can't get away from the hospital, every day I'm not able to go to work, I'm not getting paid,\" she said.\n\nOne hospital stay was nine weeks and cost close to $900,000, she said.\n\nLifestyle affects health\n\nThe Public Policy Center report said 3 percent of Iowa's African-American children were not covered by health insurance during the 2010-11 survey. The rate for Iowa's white children was 2 percent. The rate jumped to 10 percent for Latino children in Iowa, the study showed.\n\nSix of every 10 African American children in Iowa were in public insurance programs like Medicaid at the time of the study. Five of every 10 were Hispanic. Between 1 and 2, on average, of every 10 white Iowa children were in the program.\n\nPoverty-based problems are move prevalent for African-American Iowans, even though they comprised 3.3 percent of the state's population in 2013, because 35.5 percent were living in poverty in 2012, the most recent figures from the Iowa Data Center show. That poverty rate was close to triple the 12.7 percent rate for white Iowans, U.S. Census Bureau estimates show.\n\n\"There are small pockets of African-Americans secure in their jobs and (who) have health coverage,\" said Cynthia Hunafa, of the northwest Des Moines urban neighborhood support organization Creative Visions. \"Then there is a larger segment that isn't secure and finally a huge segment that is scrambling to get things together.\"\n\nThe lack of insurance drives the trend of going to an emergency room instead of a doctor. But using emergency room care as the only method of maintaining health is a reactive measure, rather than a preventive one.\n\n\"We are seeing a better trend now with national health care, but individuals still don't think about going to the hospital or getting adequate care, and that is when we decided to open our own clinic,\" said state Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad, D-Des Moines, Creative Visions' founder and executive director.\n\nDamiano said people in certain racial groups, such as Latinos and African-Americans, also go untreated because they have to work through complicated cultural differences. \"It's not as easy as giving someone a pill and it's done,\" he said. \"It's a challenge for providers to assess what the patient needs based on cultural barriers and lack of quality care over long periods of time.\"\n\nBut while health providers need to be knowledgeable to treat complicated patients, patients also need to be more educated about the health system, said some interviewed by IowaWatch.\n\n\"The underserved are unfamiliar with the health system, which makes it difficult to navigate and gain access,\" said Betsy Richey, data management program manager in the Iowa Department of Public Health's Bureau of Communication and Planning.\n\nResults with opportunities\n\nIsaiah Newsome hopes things start looking up 2015. He and his mother are to go to the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minn., in January so that Newsome can have a bone marrow transplant. He is to have chemotherapy to wipe out his diseased blood cells, giving new ones a chance to form normally and stop his constant pain.\n\n\"One of the issues we find in the community is people of African or Latino descent are not registered on the bone marrow registry,\" Williams said. \"I think it's just a lack of knowledge. And there's a fear of the medical community in the African-American community \u2014 a fear of the unknown because that preventative care has never been a part of our community, so people are afraid to go to the doctor.\"\n\nThe family established a GoFundMe account online, and friends have held fundraisers in their name to help with the extreme costs. The transplant is a serious procedure, but the family has high hopes that the pain will cease once they return to their Des Moines home.\n\nThen Newsome will look forward to a new goal: attend college.\n\nThis story was produced by Iowa Center for Public Affairs Journalism-IowaWatch.org, a nonprofit, online news website that collaborates with Iowa news organizations to produce explanatory and investigative reporting.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1ARO6ZA", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A report found Iowa's African-Americans and Latinos are more likely to need medical care and less likely to receive it.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "A report found Iowa's African-Americans and Latinos are more likely to need medical care and less likely to receive it.", "title": "African-Americans, Latinos struggle with health care access", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2014/12/20/health-care-access/20651991/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A report found Iowa's African-Americans and Latinos are more likely to need medical care and less likely to receive it.", "title": "African-Americans, Latinos struggle with health care access", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/19/B9315566306Z.1_20141219153854_000_GSR9F3G74.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Census Bureau", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Census Bureau", "title": "African-Americans, Latinos struggle with health care access", "author": "Tessa Lengeling", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/investigations", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06ba27a0362a386e9000c02e5ad114cc3f2d85e9/c=714-0-2550-2448/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/19/B9315566306Z.1_20141219153854_000_GSR9F3G74.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70261845367a788a3f907a9f1f073a9c7298db27/c=408-0-2856-2448/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/19/B9315566306Z.1_20141219153854_000_GSR9F3G74.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/209496ef8e15ec974055f2b972cb017799a2d254/c=0-0-3264-2448/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/19/B9315566306Z.1_20141219153854_000_GSR9F3G74.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5366816a2be01ce320de9a1b7d4fcd3d9671846/c=0-306-3264-2142&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/19/B9315566306Z.1_20141219153854_000_GSR9F3G74.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-27T11:10:03.447000-06:00", "shorthed": "African-Americans, Latinos struggle with health care access", "articleid": 20651991, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd81f7b80aef18fc9ff3cd911b276728a9998bb7/c=0-306-3264-2142/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/19/B9315566306Z.1_20141219153854_000_GSR9F3G74.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ddfec6da1e1c49c540a50418fed8521c9471641/c=944-0-2321-2448/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/19/B9315566306Z.1_20141219153854_000_GSR9F3G74.1-0.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb23\"", "article_summary": "\"The causes of health disparity vary, but we need to look beyond health care,\" said Dr. Peter Damiano, the director of the Iowa Public Policy Center and its health policy research program.\nSome other African-American families in Iowa with low incomes do not, adding to difficulties they face getting health care.\nCreative Visions includes health care information in its programming.\nGetting insurance to cover his health care adequately all of these years has not been easy, but at least he has has had insurance the past year.\nA University of Iowa Public Policy Center study in December 2013 put the problem into perspective, showing that African-American and Latino Iowans do not have the same access to adequate health care that Asian and white Iowans have."}
