These ancient renditions of the handshake were meant not only to greet someone, but to check their arms for hidden weapons \u2014 this explains why we shake with our right hands. Fast-forward a few thousand years, and we\u2019re still shaking hands, but with much more civil intentions. Nevertheless, the next person you shake hands with may be carrying a different type of weapon: infectious bacteria.\n\nResearchers from Aberystwyth University-Ceredigion in the UK show in a new study that the amount of bacteria passed from one sweaty person\u2019s hand to another through a handshake may be cause for concern \u2014 or at least enough to warrant the beginning of a fist-bumping era. \u201cA short, sweet fist bump will transmit the least bacteria,\u201d said study author David Whitworth, a senior lecturer at the university, according to USA Today. Even a high-five is better than a full-on, hands-locked-tight handshake.\n\nThe researchers\u2019 novel study involved two experiments. The first was conducted with the help of sterile gloves and a box full of Escherichia coli. With the gloves on, one of the scientists dipped their hands into the box repeatedly, making sure the glove was covered in the infectious bacteria \u2014 this one was on the less-dangerous side. Once the glove dried, the scientist then fist-bumped, high-fived, and shook the hands of another scientist who was wearing clean gloves. When these gloves were tested, the researchers found that a handshake passed on about 10 times more bacteria than a fist bump, and about two times more than a high five.\n\nIn a separate test, the researchers observed the surface area contact between two hands when performing the various greetings. By dipping their gloves in paint, the researchers saw that shaking hands caused contact in a much larger area than a high five or fist bump. Moreover, the researchers found that handshakes tended to last longer, increasing the amount of time transmission could take place.\n\nThough most of us don\u2019t go around looking for E. coli to dip our hands into, the fact remains that many of us just aren\u2019t as hygienic as we believe or hope to be. A study from last year found that only five percent of people washed their hands thoroughly after leaving a public bathroom. A certain number of these people will then get sweaty palms, and, while leaving a room, twist a presumably copper doorknob. Their sweaty palms, however, will counteract the antimicrobial properties of copper, allowing the bacteria to live until another person\u2019s hand makes contact. Then, the cycle continues.\n\nThe emphasis must be placed on washing hands, especially in health care settings, where these germs are passed around easily. With almost 40 percent of doctors worldwide failing to wash their hands, according to a World Health Organization report. Because of this, health experts have been pushing for a ban on handshakes in health care settings. \u201cIn a hospital, you really don\u2019t want people to shake hands. It\u2019s an unnecessary risk,\u201d Whitworth said, according to Fox News. Your child may be getting treated for a burn, but after a talk with his doctor and a simple goodbye handshake, you may find yourself battling at least a stomach virus or the flu.\n\nChances are the handshake will never go away. But the new research will hopefully push people to make wiser decisions when it comes to the things and people they touch. \u201cPeople rarely think about the health implications of shaking hands,\u201d Whitworth said in a press release. \u201cIf the general public could be encouraged to fist bump, there is a genuine potential to reduce the spread of infectious diseases.\u201d\n\nSource: Mela S, Whitworth D.
