Aetna said it could not break down enrollment numbers by state.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that 272,623 people in Illinois have enrolled through public insurance exchanges so far, which means Land of Lincoln attracted about 10 percent of overall enrollees. They are guaranteed to be covered by Feb. 1. The deadline to sign up for health insurance on Healthcare.gov is Feb. 15.\n\n\"We're obviously very excited and encouraged by the enrollment trends that we're seeing,\" Land of Lincoln president Jason Montrie said. \"We're proving to be a plan that's very attractive to families, individuals and businesses.\"\n\nIn 2014, just more than 4,000 people signed up for plans with Land of Lincoln, the startup insurer that benefited in part from a $160 million federal loan. The company's goal is at least 50,000, Montrie said.\n\nMontrie credited two factors for boosting enrollment: A reduction of up to 30 percent on monthly premiums and increased transparency of the plans.\n\nLand of Lincoln offers 88 plans, some of which are \"preferred partner\" plans that include network hospitals and doctors such as Presence Health, Adventist Midwest Health and Swedish Covenant Hospital.\n\nLand of Lincoln said 250 companies had selected its plans for their employees. Last year? Just \"a handful,\" Montrie said.\n\nehirst@tribpub.com\n\nTwitter @ellenjeanhirst", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "As 272,600 Illinoisans enroll in Obamacare, Land of Lincoln picks up speed", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "So far during Obamacare open enrollment, Land of Lincoln Health has signed up 27,500 Illinoisans for coverage, the company said Wednesday, a marked increase over last year.", "title": "As 272,600 Illinoisans enroll in Obamacare, Land of Lincoln picks up speed", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-land-of-lincoln-enrollment-0115-biz-20150114-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54b6dcaf/turbine/ct-land-of-lincoln-enrollment-0115-biz-20150114", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "healthcare.gov, illinois insurance, blue cross blue shield, bcbs, illinois health insurance,", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/82533620", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-01-14", "Description": "Nearly 1 in 4 new enrollees chose startup Land of Lincoln Health for health insurance on public exchanges in the first month of open enrollment.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "healthcare.gov, illinois insurance, blue cross blue shield, bcbs, illinois health insurance,"}, "article_summary": "So far during Obamacare open enrollment, Land of Lincoln Health has signed up 27,500 Illinoisans for coverage, the company said Wednesday, a marked increase over last year.\nAetna said it could not break down enrollment numbers by state.\n\"We're obviously very excited and encouraged by the enrollment trends that we're seeing,\" Land of Lincoln president Jason Montrie said.\nThe deadline to sign up for health insurance on Healthcare.gov is Feb. 15.\nOther insurance companies, including Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, UnitedHealthcare, Time Insurance and IlliniCare Health did not have enrollment numbers available."}
