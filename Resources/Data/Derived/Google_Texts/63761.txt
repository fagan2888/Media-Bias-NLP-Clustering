ROCHESTER - Goodhue’s Joel Gadient left the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester on Saturday with the best parting gift a wrestler can get. Gadient won a Section 1A title after topping St. Charles’ Alan Spaeth, 6-4, in the 126-pound bracket.

Bailee O’Reilly rebounded from a 6-2 loss to Lake City’s Shane Siewert in the 152-pound semifinals with a 19-3 technical fall over Pine Island’s Matt Riley, and a 3-1 overtime victory over Kenyon-Wanamingo’s Mason Stevenson. O’Reilly then edged Zumbrota-Mazeppa’s Caden Steffen 3-2 in a true-second-place bout to punch his ticket to St. Paul.

Kaleb O’Reilly lost a true second-place match to Z-M’s Freedom Hunt, 5-0, while Charles Dahling (182) lost 3-2 in a true second-place match to K-W’s Bailey Paquin.
