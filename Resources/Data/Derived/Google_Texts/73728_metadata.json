According to Trump more than 2,500 people were in attendance, however only 750 made it in to the high school auditorium where the real estate magnate promised to restore the American Dream and rebuild the beleaguered economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have so many victories,\u201d Trump told the audience, as the overflow crowd watched simultaneously from a second auditorium and listened outside.\n\nTrump listed off a number of polls showing him leading in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and the Carolinas. He said his heart is set on winning, not just proving a point.\n\n\u201cIf this all happens and I don\u2019t win? \u2026 Trust me I won\u2019t be happy,\u201d he told the audience who booed loudly later in his remarks when he talked about how weakly America would be led under a potential Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton presidency.\n\nInstead of America benefiting, China, Iran, and the rest of the world is taking advantage of people like those in the crowd. Trump said, referencing recent jobs cuts at Nabisco as it moves some operations to Mexico from Chicago and decrying China for its recent dramatic currency devaluation.\n\n\u201cWhat that means is you hear that sucking sound? You know what that sucking sound is?\u201d he asked\n\n\u201cJobs!\u201d shouted several people in the crowd.\n\n\u201cThat means jobs. That means money,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest theft in the history of the United States what China has done to us. We have rebuilt China. Our money has rebuilt China.\u201d\n\nBut under Trump all that would change, he said.\n\n\u201cWe will make great trade deals. We will save Social Security without cuts, we will come up with health care plans that will be phenomenal \u2014 phenomenal, \u201d he said, adding that his new healthcare system that would displease insurance companies, unlike Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do what\u2019s right for the people of this country,\u201d Trump said, adding \u201cI speak from the heart I really do.\u201d\n\nTrump Gets The Crowd\u2019s Permission To Criticize Carly Fiorina Trump appeared ultra-confident Friday. Though light on policy specifics, he thundered condemnations at weak U.S. leadership and many of his fellow contenders for president. He handed out praise for veterans, hardworking Americans, and the \u201csmart, industrious\u201d people of New Hampshire.\n\nAnyone who goes after him plummets in the polls, Trump said proudly, referencing Lindsey Graham, Rick Perry, and now Rand Paul. He returned to his staple rallying cries through illustrative anecdotes, like \u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t win anymore and it should.\u201d The other candidates on both sides are weak, and bought out by donors or with poor track records like Scott Walker. Jeb Bush is a controlled \u201cpuppet\u201d who Trump said won\u2019t fund women\u2019s health issues, a comment Trump likened to Mitt Romney\u2019s 47 percent moment.\n\nTrump said he was wary to criticize Carly Fiorina because of her gender, but then asked the crowd if they thought it was okay anyways, and to roaring approval, he went on to say she ran Hewlett Packard \u201cinto the ground.\u201d\n\nAnyone who goes after him plummets in the polls, Trump said proudly, referencing Lindsey Graham, Rick Perry, and now Rand Paul. Specific details of his platform including tax policy are to be released \u201cvery soon\u201d likely by September, according to Trump who said he has some of the brightest people in the country helping him craft his specifics.\n\nThe audience spontaneously shouted and cheered the loudest all night when Trump said: \u201cYou don\u2019t want a politically correct president.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to talk about how America needs great leaders once again and a military led by men like General Douglas MacArthur and George Patton. Much of the crowd rose to their feet waving American flags and cheering as he talked about how nobody would mess with America once he was in charge.\n\n\u201cNobody would be playing with us, nobody,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to the media prior to his speech, he emphasized that he doesn\u2019t believe Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee for president and said he believes Al Gore and Joe Biden may be \u201cinvolved at some point.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on Hillary right now,\u201d he said in response to a question from The Federalist. \u201cI think at some point she\u2019s perhaps not going to be able to run, she\u2019s going to have to end her campaign. I was saying that two months ago and everyone thought you\u2019re not right \u2026 Look at General Petraeus, his life was destroyed with a tiny fraction of what she\u2019s done \u2026 She\u2019s got much bigger problems than running for office.\u201d\n\nTrump Says He Loves Veterans And Women \u201cOur politicians have let the vets down. Rand Paul has let the vets down,\u201d he added in responding to another question about his opinion of Paul. He said Paul doing \u201cso poorly\u201d and running a losing campaign where he\u2019s \u201cusing the people of Kentucky\u201d by running for president at the same time as senator.\n\n\u201cI cherish women. Women will be taken care of better under President Trump than anybody else, Republican or Democrat.\u201d A veteran in the crowd asked if Trump would get the FBI to investigate Veterans Affairs and said the situation with veterans committing suicide and not getting proper care is worse than Trump knows. When Trump said he would order an investigation the crowd applauded loudly.\n\nDespite telling a rather mawkish story of being paid \u201ca lot\u201d of money to attend a dinner of Qatari airline officials and learning from it how outdated the U.S. airplanes often are, Trump continued to present himself as someone in touch with working people and despite his wealth, just another guy who\u2019s made it, but still cares about helping others.\n\n\u201cI think we should be much more open about campaign finance,\u201d Trump told the media before his speech, saying Bush and other candidates should fully release all their donors.\n\nOn women, Trump said he couldn\u2019t be more of a supporter of female empowerment.\n\n\u201cI cherish women. Women will be taken care of better under President Trump than anybody else, Republican or Democrat,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou can look at my company, I have many women executives. They make in many cases more money. Second question how many do you have? Many. And I\u2019m going to be introducing them over a period of time, too.\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere in the surrounding Hampton community prior to Trump\u2019s appearance was mainly bemused.\n\n\u201cHave you seen Celebrity Apprentice?\u201d a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts server asked his workmate with a laugh behind the counter as they prepared drinks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s good at reality TV, he should stick to that,\u201d a middle-aged man awaiting his order at a pizza parlor commented gruffly to the seemingly indifferent attendant behind the counter.\n\nAt the rally, however, it was an entirely different ballpark, as hundreds of people lined up several hours ahead of time to get in and supporters tripped over themselves to talk to the milling media about how Trump is their guy.\n\n\u201cSomebody needs to put Putin in his place,\u201d said supporter Carol Dawe from nearby Topsfield, Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cAmericans first,\u201d said supporter Patty Femino as she carried a stack of Trump lawn signs to put on her lawn and give to friends.\n\nFemino said she also is deeply concerned that cities nearby to where she lives in Revere, Massachusetts are sanctuary cities, with Lawrence, Massachusetts the latest to join the club.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually afraid to say it, I just found out I live in the vicinity of sanctuary cities. I\u2019m horrified,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue for me.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump is someone she\u2019s looked up to for years and Femino is very enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cI love his words, love his energy, love his passion,\u201d she said. \u201cHe does great all the time. Everyday I watch him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 17 Aug 2015 07:01:20 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The summer of Trump is powering full steam ahead in New Hampshire.", "title": "Trump Promises \u2018So Many Victories\u2019 To Pumped Crowd", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DSC_2202_opt.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-17T07:10:25+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/08/17/trump-promises-so-many-victories-to-pumped-crowd/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "The summer of Trump is powering full steam ahead in New Hampshire.", "title": "Trump Promises \u2018So Many Victories\u2019 To Pumped Crowd", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DSC_2202_opt.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": 2016, "tag": "2016,Carly Fiorina,Donald Trump,GOP Primary,Hillary Clinton,Jeb Bush,New Hampshire,Scott Walker", "published_time": "2015-08-17T07:01:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-17T07:10:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The summer of Trump is powering full steam ahead in New Hampshire."}, "article_summary": "Women will be taken care of better under President Trump than anybody else, Republican or Democrat,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cI think at some point she\u2019s perhaps not going to be able to run, she\u2019s going to have to end her campaign.\nOn women, Trump said he couldn\u2019t be more of a supporter of female empowerment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have so many victories,\u201d Trump told the audience, as the overflow crowd watched simultaneously from a second auditorium and listened outside.\nThat means money,\u201d Trump said."}
