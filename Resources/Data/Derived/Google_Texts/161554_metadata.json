The four-day Convention, taking place at the Dena\u2019ina Civic and Convention Center in downtown Anchorage, will focus on strengthening NIEA\u2019s mission of advancing comprehensive educational opportunities for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians throughout the United States. The theme of this year\u2019s Convention is Building Education through the Generations and builds upon the theme of last year\u2019s event, Building Education Nations & Communities, which took place in Rapid City, South Dakota.\n\nNIEA President Pamela Agoyo noted that, \u201cBeing home to 229 federally recognized tribes, Alaska is rich in Native history and educational leadership at the tribal level, which makes it the ideal location to host our 2014 annual Convention. Anchorage hosted NIEA\u2019s 2006 Convention and we are excited to return to the state with the most federally-recognized tribes to ensure equity for our students.\u201d\n\nThe 2,000 teachers, school administrators, tribal leaders, and higher education faculty expected to attend NIEA 2014 will have daily agendas packed with more than 100 workshops focusing on advancing educational programs for Native students. Professional development workshops will be coupled with a three-day tradeshow, where more than 125 vendors from across the country will showcase Native art, career opportunities, and educational technologies. The Convention will also feature a variety of exciting cultural activities for attendees, including a powwow and cultural feast.\n\nNative education stakeholders incorporated NIEA in 1970. The membership-driven organization has since been dedicated to the mission of advancing quality education for all American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian peoples. The Association\u2019s 2,500 members work each day to strengthen Native educational opportunities while also preserving the unique cultures and languages of Native Americans.\n\nFor more information about NIEA 2014 or to inquire about attending the Convention as a member, sponsor, or tradeshow exhibitor, please visit NIEA.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In just two months, thousands of Native education advocates will head to Anchorage, Alaska for The NIEA\u2019s 45th Annual Convention and Trade Show.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/03/national-indian-education-association-returns-alaska-155998", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/default/files/uploads/niea-student-activities.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "The National Indian Education Association Returns to Alaska"}, "abstract": "In just two months, thousands of Native education advocates will head to Anchorage, Alaska for The NIEA\u2019s 45th Annual Convention and Trade Show.", "dc": {"title": "The National Indian Education Association Returns to Alaska"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/03/national-indian-education-association-returns-alaska-155998", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "NIEA, National Indian Education Association, Native American Education, Alaska", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-03T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "The National Indian Education Association Returns to Alaska"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1c8\"", "article_summary": "In just two months, thousands of Native education advocates will head to Anchorage, Alaska for The National Indian Education Association\u2019s 45th Annual Convention and Trade Show on October 15-18.\nThe membership-driven organization has since been dedicated to the mission of advancing quality education for all American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian peoples.\nThe Association\u2019s 2,500 members work each day to strengthen Native educational opportunities while also preserving the unique cultures and languages of Native Americans.\nNative education stakeholders incorporated NIEA in 1970.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s Convention is Building Education through the Generations and builds upon the theme of last year\u2019s event, Building Education Nations & Communities, which took place in Rapid City, South Dakota."}
