That story was mostly about Wednesday afternoon's Southern Minnesota Ag Symposium; but it was a question in the forum at the end that got the most attention. That question was about a purported $2,500 savings for families because of the Affordable Care Act, known by many as ObamaCare.\n\nAnyone in attendance, or watching the news story on our air or website, knows that a certain amount of laughter came first from the audience, then the three panel members - Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Rep. Collin Peterson, and Rep. Tim Walz. That laughter became a bit more animated when Rep. Peterson quipped that he voted 'no,' so he was going to let the other two answer the question.\n\nThursday evening, national media outlets began running the story. However, they showed only a short clip from that exchange. The story accused all three panel members of laughing at someone else's suffering. It also accused all three panel members of ducking the question. Anyone in attendance that day, or watching the story in its entirety that evening, knows that nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThis is not a Democrat issue. This is not a Republican issue. This is a truth and fairness issue. We believe our story has been taken out of context to unfairly characterize that day's conversation; and unfairly characterize Sen. Klobuchar, Rep. Peterson, and Rep. Walz.\n\n- Dan Ruiter, News Director", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "Thursday night, a national television news organization showed a clip \r\nfrom one of our stories  that aired on KEYC News 12 Wednesday night", "author": "Dan Ruiter", "og": {"url": "http://www.keyc.com/story/24788798/citing-fairness-keyc-news-12-issues-clarification-of-national-media-reports", "type": "article", "description": "Thursday night, a national television news organization showed a clip \r\nfrom one of our stories  that aired on KEYC News 12 Wednesday night", "title": "Citing Fairness, KEYC News 12 Issues Clarification of National Media Reports"}, "twitter": {"title": "Citing Fairness, KEYC News 12 Issues Clarification of National Media Reports", "description": "Thursday night, a national television news organization showed a clip \r\nfrom one of our stories  that aired on KEYC News 12 Wednesday night", "card": "summary", "creator": "https://twitter.com/danruiter"}, "wnreadableurl": "citing-fairness-keyc-news-12-issues-clarification-of-national-media-reports", "msvalidate.01": "5D61EF7FE2DB9848F870002140C25738", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2014/02/21", "fb": {"app_id": 103460183161125}, "owner": "KEYC", "KEYWORDS": "keyc, keyc 12, keyc tv, mankato, mankato news, mankato weather, mankato sports, rep. tim walz, sen. amy klobuchar, rep. collin peterson", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS27", "news_keywords": "keyc, keyc 12, keyc tv, mankato, mankato news, mankato weather, mankato sports, rep. tim walz, sen. amy klobuchar, rep. collin peterson"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd191f\"", "article_summary": "We believe our story has been taken out of context to unfairly characterize that day's conversation; and unfairly characterize Sen.
