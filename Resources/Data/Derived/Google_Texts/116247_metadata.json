He said the company hoped the scoring system would encourage farmers to address the impact of agriculture on human health and the environment.\n\nAbout half the produce sold in 390 of Whole Foods'\u0080\u0099 399 stores will carry Responsibly Grown labels, although the amount will vary from store to store. The company'\u0080\u0099s British stores are not yet part of the program.\n\nAlthough a leader in the upscale segment of the food industry, Whole Foods has struggled to accelerate its sales growth this year, and even though its earnings in the quarter that ended July 6 beat analysts'\u0080\u0099 estimates, its stock is down more than 30 percent this year. The company remains saddled with a reputation for higher prices, and it is facing more competition from mainstream retailers like Walmart, which announced a big push into organics in April.\n\nThis month, Wal-Mart stole a beat on Whole Foods and announced its own plans to curb the environmental impact of the food it sells, together with plans to help shoppers learn more about the food they buy there. Among its partners in the efforts are food-processing titans like General Mills and Cargill.\n\nOn Monday, McDonald'\u0080\u0099s unveiled a social media program that allows its customers to ask questions like \u0080\"What part of the chicken goes into McNuggets?\"\u0080\u009d and \"Do your hamburgers contain pink slime?\"\n\nWhole Foods already has a program that rates animal welfare practices, an \u0080\"eco scale\" it applies to household cleaners and a program that assesses the sustainability of seafood, and next year, all the foods sold in its stores will carry labels indicating whether they contain genetically engineered ingredients.\n\nOther grocery chains have scrambled to adopt similar programs, and food manufacturers have changed formulations and packaging in response to many of those programs.\n\n\"\u0080\u009cI think this is going to put pressure on other food retailers to do something in this regard,\"\u0080\u009d said Tom Beddard, an organic farmer who is participating in the Whole Foods program.\n\nBeddard grows vegetables and melons on a total of some 2,500 acres in Florida, Georgia and Pennsylvania collectively known as Lady Moon Farms. His produce is already certified as organic, and he employs his workers year-round, moving them around the three locations rather than simply to pick a crop. The farms are also certified for food safety practices and fair trade.\n\nHe is able to use those certifications to increase his score in the Whole Foods program. But only one Lady Moon Farms earned the \"\u0080\u009cbest\" designation.\n\n\"We were a little weak on our use of renewable resources in Georgia and Florida,\" Beddard said.\n\nThe program inspired a vigorous discussion at the annual meeting in March of growers for Red Tomato, a nonprofit marketing and distribution platform for small growers, according to John Lyman, one of its members. While the Red Tomato growers have an \"\u0080\u009ceco-certification\u00e2\u0080\u009d program they follow, Lyman said, Whole Foods\" requirements go beyond that into farmworker welfare, conservation, waste reduction and clean energy.\n\n\"\u0080\u009cFor instance, they want to know about earthworms and how many I have in my soil,\"\u0080\u009d said Lyman, whose family has grown apples, peaches, pears and various berries on its farm in Middlefield, Connecticut, since 1741. \"I thought, How do I count every earthworm? It'\u0080\u0099s going to take a while.\"\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he said that he welcomed the opportunity to learn from other growers through the program and that it gives a grower like him, whose produce has earned a \"\u0080\u009cgood\" rating to start, incentives to try new practices.\n\nCompared to the meat and seafood it sells, a greater percentage of Whole Foods' fruits, flowers and vegetables comes from overseas, where standards for pesticide use, soil amendments and other things are different, but foreign producers also will have to comply.\n\n\"\u0080\u009cIf you pressed me to identify what I think is the component that'\u0080\u0099s going to make the biggest difference for people shopping in their stores, it'\u0080\u0099s the application of a pesticide policy universally to anyone shipping fresh produce or floral items, whether they'\u0080\u0099re coming from India or Mexico,\" said Charles Benbrook, a professor at Washington State University who works on analytical systems for measuring food quality and safety and was among the experts who helped Whole Foods develop its program.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/10/wholefoods.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1cb7\"", "article_summary": "He is able to use those certifications to increase his score in the Whole Foods program.\n\"\u0080\u009cI think this is going to put pressure on other food retailers to do something in this regard,\"\u0080\u009d said Tom Beddard, an organic farmer who is participating in the Whole Foods program.\nWhile the Red Tomato growers have an \"\u0080\u009ceco-certification\u00e2\u0080\u009d program they follow, Lyman said, Whole Foods\" requirements go beyond that into farmworker welfare, conservation, waste reduction and clean energy.\nAbout half the produce sold in 390 of Whole Foods'\u0080\u0099 399 stores will carry Responsibly Grown labels, although the amount will vary from store to store.\n\"\u0080\u009cThis is the latest example of our commitment to transparency and sustainable agriculture,\" said Matt Rogers, who handles standards and sourcing at Whole Foods."}
