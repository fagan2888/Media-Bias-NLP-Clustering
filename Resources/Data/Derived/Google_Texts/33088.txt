EDITOR: On Feb. 16, Wisconsin will hold a “non-partisan” primary election. This is to narrow the field for school board, county board and state judicial candidates. These early primaries typically have exceedingly low turnout.

One race that is critical for those who care about good government and citizens’ rights is the State Supreme Court election. Justice Rebecca Bradley was recently appointed by Gov. Scott Walker and now faces her first election to the state’s highest court.

Justice Rebecca Bradley has a proven record of being fair-minded and dedicated to applying the law in spirit and in word. Justice Bradley understands that the duty of the court is to apply the law and not to create law by legislating from the bench.

Justice Bradley is a conservative common sense Justice. Your vote is vital in these times.

Bill Elmhorst,
