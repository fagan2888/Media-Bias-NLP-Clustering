Gridlock and personality clashes prevented action on many policy proposals -- including ideas strongly supported by the public, such as comprehensive immigration reform and background checks -- from being debated or enacted into law.\n\nHowever, the public\u2019s ire wasn\u2019t limited to a single party, as both Democrats and Republicans declined in popularity this year. That said, the Republican Party certainly took much-harder hits from the inside. From a failed tea party faction revolt against House Speaker John Boehner, to the first government shutdown in 17 years, the GOP had some very embarrassing moments this year, including tussles that have sullied its brand image or, depending on how you vote, reinforced support for the party.\n\nHere are some of the Republicans' most embarrassing moments of 2013:\n\nFailed Revolt Puts Boehner Back In Charge\n\nThe year began on a sour note, as many Republicans were furious over the fiscal cliff deal that increased taxes on individuals making $400,000 and more and families earning more than $450,000. Speaker Boehner supported this bill, though Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia and many House Republicans opposed it.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nWith mostly Democratic support, the fiscal cliff deal cleared the lower chamber, 257-167. Later, the rumor of a House GOP revolt against the speaker gripped the Capitol. On Jan. 3 a small group of conservatives indeed revolted, outraged at the fiscal cliff negotiation that included few spending cuts, and Boehner narrowly retained the speakership with 220 votes. At least 12 conservatives defected and voted for other members. Looking back, it was probably a sign of how difficult 2013 was going to be.\n\n\u2018Stop Being The Stupid Party\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than being publicly shamed by one of your own. And that\u2019s exactly what happened in January, as Republicans tried to recover from the 2012 election loss.\n\nWhile giving a keynote address at a Republican National Committee meeting that month, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal gave his party members some tough love when he told them, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop being the stupid party. It\u2019s time for a new Republican Party that talks like adults. We had a number of Republicans damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments. I\u2019m here to say we\u2019ve had enough of that.\u201d\n\nJindal has been mentioned as a possible 2016 presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWetbacks\u201d\n\nThe momentum for immigration reform has never been stronger than in 2013. Advocates continuously overpower opponents in mobilizing across the nation and the airwaves. The growing Latino vote helped President Barack Obama return to the White House for a second time. Seeing this, Republicans realized that Hispanics are a group they need to court. But Republican outreach to this growing population has been very rocky, and, at minimum, problematic. Some, if not much, of it has to do with Republicans' rhetoric toward immigrant communities.\n\nA classic example of the \u201coffensive and bizarre comments\u201d Jindal warned of happened in March when U.S. Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, used the slur \u201cwetbacks\u201d to describe Hispanic workers. The term is used to describe workers from various Latin American countries; it originally referred to those who swam across the Rio Grande to come to America.\n\n\u201cMy father had a ranch; we used to have 50 to 60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes,\u201d Young said to Alaska public radio station KRBD. \u201cIt takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It\u2019s all done by machine.\u201d\n\nThat comment angered the public, and Young issued a written apology to say he \u201cmeant no disrespect.\u201d\n\n\u2018Cantaloupe Calves\u2019\n\nVarious constituencies held out hope that an immigration reform bill would head to the president\u2019s desk in 2013. The activists\u2019 momentum ticked up during the August recess, a perfect time for constituents to let their voices be heard. But heading into the break, some Republicans shot themselves in the foot, leaving the party further from its stated goal of representing all Americans.\n\nIn July, U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, showed he just can't reconcile citizenship for selected groups of immigrants who broke the law to come to the U.S. Here\u2019s what he said in an interview while speaking about those immigrants brought illegally to the country as children.\n\n\u201cSome of them are valedictorians -- and their parents brought them in. It wasn\u2019t their fault. It\u2019s true in some cases, but they aren\u2019t all valedictorians. They weren\u2019t all brought in by their parents. For everyone who\u2019s a valedictorian, there\u2019s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds -- and they\u2019ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert. Those people would be legalized with the same act.\u201d\n\nUnlike his colleague from Alaska, King felt no need to apologize, even when Boehner told King that his comments were \u201cdeeply offensive and wrong.\u201d He told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press,\u201d \u201cMy numbers have not been debunked. I said valedictorians compared to people who would be legalized under the act that are drug smugglers coming across the border.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz\u2019s Fake Filibuster\n\nCruz's effort was the beginning of an embarrassing chapter for Republicans. In an effort to stop Obamacare by getting it defunded, the Texas senator undertook a phony 21-hour filibuster on the Senate floor in September that did nothing to damage the new health care law nor its funding.\n\nCruz has also been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2016. It was obvious early on that Cruz didn\u2019t have a \"Plan B\" for his futile filibuster effort. But the general consensus was that you either chuckled or felt sorry for him reading from \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d or impersonating Darth Vader. (Skip video to 1:20)\n\nHis pointless grandstanding riled his GOP colleagues in both chambers, who blamed him for causing the U.S. government shutdown in October. Perhaps the most angered by Cruz\u2019s actions was U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y. King said this to conservative media site Breitbart about the junior senator: \u201cHe\u2019s a con man. He knew this was going nowhere. He sold a false bill of goods -- put pressure on Republicans -- said defund Obamacare in the House and it would work through the Senate, and it didn\u2019t. He knew it wouldn\u2019t [work]. So we had to listen to him talk about Dr. Seuss for 21 hours.\u201d\n\nGOP Government Shutdown\n\nIn October, the government partially shut down for 16 days after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on a budget. Politicking over a debt limit increase and Republicans\u2019 plan to block or delay Obamacare before enrollment began in October led to about 800,000 federal workers being furloughed and more than $25 billion in commercial activity eliminated from U.S. GDP. The public mainly blamed Republicans.\n\n\u2018Have To Get Something Out Of This\u2019 But Don\u2019t Know What\n\nAs the government shutdown began, Republicans were still talking tough. The public and some lawmakers were already aware Republicans were out of moves and had no exit strategy, and it was just a matter of seeing how long the party\u2019s members would take to realize the same, compromise and cut a deal. Nothing gave a better picture of just how split and chaotic things were within the party than U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman\u2019s quote to the Washington Examiner about the shutdown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be disrespected,\u201d said Stutzman, R-Ind., to the Washington Examiner. \u201cWe have to get something out of this. And I don\u2019t know what that even is.\u201d\n\nOf course, the lack of a viable game plan by the far right angered Boehner, who publicly lashed out against some groups who backed the shutdown, because he and other GOP leadership members didn\u2019t think it would actually work. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d a comical Boehner said at a recent press conference after the announcement of a two-year budget deal. He was criticizing conservative groups, who were opposed to the deal, but supported Republicans' threat of a shutdown because they didn't think the tactic would actually work.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "comprehensive immigration reform, immigration reform 2013, wetbacks don young, government shutdown, government shutdown 2013, ted cruz obamacare, ted cruz shutdown, ted cruz filibuster, steve king canatloupe calves, republican government shutdown", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and the tea party did their best to make 2013 a memorable one for the Republican Party.", "title": "'Wetbacks,' 'Cantaloupe Calves': Republicans' Most Embarrassing Moments Of 2013", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/wetbacks-cantaloupe-calves-republicans-most-embarrassing-moments-2013-1520566", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/10/14/cruz-tea-party-rally-12oct2013.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and the tea party did their best to make 2013 a memorable one for the Republican Party.", "title": "'Wetbacks,' 'Cantaloupe Calves': Republicans' Most Embarrassing Moments Of 2013", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/wetbacks-cantaloupe-calves-republicans-most-embarrassing-moments-2013-1520566", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/10/14/cruz-tea-party-rally-12oct2013.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/10/14/cruz-tea-party-rally-12oct2013.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2013-12-26T13:49:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-30T14:16:10-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and the tea party did their best to make 2013 a memorable one for the Republican Party."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd022\"", "article_summary": "Speaker Boehner supported this bill, though Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia and many House Republicans opposed it.\nHere are some of the Republicans' most embarrassing moments of 2013:Failed Revolt Puts Boehner Back In ChargeThe year began on a sour note, as many Republicans were furious over the fiscal cliff deal that increased taxes on individuals making $400,000 and more and families earning more than $450,000.\n\u2018Have To Get Something Out Of This\u2019 But Don\u2019t Know WhatAs the government shutdown began, Republicans were still talking tough.\nHowever, the public\u2019s ire wasn\u2019t limited to a single party, as both Democrats and Republicans declined in popularity this year.\nThat said, the Republican Party certainly took much-harder hits from the inside."}
