With six Republicans officially in the presidential race for 2016 and more to join soon, the party’s chairman is gearing up for a busy year. The Daily Signal spoke to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus about the policy issues at the forefront of the debate.

“On the policy side, we’re going to have plenty of debates and I think that’s a good place for the candidates to be,” Priebus said.

His goal, he told us, is to have a “peaceful, efficient primary process” so the Republican Party can emerge with a strong nominee next year.
