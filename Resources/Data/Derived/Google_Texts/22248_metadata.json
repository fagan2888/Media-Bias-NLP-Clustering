Brawny. Disruptive. They don\u2019t sound like descriptors for home d\u00e9cor, do they?\n\nYet they perfectly describe one of the most interesting new directions in furniture and accessories: Brutalist d\u00e9cor.\n\nBrutalist architecture was popularized by Le Corbusier in the 1950s. A departure from the intricate Beaux Arts building style, it was all about spare geometric forms, and materials like unfinished concrete, steel and glass. New York\u2019s Whitney Museum of American Art is a Brutalist design by Marcel Breuer. Paul Rudolph designed the Art and Architecture Building at Yale.\n\nThe style moved into interior d\u00e9cor that also played with abstract forms and rough textures, adding an earthy color palette and incorporating other materials like wood, plaster and marble. Furniture by designers like Paul Evans and Curtis Jere found fans, and the style caught fire during the \u201960s and \u201970s. There are nice examples on the sets of the movie \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d and TV\u2019s \u201cMad Men.\u201d\n\nSo why is Brutalism once again having a moment?\n\n\u201cBrutalism is derived from the French word \u2018brut,\u2019 or raw, and I think it\u2019s that sense of rawness that design lovers are attracted to today,\u201d ventures Anna Brockaway, co-founder and curator of the online vintage-design marketplace Chairish. \u201cBecause of their brawny heaviness, imperfect finishes and rough, uneven dimensions, Brutalist pieces deliver gutsy gravitas to a space.\u201d\n\nJeni Sandberg, a modern-design dealer and consultant in Raleigh, N.C., adds: \u201cBrutalist works make perfect high-impact statement pieces, and collectors are snapping up pieces like wall sculptures and chandeliers.\u201d\n\nAnd New York designer Daun Curry says: \u201cDesign should challenge us, and creating contrast in an environment gives urgency, interest and dimension. Brutalist design is fascinating because it balances delicacy with harsh materiality.\u201d\n\nCurry\u2019s favorite sources include 1st Dibs and Flair Home Collection. The former offers vintage pieces like a 1967 Paul Evans patchwork steel cabinet, and a Lane dresser with a Brutalist sculptured wood mosaic. Flair has a collection of Brutalist objets d\u2019art in various metals and gilded plaster.\n\nKelly Wearstler\u2018s Apollo stool is an artful stack of black or white marble circles; her Elliott chair is a sexy mix of curvy bronze and exotic fish leather; and her Array, District and Astral rugs bring Brutalist imagery to the floor.\n\nJames Bearden\u2019s blackened steel Skyscraper floor lamp for Studio Van den Akker combines architecture and function.\n\nAt Arteriors, long a source for Brutalist style, round slabs of forged iron form the industrial-chic Potter lamp. The Payne chandelier is a kinetic arrangement of hand-cut, gold-leafed iron shards, while a copse of welded iron sticks forms the Ecko lamp. Armor-like metallic circles and squares form the Ulysses and Monty pendants.\n\n\u201cI recommend picking one statement-making piece to anchor a space, like a chandelier, credenza, cocktail table or wall sculpture, and then mixing in pieces from other eras and styles,\u201d advises Brockaway. \u201cAlso, many Brutalist pieces are dark in coloration, so I prefer to balance them with a lighter surrounding palate.\u201d\n\nThink powerful yet playful, more \u201cMad Men\u201d than \u201cMad Max.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brutalist home d\u00e9cor makes a muscular return this fall", "title": "Brutalist home d\u00e9cor makes a muscular return this fall", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/11/brutalist-home-dcor-makes-a-muscular-return-this-fall/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150911__20150912_C8_FE12AHBRUTALISTp2.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150911__20150912_C8_FE12AHBRUTALISTp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-11T17:34:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T00:51:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9542\"", "article_summary": "Brutalist design is fascinating because it balances delicacy with harsh materiality.\u201dCurry\u2019s favorite sources include 1st Dibs and Flair Home Collection.\nNew York\u2019s Whitney Museum of American Art is a Brutalist design by Marcel Breuer.\nAt Arteriors, long a source for Brutalist style, round slabs of forged iron form the industrial-chic Potter lamp.\n\u201cAlso, many Brutalist pieces are dark in coloration, so I prefer to balance them with a lighter surrounding palate.\u201dThink powerful yet playful, more \u201cMad Men\u201d than \u201cMad Max.\u201d\nYet they perfectly describe one of the most interesting new directions in furniture and accessories: Brutalist d\u00e9cor."}
