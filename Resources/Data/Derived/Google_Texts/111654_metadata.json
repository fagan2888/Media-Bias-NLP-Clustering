In fact it\u2019s gotten so bad one of his home state newspapers actually called on him to resign.\n\n\u201cYou are paid $174,000 per year to represent us, to fight for us, to solve our problems,\u201d the editorial board of The Sun-Sentinel wrote. \u201cPlus you take a $10,000 federal subsidy \u2013 declined by some in the Senate \u2013 to participate in one of the Obamacare health plans, though you are a big critic of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are ripping us off, Senator,\u201d the editorial continued.\n\nOuch \u2026\n\nAnyway, while campaigning in early-voting New Hampshire this week \u2013 where the GOP establishment is in full-on panic mode \u2013 Rubio took credit for passing \u201cadditional sanctions on Hezbollah,\u201d a Lebanese-based militant Shiite Muslim organization.\n\nThe only problem?\n\nThe vote was one of many, many, many tallies in recent years that Rubio skipped.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2026 he wasn\u2019t there.\n\nPouncing on the miscue? Former Florida governor Jeb Bush \u2013 who is battling with Rubio for the support of the \u201cRepublican\u201d status quo crowd.\n\n\u201cWhen he was asked what his main accomplishments were, one of them was dealing with Hezbollah, which was a 93 to nothing vote that he didn\u2019t go to,\u201d Bush said. \u201cYou know, this is not real. In Iowa, one of our last events was with Chuck Grassley, the guy has not missed a vote for 22 and a half years. He probably has a list of accomplishments in service to the State of Iowa and to this country that is pretty real. Marco doesn\u2019t have it. He\u2019s gifted. Ted Cruz doesn\u2019t have it. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not talented people. But they don\u2019t have a record of accomplishment.\u201d\n\nLook, we don\u2019t care about Hezbollah. Why not? Because unlike typical tough-talking, warmongering \u201cRepublicans,\u201d our website doesn\u2019t bend over to accommodate Israel \u2013 which we view as a bossy little country that has taken far too many U.S. tax dollars (even though it vowed it would stop taking them decades ago).\n\nBut whatever you think of Israel \u2026 or the efficacy of global interventionism \u2026 Rubio bragging about a vote that he missed is pretty funny stuff.\n\nOf course as we\u2019ve said all along, our problem with Rubio isn\u2019t the votes he\u2019s missed \u2026 it\u2019s the votes he\u2019s taken. Most glaringly, we\u2019re referring to his deciding vote in support of U.S. president Barack Obama\u2018s crony capitalist trade deal \u2013 \u201cObamatrade.\u201d\n\nIronically, Rubio was busy bashing Obama prior to claiming credit for \u201csanctioning\u201d Hezbollah \u2026\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Rubio is a smooth talker. In fact he gives some of the best, most polished answers to certain red meat questions we\u2019ve ever heard \u2013 and we\u2019ve praised him accordingly.\n\nThe problem? Like former GOP nominee Mitt Romney \u2013 the last person who sold \u201cRepublicans\u201d on his electability \u2013 Rubio simply cannot be trusted to tell the truth.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2016/02/04/marco-rubio-takes-credit-for-a-vote-he-didnt-cast/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rubio-vote-577x370.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Marco Rubio Takes Credit For A Vote He Didn't Cast"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Of course as we\u2019ve said all along, our problem with Rubio isn\u2019t the votes he\u2019s missed \u2026 it\u2019s the votes he\u2019s taken.\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida has basically given up any pretense of representing his constituents while running for president.\nBut whatever you think of Israel \u2026 or the efficacy of global interventionism \u2026 Rubio bragging about a vote that he missed is pretty funny stuff.\nThe vote was one of many, many, many tallies in recent years that Rubio skipped.\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush \u2013 who is battling with Rubio for the support of the \u201cRepublican\u201d status quo crowd."}
