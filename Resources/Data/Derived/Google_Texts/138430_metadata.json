The protestors say they are outraged by evidence produced by opponents of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski purporting to show the government was involved in election fraud, mass surveillance of its citizens, and even framing opposition leaders for crimes as serious as murder.\n\nRussian state-run media, however suggests a different reason: Western (read \u201cU.S.\u201d) meddling.\n\nRelated: Kerry-Putin Talks Could Deliver a Global Surprise\n\nWith tens of thousands of Macedonians preparing to rally in the streets of the capital Skopje last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said publicly that the Russian government believes a recent gun battle between authorities and a group identified as \u201cterrorists\u201d as well as the wider unrest have causes outside Macedonia itself.\n\n\u201cObjectively speaking, the events in Macedonia are unfolding against the background of the government\u2019s refusal to join the policy of sanctions against Russia and the vigorous support Skopje gave to the Turkish Stream gas pipeline project, which many people oppose, both in Brussels and across the ocean,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo we can\u2019t help but feeling that there is some sort of connection here,\u201d Lavrov added.\n\nA statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry said it had seen \u201cconvincing evidence \u2026 of attempts to push the country into the abyss of 'color revolution.'\" The term \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d has been used to describe a number of popular uprisings across Eastern Europe in the past decade. There is also evidence, the Ministry said, \u201cthat Western organizers of such catastrophic scenarios prefer to realize them with the hands of others.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin Turns to Volunteer Vigilantes to Patrol Moscow\n\nState-run Russian media has taken that storyline and is enthusiastically running with it.\n\n\u201cPeople Power or Western Meddling? Macedonia Unrest Reveals Differing Views\u201d was the headline on Sputnik, the Kremlin\u2019s international news service. Sputnik quoted Vladimir Pandovski, identified as a \u201cSkopje-based political analyst\u201d saying that \u201ceveryone\u201d believes the massive protests are fake.\n\n\u201cEverything that is happening in Macedonia has been scripted and staged. We\u2019ve seen this before; it\u2019s a mix of comedy and tragedy. The so-called wiretapping scandal has been the biggest piece of comedy the public has ever seen\u2026 and honestly, no one is buying it \u2013 everyone is aware that this is an attempt to create a new Maidan, like in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMaidan\u201d is the central square in Kiev, where the protests that eventually led to the ouster of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych took place.\n\nRelated: Yikes! Putin Will Soon Have Superhuman Robo-Soldiers\n\nRussia Today, another English language news site funded by the Kremlin, interviewed magazine editor Srdja Trifkovic, who asserted, \u201cWashington and Brussels have been driving this sudden crisis in Macedonia all along.\u201d\n\n\u201c[I]t\u2019s quite obvious that this is a sustained regime change attempt dictated from Washington and Brussels, driven and financed from there,\u201d Trifkovic said. \u201cI think we are really witnessing just another episode in a long-term geopolitical battle between Washington and its pliant Brussels allies on the one side, and Russians on the other with Macedonians this time this time round being the collateral damage.\u201d\n\nIn the same RT article, political analyst Aleksandar Pavic laid the fault on the U.S. alone. He pointed out that shortly after opposition leader Zoran Zaev started releasing the wiretap transcripts that launched the unrest, the U.S. made a statement appearing to support him.\n\n\u201cJust a short time afterwards you had Victoria Nuland\u2019s deputy asking Macedonian government to give concessions to the opposition to negotiate with them, to even stand down,\u201d said Pavic. \u201cSo you have American fingerprints all over this.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In Russia\u2019s state-run media, it\u2019s practically certain that a brewing revolution in Macedonia is being driven by shadowy plots hatched in Washington and the European Union", "title": "Russian State Media Says U.S. Is Fomenting Riots in Macedonia", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/18/Russian-State-Media-Says-US-Fomenting-Riots-Macedonia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/macedonia_flag.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/18/Russian-State-Media-Says-US-Fomenting-Riots-Macedonia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/macedonia_flag.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In Russia\u2019s state-run media, it\u2019s practically certain that a brewing revolution in Macedonia is being driven by shadowy plots hatched in Washington and the European Union", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Macedonia Unrest Reveals Differing Views\u201d was the headline on Sputnik, the Kremlin\u2019s international news service.\nRussian state-run media, however suggests a different reason: Western (read \u201cU.S.\u201d) meddling.\nA statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry said it had seen \u201cconvincing evidence \u2026 of attempts to push the country into the abyss of 'color revolution.'\"\nThe people of Macedonia have taken to the streets in recent days, calling for the resignation of the country\u2019s Prime Minister, creating yet another flashpoint in Eastern Europe.\nThe term \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d has been used to describe a number of popular uprisings across Eastern Europe in the past decade."}
