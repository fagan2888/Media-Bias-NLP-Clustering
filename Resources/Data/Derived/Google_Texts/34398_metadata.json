Governors are best suited to lead our country because they have experience running a state.\n\nWith his record as governor and his two decades on the House Armed Services Committee working with leaders like President Reagan to strengthen our military, end the Cold War and revamp the Pentagon, John Kasich is a leader whose readiness to lead our nation on his first day in the Oval Office is unmatched. America needs John Kasich, and I am going to do everything I can to help make sure he is our next President.\u201d\n\nThis endorsement is a departure from 2012, when Gov. Bentley openly backed, but did not endorse, the very socially conservative Rick Santorum, who eventually won Alabama in the primary.\n\nAs Governor of Ohio, Kasich has had a relatively less conservative record than many of his Republican peers.\n\nKasich is one of the only Republican governors in the country who has expanded Medicaid under ObamaCare, and this move may add further fuel to the rumors that Governor Bentley is also considering ways to expand the program.\n\nBentley and Kasich also handled the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on same sex marriage similarly, essentially telling their constituents that it\u2019s time to move on, and both ran into opposition from their state legislatures for proposing tax increases.\n\nKasich has garnered early support from the more establishment wing of the GOP, who like his pragmatism and vast governing experience both as a member of Congress and as Governor of Ohio.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m humbled by Governor Bentley\u2019s support,\u201d said Kasich. \u201cThe endorsement of a fellow governor is special, especially from someone like Governor Bentley who brings so much to his work and who has such an incredible record of service to his state and our country.\n\nWhat\u2019s also significant to me is that Gov. Bentley reached out to our campaign, unsolicited, to offer his support. This is about our shared commitment to putting conservative principles to work to get America back on track. I\u2019m very appreciative of his endorsement and I\u2019m very excited about what we\u2019re going to be able to do together to move the campaign forward in Alabama, the South and across the nation.\u201d\n\nLike this article?
