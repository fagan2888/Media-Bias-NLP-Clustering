We\u2019ll see how this plays out at a Senate Appropriations health committee hearing on Zika today.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGOVERNMENTS, MEDICAL GROUPS PLEDGE TO SHARE ZIKA DATA \u2014 More than two dozen government organizations, medical journals, and non-governmental organizations have signed a declaration to share data related to the Zika virus, as soon as possible and free of charge. The CDC, NIH, Doctors Without Borders, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, government groups in South Africa, Japan and India are just a handful that signed onto the pledge. http://bit.ly/1WeYrtb\n\nOPIUM WARS \u2014 That harmonious bipartisan effort to address opioid abuse, addiction and overdose is suddenly \u2026 not so harmonious. Senate Democrats are now demanding that Republicans authorize new funding for opioid addiction as both parties struggle to claim leadership on an issue that is claiming thousands of American lives and is on voters\u2019 minds this election year, Pro's Jennifer Haberkorn reports.\n\n\u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to start work today on a bipartisan bill that would authorize the Obama administration to use existing money to give grants to states and organizations for opioid education, prevention and treatment. But it\u2019s getting more political.\n\n\u2014 What's next: Democrats at a press conference on Thursday will insist that Republicans fund the measure \u2014 instead of merely redirecting existing funding. Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is a cosponsor on the original bill, will be at the press conference.\n\nTHIS IS THURSDAY PULSE \u2014 And rumor has it that #HealthPolicyValentines \u2014 the hashtag that has health wonks falling in love \u2014 will be sweeping Twitter today.

The overall uninsured rate for Americans under age 19 dropped to 6.3 percent with significant variation between the states.\n\nHighest uninsured rate: Alaska (12.3 percent)\n\nLowest uninsured rate: Vermont (1.2 percent)\n\nAbout half of the remaining 4.9 million uninsured children nationwide lived in just six states: Texas, California, Florida, Georgia, Arizona, and New York. RWJF\u2019s Katherine Hempstead suggests that outlier states have several options, including expanding eligibility and opting into Medicaid expansion; she notes that Texas and Florida are both in the top five states in terms of child uninsurance rate \"and they also have high uninsurance rates for adults.\" Uninsurance among adults and children is often highly correlated, she reminded us.\n\nBRADY HONES IN ON OBAMACARE ENROLLMENT NUMBERS \u2014 House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady questioned HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell on Wednesday about whether CBO\u2019s exchange enrollment projections were \u201cfundamentally flawed,\u201d given that enrollment growth is plateauing earlier than anticipated. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise the law isn\u2019t working as advertised,\u201d Brady said during a hearing on the president\u2019s proposed fiscal 2017 budget, Pro's Rachana Pradhan reports.\n\n\u2014 Burwell acknowledged CBO\u2019s recent downward revision of exchange enrollment estimates \u2014 they\u2019re now 13 million for 2016 \u2014 but said, \u201cI think the most important thing to focus on is the number of uninsured,\u201d which has fallen to a record low. The silver lining in the low exchange numbers \u2014 fewer employers dropped coverage and moved their workers to the exchanges than expected.\n\n\u2014 Next up: Burwell testifies on the budget in front of the Senate Finance Committee today at 10 a.m.\n\nALEXANDER: NO JUSTIFICATION FOR FDA FUNDING THROUGH \u2018CURES\u2019 \u2014 The Senate\u2019s counterpart to the House biomedical reform bill, 21stCentury Cures, has faced disagreements over whether to provide NIH with mandatory funding and at what point that would be worked out. Now disputes over FDA funding are complicating the Senate\u2019s effort, Pro's Sarah Karlin reports.\n\n\u201cSen. Alexander said that he believes the case can be made for one-time support for limited mandatory funding at the NIH for high priority initiatives, which have a beginning and end,\" an aide to the HELP Committee chair said. \"There is no similar justification for mandatory funding at the FDA which is funded through both appropriations and industry user fees.\"\n\nThe panel\u2019s top Democrat Patty Murray wants mandatory funding for both FDA and NIH as part of the innovation bill. Sarah tells us the odds of the Senate coming together on this package look slimmer and slimmer.\n\nDEMOCRATS MAY DRIVE HARD BARGAIN ON BUDGET \u2014 New York Rep. Nita Lowey, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told POLITICO's Budget and Appropriations team that she hopes to force Republicans to accept Democratic health care priorities like efforts to prevent opioid abuse, lead poisoning and the spread of the Zika virus. And, of course, no \"divisive and ideological riders.\"\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

The docs write that limiting or shrinking it \u201cwould negatively impact our ability to care for the needy in our communities.\u201d The letter, circulated by 340B Health: http://bit.ly/1T8qR8Y\n\nOHIO LEGISLATURE PASSES BILL TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD \u2014 Ohio's general assembly on Wednesday passed a bill that would prohibit the state's Department of Health from awarding state and federal grants to the organization. The legislation now heads to Kasich for his likely signature. One reason why this matters: The bill gives Kasich the opportunity to remind South Carolina voters where he stands on Planned Parenthood. (As POLITICO reported last week \u2014 he's no moderate on abortion.)\n\nAMERICANS CAUTIOUS ON GENE EDITS IN UTERO \u2014 A STAT News and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health poll released this morning finds that about two-thirds of Americans oppose gene editing in fetuses, and 83 percent oppose gene editing solely for intellectual or physical characteristics.

Despite promises to return the money donated by former CEO Martin Shkreli himself, candidate Will Jawando only gave away half of what Shkreli donated, keeping the $2,700 earmarked for the general election on hand, reports Alex Glorioso for OpenSecrets. The campaign will also retain the $22,900 donated from six other Turing employees. bit.ly/1QruTo8\n\n\u2014 Shkreli's rap sheet could grow. Shkreli infamously bought a $2 million Wu-Tang Clan album last year; he's now being sued by an artist who alleges that the album features the artist's work without his permission.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING, by Erin Mershon\n\nHealth insurers are under pressure to improve their exchange business, the WSJ reports.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
