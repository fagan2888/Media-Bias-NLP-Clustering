Well, it probably haunted you for months on your Facebook minifeed. New data shows that most people aren\u2019t affected.\n\nGallup\u2019s new State of the American Consumer report shows 62 percent of Americans say ads on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have no influence on their decisions to buy products. A mere sliver of those surveyed, just 5 percent, said social media advertising has \u201ca great deal of influence\u201d over their purchasing decisions.\n\nRelated: With McCarthy\u2019s Rise, Tech Sector Gets a Boost\n\nIt\u2019s an amazing number, especially considering that 94 percent of that same surveyed group said they use social media to connect with friends and family.\n\nEven the so-called \u2018social media generation\u2019\u2014yes, millennials\u2014say social media marketing has little affect on their decision-making. Forty-eight percent of millennials said social media has \u201cno influence at all\u201d on their purchasing choices, while only 43 percent admitted it had \u201csome influence.\u201d\n\nTwenty-five-year-old Antoine Sargent, former BuzzFeed fellow and current writer for the millennial-focused website PolicyMic, knows a thing or two about attracting eyeballs on the web. \u201cThey are crazy about where I get my clothes,\u201d says Sargent of his more than 8,000 followers on Instagram. \u201cIf you have a following, people are influenced.\u201d\n\nRelated: LinkedIn Data Reveals the Most \u2018InDemand\u2019 Employers\n\nIn today\u2019s day and age, having influence often means getting your message through the clutter of the fractured media landscape. Gallup\u2019s report shows that when it comes to shopping, consumers are less likely to look towards a company-sponsored Facebook page or Twitter feed than they are to turn to friends, in-store displays, television commercials, and magazines. Those are the places of trendsetters and celebrities.\n\n\"I think that images are powerful and in the age of Tumblr and Instagram people certainly are influenced by the different styles people are wearing. Perhaps that doesn't translate into brand specific purchases but it does inspire people follow trends or buy something that looks like an item they found online,\" says Sargent.\n\nPerhaps buying the item advertised is not the end goal \u2013 maybe it\u2019s more like window-shopping and the idea is to explore the site because you like the style of the ad or the friend who recommended it. The challenge is that people like to touch and feel the products they buy. They seek out the brands and services they already know they like.\n\n\u201cCompanies that engage their customers, by providing exceptional service and a pleasurable in-store experience, will, in turn, drive those customers to interact with them on social media,\u201d writes Gallup\u2019s Art Swift. \u201cSimply promoting products and services on Facebook or Twitter is unlikely to lead to sales.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Best Investing Lessons from a Legendary Economist\n\nSo is the combined $5.1 billion spent on social media advertising by American companies in 2013 all for naught?\n\nCompanies are always looking for ways to reach younger consumers, those who aren\u2019t stuck in their ways, and those who have disposable income, especially. The Internet seems like the Holy Grail for reaching them.\n\nKim Gandy, president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, is not a millennial. But she is an avid media user and disagrees with the premise of the study. \u201cAmericans generally might say that, but I think that\u2019s not true of people who actually use social media. I look at Yelp or Travel Advisor if I\u2019m looking for a restaurant. I look at reviews before I buy a toaster, all of that is social media of the sort.\u201d\n\nGandy is unique. The data shows that only a small fraction of consumers take into account what they learn from social media when they are buying something. But the reality may not be whether or not people consciously recognize that social media influences their purchasing decisions; it\u2019s whether or not they\u2019ll admit it.\n\nTop Reads From the Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Have you ever thought about buying that completely unnecessary but entirely fabulous i", "title": "The Social Media Generation Says Social Media Ads Don\u2019t Work", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/23/Social-Media-Generation-Says-Social-Media-Ads-Don-t-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232012_Facebook_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/23/Social-Media-Generation-Says-Social-Media-Ads-Don-t-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232012_Facebook_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Have you ever thought about buying that completely unnecessary but entirely fabulous i", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf387\"", "article_summary": "Even the so-called \u2018social media generation\u2019\u2014yes, millennials\u2014say social media marketing has little affect on their decision-making.\n\u201cAmericans generally might say that, but I think that\u2019s not true of people who actually use social media.\nA mere sliver of those surveyed, just 5 percent, said social media advertising has \u201ca great deal of influence\u201d over their purchasing decisions.\nI look at reviews before I buy a toaster, all of that is social media of the sort.\u201dGandy is unique.\nThe data shows that only a small fraction of consumers take into account what they learn from social media when they are buying something."}
