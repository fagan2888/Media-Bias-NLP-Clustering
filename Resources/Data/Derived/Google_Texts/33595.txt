TORONTO (AP) - David Villa scored twice to lead expansion New York City FC to a 2-0 victory over Toronto FC on Saturday night, halting Torontoâ€™s unbeaten streak at five games.

Villa converted a penalty shot in the eighth minute after Benoit Cheyrou was whistled for a hand ball in the box.

Villa got his second of the night when New York pounced on a soft pass from Toronto goalkeeper Chris Konopka to defender Eriq Zavaleta. The turnover proved costly - an easy goal for the former Valencia and Barcelona star in the 58th minute.
