The health centers will use this new federal funding to renovate facilities, increase patient capacity and expand primary care services. The Vermont awards are part of $260 million in health infrastructure funding announced today for 290 community health centers in 45 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The funding comes from the Health Center Trust Fund, which was created by a Sanders provision in the Affordable Care Act that provides $11 billion for community health centers across the United States. Congress extended the Sanders provision last year with bipartisan support.\n\n\u201cI am proud that we continue to see significant increases in the number of patients accessing health care at community health centers in Vermont and around the country,\u201d said Sanders, who serves as the ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health. \u201cI am pleased to see Vermont receive these much-needed awards, which will allow our community health centers to serve even more Vermonters who today lack adequate access to affordable health care.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, fewer than 10 percent of Vermont residents received their health care at Federally Qualified Health Centers. This year, roughly 1 in 4 Vermonters, more than 150,000 people, will receive affordable primary medical, oral and mental health care services and low-cost prescription drugs at more than 50 sites across the state.\n\n\u201cAlthough I am very pleased with today\u2019s announcement, millions of Americans still do not have access to the primary and oral health care they need,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cCongress must continue to protect and expand community health centers to ensure people in Vermont and throughout the United States have access to health care.\u201d\n\nThe following Vermont health centers received awards today:\n\n\u00b7 Battenkill Valley Health Center, Arlington: $1,000,000\n\n\u00b7 Community Health Centers of the Rutland Region: $752,502\n\n\u00b7 Copley Professional Services Group, Morrisville: $1,000,000\n\n\u00b7 Little Rivers Health Care, Bradford: $999,928\n\n\u00b7 Richford Health Center: $724,780\n\n\u00b7 Springfield Medical Care Systems: $1,000,000\n\nNationally\n\nHHS Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell announced over $260 million in funding to 290 health centers in 45 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico for facility renovation, expansion, or construction. Health centers will use this funding to increase their patient capacity and to provide additional comprehensive primary and preventive health services to medically underserved populations.\n\n\u201cHealth centers are cornerstones of the communities they serve,\u201d said Secretary Burwell. \u201cToday\u2019s awards will empower health centers to build more capacity and provide needed health care to hundreds of thousands of additional individuals and their families.\u201d\n\nThese awards will allow health centers to renovate or acquire new health center clinical space to help provide care to over 800,000 new patients nationwide. This investment builds on the nearly $150 million awarded to 160 health centers for construction and/or renovation in September 2015. This funding comes from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Community Health Center (CHC) Fund, which was extended with bipartisan support in the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) of 2015.\n\n\u201cProviding funding to help health centers renovate their facilities will allow them to provide care to more patients,\u201d said HRSA Acting Associate Administrator Jim Macrae. \u201cPerhaps more importantly though, health centers will now be able to provide more health services in one location, better meeting the needs of their communities.\u201d\n\nSince the beginning of 2009, health centers have added 6 million patients; they now serve nearly 23 million people each year. Today, nearly 1,400 health centers operate about 9,800 service delivery sites in every U.S. state, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Pacific Basin.\n\nTo view a list of the award winners, visit: http://bphc.hrsa.gov/programopportunities/fundingopportunities/hiip/2016awards/\n\nFor more information on the FY 2015 Health Infrastructure Investment Program Awards, visit: http://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2015/09/15/hhs-awards-nearly-500-million-affordable-care-act-funding-health-centers-expand-primary-care.html\n\nTo learn more about HRSA\u2019s Health Center Program, visit: http://bphc.hrsa.gov/about/index.html\n\nTo find a health center in your area, visit: http://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/\n\nBURLINGTON, Vt., May 4 \u2013 U.S. Sen.
