I waited for my feminist sisters who claim that feminism is indeed for more than just white women, to make the case about why the joke was in terrible taste, and that it would never have been made about a young white child. I waited for Amy Poehler, who I myself have genuinely admired for her politics and hilarious show \u201cParks & Rec,\u201d to say something. I waited for the think pieces by white feminists calling for a reckoning of the unexamined racism inherent in the joke. I waited. And waited. Instead, I saw a few pieces explaining why the joke was not actually the joke, and that it was intended to be that vile to make a point about what a terrible person the main character is. Of course the conversation on Black Twitter was vibrant and Black feminists wrote some powerful pieces. More than a month later, I have yet to see deeper analysis from white feminists, speaking to each other, about how inexcusable such a \u2018joke\u2019 really is and whether it would have happened if it was at the expense of a white toddler. (If you\u2019ve seen such an analysis in response, please share in the comments or via Twitter!) Amy Poehler has not spoken publicly about it, nor has the actress who delivered the lines in the show, nor has anyone affiliated with Hulu, which hosts the series.\n\nThis past week brought us the release of a new film about the movement for women\u2019s right to the vote, \u201cSuffragette.\u201d In the film, Meryl Streep stars as British suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst. The film chronicles the lives of Pankhurst and her compatriots as they fight for their right to vote in the early 20th century. Leading up to the premiere of the film, Time Out London interviewed Streep and her co-stars, and they posed for the magazine\u2019s cover wearing T-shirts with the following quote from a speech Pankhurst made in 1913: \u201cI\u2019d rather be a rebel than a slave.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1900s, white women in the US were fighting for the right to vote, with many racist values intact. Defending white women\u2019s right to vote, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, foremother of the American suffragette movement, asked, \u201cWhat will we and our daughters suffer if these degraded black men are allowed to have the rights that would make them even worse than our Saxon fathers?\u201d\n\nAmerican suffragette Rebecca Ann Latimer Felton, the first woman to serve in the Senate, once said, \u201cI do not want to see a negro man walk to the polls and vote on who should handle my tax money, while I myself cannot vote at all \u2026When there is not enough religion in the pulpit to organize a crusade against sin; nor justice in the court house to promptly punish crime; nor manhood enough in the nation to put a sheltering arm about innocence and virtue \u2014 if it needs lynching to protect woman\u2019s dearest possession from the ravening human beasts \u2014 then I say lynch, a thousand times a week if necessary.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If true gender equality is the goal, then it's time for white feminists to reckon with their ongoing mistakes", "title": "The discomfiting truth about white feminism: Meryl Streep, Amy Poehler & the movement\u2019s long history of racial insensitivity", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If true gender equality is the goal, then it's time for white feminists to reckon with their ongoing mistakes", "title": "The discomfiting truth about white feminism: Meryl Streep, Amy Poehler & the movement\u2019s long history of racial insensitivity", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/11/the_discomfiting_truth_about_white_feminism_meryl_streep_amy_poehler_the_movements_long_history_of_racial_insensitivity/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/poehler_streep.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If true gender equality is the goal, then it's time for white feminists to reckon with their ongoing mistakes", "title": "The discomfiting truth about white feminism: Meryl Streep, Amy Poehler & the movement\u2019s long history of racial insensitivity", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/poehler_streep.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eesha Pandit", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Amy Poehler, Feminism, Gender, Meryl Streep, suffragette, white feminism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fbe\"", "article_summary": "I waited for Amy Poehler, who I myself have genuinely admired for her politics and hilarious show \u201cParks & Rec,\u201d to say something.\nTopics: Amy Poehler, Feminism, Gender, Meryl Streep, suffragette, white feminism, Media News, Entertainment News, News, Politics NewsAfter a very unfortunate joke about pedophilia and Blue Ivy Carter in the opening show of a new series produced by Amy Poehler, I waited for white feminists to speak up.\nI waited for the think pieces by white feminists calling for a reckoning of the unexamined racism inherent in the joke.\nAmy Poehler has not spoken publicly about it, nor has the actress who delivered the lines in the show, nor has anyone affiliated with Hulu, which hosts the series.\nThis past week brought us the release of a new film about the movement for women\u2019s right to the vote, \u201cSuffragette.\u201d In the film, Meryl Streep stars as British suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst."}
