Patrick Healy reports for the NBC4 News at 6 p.m. on Friday, July 25, 2014. (Published Friday, July 25, 2014)\n\nHundreds of veterans suffered harm or died from medical mistakes termed \"adverse events\" while receiving care from the Department of Veterans Affairs last year, according to new data obtained by NBC.\n\nThrough a Freedom of Information Act request, NBC found 575 of the estimated 6 million patients annually treated by the department were affected by adverse events, up 74 percent from 330 in 2010. The VA did not disclose details or individual outcomes.\n\nThirty-four of those cases happened in Los Angeles \u2013 the second-highest of any VA facility in the country. Now, the system, already under fire for long wait times and other alleged misconduct, is again facing criticism for the spike in these incidents.\n\n\u201cAdverse event can be anything from a death to serious injury that can occur because of something the VA did or did not do,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, who chairs the House Veterans Affairs Committee, which has been probing problems in the VA medical care system.\n\nWatch: SoCal Surgeon Among Wistleblowers in VA Scandal\n\n\u201cThere are going to be issues,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe problem is what does the VA do when they occur?\u201d\n\nSome families are also lashing out at the VA.\n\n\u201cThey lied, they misled,\u201d said Maureen Ciarolla, whose 83-year-old father died at a VA hospital in Pittsburgh in 2011.\n\nHer father, John, was an 83-year-old Korean War Veteran receiving in-patient treatment when he contracted Legionella disease and died within weeks.\n\nThe VA hospital initially denied Legionella was the cause, only later acknowledging there had been an outbreak at the Pittsburgh facility that caused several deaths.\n\n\u201cHow does a person, a medical professional, make those kinds of medical decisions for anyone, let alone veterans,\u201d Ciarrolla said.\n\nMore: Obama Nominates Ex-P&G Head to Lead VA\n\nIn a statement, the VA said in part \u201cWhether it\u2019s Pittsburgh or elsewhere in our country, our commitment is the same: to provide the very best care to our deserving veterans.\u201d\n\nThe statement did not elaborate or offer an explanation for the increase in adverse events in the last few years. The department has declined to specify the nature of the incidents, or detail how many resulted in death.\n\nGainesville, Florida had the most number of adverse events, according to the data, with 40 since the final quarter of 2013. Los Angeles was next with 34. Then Pittsburgh with 28.\n\nThe VA declined to provide specific information about the adverse events reported by its Los Angeles facilities.\n\nCongressman Miller said the VA had stonewalled his committee from getting information.\n\nIn recent months, with the VA facing increasing criticism, its secretary resigned and President Barack Obama has nominated a replacement.\n\nScott MacFarlane, investigative reporter for News4 in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to new data obtained by NBC through a Freedom of Information Act request, 575 of those patients suffered harm or died from \"adverse events\" while under the care of the Department of Veterans Affairs...", "title": "Hundreds of Vets Died or Injured Under VA Care, Data Shows", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "According to new data obtained by NBC through a Freedom of Information Act request, 575 of those patients suffered harm or died from 'adverse events' while under the care of the Department of Veterans Affairs...", "title": "Hundreds of Vets Died or Injured Under VA Care: Data", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Hundreds-of-Vets-Died-or-Injured-Under-VA-Care-Data-Shows-268677582.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/veteran-unforgettable.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to new data obtained by NBC through a Freedom of Information Act request, 575 of those patients suffered harm or died from 'adverse events' while under the care of the Department of Veterans Affairs...", "creator": "@nbcla", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Hundreds-of-Vets-Died-or-Injured-Under-VA-Care-Data-Shows-268677582.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/veteran-unforgettable.jpg?ak=bc", "title": "Hundreds of Vets Died or Injured Under VA Care: Data", "site": "@nbcla", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "keywords": "Veterans affairs, death, va, hospital, veteran", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Veterans affairs, death, va, hospital, veteran"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1cc3\"", "article_summary": "Gainesville, Florida had the most number of adverse events, according to the data, with 40 since the final quarter of 2013.\nThe VA declined to provide specific information about the adverse events reported by its Los Angeles facilities.\n(Published Friday, July 25, 2014)Hundreds of veterans suffered harm or died from medical mistakes termed \"adverse events\" while receiving care from the Department of Veterans Affairs last year, according to new data obtained by NBC.\nIn recent months, with the VA facing increasing criticism, its secretary resigned and President Barack Obama has nominated a replacement.\nThirty-four of those cases happened in Los Angeles \u2013 the second-highest of any VA facility in the country."}
