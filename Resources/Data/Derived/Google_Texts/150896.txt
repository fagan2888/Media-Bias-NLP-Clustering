If you were shopping at the mall Saturday, you may have noticed several women in crowns and sashes.

Mississippi's Miss Hospitality Bonnie Blue Dulaney, along with Lauderdale County's Miss Hospitality, and the 2014 Jimmie Rogers Queens, were hosting an autograph signing at Bonita Lakes Mall. Dulaney has traveled the state promoting tourism and economic development and says she's learned a few things along the way.

"You know where not a place that has a lot of ballparks and themeparks," Dulaney said. "That's not what attracts people here, we're a place of culture. In Mississippi that's our best asset and that's what we have to put forward as our best foot to promote ourselves.

Dulaney says in June she will be in New York City for Mississippi Day at Central Park with the governor.
