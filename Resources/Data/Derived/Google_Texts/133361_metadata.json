The WHO has called for urgent action to keep vaccinations ongoing in order to put a halt to the spread of the disease, which affects mainly children. Vaccination involves a quick tongue drop, but efforts to eradicate the virus in rural areas is difficult often due to a widespread belief that vaccines can cause infertility or other complications.\n\nThe WHO reported that every sample taken from Peshawar\u2019s sewage system tested positive for a very contagious wild polio virus strain. \u201cAs much of the population of the area moves through Peshawar, the city acts as an amplifier of the poliovirus,\u201d the WHO said in a statement.\n\nAs if the situation wasn\u2019t dire enough, vaccination efforts are difficult to carry out properly as Pakistani militants continue to attack health workers, as the Taliban banned vaccinations in 2012. \u201cThe prevailing security situation in Peshawar has seriously affected the quality of polio campaigns in the city and is resulting in inadequate coverage of children against the virus,\u201d the WHO said. Security needs to be improved in certain areas of Pakistan in order for vaccination efforts to continue, and for eradication to succeed.\n\nPolio (poliomyelitis) is an infectious disease that mostly affects children under the age of 5. According to the WHO, one in 200 infections leads to permanent paralysis, which can lead to death.\n\nThough polio cases around the globe have decreased by 99 percent since 1988, there are three countries left where polio remains endemic \u2014 Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria. In the past year, Pakistan was the only nation that experienced a rise in polio cases. Meanwhile, due to the conflict in Syria, polio has resurfaced in poor areas throughout the country where it is nearly impossible to carry out vaccination efforts due to political turmoil. The WHO also linked the outbreak in Syria to the strain from Pakistan.\n\nPolio has been eradicated from most countries for years, and India recently celebrated three years without a reported case.\n\nPeshawar provincial health minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai told the AFP, \"We are committed to eliminating the disease and doing our best despite continuous attacks on polio workers.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "polio vaccination, syria, peshawar, who, pakistan polio", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The WHO announced Friday that Peshawar, a city in Pakistan, contains dangerously high levels of a wild polio virus strain, becoming the world's largest \"reservoir\" of the disease.", "title": "Peshawar Is World\u2019s \u2018Largest Reservoir\u2019 Of Polio, WHO Says", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/peshawar-worlds-largest-reservoir-polio-who-says-every-polio-case-pakistan-genetically-linked-city", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/17/polio-vaccine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The WHO announced Friday that Peshawar, a city in Pakistan, contains dangerously high levels of a wild polio virus strain, becoming the world's largest \"reservoir\" of the disease.", "title": "Peshawar Is World\u2019s \u2018Largest Reservoir\u2019 Of Polio, WHO Says", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/peshawar-worlds-largest-reservoir-polio-who-says-every-polio-case-pakistan-genetically-linked-city", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/17/polio-vaccine.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/17/polio-vaccine.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-17T14:02:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-17T14:02:19-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The WHO announced Friday that Peshawar, a city in Pakistan, contains dangerously high levels of a wild polio virus strain, becoming the world's largest \"reservoir\" of the disease."}, "article_summary": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has dubbed Pakistan\u2019s northwestern city of Peshawar the world\u2019s \u201clargest reservoir\u201d of polio and declared that almost every 2013 polio case in Pakistan could be genetically linked to the virus strains in the city of four million.\nThe WHO reported that every sample taken from Peshawar\u2019s sewage system tested positive for a very contagious wild polio virus strain.\nSecurity needs to be improved in certain areas of Pakistan in order for vaccination efforts to continue, and for eradication to succeed.\nPolio continues to spread throughout both Pakistan and Syria, though vaccination efforts face obstacles from militant opponents, as well as a widespread belief that vaccines can cause infertility.\n\u201cWith more than 90 percent of the current polio cases in the country genetically linked to Peshawar, the [city] is now the largest reservoir of endemic poliovirus in the world,\u201d the WHO said in a statement."}
