The focus is on those with heart, pulmonary and other chronic conditions. How can we accomplish this for chronically ill patients who receive home-based health care? By supporting advanced in-home telemonitoring services under our state\u2019s private insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n\nTelemonitoring equipment helps us remotely assess the complex changes associated with a patient\u2019s condition. In combination with in-home nursing care and health education, telemonitoring gives the home health care team early warning that allows them to treat patients before their conditions deteriorate.\n\nTwo telemonitoring bills are currently moving through Connecticut\u2019s legislature. House Bill 5445 would allow Medicaid coverage of home telemonitoring services. Senate Bill 202 would require health insurer coverage of medical advice, diagnosis, care or treatment provided through telemedicine.\n\nDoes telemonitoring really work? It recently saved the life of one of VNA Healthcare\u2019s clients. Home health nurses, used to speaking with the homebound patient suffering from hypertension, had come to know her normal \u2018baseline\u2019 voice. One morning, the patient\u2019s nurse checked the patient\u2019s telemonitor and noticed that her blood pressure had dropped dramatically. The nurse also noted that the patient sounded weak, speaking in a soft voice.\n\nA care supervisor called the patient\u2019s daughter, who went to her mother\u2019s home to assess the situation. Meanwhile, the nurse called the patient\u2019s doctor, who advised the home health care team to temporarily halt the patient\u2019s blood pressure medications. After the patient\u2019s daughter reported that her mother was having bouts of diarrhea and was experiencing confusion, the patient was taken to the emergency department, where she was re\u2013hydrated and released.\n\nAfter she returned from the ED, the agency\u2019s visiting and telemonitor nurses kept tabs on the patient through in-person visits and telemonitor checks. In consultation with her physician, they adapted dosing of her blood pressure medications, which helped normalize the patient\u2019s blood pressure, preventing additional emergency care visits and hospitalizations.\n\nIn-home visits, daily telemonitoring, physician consultations and family involvement enhanced the care this patient was able to receive at home. What\u2019s more, continuous monitoring of her vital signs helped the patient better manage her daily health routine.\n\nDoes telemonitoring really save money? In 2013, telemonitoring services provided to VNA Healthcare patients saved the organization 690 home visits. That translates into approximately $70,000 in Medicare and Medicaid dollars that can be utilized to treat additional patients.\n\nTelemonitoring offers patients with chronic conditions the attention, treatment, education and self-management techniques that are keeping them out of the hospital. It\u2019s effective and efficient. It\u2019s saving money and improving lives. And it should be available to any Connecticut resident.\n\nTracy Wodatch is vice president of clinical and regulatory services at the Connecticut Association for Healthcare at Home", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Op/Ed, Medicaid, Medicare, telemonitoring", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/04/02/op-ed-why-telemonitoring-makes-sense-for-connecticuts-chronically-ill/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "The state should support advanced in-home telemonitoring services under our state\u2019s private insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid programs.", "title": "Op-ed: Why telemonitoring makes sense for Connecticut\u2019s chronically ill", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/04/02/op-ed-why-telemonitoring-makes-sense-for-connecticuts-chronically-ill/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/04/wodatchheadshot.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/04/02/op-ed-why-telemonitoring-makes-sense-for-connecticuts-chronically-ill/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bc0\"", "article_summary": "By supporting advanced in-home telemonitoring services under our state\u2019s private insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nHow can we accomplish this for chronically ill patients who receive home-based health care?\nIn consultation with her physician, they adapted dosing of her blood pressure medications, which helped normalize the patient\u2019s blood pressure, preventing additional emergency care visits and hospitalizations.\nMeanwhile, the nurse called the patient\u2019s doctor, who advised the home health care team to temporarily halt the patient\u2019s blood pressure medications.\nOne morning, the patient\u2019s nurse checked the patient\u2019s telemonitor and noticed that her blood pressure had dropped dramatically."}
