Yesterday, we told you about Alexis Van Bochove, the four-year-old with a rare form of cancer, who would like some Christmas Cards for the Holidays.

Alexis’ father Casey Van Bochove says the idea of the Christmas Cards came from a friend of his wife’s and loved the idea.

“This is probably her last Christmas and we’re trying to show her how many good people are out there,” Casey said.

Alexis is currently in hospice care and can no longer walk.

The family has received over 200 cards since they began asking for them about a week ago and are amazed by the response.

They are asking that you only send Christmas Cards, but Casey did say that Alexis is a huge Frozen fan.

There is a Facebook Page set up for Alexis.

If you’d like to send a card to Alexis, here is the address:
