Here are four things that should happen before you spend $1 on hiring, ads, public relations, visual design or collateral:\n\nPositioning. If you can state clearly who your product is for, the need it meets and the value it provides, you\u2019ll increase the return on investment. Nail the basics of positioning by filling in the following:\n\n[Product name] is for [target user] who needs to [problem to be solved] and feel [feelings] while they do it. [Product name] is based on the [adjective] idea that [unique insight] . It will win because [reasons].\n\nNow this isn\u2019t a customer-facing tagline at all. It\u2019s an internal tool to focus product and marketing strategy. Companies with clear positioning statements spend smarter, nail their messaging more often and take less time and cash to accumulate happy customers. Positioning statements also get teams aligned and working in the same direction, further saving time and cash. You will want a positioning statement before you spend cash. (And relax; you can iterate this over time. It\u2019s a prototype.)\n\nDrake Equation. Frank Drake was the radio-astronomer who, in 1961, came up with the famous equation for estimating the number of detectable, intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way. You should have your own version of the Drake Equation that describes how all the people in the world will narrow down to the ones who actually use your product again and again. Estimating the number of people in your total audience, the percentage who will hear your message, the fraction of those who will show interest, what share of those actually buy and how long the loyal ones stay with you is a remarkably powerful tool for management. In the early days, it is a statement of your vision for the future \u2014 even if you don\u2019t have any idea of the actual numbers. Once you have experience in the market, it becomes a general management tool for measuring and improving performance. A Drake Equation for your business offers some structure for what is likely to be a messy, uncertain search for success.\n\nAnalytic indoor plumbing. You don\u2019t need to invest in the Toto Washlet S350 of analytics infrastructure. But you do need basic tools to gather and analyze data. If your business is online, this can be as simple as properly provisioning Google Analytics or Mixpanel. If your business is offline, make sure you have ways to count traffic, conversions and repeats. If you do not have these data \u2014 and it\u2019s shocking how many companies are in this boat \u2014 you cannot make informed judgments about time or cash investments. The most common reason people do not opt for analytic indoor plumbing: \u201cWe\u2019re moving too fast,\u201d or, \u201cWe\u2019re just so scrappy.\u201d These nonsense excuses are based on the assumption that analytic indoor plumbing is expensive and hard to set up. That\u2019s as untrue about business analytics as it is about toilets.\n\nKey results targets. Once you have the first three steps done, the next one is a breeze. The best management teams operate with some form of management by objectives. In startups, a common form of this is \u201cObjectives and Key Results,\u201d or OKRs, a tool advocated by Andy Grove in his classic book, High Output Management. Stating the objective (desired, big-picture outcome) of the marketing effort and the key results expected (time-bound, ambitious measures of progress toward the objective) aligns the team and fosters learning. And the OKRs can easily fall right out of your Drake Equation and your dashboard of basic analytics. So if it takes more than ten minutes to do this, something is wrong.\n\nSpending time before you spend cash is like bathing and brushing your teeth: not really optional. And these steps are not only compatible with moving fast and being creative, they make speed and innovation more likely. In today\u2019s environment of easy capital, it\u2019s tempting to skip the fundamentals of positioning and analytics. But whether you are a founder or a founder\u2019s colleague, you are past winging it on your own. Other people\u2019s time, talent and money are in your hands.\n\nMr. Dearing is founder of Harrison Metal, a Palo Alto-based investor in early stage technology companies.\n\nFollow @mcgd\n\n\n\nFollow @WSJstartup\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "Weekend Read: Spend Time Before You Spend Money", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2015/06/05/weekend-read-spend-time-before-you-spend-money/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Small Business", "article.headline": "Weekend Read: Spend Time Before You Spend Money", "article_section": "Small Business", "author": "Adam Janofsky", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Accelerators Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Accelerators", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-06-05T15:49:25-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2015/06/05/weekend-read-spend-time-before-you-spend-money/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-232B-3674", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Small Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2015/06/05/weekend-read-spend-time-before-you-spend-money/", "site_name": "WSJ", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "title": "Weekend Read: Spend Time Before You Spend Money"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Accelerators", "article.id": "BL-232B-3674", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-06-05T15:49:25-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd334f\"", "article_summary": "Spending time before you spend cash is like bathing and brushing your teeth: not really optional.\nDrake Equation.\nOnce you have experience in the market, it becomes a general management tool for measuring and improving performance.\nYou will want a positioning statement before you spend cash.\nA Drake Equation for your business offers some structure for what is likely to be a messy, uncertain search for success."}
