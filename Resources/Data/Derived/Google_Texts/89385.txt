Doctors around the nation could start seeing about 43% less medicaid money.

Two years ago, some states chose to expand the insurance program under the Affordable Care Act. Last week, this program expired meaning many doctors will face big cuts in medicaid pay.

Leaders in Virginia chose not to expand medicaid so patients, and doctors won't be affected.

To make sure there is no impact on your healthcare, leaders with Sentara RMH said they have made changes to their system to manage expenses, to keep up with the changes in reimbursment rates.

Phil Hackett, the executive director of Sentara RMH said the hospital would never turn away a patient in need.

"We're committed to taking care of our patients. We live and breathe in this community. This is our community. We're very proud of the mission that we have, and we're not going to turn anybody away," Hackett said.

Last year, medicaid enrollment increased by almost 10 million, covering more than 68 million people nationwide. However Sentara RMH only saw a .1% percent increase in medicaid patients.
