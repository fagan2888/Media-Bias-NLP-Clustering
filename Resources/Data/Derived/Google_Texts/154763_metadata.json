According to the report, contact lenses alter the bacterial community of eyes, making the eye surface more similar to the surface of skin. The researchers suspect this may be why eye infections are more common in contact lens users. Although the reason for this shift in bacteria type still remains unclear, with the nearly 30 million and counting contact lens users worldwide, the need to get to the root of this finding has never been more pressing.\n\nIn 1887 German glassblower F.A. Muller created the world\u2019s first contact lens. The tool was no bigger than a thumb nail, but it completely revolutionized eyesight correction, giving those with poor eyesight a more discreet way to address their handicap. The link between contact lenses and increased risk of eye infection has already been established but the underlying components of this risk are not entirely clear.\n\nFor the new study, led by Dr. Maria Dominguez-Bello from New York University School of Medicine, Dominguez-Bello and her team took samples of surface eye bacteria and bacteria beneath the eyes of 58 adults, and analyzed samples from 20 of the study participants (nine lens wearers and 11 non-lens wearers) at three points over the course of six weeks.\n\nIn total, the team looked at cotton swabs from 116 conjunctiva, (the eye surface), 114 swabs from under the eye, and 20 from contact lenses. In doing so, they were surprised to find that there was a higher diversity of bacteria on the eye surface than there was on the skin under the eye or on the actual contact lenses. In addition, the team noted that the surface of the eye in contact lens wearers had more bacteria associated skin, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Methylobacterium, and Lactobacillus, than samples from volunteers who did not wear contacts.\n\nThe reason for this difference in eye microbiota between lens and non lens wearers is not entirely clear, but according to Dominguez-Bello in a recent statement, it could be that the skin bacteria is \u201ctransferred from the fingers to the lens and to the eye surface\u201d or it could be that \u201cthe lenses exert selective pressures on the eye bacterial community in favor of skin bacteria.\"\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear as to whether the increased presence of these skin bacteria are the reason for the increased risk of infection in contact lens wearers, but according to Dominguez-Bello, since contact lenses have been identified as a risk factor for the development of more serious eye infections, such as giant papillary conjunctivitis, a severe inflammation of the upper eyelid, and keratitis, \u201cthese questions are important.\u201d\n\nTo others in the the field of eye care, the findings are less than surprising. \u201cThe study just points out that the bacteria around lids is closer to skin bacteria in general in the contact lens wearing crowd,\u201d Dr. Robert Latkany of Physician Eye Care of NY, who was not involved with the study, told Medical Daily. \u201cBecause a big source of the infections most likely come from the user's contaminated fingers when inserting or removing the lenses.\u201d\n\nAccording to Latkany, he will still continue to advise his patients to practice good hygiene when dealing with contact lenses.\u201cContact lenses and laser eye surgery both carry risks of infections, while glasses do not,\u201d wrote Latkany. \u201cBut the risks are relatively low and that is why they are popular.\u201d\n\nWhile the far-reaching repercussions of the findings are also not clear, they could potentially affect a large majority of the world\u2019s population, especially in America which is home to a third of all worldwide contact lens users. This increasing prevalence of eyesight problems is partly due to both less time spent outdoors and increased near-work activities, such as time spent reading and studying, Popular Science reported. It\u2019s likely that spending more time in front of a screen, whether it be a television or smart phone, also plays a role in the increasing amount of world-wide eyesight problems.\n\nDominguez-Bello also explained that it is too early to offer any advice to contact lens wearers based on these results, but added that \u201cother studies have shown increased risk for eye infections in contact lens users\u201d which could possibly be explained by the lenses\u2019 impact on the microbiome.\n\n\u201cWhen we can better understand the mechanisms, we will be able to test hypotheses and propose preventive measurements,\" Dominguez-Bello concluded.\n\nSource: Shin H, Price K, Luong A, Dodick J, Park L, Dominguez-Bello MG.
