Bill Cassidy (R., La.) wants the GOP to start thinking like the left.\n\nIn proposing the Patient Freedom Act, Cassidy believes he is doing just that\u2014slowly chipping away at Obamacare by bringing federalism back into the health care system and getting the federal government out.\n\n\u201cOf course it would be wonderful [to repeal Obamacare now],\u201d Cassidy told the Washington Free Beacon. \u201cBut as Paul Ryan says, President Obama is not going to sign a repeal of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe left was really good for decades\u2014they were pushing, and pushing, and pushing [for health care reform],\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cWe\u2019re impatient. We want it all at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we have to be as strategic as they,\u201d he said. \u201cPlant those seeds, water, show people our alternative, and inch back.\u201d\n\nCassidy\u2019s bill proposes a way forward following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in King v. Burwell, which is expected by the end of June. The case will decide whether the majority of health exchanges, which are run by the federal government, are legally allowed to provide subsidies.\n\nCassidy, a doctor who unseated Mary Landrieu (D., La.) last November, narrowly focused his bill to be a response to a ruling in favor of Burwell, which would take away subsidies in states that are operated by the federal exchange. Only 13 states operate their own health insurance marketplaces, since the $205 million Hawaii exchange announced it would fold and be taken over by the federal government.\n\nThe Patient Freedom Act would give states the option of keeping Obamacare by establishing a state-based exchange, or using existing funding to provide tax credits to create Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) for the uninsured, averaging $1,500 per person.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to give the state an option other than setting up an Obamacare exchange,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\n\u201cThe president, I\u2019m sure, will make it easy [to set up a state exchange], because he wants his law to take root,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a better plan, it will take root.\u201d\n\nIf states chose Cassidy\u2019s option, they could do away with various mandates under Obamacare, including the individual and employer mandates and requirements for minimum essential coverage. The legislation would also equalize tax treatment, and require health providers to publish cash prices for services reimbursed from an HSA.\n\nPrice transparency would enable patients to know the price before booking an appointment for medical services such as a CAT scan, which Cassidy said can range between $100 and $2,500 depending on the time of day.\n\n\u201cUnder Obamacare, you have a $6,000 deductible,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cPeople are forgoing good care because they can\u2019t afford a $6,000 deductible. Under the Health Savings Account (HSA) we have first-dollar coverage. Your daughter has an earache, you bring her to the doctor and the doctor will be covered. We with our HSA actually have first dollar coverage for that which people need most.\u201d\n\nCassidy\u2019s bill borrows from other Republican alternatives to Obamacare in Congress, such as Rep. Tom Price (R., Ga.), whose replacement plan also offers tax credits. Cassidy said his is the only plan that would solve the gap in coverage if the Supreme Court does away with Obamacare subsidies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got three options: Some woman receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer paying far more than she should for health insurance because of Obamacare mandates loses the Obamacare subsidies and can\u2019t afford her insurance and loses her care,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThat\u2019s the president\u2019s fault for implementing the law illegally, but quite likely he\u2019ll successfully blame us.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond, the president, in order to alleviate her problem, will say, \u2018All Republicans have to do in the Senate and the House is deem federal exchanges state exchanges for the purposes of receiving subsidies,\u201d he continued. \u201cOr go to governors, and say, \u2018Governor, why don\u2019t you just set up a state exchange? We\u2019ll make it easy for you, and preserve her health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe third option is we have a plan,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cAnd we can credibly say we\u2019ve got something better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Freshman Sen.
