2. During the GOP debate on Saturday, Rubio repeated the same line FOUR times: Barack Obama knows what he’s doing.

Rubio was asked if he was too inexperienced — and attacked by others with the comparison that Obama was a one-term senator.

“Let’s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn’t know what he’s doing,” said Rubio. “He knows exactly what he’s doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world. That’s why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran, it is a systematic effort to change America.”

And again:

“Let’s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn’t know what he’s doing. He knows exactly what he’s doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don’t want to be like the rest of the world,” Rubio said.

And again:

“We are not facing a president who doesn’t know what’s doing. He knows what he is doing. That’s why he’s done the things he’s done.”
