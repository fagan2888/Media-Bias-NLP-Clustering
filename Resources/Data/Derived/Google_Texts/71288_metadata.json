The conference continues through Thursday.\n\nAt a discussion on the next generation of wearables and how they\u2019ll use sensors and human interaction, Striiv cofounder and CEO Dave Wang said new technology is allowing healthcare service and product providers to interact with consumers for better outcomes.\n\n\"Two-way communication is really important for wellness,\" he said. \"You're basically engaging members and patients on the wrist.\"\n\nWellness can be boosted through programs including Balance Rewards at Walgreens, which sends reminders via buzzes or messages on wearable devices to remind patients to take medication or complete other health-related activities. Customers who monitor blood pressure, weigh in, and track runs or bike rides can receive reward points redeemable at stores.\n\n\"You want to have little light interaction with the user,\" he said.\n\nThe theme of data carried over to a panel on healthcare investing, where Pritzker Group Venture Capital partner Adam Koopersmith talked about the changes brought on by the Affordable Care Act and the increasing use of wearables and electronic medical records.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018quantified self\u2019 movement has created millions and billions of data points around consumer health that just didn\u2019t exist a while ago,\u201c he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re finding that as consumers are becoming more influential in the healthcare system, a lot of the traditional B2B players in the markets \u2014 whether that\u2019s providers or insurance carriers \u2014 need to have a much more consumer-facing orientation.\u201d\n\nAt a panel called \u201cTelehealth Turnabout,\u201d panelists from Pager, Optimized Care Network, the Mid-Atlantic Telehealth Resource Center and Chicago-based Zest Health talked about new innovations and challenges in the movement.\n\nKathy Hsu Wibberly, director of the Mid-Atlantic Telehealth Resource Center, said that though patients are collecting large amounts of data, physicians aren\u2019t always equipped to use that data.\n\n\u201cThat whole realm of patient-generated health data \u2014 people don\u2019t know what to do with it right now,\u201d Wibberly said.\n\nShe said large insurance-plan providers are beginning to contract with telehealth providers to better connect data and in-person care.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re seeing a big move, but it\u2019s still spotty,\u201d Wibberly said. \u201cIt\u2019s huge in one area but barely exists in another area.\u201d\n\nPager\u2019s chief medical officer, Richard Boxer, said better integration of data may come as younger doctors enter the workforce.\n\n\u201cAs doctors over 50 start to retire and the new ones come on, all that will be technologically feasible [and] acceptable,\u201d Boxer said. \u201cIt took doctors 18 years to accept the stethoscope. What\u2019s going to happen with telemedicine?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Cook Children's Health Care System in Fort Worth, Texas, is having success with self-serve check-in kiosks, said Theresa Meadows, the hospital and clinic system\u2019s senior vice president and CIO, at another session. Users are cutting the time they spend in registration and are paying their fees on the spot, she said.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t the hospital be like that? Why shouldn\u2019t you be able to register for your appointment online, show up to your organization, check in, pay your fee, and then go straight to the appointment?\u201d she asked.\n\nShe said the kiosks have logged about 100,000 check-ins since they were connected to the system's centralized registration process in 2013. She also said they\u2019ve helped the system increase its upfront co-pay collections.\n\n\u201cPeople thought they weren\u2019t going to pay a $10,000 co-pay at a kiosk,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cAnd they do. They swipe their credit cards. People are paying significant dollar amounts at these kiosks on the front end, which is a huge thing on the revenue side. You don\u2019t have to wait 35 days or 40 days to receive your copayment. It makes a big difference.\u201d\n\nJackson is a freelance writer for Blue Sky.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "HIMSS conference: Robots, wearables and the future of healthcare", "date": "2015-04-15", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Blue Sky", "author": "Blue Sky", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Investors, entrepreneurs and physicians at HIMSS tried to see the future through a stethoscope.", "title": "HIMSS conference: Robots, wearables and the future of healthcare", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/chi-himss-conference-robots-wearables-bsi-20150415-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-552e8416/turbine/chi-himss-conference-robots-wearables-bsi-20150415", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp06.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/83303191", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "HIMSS, Healthcare Information and Management Systems, Dave Wang, Striiv, Walgreens, Balance Rewards, Pritzker Group Venture Capital, Adam Koopersmith", "news_keywords": "HIMSS, Healthcare Information and Management Systems, Dave Wang, Striiv, Walgreens, Balance Rewards, Pritzker Group Venture Capital, Adam Koopersmith", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Speakers at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society conference discussed the next wave of wearable devices and the future of telehealth."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd83f\"", "article_summary": "She said large insurance-plan providers are beginning to contract with telehealth providers to better connect data and in-person care.\n\u201cThat whole realm of patient-generated health data \u2014 people don\u2019t know what to do with it right now,\u201d Wibberly said.\nAs more than 40,000 attendees roamed McCormick Place on Tuesday, speakers at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society conference discussed the next wave of wearable devices, healthcare investing and the future of telehealth.\nInvestors, entrepreneurs and physicians at HIMSS tried to see the future through a stethoscope.\nCustomers who monitor blood pressure, weigh in, and track runs or bike rides can receive reward points redeemable at stores."}
