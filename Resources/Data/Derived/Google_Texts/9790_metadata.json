Paulsen will have surgery on Monday, while the date for Paul\u2019s procedure has not yet been determined.\n\nPaul had a career-high 39 catches for 507 yards last season, leading to a three-year $6 million contract extension he signed in February. Paulsen, entering the final season of a three-year, $4 million contract, had 13 catches for 78 yards and a touchdown in 2014.\n\nThe team has not yet placed either player on injured reserve. Hamm, who left the game against the Browns in the second quarter after getting poked in the eye, took most of the first-team reps on Saturday.\n\nRight tackle Tom Compton, who has spent extensive time at right guard in training camp, also took some reps as a jumbo tight end in running packages on Saturday. The Redskins showed that formation on occasion late last season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a versatile guy,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI doubt he\u2019ll catch any passes down the middle of the seam, but he can get in there and block, and he can run block and do all the things a tight end needs to do without running routes.\u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 236-pound Hamm, a wide receiver in college, went undrafted out of Louisiana-Monroe in 2014 and spent all of last season on the Redskins\u2018 practice squad. Dixon, a 6-foot-5, 240-pounder, went undrafted out of Central Arkansas that same year and joined the team in November.\n\n\u201c[I just have to] take advantage of all the reps that I\u2019m given with a couple guys out,\u201d Hamm said. \u201cWith a couple guys out, the rep count went up for a lot of us younger guys. Coach Wes [Phillips] has coached us up well, and to be able to go out there and get that experience is great.\u201d\n\nGruden also said that running back Silas Redd will miss the season after tearing the ACL and MCL in his right knee in the game on Thursday. Redd, undrafted out of USC prior to last season, played 55 snaps as a rookie and rushed for 75 yards on 16 carries and a touchdown. He was competing for a role in the running back rotation during training camp.\n\nLeft tackle Trent Williams sat out Saturday\u2019s practice with irritation in his right knee, while inside linebacker Perry Riley also missed the session after experiencing swelling in one of his wrists and defensive end Frank Kearse was on the sidelines with his left shoulder wrapped.\n\nStrong safety Jeron Johnson returned to the field after straining a hamstring on Aug. 1, and cornerback David Amerson also practiced for the first time as he recovers after straining the AC joint in his left shoulder on Aug. 3.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul broke his left ankle in the Redskins' preseason victory over the Browns on Thursday, while Paulsen will undergo surgery on Monday after sustaining turf toe in practice last week.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Paul broke his left ankle in the Redskins\u2019 preseason victory over the Browns on Thursday, while Paulsen will undergo surgery on Monday after sustaining turf toe in practice last week.", "title": "Redskins tight ends Niles Paul, Logan Paulsen each out for season with injuries", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/15/niles-paul-logan-paulsen-redskins-out-for-season/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/11/AP_744561569784.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/11/AP_744561569784.jpg", "description": "Paul broke his left ankle in the Redskins' preseason victory over the Browns on Thursday, while Paulsen will undergo surgery on Monday after sustaining turf toe in practice last week.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Redskins tight ends Niles Paul, Logan Paulsen each out for season with"}, "Author": "Zac Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jay Gruden, Ron Hamm, Washington Redskins, Logan Paulsen"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9bc4\"", "article_summary": "RICHMOND \u2014 Tight ends Niles Paul and Logan Paulsen will each undergo surgery next week and will miss the entire season, Washington Redskins coach Jay Gruden said on Saturday.\nGruden had said after the game against the Browns that Paul would miss the season, while that was the likely scenario for Paulsen as well.\nPaulsen, entering the final season of a three-year, $4 million contract, had 13 catches for 78 yards and a touchdown in 2014.\n\u201c[I just have to] take advantage of all the reps that I\u2019m given with a couple guys out,\u201d Hamm said.\nPaul had a career-high 39 catches for 507 yards last season, leading to a three-year $6 million contract extension he signed in February."}
