But the law might backfire by making it more likely for people to overdose or overheat without water or medical assistance. Referred to as the Federal Reducing Americans\u2019 Vulnerability to Ecstasy (RAVE) Act, the federal law dictates that club promoters and event organizers can be prosecuted if they don\u2019t stop their patrons from doing drugs at their events. It targets organizers of big raves or dance parties who allow the use of drugs made from MDMA \u2014 like ecstasy or Molly.\n\nEcstasy and ecstasy-related drugs push your core temperature up to extreme highs. These drugs can be dangerous when the user becomes overheated and dehydrated after dancing all night in a hot, crowded area and doesn\u2019t drink enough water. \u201cTheir temperatures were like 106 or 107 degrees,\u201d Anderson told LiveScience of some victims. \u201cThey basically burned up.\u201d Others die from overhydrating to compensate for the overheating, and \u201cessentially drown themselves.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s understandable why there\u2019s a federal law trying to curb those unnecessary deaths, but Anderson argues that the law itself might be doing more harm than good. In fact, she points out that electric dance music festivals have seen 15 people die worldwide recently. \u201cIt puts [club promoters and organizers] in an impossible position of protecting their clientele while abiding by the provisions of the act,\u201d said Tammy Anderson, a sociologist at the University of Delaware and an author of the study.\n\nIn other words, if club promoters aren\u2019t allowed to set up precautions \u2014 like water, medics, and drug safety tests \u2014 rave-goers might be more likely to get in trouble. \u201c[I]f the promoter \u2014 like Electric Daisy Carnival \u2014 provides water, it\u2019s an indication that they must know that drug use is going to happen at their event, because they\u2019re trying to hydrate their clientele who get dehydrated from dancing on Molly or ecstasy,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nHowever, sometimes just water or medics won\u2019t be enough to save lives. Plenty of people die from drug toxicity or drug-related car crashes during or after big raves \u2014 many of them young students in their teens or 20s. Victims will typically begin experiencing seizures, then cardiac arrest, and are deemed dead from overdosing.\n\nSo how can we prevent these deaths? Firstly, don\u2019t take hard drugs \u2014 or mix drugs \u2014 when going to festivals or raves, as this might increase your chances of overheating, dehydration, and cardiac arrest. Anderson mentions that festivals can take precautions, too: such as providing medics and holding parties during cooler times of the day or year.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rave, law, tries, prevent, ecstasy, use, parties, one, researcher, argues, its, more, harmful", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A law that attempts to stop the use of drugs at raves and dance parties isn\u2019t helping, and instead might make matters worse.", "title": "Law Tries To Stop Ecstasy Use At Parties, But Does More Harm Than Good", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rave-law-tries-prevent-ecstasy-use-parties-one-researcher-argues-its-more-harmful-helpful-299184", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/21/ravers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A law that attempts to stop the use of drugs at raves and dance parties isn\u2019t helping, and instead might make matters worse.", "title": "Law Tries To Stop Ecstasy Use At Parties, But Does More Harm Than Good", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rave-law-tries-prevent-ecstasy-use-parties-one-researcher-argues-its-more-harmful-helpful-299184", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/21/ravers.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/21/ravers.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-08-21T15:15:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-21T15:15:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A law that attempts to stop the use of drugs at raves and dance parties isn\u2019t helping, and instead might make matters worse."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb5bf\"", "article_summary": "A 2003 federal law aimed at preventing the use of \u201cparty drugs\u201d like ecstasy at raves might be more harmful than helpful, according to one researcher.\nThe law targets club promoters for offering services like water, medics, and testing drugs for safety \u2014 since these actions might mean drugs are present at the party.\nRave and festival-goers are notorious for using MDMA-related drugs, like ecstasy and Molly, which can be quite dangerous.\nIt targets organizers of big raves or dance parties who allow the use of drugs made from MDMA \u2014 like ecstasy or Molly.\nIn other words, if club promoters aren\u2019t allowed to set up precautions \u2014 like water, medics, and drug safety tests \u2014 rave-goers might be more likely to get in trouble."}
