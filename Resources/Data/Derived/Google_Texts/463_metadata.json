Daniel Donovan voted in favor of the budget, calling it \"responsible.\"\n\nDonovan (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn) was among the 79 Republicans joining 187 Democrats in voting in favor of the accord, which passed with a vote of 266 to 167.\n\nThe budget deal lifts the federal borrowing limit through March 2017, greatly reducing the chance of a government shutdown.\n\nThe net spending remains roughly the same over the next two years. While it allows up to $80 billion more spending in some areas, it decreases spending in other areas by roughly the same amount. Included in the additional spending is $32 billion more for the Pentagon's and State Department's overseas operations.\n\nThe budget deal cuts Medicare payments to doctors and other healthcare providers, which prevents dramatic premium increases for seniors.\n\nThe accord makes changes to the Social Security disability program, which is expected to save the government billions and keep the program funded for years.\n\nIt also eliminates the Affordable Care Act's auto-enrollment mandate, which automatically enrolls employees in employer healthcare plans regardless of whether they want the coverage.\n\nThe deal now goes to the Senate, which is expected to approve it.\n\nDonovan said in a statement, \"Representatives are sent to Washington to find solutions. This isn't a perfect deal, but it delivers results: the federal government will pay its debts, responsible spending caps will continue, seniors will not see outrageous increases in their Medicare premiums, and a major provision of Obamacare will be repealed.\"\n\nThis story was updated to reflect that while the budget allows $80 billion more in spending, it reduces the deficit by the same amount, resulting in no net increase.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Daniel Donovan, congress, daniel-donovan, news", "title": "Rep.
