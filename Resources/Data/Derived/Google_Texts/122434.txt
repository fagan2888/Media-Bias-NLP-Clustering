Aetna's 4Q15 Results Are Coming Up: Will It Beat the Estimates? PART 2 OF 6

Analysts Project Weak 4Q15 Revenue Growth for Aetna

Weak revenue growth

On February 1, 2016, Aetna (AET) is expected to announce its 4Q15 earnings. The quarter ended on December 31, 2015. Wall Street has estimated Aetna’s 4Q15 revenue to be about $14.9 billion, a growth of only 1.1% on a year-over-year (or YOY) basis. In 4Q15, Aetna is expected to register a net profit margin of 2.8%, equal to the 2.8% reported by UnitedHealth Group (UNH).

The above chart shows that analysts expect Aetna’s revenues to rise and reach $15.5 billion in fiscal 1Q16. This is mainly attributed to the expected increase in enrollments in the company’s Medicare and Medicaid segments. The revenue growth is projected to be partly offset by the future impact of known membership attrition in the company’s commercial self-insured business due to a few large insurance customers who are expected to switch to alternative funding arrangements.

Profitability margins

Wall Street has also projected that Aetna’s net profit margins will rise in 1Q16 and reach 5.4%. However, in 4Q15, margins are expected to be pressured by the individual and small group Affordable Care Act (or ACA) compliant business. The individual exchange business has also proved challenging for peer companies such as Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI).

In 2015, the small group ACA business is projected to account for approximately $3.5 billion in premiums. The on-exchange individual business will be about $2.7 billion in premium revenues. While the ACA-compliant small group business is expected to be profitable in 2015, the margins will be below the target. The individual exchange business is estimated to be unprofitable, while the off-exchange individual business, which is worth approximately $0.8 billion, is projected to break even in 2015.
