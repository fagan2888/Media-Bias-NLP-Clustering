That rule won\u2019t be finalized until next year, and it\u2019s likely that House Republicans, who requested the GAO report, will use its findings to slow that process.\n\n\u201cRather than using a fair and open rulemaking process, EPA pushed through regulations using sloppy analysis without sufficiently informing Congress or the public of the economic impact,\u201d Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) said in a statement.\n\nIssa, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, along with other Republicans, has taken issue with the president\u2019s use of executive actions that bypass Congress in order to address divisive issues like climate change.\n\nRelated: EPA to Power Plants: Clean Up or Shut Down\n\nIn June, the EPA released its proposal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by cutting CO2 emissions from existing power sources by 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.\n\nIn the report, auditors suggested that the Office of Management and Budget clarify the process of estimating the costs and benefits of EPA\u2019s proposals\u2014especially for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They also said the EPA should do a better job of following the government\u2019s guidelines when it comes to issuing cost benefit analyses.\n\nEPA, for its part, said that the GAO\u2019s review only focused on a \u201csmall subset\u201d of rules, and that overall EPA adheres to the official guidelines for the majority of its rulings.\n\nThe auditors reviewed rules including the EPA\u2019s regulations overseeing Commercial and Industrial Solid Incineration Units and renewable fuel standards The Hill noted.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When the Environmental Protection Agency proposes regulations, it doesn\u2019t always do a", "title": "EPA Fails at a Simple Cost-Benefit Analysis", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/12/EPA-Fails-Simple-Cost-Benefit-Analysis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/EPA_Building.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/12/EPA-Fails-Simple-Cost-Benefit-Analysis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/EPA_Building.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When the Environmental Protection Agency proposes regulations, it doesn\u2019t always do a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc02b\"", "article_summary": "The auditors reviewed rules including the EPA\u2019s regulations overseeing Commercial and Industrial Solid Incineration Units and renewable fuel standards The Hill noted.\n\u201cRather than using a fair and open rulemaking process, EPA pushed through regulations using sloppy analysis without sufficiently informing Congress or the public of the economic impact,\u201d Rep.
