The New York Post touched on the Clinton/Epstein connection in February.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nJust a few weeks ago, reports broke that Bill Clinton had flown at least 11 times on \u201cThe Lolita Express\u201d \u2014 a private plane owned by the mysterious financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nAlso, forget that Michelle Obama made over $100k as a part-time hospital employee while Obama was in the Senate \u2014 not to mention any monies that came in through her serving on boards and such. Those kinds of inquiries are often dismissed as out of bounds, because they\u2019re characterized as attacks on a candidate\u2019s family.\n\nObama\u2019s reported income was $103,633 in 2007, the year she reduced her work schedule to part time.\n\nBut those sorts of concerns didn\u2019t stop Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Halperin and David Knowles from piling on the family of conservative Republican Ted Cruz as he announced his candidacy for the GOP nomination.\n\nOne day after announcing himself as presidential candidate, Texas Senator Ted Cruz fired a few shots across the bow of Wall Street, and the firm that employs his wife as managing director. In an interview with Bloomberg\u2019s With All Due Respect, Cruz was asked by host Mark Halperin whether, on balance, Goldman Sachs was a positive or a negative force on society.\n\nBloomberg pushed and pushed, forcing Cruz to defend his wife.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s interview, Halperin pointed out that during Cruz\u2019s campaign rollout at Liberty University on Monday, he failed to mention the fact that his wife, Heidi, worked for Goldman Sachs. \u201cI am unabashedly proud about everything about Heidi,\u201d Cruz responded. \u201cAnd I did mention the fact that she had an incredibly successful business career.\u201d A managing director at Goldman, Heidi Cruz will be taking unpaid leave as she campaigns for her husband. As a result, the Cruz family will be switching over from Goldman\u2019s generous medical plan to, you guessed it, Obamacare.\n\nBut then, what was left to attack? BuzzFeed already went after his father. Conservatives and Republicans would do well to remember that the next time they hear this, or that liberal politician\u2019s family is off limits because\u2026 well, because the media mostly agrees with them, I suppose.
