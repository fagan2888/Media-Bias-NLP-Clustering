More on this NCAA Women's Soccer College Cup

For the soccer-loving families out there ...

Tickets now are on sale for the NCAA Womenâ€™s Soccer College Cup, which will be held on Dec. 4 and Dec. 6 at WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary.

The semifinals will be played at 4 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., Dec. 4. The national championship will be played at noon, Dec. 6. Weekend passes are $35 and include general admission to all three games and parking for both days. Passes can be purchased through the NCAA's website and printed at home.

Games will be played rain or shine.

We often see a Triangle team or two competing in the semifinals or finals. As of Friday afternoon, North Carolina was ranked No. 1. (And my Virginia Cavaliers, who lost in the final game last year, are No. 3. Wahoowa!). Florida State is in the No. 2 spot.

The tournament was last in Cary in 2013 when UCLA won.
