BOCA RATON, Fla. - Kimberly Cogan works out on a regular basis but couldn't get rid of that one trouble spot that she called a little extra "roll' on her abdomen. She tried diets, different exercises, different trainers but nothing worked.

Cogan then heard about UltraShape, one of the newest treatments that's advertised as a fat buster.

According to Plastic Surgeon Dr. Jason Pozner of Boca Raton, UltraShape uses ultrasound to send a focused sound wave that breaks up the fat.

It's also painless and it can treat a larger portion of the body at one time. After the treatment, the body absorbs the fat, it goes in to the bloodstream and it's excreted, according to Pozner.

UltraShape has been used in Europe for nearly a decade and it's been in the U.S. for a year.

Patients need three treatments, two weeks apart before results can be noticed. Slight swelling is the only possible side effect.

Cost is between $800 and $1,000 for a single treatment.

For Cogan, she said she noticed a difference after one treatment and was pleased with her flatter tummy after her final treatment.
