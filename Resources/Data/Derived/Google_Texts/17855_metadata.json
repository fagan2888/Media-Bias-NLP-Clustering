They\u2019ve closed off roads running past one of Mexico\u2019s busiest inter-city bus terminals and are at work repairing the broken sewer line and the hole that it\u2019s carved \u2014 a cavern estimated to be about four stories deep.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been afraid that the earth could collapse beneath us,\u201d said Rosalia Orozco, 63, who\u2019s lived here for half a century. \u201cIt\u2019s strange to me that they didn\u2019t take into account the conditions here before they built so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u201d is the borough of Alvaro Obregon. Its 720,000 mostly working class residents make it among the most crowded of Mexico City\u2019s 16 boroughs and, officials say, one of its more geologically challenged.\n\nThe borough occupies ridgelines that rise from the onetime lake bed upon which the capital center stands. The borough is sluiced by flood-prone canyons and gullies in which thousands of poor families have built makeshift, haphazard homes.\n\nA gunpowder factory owned by the Mexican army sits in the center of one neighborhood. An oil storage facility occupies another.\n\nThe above video was published Wednesday by Mexico\u2019s Milenio.com news site.\n\nBut most worrying to residents and some officials are the many miles of abandoned sand and gravel mines \u2014 no one knows exactly how many exist or how extensive each is \u2014 bored ant-like beneath the homes of as many as 250,000 people.\n\n\u201cThe mines are a problem we\u2019ve always had here,\u201d says Georgina Pineda, spokeswoman for the borough government. \u201cWe live with these risks every day.\u201d\n\nMost Mexico City dwellers know the dangers go way back.\n\nHundreds of years ago, this megacity was the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. It was a whole lot smaller, and perched on islands in a sprawling, shallow lake.\n\nSpanish colonists drained the lake, reversed the streams feeding it, and built their own capital.\n\nThat hobbled the city with hydrological horrors and an unstable, soft-soiled foundation that haunt it still.\n\nMany older downtown buildings lean heavily to one side or have sunk feet-deep into the earth. A 1985 earthquake killed as many as 20,000 people as downtown buildings wiggled in the gelatin ground and then collapsed.\n\nOver three decades of quickly swelling population beginning in the 1940s, the mines of Alvaro Obregon provided raw material for a concrete-heavy building boom across Mexico City\u2019s metropolis, now home to some 23 million people.\n\nThe construction companies didn\u2019t keep maps or other records of the mines they dug. City officials never discouraged newcomers from settling atop the array of abandoned mine shafts.\n\nSome two-thirds of the 30-square-mile borough now sits above the abandoned mines, officials say.\n\n\u201cIn those days there were no regulations impeding urbanization,\u201d Alfredo Alanis, public works director for Alvaro Obregon, says of the 1970s, when most of the neighborhoods were built. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a count of how many mines there are. Some are underneath three entire neighborhoods. Others are only a block long.\u201d\n\nA collapsing mine shaft forced the demolition of a dozen houses and threatened to swallow more than 300 others in one neighborhood in 2007.\n\nAnother sinkhole nearby consumed two more houses in 2011. Still another that suddenly gaped on a street last summer has spared homes so far.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing here when I first arrived. Just fields and mine shafts,\u201d says Orozco, who moved here with her family from the countryside in the 1960s. \u201cIf there are caverns beneath all of this, how can we not have collapses?\u201d\n\nCity crews have filled in about 900 mines with rock and concrete in recent years, Alaniz says. The work continues as new shafts are discovered, usually when cracks appear in the walls of an affected building or a hole suddenly yawns in a street or yard.\n\nThe sinkholes are a constant worry, Orozco and other residents say. Earthquakes pose another one entirely.\n\nIn addition to the tunnels, gravel and sand were excavated from broad open pit mines. Developers later filled the pits with rubble and built houses upon them. That\u2019s made for a jiggly life for homeowners.\n\n\u201cWhen there is an earthquake the ground here shakes like jelly,\u201d says Leticia Cruz, 50, whose family\u2019s restaurant overlooks the intersection where the newest cavern was discovered early this month.\n\nUnstable landfill soil ikely caused the large storm sewer \u2014 the one that created the latest cavern \u2014 to break some years ago, officials say. City engineers say they\u2019re not yet sure how far the hole extends under the streets and toward nearby houses.\n\nWhile engineers calculate the fissure is about 45-feet deep, they do not yet know how far it extends horizontally.\n\n\u201cIf this has been going on all this time and they didn\u2019t know anything, what can we expect?\u201d says Miguel Hernandez, 30, who sells fruit cocktails from a pushcart across the street from where work crews are digging to reach the broken pipe. \u201cWe won\u2019t know anything until it pulls us below.\u201d\n\nThis article was published by Global Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A cavern 45 feet deep carved beneath the Mexican capital's busy streets highlights a long-lurking threat.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Dudley Althaus", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "A cavern 45 feet deep carved beneath the Mexican capital's busy streets highlights a long-lurking threat.", "title": "Deep Caverns And Old Mine Shafts Are Giving Mexico City A Sinking Feeling", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/deep-caverns-old-mine-shafts-giving-mexico-city-sinking-feeling/187226/", "image": "http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/gp3_slideshow_large/photos/2014-March/mexico_city_cavern_2014_03_20.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-21T11:16:15-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A cavern 45 feet deep carved beneath the Mexican capital's busy streets highlights a long-lurking threat.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mexico_city_cavern_2014_03_20.jpg", "title": "Deep Caverns And Old Mine Shafts Are Giving Mexico City A Sinking Feeling", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "pollution", "published_time": "2014-03-22T05:00:11-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-21T11:16:15-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca579\"", "article_summary": "Deep Caverns And Old Mine Shafts Are Giving Mexico City A Sinking FeelingA cavern 45 feet deep carved beneath the Mexican capital's busy streets highlights a long-lurking threat.\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 With all the crime, pollution and traffic, life has been shaky on the teeming streets clinging to Mexico City\u2019s hilly southwest side.\nCity officials never discouraged newcomers from settling atop the array of abandoned mine shafts.\n\u201cWe live with these risks every day.\u201dMost Mexico City dwellers know the dangers go way back.\nIts 720,000 mostly working class residents make it among the most crowded of Mexico City\u2019s 16 boroughs and, officials say, one of its more geologically challenged."}
