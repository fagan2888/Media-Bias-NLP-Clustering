All India Bakchod posted a sketch on YouTube called \u201cIt\u2019s Your Fault\u201d last Thursday that has already far surpassed its previous videos with nearly 1 million views.\n\nIn the video, an increasingly bruised and battered group of young women use the PSA format to cheerily correct the \u201cnotion that women are people too.\u201d Because, \u201clet\u2019s face it ladies: Rape. It\u2019s your fault.\u201d From there, the women go through things women can do to \u201cavoid\u201d rape, from dressing more conservatively to staying in the kitchen.\n\nAll India Bakchod co-founder Gursimran Khamba spoke to Al Jazeera about the idea behind the video:\n\n\u201cThe notion behind this video was pretty simple.
