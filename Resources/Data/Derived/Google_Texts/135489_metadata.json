It\u2019s been a long process, but now six months later they say they\u2019ve finally found who they\u2019ve been looking for.\n\n\u201cFire fighter John Stevens started this week. We\u2019re glad to have him. We\u2019re half-way back to a full staff of career personnel,\u201d Vandalia Fire Chief Chad Follick. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to have him. It\u2019s been a long process.\u201d\n\nFollick says the new hire will mean less stress on the department, but it won\u2019t quite bring them up to full staffing levels. Right now, the department relies heavily on part-time workers, but that\u2019s causing problems.\n\n\u201cThe pool of part-time personnel in the region is starting to get pulled in one hundred different directions and the pool is starting to thin out a little bit,\u201d Follick said. \u201cWe starting to struggle to get part-time applicants.\u201d\n\nAnd finding workers isn\u2019t the only challenge. Follick says the limit on the number of hours they can work also causes problems.\n\n\u201cBefore the Affordable Care Act, we were able to work part-time employees many more hours,\u201d Follick said. \u201cNow, they are limited to about 28 hours a week. We\u2019re hiring part-time guys now that are working 3 and 4 different fire departments trying to make-up for hours they\u2019ve lost because of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAlong with new firefighter John Stevens, Follick says they also plan to fill some new positions.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at a third full-time fire captain, which is we call him a shift commander,\u201d Follick said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we never had before. It\u2019s a new position that city council approved in our 2016 budget.\u201d\n\nThe swearing in ceremony for the new full-time fire fighter John Stevens is tomorrow at 2pm in the Vandalia City Council Chambers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Vandalia Fire Department says they're finally getting what they need... more workers.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488539385", "og": {"site_name": "WDTN", "description": "The Vandalia Fire Department says they\u2019re finally getting what they need\u2026 more workers.", "title": "Vandalia Fire Department hires more workers after extensive search", "url": "http://wdtn.com/2016/01/06/vandalia-fire-department-hires-more-workers-after-extensive-search/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwdtn.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/vandalia-fire.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Vandalia Fire Department says they\u2019re finally getting what they need\u2026 more workers.", "title": "Vandalia Fire Department hires more workers after extensive search", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwdtn.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/vandalia-fire.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WDTN", "site": "@WDTN", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "al": {"android": {"url": "play.google://launch?location=.wdtn.android.weather", "app_name": "WDTN Weather - Dayton Radar & Forecasts", "package": "com.wdtn"}, "ios": {"url": "itunes://app/935434517", "app_store_id": 935434517, "app_name": "WDTN Weather - Dayton Radar & Forecasts"}}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Dayton News and Weather | 2 NEWS | WDTN-TV Channel 2 is Dayton's source for News, Weather, Sports and Traffic.
