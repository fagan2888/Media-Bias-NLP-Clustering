Brian Sandoval and U.S. Sen. Dean Heller.\n\nIn fact, Hardy said he was approached by the Nevada-focused political consulting firm RedRock Strategies last year to run.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I planned on doing early on, but when I studied the race, I thought it\u2019s a winnable race,\u201d Hardy said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m truly concerned about the direction the nation is going, so for me, I have to get involved.\u201d\n\nBut anything can happen in politics, and seven months later, some would see Hardy as the underdog in the June 10 Republican primary between him and Tea Party candidate Niger Innis, who won the official endorsement from the state\u2019s Republican party. The winner will go on to challenge heavily favored Democratic incumbent Rep. Steven Horsford to represent the northern Las Vegas Valley and parts of central Nevada.\n\nThe fifth-generation Nevadan, farmer and businessman isn\u2019t prone to hyperbole like his outspoken opponent. Hardy is clear about where he stands and says voters can take it or leave it.\n\n\u201cWhat I hope they really relate to is that actually I\u2019m just a regular guy that happens to be a pretty good problem solver,\u201d Hardy said.\n\nParadoxically, the self-described \u201cconstitutional conservative\u201d is asking voters to send him to Washington so he can loosen the power Congress has.\n\nHe\u2019d cut down on social welfare programs. He also calls for a flat tax to make doing business easier. He wants to repeal Obamacare, the 2010 federal health care reform law. He opposes same-sex marriage, supports a path to citizenship in immigration reform and wants to offset any federal spending with cost-cutting measures.\n\n\u201cI truly want government out of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be able to stand on my own two feet, and there\u2019s a real privilege to be able to do that, and I think people want to work and want to be independent.\u201d\n\nHardy\u2019s matter-of-fact campaign hasn\u2019t been without drama, though.\n\nHe\u2019s had to explain why his construction company filed for bankruptcy in early 2012 after owing more than $8 million.\n\nHardy blames the recession and says he\u2019s proud the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which requires his company to pay back each creditor in full, plus interest. He\u2019s since sold his stake in the business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not blaming it on anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt there was going to be a dip in the economy, but not this radical change.\u201d\n\nAnd national left-leaning publications harshly criticized Hardy after a February interview with the Sun where he called a federal proposal to ban workplace discrimination for gays and lesbians \u201csegregation.\u201d\n\nHardy shrugs off the mini-storm his comment created.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an articulate, well-spoken, back-slapping person,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just a regular guy trying to do this job.\u201d\n\nCampaigning as the guy next door seemed to work well in his 2012 re-election for Nevada\u2019s state Assembly, where he scored high crossover votes from Democrats. For this election, he\u2019s raised more than $150,000 and has $55,000 cash on hand, compared to his opponents\u2019 $66,000, for the last few days of the primary.\n\nIf Hardy wins the primary, he\u2019ll have a formidable campaign trying to unseat Horsford, who early polls show is about 12 points ahead of either candidate. But the understated Hardy said he\u2019ll do his best.\n\n\u201cI believe I\u2019m the guy who is the most qualified to be there, in both the primary and general election,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Within the ongoing national narrative of the Republican party\u2019s identity crisis, think of Assemblyman Cresent Hardy as the establishment candidate.
