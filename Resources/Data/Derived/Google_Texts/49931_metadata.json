In his opinion, the Avs improved with their recent flurry of moves.\n\nTo recap: Paul Stastny, P.A. Parenteau, Andre Benoit, Cory Sarich, Brad Malone and a couple of draft picks are out; Jarome Iginla, Daniel Briere, Brad Stuart and other depth players are in. Iginla and Stastny are the big names, the ones most people will debate. But to Reid\u2019s thinking, the Avs bolstered an area that needed more help than the center position Stastny plays, and they were smart with their payroll.\n\n\u201cIt was financially prudent not to get caught up in high dollars for Paul Stastny,\u201d Reid said. \u201cAre the Avs better than last year up front? Well, Nathan MacKinnon is not a rookie anymore. So, yes, they are better.\u201d\n\nLosing Stastny\u2019s point production and strong two-way game \u2014 for nothing in return \u2014 is a blow. But if the Avs could afford to lose a quality player it was at center. Stastny, MacKinnon, Matt Duchene and Ryan O\u2019Reilly are natural centers. But MacKinnon and O\u2019Reilly played mostly on the wing last season. Stastny, Duchene and John Mitchell mostly made up the top three up the middle.\n\nThe Avs could have dealt Stastny at the trade deadline this spring. But Sakic, their executive vice president of hockey operations, and Roy, their coach and front-office VP, didn\u2019t like the offers the Avs received enough to pull the trigger on a deal. They also didn\u2019t like the idea of disrupting the chemistry of a team in the late stages of a storybook season. The decision was made to keep Stastny and hope he would take less than market value to stay in Denver. But optimism was never high among Avalanche brass that he would stay.\n\n\u201cWe knew we couldn\u2019t get to what he got in St. Louis,\u201d Sakic said. \u201cIt was his right, and he\u2019s going home. I had a pretty good idea of what was going on with Paul. I knew there was a great possibility he was going to move on.\u201d\n\nThe Avs made Stastny a good offer, but it was no match for the $7 million per season over four years that Stastny received from St. Louis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not disappointed. It was Paul\u2019s right,\u201d Sakic said.\n\nWhen it was clear to Sakic that Stastny wouldn\u2019t be back, he moved aggressively on Iginla, making contact with his agent, Don Meehan, soon into the five-day courting process that started June 25. A good two-way center was leaving, but MacKinnon, Duchene and Mitchell would still be around, plus O\u2019Reilly can play center if needed. What the Avs had seriously lacked since Chris Stewart was traded to St. Louis in 2011 was a power forward on the right side.\n\nIginla, 37, potentially fills a bigger hole than the one Stastny will leave at another position. That\u2019s the hope, anyway.\n\n\u201cJarome Iginla can still score and is definitely a first-line right winger,\u201d Reid said. \u201cDaniel Briere is very good on the power play and in the playoffs, and will be a big asset. Parenteau was in and out of Patrick Roy\u2019s doghouse, so a change was needed there.\u201d\n\nAt a charity golf tournament in Quebec the other day, Roy told a group of reporters: \u201cThe addition of Iginla for us is very important. I think he\u2019s going to help our younger players continue to grow. It\u2019s extremely positive. Brad Stuart on defense will provide stability. He\u2019s going to play some big minutes and can play with Erik Johnson on the top pair. We\u2019re very confident with these additions. I think we improved the team in an important way.\u201d\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NHL analyst Dave Reid: Avalanche got better with offseason moves", "title": "NHL analyst Dave Reid: Avalanche got better with offseason moves", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/12/nhl-analyst-dave-reid-avalanche-got-better-with-offseason-moves/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140705_065253_jarome-iginla-1.jpg", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140705_065253_jarome-iginla-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-12T18:55:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:27:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd574\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was financially prudent not to get caught up in high dollars for Paul Stastny,\u201d Reid said.\nStastny, MacKinnon, Matt Duchene and Ryan O\u2019Reilly are natural centers.\nIt was Paul\u2019s right,\u201d Sakic said.\nHe\u2019s going to play some big minutes and can play with Erik Johnson on the top pair.\nThe decision was made to keep Stastny and hope he would take less than market value to stay in Denver."}
