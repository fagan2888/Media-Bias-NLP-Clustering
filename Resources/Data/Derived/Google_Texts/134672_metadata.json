Does a business owner tap an employee to deal with administering the programs or look to hire someone outside the organization to handle it?\n\nThat\u2019s where third party administrators come to the rescue in various scenarios.\n\nScott Moak, vice president of Ross & Yerger Insurance Inc. in Jackson, said a growing number of companies are moving toward third parties.\n\n\u201cMany are considering a partially self-funded model to insure their employee group medical insurance plan,\u201d Moak said. \u201cA company at or above 150 or more employees in Mississippi should at a minimum be considering this as a funding arrangement.\u201d\n\nLarge employers would be wise to consider a self-insured model for the flexibility that these plans offer, Moak said.\n\n\u201cBeing able to create your own plan designs within the scope of the Affordable Care Act, having access to very specific claims data and claims trends allows the employer to more transparently manage their company\u2019s group health insurance risks,\u201d Moak said.\n\nThat type of control is what many employers are seeking, he said. \u201cAn employer has to be prepared for a different cash flow from month to month since they now become the claims payer up to a specific and aggregate reinsurance limit,\u201d Moak said. \u201cThis flow of month to month claims can put pressure on cash flow in a bad year. However, this funding arrangement is an attractive solution in both the long and short term for those that have the proper consulting and risk tolerance.\u201d\n\nKen Lewis of his family-owned People Lease in Ridgeland handles the administration of existing benefits packages for companies, among other services ranging from payroll to retirement plans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the payroll industry so obviously employee benefits such as employer insurance directly relates to the payroll function,\u201d he said. \u201cEmployers come to us and we handle all of their payroll and benefits administration.\u201d\n\nThird parties often are hired by small employers, who make up the bulk of the state\u2019s business owners, Lewis said. \u201cThe typical employer is not going to have someone on staff to handle (the tasks). They can be time consuming so they outsource that function or hire companies like ours to take the payroll and benefits administration off of the individuals on their existing staff.\u201d\n\nLewis said People Lease can handle everything from premium collections to reconciling monthly insurance bills and changing coverage for employees. \u201cIt\u2019s all we do all day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would get everything taken care of for them.\u201d\n\nHeadquartered in Ridgeland, People Lease has been in business for 34 years and has clients in 16 states. \u201cOur growth outside of the state has been from our customer base within Mississippi,\u201d he said. The staff of 16 includes CPAs and accountants and a small sales force.\n\nLewis said everything related to employee benefits is getting more complicated and with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s reporting requirements kicking in at the end of the year, employers will feel the impact.\n\n\u201cThere is not a lot of clear guidance coming down for employers on how to do this so companies like ours obviously are being leaned on to help the larger clients with the ACA reporting requirements.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the new ACA that has complicated employers\u2019 lives. \u201cEvery area of having employees has gotten more complex as they keep playing with the tax code and employee related matters,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming harder and harder to have employees. It\u2019s a lot more than just issuing a paycheck. That\u2019s actually the easy part. The hard part is actually having employees as far as hiring them and putting together benefits packages that will retain them and attract new talent to your organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody got into business to have employees,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWe all got into business to make money. But we spend an inordinate amount of time dealing employee related matters. You can give all that to someone else and focus on what you set out to do, whatever your company product or service is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "By\u00a0LISA MONTI\r\n\r\nWith employees come benefits packages and with benefits come ever-changing layers o...", "title": "Employers struggle with handling benefits packages in-house or out", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://msbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Outsource-sign_feature_rgb-620x330.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-05T09:49:38-05:00", "url": "http://msbusiness.com/2015/11/employers-struggle-with-handling-benefits-packages-in-house-or-out/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mbjournal", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "NEWS", "published_time": "2015-11-05T08:55:43-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-05T09:49:38-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "By\u00a0LISA MONTI With employees come benefits packages and with benefits come ever-changing layers of regulations handed down by government agencies.
