Beginning July 1, Connecticut residents convicted for the first time of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs will not only have their licenses suspended for 45 days -- theyâ€™ll also have to install a breathalyzer on the ignition of their car for at least six months.

Also known as an ignition interlock device, the breathalyzer requires drivers to blow into the device before the car start.

The Connecticut chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) advocated for the legislation, which expands on the previous extension of ignition interlock device use that went into effect in 2012. This new law, which the Connecticut legislature passed unanimously, closed a loophole that had previously allowed some offenders to avoid use of the device.

Offenders have to pay for the device, as well as its upkeep, out of their own pockets; the devices are about $75 to install, and require about $75 per month in monitoring fees.
