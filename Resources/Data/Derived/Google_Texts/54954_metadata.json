But it\u2019s more often a natural question, since Robert Caro\u2019s biography of mid-century planning czar Robert Moses is so much more than that: It\u2019s a history of urban politics and planning, of bonds, of infrastructure, of bureaucracy and patronage, and, as Caro emphasizes, a study of the use of power.\n\nThough never elected, Robert Moses served nearly half a century in the city and state governments of New York. He built 627 miles of highway in the city and its suburbs. He built enough public housing for 555,000 people. He built hundreds of playgrounds, ballfields and tennis courts in the city, and a handful of enormous state parks beyond its borders. He built the Triborough, Throgs Neck and Whitestone, Marine Parkway, Cross-Bay, Henry Hudson and Verrazano Bridges.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that most conversations about New York eventually fall into the orbit of Moses \u2014 and of Caro\u2019s vast biography. \u201cThe Power Broker\u201d isn\u2019t just the best book about this city; it is, according to the historian David Halberstam, the best book about the city.\n\n\u201cThe Power Broker\u201d is a classic of great-man history. Yet it\u2019s the stories of the disempowered that resonate most: the potato farmers of Nassau County, the environmental advocates of Inwood Hill, the families of East Tremont, Robert\u2019s own brother Paul. All of them suffered at the hands of the Master Builder, and Caro gives them a voice.\n\nThe three chapters on the construction of the Cross-Bronx Expressway, for example, are justly the book\u2019s most famous. Caro so captures the frustration and sadness of the vanished East Tremont community, channels their sense of loss and betrayal at the hands of callous officials, that one forgets he was only 17 years old when the notices of eviction arrived. By the time the author was doing research, East Tremont was an emblematic inner-city ghetto. \u201cI had never, in my sheltered middle-class life, descended so deeply into the realms of despair,\u201d Caro wrote in the New Yorker in 1998.\n\n\u201cThe Power Broker\u201d was published at the nadir of New York\u2019s history, give or take a few years. The population fell by more than 10 percent between 1970 and 1980. The year after Caro won the Pulitzer Prize, New York City nearly went bankrupt. (\u201cFORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD,\u201d read the famous headline.) Two years after that, the South Bronx burst into flames during a World Series game at Yankee Stadium. The book\u2019s subtitle summed up its author\u2019s take on the era of urban fear and flight: \u201cRobert Moses and the Fall of New York.\u201d\n\nWas Caro right to link New York\u2019s decline to Moses\u2019 reign? The zeitgeist, from St. Louis to New Haven, was that urban renewal projects had done more harm than good in cities. And New York had seen, thanks to Moses\u2019s tireless draftsmen and shrewd financial practices, more urban renewal than anywhere else. Slum clearance was a known scam; the unbuilt schemes became urban boogeymen, warnings to future generations.\n\nThere were some doubts at the time: in a blistering review in the New York Times (a paper that Caro had repeatedly singled out for its sycophancy to Moses), Christopher Lehmann-Haupt challenged the simple conclusion and its implications. \u201cIf Robert Moses really is the root cause of our problems that Mr. Caro has made him appear to be \u2026 what we need now to straighten us out is another Robert Moses.\u201d\n\nThere are certainly doubts about Caro\u2019s thesis now. In the course of New York\u2019s remarkable and well-publicized turnaround, Moses\u2019s reputation has undergone a revision, if not a rehabilitation. As early as 1987, the Municipal Art Society was running a \u201cRobert Moses Reappraised\u201d bus tour, led by \u201cMoses man\u201d Arnold Vollmer. The sociologist Nathan Glazer, in a powerful rebuttal, called Caro\u2019s views \u201cManichean.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After 40 years, this magisterial biography of Robert Moses remains an essential primer on American power", "title": "The bible of the modern American city: Why \u201cThe Power Broker\u201d is still one of our most important books", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After 40 years, this magisterial biography of Robert Moses remains an essential primer on American power", "title": "The bible of the modern American city: Why \u201cThe Power Broker\u201d is still one of our most important books", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/21/the_bible_of_the_modern_american_city_why_the_power_broker_is_still_one_of_our_most_important_books/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/robert_moses.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After 40 years, this magisterial biography of Robert Moses remains an essential primer on American power", "title": "The bible of the modern American city: Why \u201cThe Power Broker\u201d is still one of our most important books", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/robert_moses.jpg", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Henry Grabar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Dream City, New York City, robert caro, Robert Moses, The Power Broker, urban planning", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf307\"", "article_summary": "As early as 1987, the Municipal Art Society was running a \u201cRobert Moses Reappraised\u201d bus tour, led by \u201cMoses man\u201d Arnold Vollmer.\nThough never elected, Robert Moses served nearly half a century in the city and state governments of New York.\n\u201cThe Power Broker\u201d isn\u2019t just the best book about this city; it is, according to the historian David Halberstam, the best book about the city.\nThe year after Caro won the Pulitzer Prize, New York City nearly went bankrupt.\nTopics: Dream City, New York City, robert caro, Robert Moses, The Power Broker, urban planningTake an interest in the history of New York City, and someone will soon ask if you\u2019ve read \u201cThe Power Broker.\u201dThis is, in part, a good-natured gauge of your interest and experience; the urban affairs buff slyly asking for your credentials."}
