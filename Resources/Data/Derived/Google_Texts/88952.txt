President Obama gave his big speech last night on how we’re going to, in his words, “degrade, and ultimately destroy” the Islamic State through a combination of airstrikes, partnerships with regional allies, and training of local forces. You should read Jim Newell’s explanation of all the problems with Obama’s strategy, the most significant being the fact that his ultimate goal is the destruction of ISIS. That’s a fine sound bite and it’s likely reassuring to the people who need their presidents to talk tough, but the gulf between saying you’ll destroy a terrorist insurgency and actually accomplishing that goal is yawning.

There are, however, plenty of politicians who endorse that strategy and want it to be pursued with as much vigor as possible. Sen. Marco Rubio is one of them. He talked to NPR’s Steve Inskeep this morning about the president’s speech, and while he generally approved of what Obama had to say, Rubio was dismayed that the president didn’t say “we’re going to defeat ISIL no matter what.”

Inskeep pressed Rubio on this point and asked whether this was a realistic objective, and Rubio gave a doozy of an answer:

Here’s the relevant transcript:

INSKEEP: And you wish that there was a stronger goal of defeating ISIL, or ISIS, or the Islamic State, no matter what. Is that a realistic goal, senator? Because insurgent groups like this can go on for years and years and years even if they’re weakened. RUBIO: Well, absolutely it’s a realistic goal. It’s been achieved in the past. This very same insurgency was defeated during the awakening in Iraq. This is the same group that was driven out by Sunnis, who then reconstituted itself in Syria when that became an unstable and ungoverned space. So it is possible, but it’s going to take some time.
