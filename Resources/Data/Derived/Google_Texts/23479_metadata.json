He was 75. Carlos was a champion of liberty and a long-time friend to so many of us in the freedom movement in the Americas. His life was a testimony to the power of ideas, and he lived it true to his classical-liberal convictions.\n\nCarlos was a co-founder of CEDICE, the market-liberal think tank in Caracas that celebrated its 30th anniversary this year and with whom Cato has worked closely for many years (and that has been severely harassed by the Chavista regime). In the 1980s, Carlos was the editor of El Diario de Caracas, an important daily that was critical of government policies. It was when Carlos represented Venezuelan journalists at an Inter-American Press Association conference in 1987 in San Antonio, Texas and denounced then-President Lusinchi\u2019s attacks on freedom of the press, that Lusinchi demanded that Carlos be fired from the newspaper, conditioning the renewal of the license of the popular television station RCTV\u2014part of the same media company\u2014on that outcome. Carlos was let go from the paper, he was criminally charged by the government, and was told by the judge presiding his case that \u201cI have orders from above.\u201d It was at that time that Carlos left Venezuela, moving to Florida where he would live the rest of his life. RCTV received a 20-year license. It was the expiration of that license in 2007\u2014that Hugo Chavez refused to renew, thus shutting down the television station\u2014that triggered the massive student uprising against the government that year. (As a result, Chavez lost a constitutional referendum and temporarily slowed down his accumulation of power.)\n\nThe idea that Venezuela was doomed to repeat such experiences and that the country would only lose more freedoms if economic freedom was not also respected was a long-time theme in Carlos\u2019s writings. In that regard, he was among a very small group of Venezuelan intellectuals who decades ago warned against the ideology of socialism predominant in the political system and much of Venezuelan society. Indeed, he very correctly viewed Hugo Chavez\u2019s regime as a logical, though more extreme, extension of what had come before. \u201cChavez,\u201d he wrote, \u201chas intensified, accelerated and exacerbated corruption, the concentration of power, the violation of property rights\u201d and the power of the bureaucracy in people\u2019s lives. In a 1992 essay, Carlos wrote that the \u201cfatal date\u201d for his country was January 1976, when President Perez nationalized the petroleum industry. That \u201cmeant a radical change; for the first time since the death of General Gomez [1935], political and economic power was again concentrated in the same hands: in those of the head of state.\u201d\n\nHe would later write: \u201cWithout that concentration of wealth in political hands, Chavez would never have been able to Cubanize Venezuela because it was the economic power of oil that allowed the government to crush the individual liberties of the Venezuelans.\u201d How right he was.\n\nIn 1991, Carlos established AIPE\u2014the Inter-American Economic Press Agency\u2014which syndicated articles of the region\u2019s leading classical liberals in Latin America\u2019s most important newspapers. He also translated and syndicated articles by Milton Friedman, Gary Becker, James Buchanan and other prominent scholars, thus introducing those thinkers too to countless Latin American readers. On Cato\u2019s Spanish-language web site (elcato.org), we were able to create a special Milton Friedman page made up of a collection of Friedman\u2019s articles, mostly from AIPE. Indeed, when we created elcato.org in 1998, AIPE provided much of the material we posted. It also provided a model we would soon adopt of publishing articles in the region that we then posted. By the time Carlos closed AIPE in 2010, he had syndicated 8,788 op-eds from 734 authors. The following year, Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution included the complete collection of articles in its prestigious archives.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s long and tragic decline into authoritarianism and economic backwardness has sadly vindicated Carlos\u2019s views. But as became clear to me during a visit a few months ago to Caracas, the eruption of massive, peaceful, student-led protests this year shows a new appreciation of liberty among Venezuelans. As Maria Corina Machado\u2014a leading opposition leader who explicitly advocates economic, political and civil liberties\u2014said at the CEDICE event I attended, the country has clearly changed this year and people are demanding a broad spectrum of liberties as never before. CEDICE is playing an important role in that change and it is part of Carlos Ball\u2019s legacy.\n\nYou can read many of Carlos\u2019s articles in Spanish here and some articles in English here.\n\nA few months ago, I sent Carlos an article I wrote on Venezuela that appeared in El Comercio (Peru). He responded with enthusiasm and encouragement, signing off \u201cViva Cato!\u201d I will miss Carlos.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carlos Ball was a champion of liberty.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "Carlos Ball was a champion of liberty.", "title": "In Memory of Carlos Ball", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/memory-carlos-ball", "image": "http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/wp-content/uploads/carlosball_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/memory-carlos-ball", "creator": "@CatoInstitute", "description": "Carlos Ball was a champion of liberty.", "card": "summary", "title": "In Memory of Carlos Ball"}, "site": "Cato Institute", "robots": "noodp", "node_creation_date": "2014/7/17", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "publication_date": "2014/7/17", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-17T12:17:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Carlos Ball, Venezuela, Latin America, Freedom movement, CEDICE"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd973c\"", "article_summary": "In a 1992 essay, Carlos wrote that the \u201cfatal date\u201d for his country was January 1976, when President Perez nationalized the petroleum industry.\nI\u2019m sad to report that Venezuelan journalist and Cato adjunct scholar Carlos Ball passed away last week.\nIn 1991, Carlos established AIPE\u2014the Inter-American Economic Press Agency\u2014which syndicated articles of the region\u2019s leading classical liberals in Latin America\u2019s most important newspapers.\nA few months ago, I sent Carlos an article I wrote on Venezuela that appeared in El Comercio (Peru).\nIn the 1980s, Carlos was the editor of El Diario de Caracas, an important daily that was critical of government policies."}
