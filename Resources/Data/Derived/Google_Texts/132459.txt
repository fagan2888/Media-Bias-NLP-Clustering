The replacement of Hamilton on the $10 note takes another lame progressive turn. There’s a move afoot to have SCOTUS justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg chosen for this honor.

If it’s to be a woman, my suggestion – call it the Mount Rushmore rule, to avoid the equivalent of putting the second-string POTUS Teddy Roosevelt up there with first-stringers Lincoln, Washington, and Jefferson – is that no one alive after June 1915 be considered. This includes all the present suggestions.
