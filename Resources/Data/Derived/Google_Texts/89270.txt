The start of the first hockey game to be played at Yankee Stadium was delayed Sunday afternoon because of glare on the ice that created unsafe playing conditions, the NHL announced.

The start of the game was to be delayed by about an hour, with the puck now slated to drop at 1:38 p.m. The opening faceoff between the Rangers and Devils was to be at 12:30 p.m.; the NHL said the teams will start warmups at 1 p.m.

The temperature at the scheduled game time in the Bronx was 23 degrees, with a wind-chill factor of 14 degrees. But it was also sunny, which prompted the grounds crew to delay pulling a sheet of plastic off the rink built on the Yankee Stadium diamond. The conditions didnâ€™t stop youth players in Rangers and Devils jerseys from playing a pickup game on a smaller rink in front of the main rink.
