These include chemicals identified to be carcinogenic, capable of causing developmental disabilities in children, or were otherwise found at levels considered toxic. Unlike major chains like Wal-Mart and Target, no major dollar store chain has a formal policy on selling or disclosing toxic ingredients in products.\n\nIn Austin, Texas, the campaign partnered with local activists from Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services (TEJAS) and Texas Campaign for the Environment. Dressed in white hazardous material-handling suits, they gathered in front of a Family Dollar store on the south side of the city to chant and hold protest signs and banners.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nFamily Dollar, already one of the nation\u2019s largest chains, is in the process of being acquired by Dollar Tree, making it potentially an even bigger part of the market selling these dangerous products to the poor.\n\nDeyadira Trevi\u00f1o, a Houston-based TEJAS community organizer and community health worker, told MintPress News that families living in poverty may have no choice but to shop at discount stores because of their limited budgets, but as informed consumers they could still put pressure on these chains to make more responsible decisions.\n\n\u201cOur collective purchasing power has the strength to say we will not support any stores production of toxic products which lead to dumping of hazardous products in marginalized communities,\u201d Trevi\u00f1o said. She told MintPress that she comes to this protest not just as an activist and community member, but also as a mother expecting her second child.\n\nTrevi\u00f1o emphasized that the poor are especially vulnerable not just because they may not be able to afford to purchase higher quality products, but also because their communities often face a higher risk of exposure already.\n\n\u201cIt is these communities which are stuck with not only dollar stores and their toxic products, but also find themselves surrounded by refineries and other toxic producing industries,\u201d she said. \u201cLow-income communities and communities of color from which dollar stores draw much of their profits cannot afford additional toxic exposures.\u201d\n\nAfter rallying outside the store, where they chanted and handed out fliers to interested customers, protesters filed inside where Andrew Dobbs, program director for Texas Campaign for the Environment, attempted to deliver a letter to the manager on duty outlining consumers\u2019 and activists\u2019 concerns.\n\nAlthough the manager refused to accept their letter, Dobbs told MintPress that the protest was a success and the campaign would continue.\n\n\u201cIt was raining before we got there but ended up being sunny and bright. We got a lot of honks and support,\u201d he said afterward. \u201cWe had a lot of customers, folks who shop right there at Family Dollar coming up to us and we were able to give them fliers to help educate them about the risks that their families are facing due to the short-sighted policies of this company.\u201d\n\nDobbs acknowledged that the local manager has little control over the store\u2019s products, but by putting pressure on individual stores, the activists hope to send a message to the upper management that do have decision-making power in the chain.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal situation, Family Dollar would adopt a chemical policy that includes a list of chemicals they will not tolerate in their stores anymore.\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to leverage their buying power to make producers clean up their act.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these protests, the campaign includes educators that go door-to-door in the neighborhoods near the discount stores in Austin, Houston and Dallas to alert potential customers to the dangers of toxic products.\n\n\u201cWe will generate dozens if not hundreds of letters a week to these companies demanding that they change this, until they do,\u201d Dobbs said.\n\nWatch actress Jennifer Beals introduce the Campaign for Healthier Solutions:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Environmental Justice Report: 81% Of Products Tested At U.S. Dollar Stores Are Unsafe", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Kit O'Connell", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Environmental Justice Report: 81% Of Products Tested At U.S. Dollar Stores Are Unsafe", "title": "Environmental Justice Report: 81% Of Products Tested At U.S. Dollar Stores Are Unsafe", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/environmental-justice-report-81-of-products-tested-at-u-s-dollar-stores-are-unsafe/207238/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/20150701_141231.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-03T08:26:51-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Environmental Justice Report: 81% Of Products Tested At U.S. Dollar Stores Are Unsafe", "creator": "@KitOConnell", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/20150701_141231.jpg", "title": "Environmental Justice Report: 81% Of Products Tested At U.S. Dollar Stores Are Unsafe", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "published_time": "2015-07-03T08:09:23-05:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/kitoconnell", "section": "Health & Lifestyle", "modified_time": "2015-07-03T08:26:51-05:00", "tag": "Texas"}}, "article_summary": "Environmental Justice Report: 81% Of Products Tested At U.S. Dollar Stores Are UnsafeLow income families often live in communities surrounded by toxic refineries and other dangerous industries, further increasing exposure.\nIn Austin, Texas, the campaign partnered with local activists from Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services (TEJAS) and Texas Campaign for the Environment.\n\u201cIt is these communities which are stuck with not only dollar stores and their toxic products, but also find themselves surrounded by refineries and other toxic producing industries,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOur collective purchasing power has the strength to say we will not support any stores production of toxic products which lead to dumping of hazardous products in marginalized communities,\u201d Trevi\u00f1o said.\nTo produce the report, issued in February by Environmental Justice for All\u2019s Campaign for Healthier Solutions, researchers tested 164 products from multiple discount chain stores nationwide and found that 133 contained \u201cat least one hazardous chemical above levels of concern,\u201d meaning that 81% of tested products were hazardous."}
