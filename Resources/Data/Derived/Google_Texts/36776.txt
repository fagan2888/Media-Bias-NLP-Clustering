The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced last week that 2,100 participants have moved to the contract, risk-bearing period of the agency's Bundled Payments for Care Improvement pilot program.

The initiative, started under the Affordable Care Act, originally had 7,000 providers sign on to review how they would implement bundled payment contracts. The pilot seeks to test bundled payments for 48 different health conditions, including stroke, heart failure or joint replacement.

According to CMS, “Phase 2” of the pilot includes 1,071 skilled nursing facilities and 101 home health agencies, among other participants.

“We are excited that thousands of providers in the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative have joined us in changing the health care system to pay for quality over quantity — spending our dollars more wisely and improving care for Medicare beneficiaries,” wrote Patrick Conway, M.D., acting principal deputy administrator and chief medical officer of CMS, in a statement.

Earlier this year, CMS announced it aims to have 30% of Medicare payments under bundled contracts by the end of 2016, with a goal of reaching 50% by 2018. Last month, CMS announced a proposal to require bundled payments for hip and knee replacement surgeries in 75 markets across the country.
