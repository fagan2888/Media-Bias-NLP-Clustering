She plans to vote for Gwen Graham, Mr Southerland\u2019s challenger and one of the Democrats\u2019 best hopes to snatch a seat in the House of Representatives.\n\nHer candidacy has attracted a ton of money from outside groups. She is a centrist: she says Democrats \u201cbit off more than they could chew\u201d with Obamacare, but criticises Republicans for trying to return health-care decisions \u201cto the hands of the insurance companies.\u201d Her main advantage, however, may be her opponent.\n\nNot only does Mr Southerland make gaffes (he dismissed complaints about his male-only fundraiser by pointing out that some brides-to-be hold a women-only \u201clingerie shower\u201d where their friends give them frilly gifts). As a pro-life family-values Republican, he also reminds some female voters of what they dislike about his party.\n\nMs Graham\u2019s advertisements warn voters that Mr Southerland voted against reauthorising the Violence Against Women Act. \u201cThat\u2019s not the north Florida way,\u201d she says. Mr Southerland retorts that he did vote for a different version of it, and that as the father of four daughters, he would hardly want to ignore the issue. Still, in a tight race, Ms Graham hopes that female voters will make the difference. Democrats usually have an advantage: in 2012 Barack Obama won the female vote by 12 points nationwide.\n\nMr Southerland, whose family has run funeral homes in the district for three generations, won his seat in the Republican wave of 2010, knocking out a conservative Democrat, Allen Boyd, who had voted for Obamacare. North Florida is conservative but the second district is politically mixed: it has plenty of rural southern voters, who lean Republican. But it is also 25% black and, since it includes Florida\u2019s state capital, Tallahassee, is home to many government workers, who skew Democratic.\n\nAt a feisty debate on September 23rd Mr Southerland harangued his opponent for not having deep local roots. She countered by naming the local high school she attended. The pair also jousted over the minimum wage (she wants to raise it; he thinks that would destroy jobs).\n\nMr Southerland dings Ms Graham for being an insider. Her father, Bob Graham, was governor of Florida and a US senator. She worked for two north-eastern liberals, John Kerry and Howard Dean. And her time at a law firm in Washington, DC lets critics paint her as a lobbyist. Tracey Cochran, who owns a guesthouse in the district, thinks Ms Graham looks weak when her father campaigns for her. \u201cShe should stand on her own two feet,\u201d she says.\n\n(Photo credit: SAUL LOEB / AFP)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/articles/women.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Florida\u2019s second district", "description": "How not to win over women voters", "pubdate": 20140927, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "How not to win over women voters", "title": "Republican knightmares", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21620214-how-not-win-over-women-voters-republican-knightmares", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/women.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "How not to win over women voters", "sailthru.date": "2014-10-01 21:41:32", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/women.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.printdate": "2014-09-27 00:00:00", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "United States", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/articles/women.jpg", "articleid": 21620214, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/articles/women.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Florida\u2019s second district", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/women.jpg", "news_keywords": "Florida\u2019s second district"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbdbe\"", "article_summary": "As a pro-life family-values Republican, he also reminds some female voters of what they dislike about his party.\nNorth Florida is conservative but the second district is politically mixed: it has plenty of rural southern voters, who lean Republican.\nTracey Cochran, who owns a guesthouse in the district, thinks Ms Graham looks weak when her father campaigns for her.\nAt a feisty debate on September 23rd Mr Southerland harangued his opponent for not having deep local roots.\nDemocrats usually have an advantage: in 2012 Barack Obama won the female vote by 12 points nationwide."}
