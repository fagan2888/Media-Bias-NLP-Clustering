(AP) - North Dakota\u2019s Republican candidates for governor, Wayne Stenehjem and Doug Burgum, exchanged jabs on health care and tax credits Monday during a rapid-fire debate at a Fargo television station.\n\nIn the liveliest exchange of the half-hour program, Stenehjem accused Burgum of being disingenuous by criticizing Stenehjem\u2019s actions on President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. Stenehjem supported a U.S. Supreme Court case regarding health exchanges for the Affordable Care Act, which Burgum has described as support for the health care reform.\n\nStenehjem, the longtime attorney general and the GOP\u2019s endorsed candidate for governor, said he did the right thing by backing a health care tax credit for 16,000 North Dakota citizens and thinks \u201cthe original, authentic Doug Burgum\u201d would agree with the idea.\n\n\u201cI was not standing up to support Obamacare, but I was standing up to support the taxpaying citizens, most of them lower income, who once Obamacare was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court were required by law to buy health insurance,\u201d Stenehjem said.\n\nBurgum, a wealthy business leader and philanthropist, responded that his \u201creaction as the authentic Doug Burgum\u201d is that he would have found a better way to help a small percentage of North Dakota residents rather than supporting Obama\u2019s health reform.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m more concerned about, if that logic applies, then we as Republicans would be supporting every large-scale tax-and-spend redistribution scheme that helps 2 percent of North Dakotans,\u201d Burgum said.\n\nThe debate will be shown at 7:30 p.m. Friday on Prairie Public Television.\n\nAnother hot topic of discussion was Burgum\u2019s participation in state-supported angel funds, which offer tax credits to investors. Stenehjem has questioned two funds backed by Burgum that have invested in 13 out-of-state companies. Stenehjem compared that to Burgum\u2019s attitude toward the health care tax credit.\n\n\u201cI really find it a little disingenuous that you want to defend so critically and zealously your tax credit when just on the last question you wanted to take away the tax credit from the citizens who bought insurance,\u201d Stenehjem said. \u201cAnd those are the poor people of North Dakota.\u201d\n\nBurgum said the issue shows the difference between the attitude of a lifelong politician and a lifelong businessman.\n\n\u201cIt ought to send a chill up the spine of any law-abiding citizen in North Dakota to know that we have a candidate for governor who\u2019s willing to use political theater to try to advance a political agenda around a program that was passed by Republicans, supported by Republicans, expanded by Republicans,\u201d Burgum said. \u201cEvery single person who is using the angel tax credit in North Dakota is doing it in a way as it was intended and following the law.\u201d\n\nStenehjem said he generally supports the idea of angel funds and does not believe any of the participants are skirting the law.\n\n\u201cThe question is going to come up \u2026 what are the citizens of North Dakota getting out of that,\u201d Stenehjem said. \u201cThat\u2019s the simple question that people want to know.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Dakota's Republican candidates for governor, Wayne Stenehjem and Doug Burgum, exchanged jabs on health care and tax credits Monday during a rapid-fire debate at a Fargo television station.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "North Dakota\u2019s Republican candidates for governor, Wayne Stenehjem and Doug Burgum, exchanged jabs on health care and tax credits Monday during a rapid-fire debate at a Fargo television station.", "title": "GOP candidates for governor argue health care, tax credits", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/16/gop-governor-candidates-argue-health-care-other-to/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/16/governor_north_dakota.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/16/governor_north_dakota.jpeg", "description": "North Dakota's Republican candidates for governor, Wayne Stenehjem and Doug Burgum, exchanged jabs on health care and tax credits Monday during a rapid-fire debate at a Fargo television station.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP candidates for governor argue health care, tax credits"}, "Author": "DAVE KOLPACK", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a5b\"", "article_summary": "Stenehjem compared that to Burgum\u2019s attitude toward the health care tax credit.\nStenehjem supported a U.S. Supreme Court case regarding health exchanges for the Affordable Care Act, which Burgum has described as support for the health care reform.\nFARGO, N.D.
