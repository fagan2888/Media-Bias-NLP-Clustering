Indeed, it may not get better for a long time. No one wants to admit this, because it\u2019s ugly and unwelcome. Parents are supposed to care for their children, and children are supposed to care for their aging parents. For families, these collective obligations may work. But what makes sense for families doesn\u2019t always succeed for society as a whole. The clash of generations is intensifying.\n\nLast week, a federal judge ruled that Detroit qualifies for municipal bankruptcy. This almost certainly means that pensions and health benefits for the city\u2019s retired workers will be trimmed. There\u2019s a basic conflict between paying for all retirement benefits and supporting adequate current services (police, schools, parks, sanitation, roads). The number of Detroit\u2019s retired workers has swelled, benefits were not adequately funded and the city\u2019s economy isn\u2019t strong enough to take care of both without self-defeating tax increases.\n\nThe math is unforgiving. Detroit now has two retirees for every active worker, reports the Detroit Free Press; in 2012, that was 10,525 employees and 21,113 retirees. Satisfying retirees inevitably shortchanges their children and grandchildren. Though Detroit\u2019s situation is extreme, it\u2019s not unique. Pension benefits were once thought to be legally and politically impregnable. Pension cuts in Illinois (last week), Rhode Island and elsewhere have shattered this assumption. Chicago is considering reductions for its retirees.\n\nWhat\u2019s occurring at the state and local levels is an incomplete and imperfect effort to balance the interests of young and old. Conflicts vary depending on benefits\u2019 generosity and the strength \u2014 or weakness \u2014 of local economies. A study of 173 cities by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found pension costs averaged 7.9 percent of tax revenues, but those of many cities were much higher: 17 percent in Chicago, 15 percent in Springfield, Mass., and 12.9 percent in New York. Health benefits add to costs.\n\nAt the federal level, even this sloppy generational reckoning is missing. The elderly\u2019s interests are running roughshod over other national concerns . Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 programs heavily for the retired \u2014 dominate the budget, accounting for about 44 percent of spending, and have been largely excluded from deficit-reduction measures.\n\nAlmost all the adjustment falls on other programs: defense, courts, research, roads, education. Or higher taxes. The federal government is increasingly a transfer agency: Taxes from the young and middle-aged are spent on the elderly.\n\nThe explanation for this is politics. For states and localities, benefit cuts affect government workers \u2014 a powerful but small group \u2014 while at the federal level, it\u2019s all the elderly, a huge group that includes everyone\u2019s parents and grandparents. As a result, the combat has been lopsided. Political leaders of both parties have avoided distasteful choices. Younger Americans have generally been clueless about how shifting demographics threaten their future government services and taxes.\n\nThis may be changing. One reason is the Affordable Care Act. Among other things, Obamacare expands the young\u2019s compulsory subsidization of older Americans (in this case, those not yet 65). Under the law, some of the young will pay artificially high insurance premiums to cover the medical expenses of older and sicker Americans. The young seem to be balking. A poll by Harvard University\u2019s Institute of Politics finds that less than a third of uninsured 18- to 29-year-olds plan to enroll in the program. Here\u2019s another generational skirmish.\n\nThe upgrading of old age also undermines the status quo. To be sure, millions of older Americans are frail, sickly or poor. But many more aren\u2019t. Older Americans are generally healthier and wealthier than ever. Someone now 65 can, on average, expect to live another 19 years, up about two years since 1990. More years are spent in relatively good health, finds a study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, because major disabilities are occurring later. Meanwhile, Americans age 65 and older regularly rate their finances better than do those in other age groups according to surveys by NORC, an opinion research organization at the University of Chicago. In 2012, 41 percent of those 65 and older were \u201csatisfied\u201d with their finances and 20 percent dissatisfied (the rest were in between). Among those ages 35 to 49, only 25 percent were satisfied and 29 percent were dissatisfied.\n\nGenerational warfare upsets us because it pits parents against children. The elderly\u2019s well-being partly reflects Social Security and Medicare\u2019s success, but it also comes at the expense of younger Americans. We pretend these discomforting conflicts don\u2019t exist. But they do and are rooted in changing demographics, slower economic growth and competing concepts of old age. They cannot be dissolved by pious invocations that \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d To date, the contest has been one-sided; now the other side is beginning to stir.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson\u2019s archive.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Robert Samuelson, robert samuelson column, robert samuelson washington post, elderly, generational war, young vs old, clash of generations, transfer of wealth, young social security, elderly social security, older americans living longer, young obamacare, youth obamacare, youth affordable care act, detroit pensions, public service workers, public service pensions", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The elderly\u2019s well-being comes at the expense of younger Americans.", "title": "Robert Samuelson: America\u2019s clash of generations is inevitable", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-americas-clash-of-generations-is-inevitable/2013/12/08/e4810416-5ea0-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2010/12/07/Others/Images/2010-12-07/PHO-10Dec07-274516.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-americas-clash-of-generations-is-inevitable/2013/12/08/e4810416-5ea0-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Robert Samuelson, robert samuelson column, robert samuelson washington post, elderly, generational war, young vs old, clash of generations, transfer of wealth, young social security, elderly social security, older americans living longer, young obamacare, youth obamacare, youth affordable care act, detroit pensions, public service workers, public service pensions", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "e4810416-5ea0-11e3-be07-006c776266ed", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "The elderly\u2019s well-being comes at the expense of younger Americans."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37c6\"", "article_summary": "Among other things, Obamacare expands the young\u2019s compulsory subsidization of older Americans (in this case, those not yet 65).\nParents are supposed to care for their children, and children are supposed to care for their aging parents.\nTo be sure, millions of older Americans are frail, sickly or poor.\nOlder Americans are generally healthier and wealthier than ever.\nThere\u2019s a basic conflict between paying for all retirement benefits and supporting adequate current services (police, schools, parks, sanitation, roads)."}
