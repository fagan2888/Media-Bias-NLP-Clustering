She had seen this before, of course, the word outreach being thrown around, but then as soon as elections are over, everyone packs their bags and leaves. So her request was simple: she would volunteer and work her ass off for the party if they would commit to staying past election day.\n\nJennifer Sevilla Korn, the RNC\u2019s deputy political director, who presented the blueprint, told her they would.\n\nSo Carmen Weese, 58, went to work. Colorado Republicans went to everything from the Peruvian festival to county fairs and events with churches and businesses, together totaling 70 events reaching 223,000 people between June and November, according to records the local party kept.\n\nRepublicans across the country won in a wave election for the party, but Colorado boasted two wins the RNC attributes to their strong Latino outreach. Cory Gardner defeated incumbent Mark Udall in the U.S. Senate race by less than 50,000 votes, but made a 10,000 vote improvement in a place like Pueblo county, which is 42% Hispanic. Rep. Mike Coffman defeated Andrew Romanoff in a district that became majority-Democratic after 2010 redistricting, learning Spanish, and taking part in Univision\u2019s first-ever Spanish-language debate in the state.\n\nThe Cuban-American Carmen Weese, who put 1,900 hours into Latino outreach was elated, but resigned to the national party high-fiving and leaving town. Then she got a call a week after the election.\n\n\u201cThey called me and said we\u2019re here through 2016,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew then that all the efforts and the hours that I put in did not go to waste.\u201d\n\nBuoyed by victories in Colorado and in Florida, the RNC feels it has a blueprint for how to win support from Hispanic voters. Of the $10 million strategic initiative announced after the 2012 election for the midterms aimed at Hispanic, black, and Asian voters, the largest chunk was spent on Latino outreach, with more than 40 staffers spread across 10 states including the Southwest battlegrounds, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and Texas.\n\nNow the RNC says it is raising the strategic initiative budget \u201csubstantially,\u201d with plans to double paid staff to more than 80 in those states.\n\nBut Republicans also readily admit that they have a long way to go with the Hispanic community nationally, where the brand is damaged after searing fights on immigration policy that have often cast them as out of step and sometimes as racist in certain wings of the party. Democrats say Latinos will respond to policies that make their lives better, not empty words and outreach, no matter the impressive level of resources deployed on the ground.\n\n\u201cThey can dedicate all the money in the election to the Latino vote but how can they defend the offensive nature of the immigration debate, wanting to repeal Obamacare, and opposition to the earned income tax credit?\u201d said Gabriela Domenzain, who ran Hispanic media for the Obama campaign in 2012.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are their own worst enemies.\u201d\n\nThis is the earliest Republicans have launched a national Latino outreach effort, according to the RNC. And they\u2019ve put an emphasis on repeating what worked in 2014, even if that midterm electorate was very different than most presidential ones. That starts with candidates willing to do the outreach.\n\nGardner, for example, went to Fiestas Patrias, a raucous 92,000-person celebration for Mexican independence, where he was followed by Univision in September.\n\nIn Florida, Rick Scott who eked out a win over Charlie Crist in the governor\u2019s race, mounted the earliest and most expensive Spanish-language television ad campaign in Florida history, held a recurring Hispanic pastors\u2019 breakfast, and unveiled ads weeks before the election with popular former governor and presumed presidential candidate Jeb Bush telling voters to support Scott in Spanish.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that you have a candidate who\u2019s willing to make the Hispanic community a priority,\u201d the RNC\u2019s Korn told BuzzFeed News.\n\nA Florida Democrat close to the governor\u2019s race said this explanation for Scott\u2019s success is oversimplified. Scott, the Democrat said, split the Hispanic vote when he ran in 2010, but lost it by 20% in 2014. The Democrat gave another reason for his win.\n\n\u201cThey bought everything, they walked into Spanish radio stations and said, \u2018We will buy everything that\u2019s available,\u2019\u201d the source said.\n\nThe numbers back up the contention. An election eve memo by Crist\u2019s pollsters found that at the end, Scott was pumping $1,200 a minute into TV ads.\n\nDemocrats acknowledge that the RNC Latino outreach machine is impressive, especially as it relates to what their party is doing, and say Democrats need to wake up before 2016.\n\n\u201cDemocrats should give more resources, we have a whole lot more at risk if we don\u2019t engage the Latino community in 2016, we have to match them and then some,\u201d said DNC Hispanic Caucus chair Iris Martinez, a Chicago state senator. \u201cWe are the crucial vote, the party needs to spend a whole lot more money in places where the Latino population is high and we have to do it early on.\u201d\n\nDomenzain said the entrance of Marco Rubio and expected candidacy of Jeb Bush, who is fluent in Spanish, raises the bar for all Hispanic outreach for both parties, especially for Democrats.\n\n\u201cFolks that come from Florida know the differences [within the Latino community],\u201d she said. \u201cThey never had a Republican contender with such deep ties to the community, one that speaks the language. When your principal speaks the language, that\u2019s a different playing field.\u201d\n\nThe DNC waved away concerns about RNC initiatives in an email to BuzzFeed News.\n\n\u201cAlmost every Republican running to be the leader of their party supported an effort to shut down part of the government, because they wanted to stop a policy that would keep immigrant families together,\u201d said DNC spokesperson Holly Shulman, referring to the fierce opposition to Obama\u2019s executive actions from Republicans that would shield more than 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and is currently undergoing legal challenge.\n\n\u201cThe fact is no amount of new hiring or new programs will be able to make up for having the wrong policies on issue after issue.\u201d\n\nThe DNC has had some hiring difficulties so far: the party has not hired someone to oversee its Hispanic media efforts nationally.\n\nAndres Ramirez, a 20-year veteran Democratic strategist in Nevada said for all the criticism of the DNC, they identified in 2003 that the Latino community wasn\u2019t monolithic \u2014 that Nevada has a higher immigrant population, for example, and in Colorado and New Mexico you\u2019re dealing with third and fourth-generation Hispanics. The GOP, he said, is just playing catch up.\n\nRepublicans acknowledge that their biggest challenge is convincing Latino voters that the party doesn\u2019t have animosity towards them.\n\nThe RNC told BuzzFeed News that the perception the Hispanic community has of Republicans may be negative, but when they go into their communities, and stay there, and share their message, things can change.\n\nKorn said the biggest problem was that in the past Republicans weren\u2019t present.\n\n\u201cHow can you change someone\u2019s mind if you aren\u2019t there?\u201d Korn said. \u201cThe door has to be open, it doesn\u2019t mean we will always get their support but opening the door and having them listen is very important.\u201d\n\nCarmen Weese, the Colorado volunteer, said first of all, people don\u2019t really like you knocking on their door. The Republican Party kind of made things worse.\n\n\u201cThe pushback was awesome,\u201d she said. \u201cThey came out and argued with us, they were angry. They said, \u2018What are you doing here now, you\u2019re here now because of the election, right?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo what did she do?\n\n\u201cWe listened, we acknowledged their concerns,\u201d she said, which can have a positive effect in the long run. \u201cWhen a person has a good experience, they will tell more people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3755214, "userid": 741910}, "description": "A substantial increase in budget, double the staff focused on Latino outreach, and a blueprint based off big 2014 wins in Florida and...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
