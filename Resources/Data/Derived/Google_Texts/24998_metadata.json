Make it clear to radical Islamists who pledge to fight America that they are \"signing [their] death warrant.\" Take on the EPA and other government agencies that \"destroy small businesses and jobs.\" Abolish the IRS and pass tax reform, including a flat tax that means Americans can fill out their taxes on a postcard.
