And first you have to drive 43km just to get on the Stuart Highway.\n\nEnter the Royal Flying Doctor Service.\n\nFor for people looking up to enormous empty blue skies, the plane carrying dental care is a godsend.\n\nThe Royal Flying Doctor Service Central Operations Remote Oral Health Care Program are the bush equivalent of tooth fairies.\n\nAdelaide Airport has partnered with the RFDS to deliver the program for the next three years.\n\nTwice yearly fly-in clinics will go to remote communities \u2014 in 2013/14, 96 patients including 38 children attended the clinics.\n\nThe extension of the program comes after a successful two-year pilot and ensures more adults and children living in remote SA communities will get regular visits from senior dental students as well as access to preventive treatments and oral health education.\n\nThe RFDS will deliver the program in collaboration with the University of Adelaide\u2019s School of Dentistry to communities including Marla/Mintabie, the Gawler Ranges and the Birdsville Track \u2014 places where access to a dentist can be up to a day\u2019s drive away.\n\nThe service includes cleaning, fillings and extractions.\n\nLanding on the red dirt airstrip at Kingoonya as kangaroos scramble out of the way gives a hint of the vastness and sparseness of the region.\n\nOn this day five final year dental students supervised by Dr Dick Milner are in the small RFDS clinic with a steady stream of patients. It is the second time the clinic has been held in the tiny town.\n\nFor Lynly Kerin of North Well Station the fly in dental care is gold.\n\nDaughter Elke, 5, in Reception in the School of the Air, has had a check up and no problems found.\n\n\u201cPeople get very busy and when we go to town dental care is usually at the bottom of the list,\u201d Mrs Kerin said.\n\n\u201cPeople usually leave it until they are in terrible pain. Having this as a preventive care service is just wonderful.\n\n\u201cIt gives peace of mind that Elke can be checked so easily.\u201d\n\nMrs Kerin well knows the peril of putting off dental checks.\n\nHer husband Mat put off having check after chipping a tooth. It eroded to a point he had to be rushed to Adelaide for surgery which cost $4500.\n\n\u201cHe was on morphine and I have never seen him in such pain,\u201d Mrs Kerin said. \u201cBut that is too often the case here \u2014 it is a long way to travel to see a dentist and it can be hard to get in to see one.\n\nPeter Beaton, 48, is typical of many people in the small waiting room.\n\nHe has driven four hours from Mobella Station to be told he needs four fillings and a wisdom tooth extracted.\n\n\u201cMy tooth had been giving me curry so when the station manager said the dentist was coming to town I put my hand up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this I probably would have waited until I was in agony and may have had to be flown out.\u201d\n\nThe five dental students also are enjoying the day.\n\nIt is the first time student Katherine Rao, 26, has been to this part of SA.\n\n\u201cThis is a wonderful opportunity for us \u2014 and a real eye opener,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a really diverse group of people and it is great to be involved in preventive care.\n\n\u201cIt is also great to see this part of the world.\u201d\n\nRFDS Central Operations General Manager of Health Services, Dr John Setchell, said\n\nthe continuation of the RFDS Remote Oral Health Care Program means RFDS will be\n\nable to address serious shortcomings in more communities.\n\n\u201cThe pilot program uncovered serious problems and even worse potential health issues\n\ncreated by a lack of regular oral care services, with as many as two-in-three school-age\n\nchildren and three quarters of adults having at least one cavity,\u201d Dr Setchell said.\n\n\u201cPleasingly, a significant proportion of those who received a dental examination and\n\ntreatment during their first visit showed significant improvements in oral health at\n\nsubsequent visits.\u201d\n\nThe dental students also conduct community oral health sessions to increase awareness\n\nof the link between poor oral health and chronic disease; these take place one-on-one\n\nwith patients or in formal group sessions.\n\nAdelaide Airport managing director, Mark Young, said the association with RFDS was highly valued.\n\n\u201cOur position as the major gateway to South Australia provides us with an opportunity to\n\npartner with local community initiatives and worthwhile causes as part of our Community\n\nInvestment Program. We consider our partnership with the RFDS a significant investment.\n\n\u201cWe have an excellent longstanding relationship with RFDS \u2014 they are a vital part of the fabric of Adelaide Airport and make an incredible contribution to the State.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress.com", "application-name": "The Advertiser", "og": {"site_name": "The Advertiser", "description": "Kingoonya, population 15, has a great pub, a few sheds and stunning sunsets but no dentist.
