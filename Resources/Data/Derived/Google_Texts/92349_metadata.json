A new effort from the World Health Organization (WHO), alongside two scientists from the University of Illinois, involves fortifying many of the developing countries\u2019 favorite condiments and seasonings in a bid to inject some nutrition into foods they frequently consume.\n\nImagine dipping your French fries in a glob of ketchup that\u2019s been boosted with iron and vitamin A. Or maybe the oil and vinegar on your sandwich contain folic acid and zinc. Of course, we in America don\u2019t suffer from micronutrient deficiencies to the extent other countries do, which is why Luis A. Mejia and Allyson Bower are instead bringing these essential vitamins and minerals to soy sauce in China, for example, or to curry powder in India.\n\n\"In some countries where these deficiencies are widespread, there is consistent use \u2014 almost a daily dose \u2014 of certain condiments and seasonings,\u201d said Mejia, an adjunct professor in food science and human nutrition, in a statement.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t confined to one income bracket. Andy Warhol once said the best thing about Coca-Cola is that it\u2019s democratic: \u201cA Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking.\u201d The same holds true for condiments. Soy sauce is accessible, and it doesn\u2019t discriminate among palates. This gives organizations like WHO a tremendous amount of responsibility because it means the solution is vast and simple, and therefore necessary.\n\nThe method has already shown success with table salt and iodine. In 1990, less than 20 percent of all households were consuming iodized salt over the standard plain variety. The U.S. was lucky enough to have iodized salt, a so-called \u201cfunctional food,\u201d since 1924 when scientist David Marine first launched the goiter prevention program. But other countries have not fared so well. An absence of iodine in the diets of many developing countries has led to sweeping mental retardation and complications with childbirth.\n\nIn 2007, Kul Gautam, then-deputy executive director of UNICEF, spoke out on the terrible dangers of Iodine Deficiency Disorder. \u201cEven a moderate deficiency, especially in pregnant women and infants,\u201d he said, \u201clowers their intelligence by 10 to 15 IQ points, with incalculable damage to social and economic development of nations and communities.\u201d\n\nWhat David Marine recognized in 1924, the rest of the world eventually adopted. Salt became the conduit through which people consumed their daily helping of iodine. By 2008, UNICEF estimated, 72 percent of households in developing countries had begun using iodized salt, and the number of countries suffering from rampant IDD dropped from 110 to 47.\n\n\"Just as iodine deficiency has been controlled for many years in the U.S. through salt fortification,\u201d said Bower, \u201cwe now hope to offer a framework to enrich foods with iron, vitamin A, and other micronutrients in the developing world.\u201d\n\nThe greatest hotspots are in Southeast Asia, specifically in the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia. They also crop up in West Africa and in Central America. Mejia and Bower hope to bring fortified sugar to Guatemala, soy and fish sauces to Asia, bouillon cubes to West Africa, and curry powder to India and Pakistan.\n\nTheir greatest hurdle in bringing micronutrients to these countries is a legal one. Anytime a health organization wants to start manipulating a country\u2019s food supply, governments are likely to bristle. The team hopes this resistance is only kneejerk.\n\nMejia and Bower will present their recommendations to a WHO meeting in New York in the coming days alongside several other colleagues. They say they\u2019re confident the argument for greater fortification will be heard, in large part because of WHO\u2019s reputation, which the researchers hope to wield as they venture out to various corners of the globe.\n\nFor example, Vietnam has a soy sauce fortification program. Indonesia doesn\u2019t. \u201cIndonesia does have regulations that allow fortification of wheat flour, margarine, and rice,\u201d Mejia says, \u201cbut not condiments. So we can tell WHO that the legal framework is present in Indonesia and recommend that the organization expand its efforts there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "who, and, scientists, work, fortify, condiments, seasonings, areas, nutrient, deficiencies", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "By injecting essential micronutrients into the foods people consume every day, entire swaths of disease could be erased.", "title": "Adding Nutrients To Seasonings Could Make The Whole World Healthier", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/who-and-scientists-work-fortify-condiments-seasonings-areas-nutrient-deficiencies-299694", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/25/soysauce.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "By injecting essential micronutrients into the foods people consume every day, entire swaths of disease could be erased.", "title": "Adding Nutrients To Seasonings Could Make The Whole World Healthier", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/who-and-scientists-work-fortify-condiments-seasonings-areas-nutrient-deficiencies-299694", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/25/soysauce.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/25/soysauce.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-25T17:07:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-25T17:07:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "By injecting essential micronutrients into the foods people consume every day, entire swaths of disease could be erased."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd897\"", "article_summary": "An absence of iodine in the diets of many developing countries has led to sweeping mental retardation and complications with childbirth.\n\u201cIndonesia does have regulations that allow fortification of wheat flour, margarine, and rice,\u201d Mejia says, \u201cbut not condiments.\nA new effort from the World Health Organization (WHO), alongside two scientists from the University of Illinois, involves fortifying many of the developing countries\u2019 favorite condiments and seasonings in a bid to inject some nutrition into foods they frequently consume.\nBy 2008, UNICEF estimated, 72 percent of households in developing countries had begun using iodized salt, and the number of countries suffering from rampant IDD dropped from 110 to 47.\nMejia and Bower will present their recommendations to a WHO meeting in New York in the coming days alongside several other colleagues."}
