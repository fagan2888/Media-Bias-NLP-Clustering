Someone was bored in Sen. Ted Cruz’s office this Friday. A video titled “Can’t Shake It Off,” using a bootleg version of Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off” beat as its soundtrack appeared on Cruz’s official YouTube channel this afternoon. In just 38 seconds, Cruz covers some of the most damning statements made by Obamacare “architect” Jonathan Gruber without the added benefit of context.

But at least you can dance to it.

Sorry Jonathan Gruber, you can't shake off the Obamacare deceptions #FullRepeal https://t.co/ZlIKQ25NRE — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) November 14, 2014
