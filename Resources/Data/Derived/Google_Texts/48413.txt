The Kansas Highway Patrol says weather is to blame for two deadly crashes on the state's highways.

The first crash happened around 4:15 p.m. Sunday on U.S. 50, about 15 miles west of Cimarron in Gray County.

Troopers say a 1993 Mercedes was heading west and lost control in the ice and slush. It slid across the center line and hit a Toyota SUV.

The man driving the Mercedes, 71-year-old Amedeo Grieco of Santa Barbara, California, was taken to a local hospital where he later died. A 64-year-old woman in the car was hospitalized with serious injuries. She is identified as Graziella Grieco of Garden City.

The driver of the SUV, 47-year-old Sallie Oloman of Garden City, also suffered serious injuries in the crash.

The second crash happened just over an hour later on Highway 56 near Pawnee Rock in Pawnee County.

The highway patrol reports a motorcycle was westbound when its driver lost control and skidded in front of an oncoming SUV.

The man on the motorcycle, 39-year-old Joseph Freeman of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, died at the scene.

Of the four people in the SUV, two in their 30s suffered minor injuries. Two boys, ages 9 and 12, were not hurt. The family is from Great Bend.
