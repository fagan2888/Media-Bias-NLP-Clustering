(Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nPresident Obama likes to remind people that he has run his last campaign, but he can\u2019t resist an occasional dig at the man he beat in 2012.\n\n\u201cMy opponent in that last election pledged that he could bring down the unemployment rate to 6 percent by 2016,\u201d Obama said on a recent trip to Cleveland, before delivering the punch line: \u201cIt\u2019s 5.5 now.\u201d\n\nMitt Romney is almost entirely out of politics, but that didn\u2019t stop him from second-guessing the president just hours before Obama\u2019s prime-time address on the Islamic State last fall. Obama\u2019s foreign policy, he said on Fox News, had \u201cput us in a place of danger unlike anything we knew.\u201d\n\nIn the 2 1 / 2 years since the former rivals had lunch at the White House after Obama\u2019s reelection win, they have had no direct communication, and aides to both insist they\u2019ve moved on from a campaign that was notable for the level of hostility and personal attacks it provoked. But the residue of their antipathy remains apparent in their verbal shadowboxing and their determination to keep on keeping score.\n\nOn Friday, Obama made his first appearance in Utah since taking office, speaking on the economy in Salt Lake City, not far from where Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, and his wife, Ann, built a retirement home in Holladay. Romney has deep ties to the area as a member of the Mormon Church and as the former head of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\nObama\u2019s ties are not so deep. Utah is the 49th state he will have visited as president \u2014 with just South Dakota remaining \u2014 and there may be a good reason that he hasn\u2019t been in a hurry to get there: The deep-red Beehive State gave Romney his largest margin of victory over Obama in 2012, 73 percent to 25 percent.\n\nObama was greeted at the airport by Sens. Orrin G. Hatch and Mike Lee, both Republicans, along with Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert (R). But Romney, who associates said was in town, was notably absent. The White House had not invited him to attend; administration aides said the stop in Utah had nothing to do with Obama\u2019s former challenger.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s latest stop in a national tour to highlight differences with Republicans and more forcefully claim credit for the nation\u2019s economic gains nonetheless irritated former Romney aides.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like refighting old wars . . . but it\u2019s also important to set the record straight,\u201d said Eric Fehrnstrom, Romney\u2019s campaign strategist, when asked about Obama\u2019s boasts about the falling unemployment rate. \u201cMitt Romney said during the campaign that the economy goes through up-and-down cycles and that it would eventually come back as it always does. His criticism of President Obama\u2019s policies is they had unnecessarily prolonged the recession.\u201d\n\nFehrnstrom added that considering the high number of \u201cmarginally attached workers\u201d still in the workforce, \u201cthis is not the time for self-satisfaction or victory laps.\u201d\n\nObama associates countered that the president has no personal ill will toward Romney and professed bewilderment at suggestions that he is rubbing it in.\n\n\u201cI sure don\u2019t sense such antipathy on the President\u2019s part,\u201d David Axelrod, Obama\u2019s former senior adviser, wrote in an e-mail.\n\nIt was Axelrod, however, whose memoir \u201cBeliever: My Forty Years in Politics\u201d set off the latest round of bitter recriminations between the two camps last month. The book recounted Romney\u2019s concession phone call to Obama on Nov. 6, 2012, which left the president \u201cslightly irritated.\u201d\n\nAfter their brief talk, Obama purportedly told his advisers that Romney had said: \u201cYou really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee.\u201d Obama continued: \u201cIn other words, black people. That\u2019s what he thinks this was all about.\u201d\n\nThe anecdote outraged Romney\u2019s former campaign aides, who have called it a fabrication. One former Romney associate, in an interview this week, called Obama \u201cpetty\u201d and suggested the sports-loving president had watched too many trash-talking athletes on ESPN.\n\nAxelrod defended his account of the election-night call and ascribed no ill intent to Romney or Obama.\n\nObama\u2019s comment \u201cwas a spontaneous reaction to a conversation between two guys who had just run against each other and saw the campaign and results through distinctly different prisms,\u201d Axelrod wrote in the e-mail. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the sense then that Gov. Romney was being ungracious, nor do I think Obama read him that way.\u201d\n\nDuring a news conference a week after the election, Obama told reporters that he agreed with some of Romney\u2019s ideas and might look for ways to work with him. But after their lunch at the White House two weeks later, there was no serious consideration of any kind of \u201cteam of rivals\u201d approach that Obama seemed to embrace in his first term with Democratic primary challenger-turned-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nIn January 2014, appearing on comedian Jimmy Fallon\u2019s late-night show, Romney said he told Obama during their lunch that he wanted him to succeed and encouraged him \u201cto think about what makes America a unique nation, what led us to be greatest nation in the history of the earth.\u201d\n\nBut, Romney added, \u201cI\u2019ve been disappointed, truthfully. The centerpiece of his first four years, Obamacare, has not gone off terribly well, and our reputation around the world has not been enhanced like I\u2019d hoped.\u201d\n\nBy the beginning of 2015, it was Obama\u2019s turn to throw a verbal dart. Romney was considering another White House bid and had begun to talk about combating poverty \u2014 an effort, perhaps, to atone for his infamous comment in 2012 that 47 percent of the nation did not pay income taxes and would never vote for him.\n\nAppearing at the House Democrats\u2019 retreat in January, Obama mockingly noted that Romney was \u201csuddenly deeply concerned about poverty.\u201d\n\nObama added: \u201cThat\u2019s great. Let\u2019s do something about it.\u201d\n\nRomney, who ultimately chose not to run, replied on Twitter: \u201cMr. Obama, wonder why my concern about poverty? The record number of poor in your term, and your record of failure to remedy.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials declined to comment for this story.\n\nIn recent weeks, Obama has appeared more emboldened. During remarks on the fifth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act last week, Obama suggested that Republicans had not offered an alternative to his landmark health-care plan because he had borrowed many of the principles from the very rivals who had criticized him.\n\nA similar law was \u201cdeployed by a guy named Mitt Romney in Massachusetts to great effect,\u201d Obama said, adding sarcastically: \u201cIf they want to take credit for this law, they can. I\u2019m happy to share it.\u201d\n\nThat same night, Romney appeared on Fallon\u2019s show again and, in a skit with the host, got in his own licks in a humorous way. He mused about a litany of global crises \u2014 turmoil in the Middle East, immigration in the United States and the breakup of the boy band One Direction \u2014 and concluded they all had something in common.\n\n\u201cThanks, Obama,\u201d Romney quipped.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama makes his first trip to Utah as president, where Romney has retired, to talk about the improving economy.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/nakamuradavid", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Obama makes his first trip to Utah as president, where Romney has retired, to talk about the improving economy.", "title": "Why Obama and Romney won\u2019t stop poking each other despite not talking", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/why-obama-and-romney-wont-stop-poking-each-other-despite-not-talking/2015/04/02/5b928304-d899-11e4-8103-fa84725dbf9d_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Production/Digital/Pages-Web/utils/elections2012/_module-content/romney-obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@davidnakamura"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/why-obama-and-romney-wont-stop-poking-each-other-despite-not-talking/2015/04/02/5b928304-d899-11e4-8103-fa84725dbf9d_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "president obama, mitt romney, utah, peronal attacks, 2012 campaign, white house, economy, health care, jimmy fallon, salt lake city, foreign policy, islamic state, david axelrod, eric fehrnstrom", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/nakamuradavid"}, "eomportal-uuid": "5b928304-d899-11e4-8103-fa84725dbf9d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "president obama, mitt romney, utah, peronal attacks, 2012 campaign, white house, economy, health care, jimmy fallon, salt lake city, foreign policy, islamic state, david axelrod, eric fehrnstrom"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc09\"", "article_summary": "Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and President Obama discuss a point during the second presidential debate in Hempstead, N.Y., in October 2012.\n\u201cThanks, Obama,\u201d Romney quipped.\nAxelrod defended his account of the election-night call and ascribed no ill intent to Romney or Obama.\nThe White House had not invited him to attend; administration aides said the stop in Utah had nothing to do with Obama\u2019s former challenger.\nAppearing at the House Democrats\u2019 retreat in January, Obama mockingly noted that Romney was \u201csuddenly deeply concerned about poverty.\u201dObama added: \u201cThat\u2019s great."}
