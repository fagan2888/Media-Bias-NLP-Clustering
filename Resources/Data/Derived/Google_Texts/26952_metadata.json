Instead he\u2019s had his hand in a few different industries over the years, but now he\u2019s hoping to make a name for himself in the restaurant business.\n\nCarlucci\u2019s Pizzaria officially opened about three weeks ago, joining Hacienda, Morgan\u2019s and the Little Black Dog Tavern and The Smokestack Brew at the 100 Center. The pizzeria, which prides itself on its deep dish, occupies the former Center Street Pub at 122 N. Center St., in Mishawaka.\n\nCarlucci\u2019s is open Tuesday through Thursday 4 to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday noon to midnight and Sunday noon to 10 p.m.\n\nDuncan says he\u2019s always liked to cook and finds being in the kitchen therapeutic, but this is his first time taking on his own restaurant. Carlucci\u2019s came about because Joe Grabill with Berkshire Hathaway, which owns the building, approached Duncan about bringing something new to the space after the previous tenant closed. The two had previously worked together.\n\nWhat was important to them was not having another bar at the location, he says, and they came up with a plan after noticing a lack of pizza \u2014 specifically deep-dish \u2014 in the area. It was last March that Grabill contacted Duncan and by August renovations were underway.\n\nDuncan liked the 100 Center because of where it\u2019s heading. The area is once again on the rise, he says, and adding a food option that isn\u2019t offered is going to boost all the businesses in the area. No one is competing with the same product, he says, but giving people more options is going to help the restaurants draw more people and share customers.\n\n\u201cThe 100 Center is on its way back to a time when it was the place to come,\u201d he says. \u201cThe area is returning to its former glory.\u201d\n\nWhen planning Carlucci\u2019s, what was important to Duncan was family and community. Duncan says he works with as many local companies as he can. And with many chain pizza restaurants moving away from sit-down locations and focusing on carry-out only, Duncan wanted to focus on the dining experience.\n\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s still a desire for people to sit down and have a pizza as a meal with their family,\u201d he says.\n\nBut to define yourself as a pizzeria, Duncan says, he knew he had to step it up a notch with his food. So he did a lot of research into the best deep-dish eateries in Chicago and what made people love their pizza.\n\nEverything about Carlucci\u2019s pizzas, he says, is focused on fresh. Nothing comes canned, veggies are chopped daily and he makes his own sauce and dough. Right now the menu is small, but he says they are focused on what they can do well.\n\nEventually the menu will grow and more specialty pizzas will be added as well as desserts. He also will have a half-baked product that customers can pick, take home and pop in the oven for about 10 minutes.\n\nWhen the patio opens in the spring they want to serve ice cream and also add a wine slushy to the drink menu. Carlucci\u2019s serves wine and beer and by March Duncan says he hopes to have his tap system up and running in a \u201cbar-type\u201d area.\n\nDuncan won\u2019t say he has the best pizza in town, but he will stand by the product he is making.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to do pizza the best way we know how,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can count on it being made fresh.\u201d\n\nTop Notch closing on city\u2019s west side\n\nSouth Bend is losing a restaurant that\u2019s called Western Avenue home for almost 20 years. Sunday will be Top Notch Family Restaurant & Bakery\u2019s last day.\n\nEmployees found out only a couple of days ago that the restaurant, located on the corner of Mayflower Road and Western Avenue, will shut its doors, manager Rosa Garcilaco said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad seeing the restaurant go,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a home.\u201d\n\nGarcilaco, who has worked at the restaurant for six years, said many customers have told her Top Notch is like a second home to them. Employees have become close to their regular customers, she said, and that\u2019s going to be one of the hardest parts about shutting down.\n\nThe restaurant is closing because of a new Martin\u2019s Super Market planned for the area, said Gus Bourounis, the owner\u2019s son. Last July, Martin\u2019s announced it would build a 40,000-square-foot store to replace its nearby Western Avenue location.\n\nAs part of its plans, Martin\u2019s purchased the property on which Top Notch sits. Bourounis expects the restaurant to be torn down. Martin\u2019s was not able to provide information on the planned use of the property.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we can confirm we plan to build a new store. Additional details are not available,\u201d Cindy Kaplan, a Martin\u2019s spokeswoman, wrote in an email.\n\nAlthough opening at a new location has been discussed, it\u2019s too early to know if Top Notch will return, Bourounis said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking that after 20 years we have to close,\u201d he said\n\nNavarre, Morris partner up\n\nThe Navarre Hospitality Group has entered into a new partnership with the Morris Performing Arts Center as the exclusive in-house food and beverage provider. The partnership went into effect Feb. 4. Navarre will serve as the official food and beverage operator of the Palais Royale ballroom and will oversee the bars and concessions for the Morris.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to have this premier restaurant group operate the Morris and Palais food and beverage services,\u201d Dennis Andres, executive director of the Morris and Palais Royale, said in a news release. \u201cThis partnership will bring food and beverage services to the next level.\u201d\n\nThe partnership is the first time a locally owned company has secured the food and beverage contract since the venue was renovated in 2000. Navarre Hospitality Group also provides service to the Crystal Ballroom at the Lerner Theatre and the Matterhorn Conference Center, both in Elkhart.\n\n\u201cThis agreement illustrates our ongoing efforts to fully leverage local food products and have an even greater impact on the region\u2019s economy,\u201d Kurt Janowsky, founder and CEO of Navarre Hospitality Group, said in the release. \u201cWe\u2019re excited and honored by this opportunity.\u201d\n\nLincoln Wright\u2019s column runs on Wednesdays and Sundays.
