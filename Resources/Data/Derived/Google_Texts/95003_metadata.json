Scott Brown, who served briefly in Massachusetts before losing to Elizabeth Warren, has moved to New Hampshire for another run at the US Senate. Will the Granite State accept him?\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nWhy Congress is looking at labels to curb food waste\n\nSmoke detected on EgyptAir Flight 804: What does that mean?\n\nRobert F. Kennedy did it. So did Hillary Clinton. But can Scott Brown pull it off?\n\nCan Mr. Brown pack his (carpet)bag, move to another state, and hope to win a US Senate seat \u2013 as did the two former senators from New York?\n\nWhen Brown on Friday set in motion his campaign to challenge incumbent Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, it took Democrats about two seconds to cobble together a video showing Brown on many occasions declaring himself a proud resident of Massachusetts.\n\nRecommended: So you think you know Congress? Take our quiz.\n\nThat\u2019s when he successfully ran for the Senate seat held for nearly 47 years by the late Ted Kennedy.\n\nBrown was an attractive candidate \u2013 conservative but not too tea partyish for relatively liberal Massachusetts \u2013 a real estate lawyer with a rough upbringing, a Boston College Law School degree, and more than 30 years in the National Guard who campaigned around the state in his pickup truck.\n\nBrown beat state Attorney General Martha Coakley (D) in a special election in 2010. But in the regular election two years later, he lost to Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren \u2013 an unabashed liberal and consumer advocate who focused her attention on large financial institutions at a time when big banks were not the most popular businesses in America.\n\nEarly polls suggested that a Brown-Shaheen race could be a toss-up, but more recent surveys indicate she has a sizable lead, according to the Boston Globe. A Suffolk University poll released last week found Brown would pose a strong challenge to Shaheen, but still trails her 52 percent to 39 percent, with 9 percent undecided, the Globe reported from Nashua, NH, Saturday.\n\nOn Friday, Brown noted that his well-traveled pickup \u2013 now adorned with \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d New Hampshire license plates \u2013 was approaching 300,000 miles.\n\nHe\u2019ll need it if he\u2019s too overcome any perception that he\u2019s a newcomer to the Granite State. (He moved to his family\u2019s vacation home there last summer and registered as a New Hampshire voter in December.)\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire is a traditional retail politics state,\u201d Matt Mowers, executive director of the New Hampshire GOP, told the Globe. \u201cThe voters here want to hear you talk two or three times, not just once. People are much more interested in where you stand on issues and how you\u2019ll help them.\u201d\n\nLike virtually every Republican running for election or re-election, Brown is zeroing in on the Affordable Care Act as his prime target.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t like Obamacare, we can get rid of it. Period,\u201d Brown said in his speech Friday at the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference in Nashua. \u201cA big political wave is about to break in America, and the Obamacare Democrats are on the wrong side of that wave.\u201d\n\nOutside influence is likely to be a big issue in New Hampshire\u2019s senatorial race.\n\nAmerican Crossroads, Karl Rove\u2019s super PAC, is about to launch $600,000 in attack ads against Shaheen.\n\n\u201cScott Brown is for Scott Brown and the powerful interests that back him, not New Hampshire,\u201d New Hampshire Democrats said in a statement. \u201cNew Hampshire isn\u2019t going to let Scott Brown and his big oil buddies like the Koch brothers buy themselves a Senate seat.\u201d\n\n(Wealthy industrialists David and Charles Koch are founders of Americans for Prosperity, the conservative political advocacy group.)\n\nOn Saturday, Shaheen sent a letter to Brown asking him to sign the \"People's Pledge,\" the same thing he agreed to while running against Warren two years ago.\n\n\u201cI have signed and attached two copies of an agreement with the exact same terms for the New Hampshire 2014 Senate race,\u201d Shaheen wrote. \"I hope you will join me in once again committing to the same People\u2019s Pledge you signed in Massachusetts and limiting the influence of outside groups in New Hampshire this year.\"\n\nBrown quickly knocked back that idea, calling it \u201chypocritical and self-serving.\u201d\n\n\"Before I even thought of becoming a candidate, Jeanne Shaheen's allies in Washington were running negative ads against me for months,\" Brown said. \"And right now, while I'm meeting with the people of New Hampshire, she is on the West Coast raising money so third-party groups in DC will have money to run even more outside negative ads against me.\"\n\nPolitico.com reported that Shaheen is spending the weekend with other female Senate candidates fundraising in Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.\n\nBrown\u2019s nomination \u2013 assuming he moves beyond his exploratory effort to official candidacy \u2013 is no slam dunk\n\nFormer US Sen. Bob Smith, former state Sen. Jim Rubens, and conservative activist Karen Testerman, have announced for the seat as Republicans.\n\nSmith says he and the other two declared candidates \"are being ignored by the establishment.\u201d\n\n\"This is really something,\u201d he told the New Hampshire Union Leader. \u201cTo have a Massachusetts liberal being promoted, actually being pushed, by the powers in Washington and the establishment here in New Hampshire to run against three people who have been on the ground here for decades is really pretty bizarre.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "c5f218d8f3bf28e1ef9ef1e1588ec847", "sailthru.author": "Brad Knickerbocker", "description": "Former Sen.
