A 35-year-old man is being held at the Monmouth County Correctional Institution on a $700,000 bond for Friday’s high-speed police chase in Long Branch.

Brian D. Cofer, of Asbury Park, is charged with second-degree fleeing and eluding and six counts of aggravated assault on three police officers. Police say that Cofer endangered the public and struck two police cars three times each during his attempt to avoid arrest. Nobody was injured.

The 3 p.m. pursuit ended on Morrell Street near Bath Avenue.

Cofer had an outstanding warrant for failing to pay $164 in fines, according to charging documents released today by the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office.
