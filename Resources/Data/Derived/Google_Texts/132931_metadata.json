For five generations, the family farm was diversified between livestock, vegetables, orchard fruits and bush fruit, all raised and grown sustainably. For the last 16 years, Johnson has supported research on safe and sustainable farm practices and represented 13 states in helping farmers convert to grass-based agriculture through his involvement in the Northeast Pasture Consortium.\n\nCourtesy of Angus Johnson Angus Johnson on his Just Good Kosher farm.

Johnson will go into detail on why this matters later.\n\nOver the years, Johnson had been no stranger to Judaism; however, when he met, fell in love with, and married his Jewish wife, Dr. Allison Bell, his interest and study of Judaism deepened, as did his questions about Kashrut. He made an Orthodox conversion in Teaneck, New Jersey, in June 2009 and began to focus on kosher agriculture.\n\nWhile his wife sparked his interest in Judaism, it became clear within five minutes of speaking with him that Johnson is Jewish because he truly wants to be.\n\n\u201cThe moment I realized I was a Jew was when I read the Sh\u2019ma [a principal Jewish prayer recited in the morning and evening]. It says \u2018That I will give rain to your land, the early and the late rains, that you may gather in your grain, your wine and your oil. And I will give grass in your field for your cattle and you will eat and you will be satisfied.\u2019 For me, that is the crux of Judaism. I believe in Tikkun Olam , repairing the world ,\u201d he emphasized, \u201cthrough agriculture.\u201d\n\nThere is certainly a lot to be done in the area of kosher meat, he points out. \u201cKosher meat is not \u2018kosher\u2019 as I define the word,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cKashrut is about kavanah , or intention. For most farms, it\u2019s just a business.\u201d\n\nThrough his food, Johnson said he hopes to provide a pathway for people looking to reconnect with Judaism through kavanah.\n\nIs the standard kosher meat we buy in the supermarket today so bad? Johnson responded that we know that grass-fed livestock are better for human health because of the presence of CLAs (conjugated lineolio acids). Furthermore, he said, as Jews we are commanded to look after and not laud over our animals and our environment. We\u2019re to take care of and not abuse them. His intention, he said, is to produce food that holds to this principle.\n\nJust Good Kosher pasture-raised chickens in their coup.

This is completely unnatural,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they grow that quickly, they can\u2019t move. They haven\u2019t developed the strength in their legs to hold themselves up. Often when they try to move, they\u2019ll have a heart attack, because their hearts haven\u2019t grown at the same rate as their bodies. Factory farming loses a percentage of birds this way.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s passion for and commitment to creating kosher and sustainable meat is unyielding. Five years ago, he contracted Lyme disease, which affected his health seriously. He\u2019s since mostly recovered. In the spring of 2014, he started Just Good Kosher, raising birds on pasture, and he is determined to create a world that knows about the brand. Every single piece of his operation, from hired help down to the knives used to slaughter the animals, involves kavana.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 61 years old, and I\u2019m finally doing what I was meant to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I began, I didn\u2019t have two nickels to rub together. Now I\u2019m sourcing my meat to many local synagogues in the Berkshires area.\u201d Johnson said he hopes to eventually provide New England\u2019s Jewish community with \u201cgood kosher meat,\u201d and, if enough interest is generated, franchise Just Good Kosher so that the Jewish community can acquire locally sourced kosher meat.\n\n\u201cThose are my short-term goals,\u201d he said. \u201cMy long-term goal is to create an agricultural yeshiva that will teach young Jews how to sustainably farm on a commercial basis.\u201d\n\nClearly, there\u2019s no end in sight to the possibilities. Johnson\u2019s drive is as palpable as his cause is essential.\n\nFind Hadas Margulies at HadasMargulies.com .", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.128x79": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.forward.com/images/128x79/t-v-angusjohnson-10415-1425562602.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Hadas Margulies", "twitter": {"description": "Fifth-generation New England farmer Angus Johnson explains that standard kosher agriculture is not all it\u2019s cracked up to be.
