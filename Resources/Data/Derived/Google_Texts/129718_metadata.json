They will ask specifically for support of H.R. 3463 and creation of similar legislation in the Senate. The bipartisan legislation, introduced by Reps. Griffith and DeGette, harmonizes on and off-Exchange markets to offer consumers similar dental choices. The bill offers a win-win solution as it has no-cost implications, no opposition and does not impact other Affordable Care Act requirements.\n\n\"We want to make it easier for all consumers to purchase dental benefits, whether they shop inside or outside Exchanges,\" said NADP Executive Director Evelyn F. Ireland. \"NADP research and numerous outside studies show having dental coverage leads to a greater likelihood to receive dental care. In a 2015 NADP consumer survey, 84 percent of consumers with dental benefits report having a dental checkup in the past year compared to only 61 percent of those without dental benefits.\"\n\nNADP members will also be asking for support to encourage the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to fix the Advanced Premium Tax Credit (APTC) calculation, noting the issue has bi-partisan support as well as support from consumers, carriers and providers. Currently, the calculation is based on a silver medical plan in each family's area within a state which may not include the pediatric dental benefit. Because of this calculation error, families in some states and regions are receiving APTC for dental benefits while most are not.\n\nAdvocacy in Action attendees will provide detailed documentation of the issues at the conclusion of their face-to-face meetings, and NADP will follow-up with policymakers throughout the year. These materials are also available on NADP's website at www.nadp.org.\n\nAbout NADP\n\nNational Association of Dental Plans (NADP), a Texas nonprofit corporation with headquarters in Dallas, Texas, is the representative and recognized resource of the dental benefits industry.
