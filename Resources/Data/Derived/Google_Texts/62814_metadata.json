In January, Soupure, a company that opened in Los Angeles in 2014, expanded from local delivery to shipping its cleanses nationally.\n\nThe appeal of souping, in part, is that it promises an easier detox than a juice cleanse.\n\n\u201cWhen you do juice cleanses, your blood sugar can spike really high,\u201d said Despina Hyde, a registered dietitian at NYU Langone Medical Center. \u201cSoup cleanses are inherently lower in sugar overall because they\u2019re using more vegetables and complex carbohydrates versus fruit. They also tend to be higher in fiber, which has so many good benefits.\u201d\n\nElina Fuhrman, who founded Soupelina in Los Angeles in 2013, chimed in: \u201cThe juice cleansing trend started from a good place and evolved into something that\u2019s not so healthy, because there\u2019s a lot of sugar and not enough nutrients that the body needs.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, the soups that make up these cleanses tend to be quite flavorful, thanks in part to a liberal use of spices like turmeric and cumin. Packaged without preservatives and delivered chilled, they lack the higher sodium content of, say, a can of chicken noodle from a supermarket. Some are drinkable cold, although eating them warmed up, ideally out of a bowl with a spoon, arguably underlines the sense that they\u2019re a meal.\n\nSoup cleanses also tend to be quite low in calories, often hovering around the 1,200 mark for a day\u2019s worth of soup.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right at the borderline,\u201d said Hyde, the dietitian. \u201cA lot of people I work with need between 1,400 and 1,600 calories a day. You\u2019re going to lose weight on low-calorie diets, of course, but it can lead to muscle breakdown.\u201d For that reason, she doesn\u2019t advise souping for more than one full day at a time.\n\nFor those who prefer to make their soups from scratch, several books on soup cleansing have recently been published, including \u201cThe Soup Cleanse\u201d by Blatteis and Vivienne Vella of Soupure, and \u201cSoupelina\u2019s Soup Cleanse\u201d by Fuhrman. The founder of Splendid Spoon plans one, too.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/11/health_FatDad20a1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "For those who prefer to make their soups from scratch, several books on soup cleansing have recently been published, including \u201cThe Soup Cleanse\u201d by Blatteis and Vivienne Vella of Soupure, and \u201cSoupelina\u2019s Soup Cleanse\u201d by Fuhrman.\nThe appeal of souping, in part, is that it promises an easier detox than a juice cleanse.\nLike a growing number of people, Zhao came to the routine \u2014 known as souping, or going on a soup cleanse \u2014 after finding juice cleanses, which she tried several times, too extreme.\nSoup cleanses also tend to be quite low in calories, often hovering around the 1,200 mark for a day\u2019s worth of soup.\n\u201cSoup cleanses are inherently lower in sugar overall because they\u2019re using more vegetables and complex carbohydrates versus fruit."}
