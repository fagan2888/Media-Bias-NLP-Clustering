Americans for Prosperity, the Koch Brothers-backed conservative nonprofit, has already spent millions of dollars this election cycle attacking Democratic incumbents over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Today, one of the group's state affiliates will offer a "Surviving Obamacare 101" workshop in Missoula, Mont.

The workshop will cover both practical and political topics. The chapter's website says it will educate participants as to "How Obamacare affects your insurance" and "Whether it is more 'affordable' for you to not comply with the mandate," as well as "Why Medicaid expansion is a badeconomic [sic] and bad health policy."

Americans for Properity's Montana state president Joe Balyeat, who is a former state senator and certified public accountant, is giving the workshop.

Balyeat told the Missoulian Monday that despite the group's political beliefs, the point of the workshop is to "inform Montanans of their options."

“I don’t really encourage them one way or another, I just sort of give them the information,” Balyeat said.

U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) accused the billionaire Koch brothers last week of being "un-American" for spreading "lies" about the health care law in political ads.

A proposal to adopt the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion failed in Montana's state legislature in April.
