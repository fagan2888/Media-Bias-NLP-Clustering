In the GOP debates, the candidates only bring up the topic as a way to swipe President Obama, which is fair enough but is not a discussion of poverty much less a good-faith attempt to mitigate it. By comparison, the Democratic debate moderators brought up \u201cISIS\u201d or \u201cTerrorism\u201d 21 times total in all three debates.\n\nA recent study in The Intercept found poverty\u2019s non-status on television isn\u2019t just limited to the debates. Cable news was over 20 times more likely to mention ISIS or terrorism than poverty during the heart of primary season in late 2014.\n\nBernie Sanders has brought up poverty in the debates about half a dozen times, calling childhood poverty \u201ca national disgrace.\u201d Hillary Clinton has not brought up the issue in the debates, though she frequently tweets about it. This is partly not the candidates\u2019 fault: if they\u2019re not asked the question they can\u2019t really discuss the topic. To the extent discussions of poverty are jammed into a response it\u2019s part of a much broader answer about the economic problems America is facing.\n\nAccording to the 2014 census, 14.5% of Americans, or over 45 million people, live in poverty, up from 11.3% in 2000; a rate not seen since the early \u201990s.\n\nDespite some economic progress since the recession of 2008-\u201909, the poverty rate remains stubbornly immovable. To exacerbate the problem, an increasingly cruel GOP Congress has slashed billions from the government food stamp program and ended unemployment benefits. Poverty is particularly bad for single mothers. One-third of families led by single mothers lived below the poverty line in 2013\u2014or 15.6 million Americans.\n\nOne recent study linked poverty to diminished IQ in children. It impacts childhood education, crime and even future economic gains. A 2011 study attributed 133,000 deaths a year to poverty-related illnesses.\n\nIslamic terrorism, by contrast, has less of a chance of killing someone than bee stings or furniture. Only 45 Americans have been killed since 9/11 as a result of al-Qaeda or ISIL-inspired attacks.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the candidates don\u2019t mention poverty on their websites and in speeches. Both Clinton and Sanders bring up the topic. Sanders\u2019 website leads with the issue at the time of publication, albeit with the superfluous \u201cwho works 40 hours a week\u201d qualifier:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even with Bernie Sanders squarely in the running, campaign coverage is far likelier to talk terrorism than poverty", "title": "The defining American crisis our corporate media still can\u2019t be bothered to cover", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Even with Bernie Sanders squarely in the running, campaign coverage is far likelier to talk terrorism than poverty", "title": "The defining American crisis our corporate media still can\u2019t be bothered to cover", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/10/why_the_corporate_media_refuses_to_talk_about_poverty_in_2016_coverage_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/12/AP100916115874.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even with Bernie Sanders squarely in the running, campaign coverage is far likelier to talk terrorism than poverty", "title": "The defining American crisis our corporate media still can\u2019t be bothered to cover", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/12/AP100916115874.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Adam Johnson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016, AlterNet, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, isis, Jim Webb, Poverty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "By comparison, the Democratic debate moderators brought up \u201cISIS\u201d or \u201cTerrorism\u201d 21 times total in all three debates.\nThis is partly not the candidates\u2019 fault: if they\u2019re not asked the question they can\u2019t really discuss the topic.\nCable news was over 20 times more likely to mention ISIS or terrorism than poverty during the heart of primary season in late 2014.\nA recent study in The Intercept found poverty\u2019s non-status on television isn\u2019t just limited to the debates.\nIt\u2019s not as if the candidates don\u2019t mention poverty on their websites and in speeches."}
