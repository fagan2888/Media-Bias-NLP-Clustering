After reading the article in the Portsmouth Herald, May 9, 2016, about Carol Shea-Porter’s election bid, where it states, “her primary challenger, Bedford businessman Shawn O’Conner, a name she won’t acknowledge,” I checked out their respective Facebook pages.

On Shawn’s page I find five priority issues, raise the minimum wage, ensure health care for all and improve the affordable care act while not burdening the middle and working classes with new/increased taxes, fulfilling the American dream through equal opportunities in education, gun safety and regulate Wall Street & break up the big banks.
