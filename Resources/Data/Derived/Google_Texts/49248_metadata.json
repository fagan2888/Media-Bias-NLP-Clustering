She was pronounced dead around 9:40 Saturday morning. Her name hasn't been released.\n\nCornell McNeal, 26, is charged with attempted capital murder, rape and arson. Police did not mention any possible amendment to the attempted murder charge.\n\nThe man accused of beating, raping and setting a woman on fire at a northeast Wichita park last week has been charged with attempted capital murder.\n\nCornell Antoine McNeal, 26, made his first appearance in Sedgwick County District Court Friday afternoon. He was charged with attempted capital murder, or in the alternative, attempted first degree murder. He was also charged with rape and two counts of arson. One count of arson is relating to the attack. The second accuses McNeal of setting a garage on fire the same night, just a few blocks away from the park.\n\nThe charges stem from the attack of a 36-year-old woman at Fairmount Park on Nov. 14th late at night. Police said the suspect and victim had a 'random encounter' at the park before the attack occurred.\n\nThe victim remains hospitalized in critical condition, and has been unable to speak with investigators.\n\nInterim Wichita Police Chief Nelson Mosely said earlier this week that investigators were able to link the suspect through evidence obtained by forensic nurses. McNeal was arrested hours later on Nov. 20.\n\nMcNeal requested a court-appointed attorney, and is scheduled to be back in court for a preliminary hearing on December 4. His bond is set at $250,000", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The woman attacked at Fairmount Park last week has died.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Bradley -", "og": {"description": "The woman attacked at Fairmount Park last week has died.", "title": "UPDATE: Fairmount Park attack victim dies", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Cornell-McNeal-in-court-283516311.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/51B/F72/51BF724B8623440BA094B0A4DC2D5C5E", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/0E4/FC1/0E4FC143F88F4F7A931F8430F18DA605.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The woman attacked at Fairmount Park last week has died.", "title": "UPDATE: Fairmount Park attack victim dies", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Cornell-McNeal-in-court-283516311.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Cornell-McNeal.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Fairmount Park attack victim dies", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Fairmount Park attack victim"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd46d\"", "article_summary": "The charges stem from the attack of a 36-year-old woman at Fairmount Park on Nov. 14th late at night.\nHe was charged with attempted capital murder, or in the alternative, attempted first degree murder.\nPolice said the suspect and victim had a 'random encounter' at the park before the attack occurred.\nMore Video...Wichita police confirm the woman who was raped, beaten and set on fire last week at a northeast Wichita park has died.\nThe man accused of beating, raping and setting a woman on fire at a northeast Wichita park last week has been charged with attempted capital murder."}
