The group Reporters Without Borders has labeled Hacking Team \u201can enemy of the Internet,\u201d for the surveillance tools and malware products it provides, with little transparency or accountability, to governments. News of the disclosure brought forth the sounds of schadenfreude from the privacy and tech communities.\n\nSo far, the exposed documents have already revealed a few key things about the group, its clients, and the business of cyberwar for hire.\n\nThe FBI has spent about $775,000 on the company\u2019s Remote Control Service, or RCS, an eavesdropping system that pulls data from a target computer before it\u2019s encrypted.\n\nHacking Team purports to sell its services to \u201claw enforcement\u201d but invoices reveal a wide assortment of unsavory clients, including the governments of Russia and Sudan, despite a UN arms embargo against the latter and contrary to previous assertions from company\u2019s president, Christian Pozzi. It\u2019s not clear that the company broke any laws with sales to Sudan, since surveillance software isn\u2019t typically classified as a weapon.\n\nThe company had an \u201caction plan\u201d for further expansion into the United States market and listed a Naval Criminal Investigative Service representative as a potential sales target.\n\nA previous disclosure from April showed that the United States Army bought an RCS system for $350,000. The most recent breach adds details: the system went to Fort Meade, but was never used, according to a (typo-ridden) email from Alex Velasco, the third-party contractor who closed the deal on behalf of Hacking Team. \u201cThey were never given permission to pull an internet line to their of-ice [sic] to install the system. (ridiculous but true!),\u201d Velasco writes. \u201cThey also are interested in the new options that we have developed and want prices. They are not sure when we will be able to install but they believe that it could be in the next few months.\u201d\n\nMost incredibly, the hack brought to light the company\u2019s price list, a blue book for surveillance and malware products. It\u2019s a first-of-its-kind window into the going rate of cyberwar and espionage capabilities. Of the many offenses the company seems to have committed, price gouging seems to be one.\n\nWant to hack into someone\u2019s Windows device to steal Gmail data, turn on the microphone, and take snapshots with the camera? That\u2019s an upfront license fee of about $44,200. Microphone recording and keystroke logging on in Mac OS will run you the same amount.\n\nThe company also sells what it calls \u201cinfection vectors,\u201d or malware, including one product that \u201callows you to remotely infect Android and BlackBerry smartphones by sending specially crafted messages.\u201d The price for that is $33,000.\n\nPerhaps the strangest product on offer is a software-based AIagent, or \u201cintelligence module,\u201d that does some of the work of a real spy. The module \u201cautomatically processes all the evidence to extract and correlate the relevant bits of information, presenting you the overall picture of your investigations as it progress [sic] in time,\u201d all for a price of $241,000.\n\nThere are a number of lessons to be learned from the breach.\n\n\u201cThe Hacking Team case shows that international rules and controls should be applied more efficiently to private companies which are producing shady cyber capabilities and related technologies, as they are for conventional weapons,\u201dJarno Limn\u00e9ll, a professor of cybersecurity at Aalto University in Finland, wrote in the International Business Times.\n\nIt also shows that the cyber weapons you build, or buy, can come back to haunt you.\n\nThis article was published originally in Defense One.\n\nRead More at Defense One:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On Monday, the Italian company Hacking Team, which produces secret cyber weapons for l", "title": "You Won\u2019t Believe How Much a Cyberwar Really Costs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/07/You-Won-t-Believe-How-Much-Cyberwar-Really-Costs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06182012_Hacked_Money_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/07/You-Won-t-Believe-How-Much-Cyberwar-Really-Costs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06182012_Hacked_Money_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "On Monday, the Italian company Hacking Team, which produces secret cyber weapons for l", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "So far, the exposed documents have already revealed a few key things about the group, its clients, and the business of cyberwar for hire.\nThe group Reporters Without Borders has labeled Hacking Team \u201can enemy of the Internet,\u201d for the surveillance tools and malware products it provides, with little transparency or accountability, to governments.\nIt\u2019s not clear that the company broke any laws with sales to Sudan, since surveillance software isn\u2019t typically classified as a weapon.\nNews of the disclosure brought forth the sounds of schadenfreude from the privacy and tech communities.\nIt also shows that the cyber weapons you build, or buy, can come back to haunt you."}
