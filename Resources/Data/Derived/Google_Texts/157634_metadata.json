From broadcast networks to cable and streaming services, a profusion of outlets are sprouting original programming.\n\nComic book heroes will vie for attention as \u201cConstantine\u201d tackles Hellblazer, \u201cGotham\u201d envisions the Batman origin story and \u201cThe Flash\u201d finds his super powers in a spinoff of \u201cArrow.\u201d Most of these won\u2019t be as long-lived as their source material.\n\nMinorities will be abundant. \u201cBlack-ish,\u201d \u201cCristela\u201d and \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d are just the most obvious series delivering diversity onscreen, poking fun at ethnic and racial stereotypes and toying with identity politics. The upward mobility of immigrants in the workforce will be a frequent source of dramedy. While African-Americans and Hispanics are most prominent, they\u2019re not alone. The Henry Higgins-Eliza Doolittle class formula of Pygmalion/My Fair Lady is recast with an Asian male instructing a younger, \u201cselfie\u201d-obsessed Caucasian female. TV is moving on from requisite gay characters to a broader rainbow coalition.\n\nSEE ALSO: List of new shows, night by night\n\nStrong women will be omnipresent, some in silly portrayals (she\u2019s a cop! she\u2019s a mom! she\u2019s Debra Messing!), some in politically relevant ones. \u201cState of Affairs\u201d stars Alfre Woodard as the president and Katherine Heigl as her trusted CIA analyst \u2014 and almost daughter-in-law (don\u2019t ask), while \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d pictures T\u00e9a Leoni as a Secretary of State miraculously balancing work and family. Women reign in court: Kate Walsh is a \u201cBad Judge,\u201d tough on the bench by day, wild on the party circuit by night. And women rule at law school: Viola Davis inspires fear in students, teaching them \u201cHow to Get Away with Murder.\u201d\n\nSome series hope to gain traction from star power and known quantities. \u201cRed Band Society\u201d on Fox parallels the popular book and film \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d a worthy weeper for teens.\n\nExpect more daring subject matter outside of the commercial networks, notably Jeffrey Tambor (\u201cArrested Development\u201d) as a father transitioning male-to-female on Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d a courageous, sincere dramedy; \u201cThe Affair,\u201d a 10-episode drama from Showtime offering male-female perspectives on an extramarital hookup; and the latest from Ken Burns, a 14-hour triple biography of Theodore, Eleanor and Franklin on PBS, \u201cThe Roosevelts.\u201d\n\nThe Top 10:\n\n1. \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d CW (Oct. 13)\n\n2. \u201cBlack-ish\u201d ABC (Sept. 24)\n\n3. \u201cTransparent\u201d Amazon (Sept. 26)\n\n4. \u201cThe Affair\u201d Showtime (Oct. 12)\n\n5. \u201cRed Band Society\u201d Fox (Sept. 17)\n\n6. \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d PBS (Sept. 14)\n\n7. \u201cThe Flash\u201d CW (Oct. 7)\n\n8. \u201cGotham\u201d Fox (Sept. 22)\n\n9. \u201cHow to Get Away with Murder\u201d ABC (Sept. 25)\n\n10. \u201cCristela\u201d ABC (Oct. 10)\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp\n\nSix nights of newcomers\n\nMonday\n\n\u201cGotham\u201d Fox Sept. 22 \u2014 The very dark Batman-origin story from Bruno Heller (\u201cRome,\u201d \u201cThe Mentalist\u201d), full of hints about future heroes and villains \u2014 see how the Penguin became the Penguin, and so on. Ben McKenzie is Detective James Gordon. Jada Pinkett Smith is the standout as a new villain. You don\u2019t have to know the Bruce Wayne backstory, but it helps.\n\n\u201cScorpion\u201dCBS Sept. 22 \u2014 The geek ensemble shall inherit the Earth. Genius misfits are recruited to solve the world\u2019s problems, while Katharine McPhee (\u201cGlee\u201d) serves to help them \u2014 and her and her genius son \u2014 cope with everyday life. Imagine \u201cMacGyver\u201d meets \u201cBig Bang\u201d as a drama.\n\n\u201cJane the Virgin\u201dCW Oct. 13 \u2014 The best surprise of the season. Gina Rodriguez is a breakout star in this winning dramedy adapted from a telenovela about Hispanic family culture. Accidentally inseminated by her doctor, the devout Jane (Rodriguez) must navigate family, religion and boyfriend. Grandma speaks Spanish (with English subtitles), while her daughter and granddaughter respond to her in English. Edgy and demure at once, it both knocks and embraces the telenovela form.\n\n\u201cState of Affairs\u201d NBC Nov. 17 \u2014 Built on too many coincidences and the premise that a woman can\u2019t hold a high-pressure job and be a wife and mom at the same time. In this case, Katherine Heigl (\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d) is a CIA analyst whose fianc\u00e9, the president\u2019s son, is deceased from the start. She\u2019s the right hand to the president (Alfre Woodard), her not-quite mother-in-law. Heigl wants very much to be taken seriously, but her effort is distracting.\n\nTuesday\n\n\u201cUtopia\u201dFox Sept. 7 \u2014 With a Sunday start, then moving to Tuesday, the reality series aims to hook NFL viewers. Fifteen wildly different strangers must form a society from scratch. Libertarian, pansexual, hillbilly, Manhattan snob\u2026 it\u2019s all in the casting, of course.\n\n\u201cThe Flash\u201d CW Oct. 7 \u2014 A promising comic-book adaptation that is more optimistic and full of humanity than most. Grant Gustin (\u201cGlee,\u201d \u201c90210\u201d) plays forensic scientist Barry Allen, who becomes the costumed fastest-man-alive and crimefighter thanks to a freak accident. With Jesse L. Martin (\u201cLaw & Order\u201d) and Tom Cavanagh (\u201cEd\u201d). A worthy spinoff of \u201cThe Arrow\u201d from producers Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg and another positive surprise from CW.\n\n\u201cSelfie\u201d ABC Sept. 30 \u2014 Karen Gillan is the draw as Eliza Dooley, a social-media addict who realizes she has no real friends. John Cho as Henry will teach her etiquette. Cute idea for a romcom, but where does it go after the pilot? Also, why won\u2019t ABC let Gillan use her lovely native Scottish accent?\n\n\u201cManhattan Love Story\u201dABC Sept. 30 \u2014 What he\u2019s thinking versus what she\u2019s thinking. Jeff Lowell (\u201cThe Drew Carey Show\u201d) has created a retrograde romcom about the battle of the sexes: He\u2019s obsessed with boobs, she\u2019s obsessed with purses. The gimmick feels old by the end of the first act.\n\n\u201cNCIS: New Orleans\u201d CBS Sept. 23 \u2014 Scott Bakula leads the latest spinoff of the long-lived procedural brand. Expect Mark Harmon and company to do crossover episodes to launch the new hour.\n\n\u201cMarry Me\u201dNBC Oct. 14 \u2014 Will the real-life romance of Casey Wilson (\u201cHappy Endings\u201d) and Ken Marino (\u201cParty Down\u201d) be enough to sustain this romcom from the creator of \u201cHappy Endings\u201d? There are some very funny moments here, but they might not be enough.\n\n\u201cForever\u201d ABC Sept. 23 \u2014 Think \u201cQuincy M.E.\u201d plus naked Welshman. Ioan Gruffudd is a hunk as a deathless New York medical examiner, solving crimes and living forever. Each time he dies he\u2019s reborn, naked, in a body of water. Only his buddy, played by Judd Hirsch, knows his secret. If only Jack Klugman had been prettier\u2026\n\nWednesday\n\n\u201cThe Mysteries of Laura\u201d NBC Sept. 17 \u2014 Another embarrassment for Debra Messing (\u201cSmash\u201d), who plays a detective with twin boys. Cleaning up crime, cleaning up grime. Another \u201chaving it all\u201d hour about women trying to hold serious jobs while serving as homemakers, apparently the miracle of the millennium.\n\n\u201cRed Band Society\u201d Fox Sept. 17 \u2014 A soulful ensemble drama about teens with long-term illnesses living in a hospital. With Octavia Spencer (\u201cThe Help\u201d) as a tough-love nurse, Dave Annabel (\u201cBrothers and Sisters\u201d) as a doctor, and more including Wilson Cruz and Griffin Dunne. It\u2019s not unrelentingly sad: \u201cI had a brother who was in a coma,\u201d creator Margaret Nagle told critics, \u201cand I grew up in pediatric hospitals.\u201d She aims to replicate \u201cthe black humor, the fun, the getting to know the kids that you would never know in any other situation\u201d and uplifting spirit. \u201cSo yes,\u201d she said, \u201cthere are serious things that these kids are going to have to face, but it is not a show that has a body count.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack-ish\u201d ABC Sept. 24 \u2014 How to hold on to cultural identity in assimilated America? What to do when your African-American son wants a Bar Mitzvah? Anthony Anderson ponders these questions in this promising comedy about a contemporary American family dealing with race, specifically mixed race. Tracee Ellis Ross (\u201cGirlfriends\u201d) is terrific as his wife. Laurence Fishburne is hilariously cranky as his dad. From executive producer Larry Wilmore and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model\u201d co-creator Kenya Barris.\n\n\u201cStalker\u201dCBS Oct. 1 \u2014 Possibly the worst pilot of the season, a senselessly violent peep show from Kevin Williamson, from whom we expect better. Dylan McDermott and Maggie Q play LAPD detectives specializing in stalking cases.\n\nThursday\n\n\u201cGracepoint\u201d Fox Oct. 2 \u2014 The American adaptation of the terrific Brit hit \u201cBroadchurch.\u201d David Tennant reprises his role (this time with an American accent); Anna Gunn plays his fellow detective. Fox promises different twists than the original.\n\n\u201cBad Judge\u201d NBC Oct. 2 \u2014 Kate Walsh is the tough criminal judge by day, hard-partying girl by night whose life/heart may be changed when a young boy needs a home\u2026. Ridiculously over the top, from Funny or Die\u2019s Adam McKay and Will Ferrell. Can\u2019t imagine watching the second episode.\n\n\u201cThe McCarthys\u201dCBS Oct. 30 \u2014 Laurie Metcalf and Jack McGee lead a solid cast as a yelling Boston Irish family. Loud and sitcom-y, but funny. The sports-crazed family doesn\u2019t know what to make of gay son Ronny, played by Tyler Ritter (son of John Ritter).\n\n\u201cA to Z\u201d NBC Oct. 2 \u2014 Ben Feldman (\u201cMad Men\u201d) and Cristin Milioti (\u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d) are appealing as singles Andrew and Zelda in another romcom about the peculiarities of dating in the Internet age. The timeline of the couple\u2019s relationship is narrated by Katey Sagal.\n\n\u201cHow to Get Away with Murder\u201d ABC Sept. 25 \u2014 Viola Davis plays an intimidating law-school prof who, along with her students, becomes embroiled in a murder case. Shonda Rhimes has created a star vehicle for Davis, but her character is very much a mystery \u2014 even confusing. \u201cI hope they wonder about what her real motivations are throughout the whole season,\u201d said producer Peter Nowalk.\n\nFriday\n\n\u201cCristela\u201d ABC Oct. 10 \u2014 Cristela Alonzo grew up on the Texas-Mexico border, raised by a single mom who spoke no English. They were squatters in an abandoned diner. She knows whereof she speaks in this up-by-the-bootstraps comedy based on her life, which addresses issues of immigration and class with smart humor. As the title character, she plays a striver going on her sixth year in law school who works as an unpaid intern at a law firm.\n\n\u201cConstantine\u201d NBC Oct. 24 \u2014 An adaptation of DC Comics\u2019 \u201cHellblazer,\u201d with Matt Ryan (\u201cCriminal Minds\u201d) as demon hunter and master of the occult John Constantine. With Lucy Griffiths. Lots of supernatural action, less character development.\n\nSaturday\n\nReport to your DVR. No new series premiere on Saturdays, so it\u2019s catch-up time.\n\nSunday\n\n\u201cMadam Secretary\u201dCBS Sept. 21 \u2014 T\u00e9a Leoni navigates global politics, office politics and her home life as secretary of state after inheriting the office from someone who died. The idea came to exec producer Lori McCreary during the Benghazi hearings. Asked about any similarities to Hillary Clinton, writer Barbara Hall joked that season 4 switches to \u201cMadam President.\u201d\n\n\u201cMulaney\u201d Fox Oct. 5 \u2014 A mishmash of a comedy about a comedian and the world he inhabits. A vehicle for stand-up comic John Mulaney (\u201cKroll Show\u201d) with Martin Short, Nasim Pedrad (\u201cSNL\u201d), Elliott Gould, Seaton Smith (\u201cTotally Biased\u201d), Zack Pearlman (\u201cThe Virginity Hit\u201d) and guests Penny Marshall and Lorraine Bracco. Producer Lorne Michaels recruits everyone who owes him, and it\u2019s still not funny.\n\n\u201cThe Affair\u201d Showtime Oct. 12 \u2014 A 10-episode drama from the producers of \u201cIn Treatment.\u201d A tense, emotional ride with shifting his/her perspectives on an extramarital affair. Dominic West (\u201cThe Wire\u201d), Ruth Wilson (\u201cLuther\u201d), Maura Tierney and Joshua Jackson make it sizzle.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fall 2014 TV: Comic-book heroes, minorities, strong women and a virgin", "title": "Fall 2014 TV: Comic-book heroes, minorities, strong women and a virgin", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/09/fall-2014-tv-comic-book-heroes-minorities-strong-women-and-a-virgin-2/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140909__AE14TVFALL-001p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140909__AE14TVFALL-001p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-09T10:36:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:02:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cRed Band Society\u201d Fox Sept. 17 \u2014 A soulful ensemble drama about teens with long-term illnesses living in a hospital.\nFriday\u201cCristela\u201d ABC Oct. 10 \u2014 Cristela Alonzo grew up on the Texas-Mexico border, raised by a single mom who spoke no English.\n\u201cSelfie\u201d ABC Sept. 30 \u2014 Karen Gillan is the draw as Eliza Dooley, a social-media addict who realizes she has no real friends.\n\u201cBlack-ish\u201d ABC (Sept. 24)3.\n\u201cConstantine\u201d NBC Oct. 24 \u2014 An adaptation of DC Comics\u2019 \u201cHellblazer,\u201d with Matt Ryan (\u201cCriminal Minds\u201d) as demon hunter and master of the occult John Constantine."}
