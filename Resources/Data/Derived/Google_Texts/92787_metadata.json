YouTube: Beyonce\n\nThanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Taylon \u2014 who is terminally ill with brain cancer \u2014 got the chance of a lifetime. The brave young girl danced with singer Beyonc\u00e9 on her Mrs. Carter Tour stop in Las Vegas, Nev., this month. \"They found an inoperable tumor on her brain, and her dying wish was to dance with Beyonc\u00e9,\" said Ivy McGregor, of Philanthropy Program Partnerships in the video posted on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s YouTube.\n\n\"I am having so much fun. I can't wait to see Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d Taylon said. And some time later, her wish came true. In a tight-fitting, blue sequined jumpsuit, Beyonc\u00e9 came down from the stage, hugged, and kissed Taylon, who was seated stage-side in a wheelchair. The singer even wiped the girl\u2019s tears as she returned to the stage to perform her next song. Fittingly, she sang the Destiny\u2019s Child hit \u201cSurvivor,\u201d and Taylon rose from her seat to sing along. They danced together, and Taylon was visibly moved by the singer\u2019s tribute.\n\nThe women from Philanthropy Program partnerships, who accompanied Taylon to the show, were equally moved.\n\n\"Here's a little girl literally fighting for her life,\" McGregor said. \"'Tomorrow's not promised, next week's not promised, but right now I'm here,' and her thought that will forever stay with me is 'since I'm here I might as well live.'\"\n\nCheck out the touching video below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "beyonce, terminally ill fan, taylon", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Singer Beyonc\u00e9 made brain cancer patient Taylon's dream come true when she danced with the young girl at her Las Vegas show this month.", "title": "Terminally Ill Fan Rises From Wheelchair To Dance With Beyonc\u00e9  [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/beyonce-dances-terminally-ill-fan-cancer-patient-taylon-rises-wheelchair-dance-singer-video-265835", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/26/beyonce-taylon-horiz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Singer Beyonc\u00e9 made brain cancer patient Taylon's dream come true when she danced with the young girl at her Las Vegas show this month.", "title": "Terminally Ill Fan Rises From Wheelchair To Dance With Beyonc\u00e9  [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/beyonce-dances-terminally-ill-fan-cancer-patient-taylon-rises-wheelchair-dance-singer-video-265835", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/26/beyonce-taylon-horiz.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/26/beyonce-taylon-horiz.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-12-26T18:20:23-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-26T18:20:22-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Singer Beyonc\u00e9 made brain cancer patient Taylon's dream come true when she danced with the young girl at her Las Vegas show this month."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bda\"", "article_summary": "Singer Beyonc\u00e9 made brain cancer patient Taylon's dream come true when she danced with the young girl at her Las Vegas show this month.\nThe brave young girl danced with singer Beyonc\u00e9 on her Mrs. Carter Tour stop in Las Vegas, Nev., this month.\nI can't wait to see Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d Taylon said.\nYouTube: BeyonceThanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Taylon \u2014 who is terminally ill with brain cancer \u2014 got the chance of a lifetime.\nIn a tight-fitting, blue sequined jumpsuit, Beyonc\u00e9 came down from the stage, hugged, and kissed Taylon, who was seated stage-side in a wheelchair."}
