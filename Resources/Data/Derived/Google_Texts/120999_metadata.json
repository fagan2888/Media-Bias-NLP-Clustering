But both Mitch McConnell and Alison Lundergan Grimes have been avoiding the issues that are before us,\u201d says Bevin.\n\n\u201cThese are serious issues and these are serious times, and yet both of my opponents in this race are acting like this is a race for 8th grade class president, not for U.S. Senate representing Kentucky. We need to elevate the tenor of this campaign\u201d\n\nPerhaps underscoring Bevin\u2019s point, the McConnell campaign preempted his policy speech Thursday morning with a video making fun of their primary opponent.\n\nWatch:\n\nBevin says he differs from McConnell most on government spending, financial policy and ways to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Those in attendance railed against McConnell\u2019s vote for the TARP bailout in 2008, for instance.\n\nMcConnell has been one of the leading critics of the president\u2019s health care law, however. Just recently the GOP leader proposed an amendment to the unemployment insurance bill to delay the individual mandate by one year.\n\nBevin\u2019s campaign argues that isn\u2019t enough and that McConnell failed to support Tea Party-leaning senators such as Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah who sought to de-fund the law last year. In fact, many conservative activists at Bevin\u2019s campaign events noted reports of McConnell working against Cruz during the lead up to the government shutdown.\n\nIn terms of reforming the country\u2019s health care system Bevin favors tort reform and allowing citizen to purchase insurance plans across state lines. He supports a permanent ban on earmarks and backs the REINS Act, which would give Congress the authority to overturn regulations costing over $100 million.\n\nThe Louisville businessman also opposes the National Security Agency\u2019s collection of phone data, saying it is time to end \u201cwarrantless wiretapping\u201d on law-abiding citizens.\n\nMcConnell and Bevin do have similar views on some issues such as their support of the coal industry and criticism of the Obama administration\u2019s environmental regulations.\n\nMuch like the argument against Grimes, the senator\u2019s team says this comes down to who can maneuver for Kentucky best in Washington. When confronted with what he would do differently, Bevin says McConnell has changed and has become ineffectual as a conservative leader.\n\n\u201cThe difference is some people just talk and some people will actually act,\u201d he says. \u201cMitch McConnell has 30 years of talking a big game, but the proof is in the pudding. I ask the voters of Kentucky to take a hard look at whether or not his talk has actually translated into much action.\u201d\n\nJust this week, however, the president of the Kentucky Coal Association credited McConnell\u2019s leadership with helping the struggling industry. And McConnell\u2019s office points out the senator played a role in helping a state group apply for the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cPromised Zones\u201d program.\n\nBut Bevin maintains if elected he can accomplish things McConnell cannot by standing up rather than cutting deals.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t question the sincerity with which (McConnell) initially went to Washington. I\u2019ve always voted for him in the past. I\u2019ve always felt he was the better choice,\u201d he says. \u201cI no longer think that he represents the people of Kentucky. He now just talks in a way that he thinks will allow him to get re-elected. He doesn\u2019t seem to care or even know what it is what we care about here in Kentucky.\u201d\n\nRead Bevin\u2019s full speech here:\n\nMatt Bevin Speech: A Path Forward for Kentucky", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Saying the Republican Party needs to adopt a new vision, U.S. Senate candidate Matt Bevin is hoping to shift Kentucky's race to issues, rather than...", "title": "Republican Senate Candidate Matt Bevin Outlines Key Differences With Mitch McConnell - 89.3 WFPL", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 637, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/McConnellBevin.jpg", "height": 389}, "updated_time": "2014-10-14T11:55:03-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/republican-senate-candidate-matt-bevin-outlines-key-differences-mitch-mcconnell/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Saying the Republican Party needs to adopt a new vision, U.S. Senate candidate Matt Bevin is hoping to shift Kentucky's race to issues, rather than...", "creator": "@WFPLNews", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/McConnellBevin.jpg", "title": "Republican Senate Candidate Matt Bevin Outlines Key Differences With Mitch McConnell - 89.3 WFPL", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-01-09T14:29:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-14T11:55:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde7cf\"", "article_summary": "But both Mitch McConnell and Alison Lundergan Grimes have been avoiding the issues that are before us,\u201d says Bevin.\nSaying the Republican Party needs to adopt a new vision, U.S. Senate candidate Matt Bevin is hoping to shift Kentucky\u2019s race to issues, rather than surface-level politics and attacks.\nWhen confronted with what he would do differently, Bevin says McConnell has changed and has become ineffectual as a conservative leader.\nThe Tea Party-backed Bevin has often given speeches focusing on policy, and he decried Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes for failing to discuss them in-depth.\nHe doesn\u2019t seem to care or even know what it is what we care about here in Kentucky.\u201dRead Bevin\u2019s full speech here:Matt Bevin Speech: A Path Forward for Kentucky"}
