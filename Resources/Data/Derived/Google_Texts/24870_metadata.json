Dyslexie uses scientific data to facilitate the reading experience for individuals struggling with word and letter recognition. Developed by Dutch graphic designer Christian Boer, the new typeface forgoes aesthetic qualities for heightened legibility and perception.\n\n\u201cTraditional fonts are designed purely from an aesthetic point of view, meaning that they frequently have characteristics which make some or all of their letters difficult for dyslexics to read,\u201d the developers write on StudioStudio Graphic Design. \u201cSufferers of dyslexia often find themselves jumbling up the letters of a word, or inverting and flipping some letters because they look too familiar.\u201d\n\nDyslexie addresses this problem by emphasizing each letter\u2019s integrity and uniqueness. Semi-italics and varying tail-lengths are some of the tools used to ensure a clarified distinction between letters in sequence. In addition, a pronounced baseline reduces the likelihood of word inversion.\n\nBesides independent surveys, the typeface has been the subject of formal academic inquiry. In a study conducted by researchers at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, the font promoted legibility for dyslexics, reducing the likelihood of reading errors. Compared to stock fonts like Arial, Dyslexie showed a clear advantage.\n\n\u201c[The study showed] a decrease in the reading errors when dyslexics read words that where printed in the font \u2018Dyslexie.\u2019\u201d study author Renske de Leeuw writes. \u201cThis is an indication that reading with the font \u2018Dyslexie\u2019 decreases the reading errors.\u201d\n\nAccording to the developers of the typeface, the innovation has also galvanized the publishing industry. With Dyslexie, the literary world may find a way to connect with audiences traditionally considered out of reach. If implemented, the font could boost profits for both small presses and international publishing houses.\n\nIf you suffer from dyslexia, or know someone who does, check out the video below to find out more about the typeface and its potential.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dyslexia font, dyslexia typeface, dyslexie, christian boer, studiostudio font, renske de leeuw", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "'Dyslexie' reduces reading errors by emphasizing the integrity and clarity of each letter, making sequences easier to follow.", "title": "New Typeface 'Dyslexie' Helps Dyslexics Overcome Reading Difficulties [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-typeface-dyslexie-helps-dyslexics-overcome-reading-difficulties-font-increases-perception-and", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/01/dyslexia.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Dyslexie' reduces reading errors by emphasizing the integrity and clarity of each letter, making sequences easier to follow.", "title": "New Typeface 'Dyslexie' Helps Dyslexics Overcome Reading Difficulties [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-typeface-dyslexie-helps-dyslexics-overcome-reading-difficulties-font-increases-perception-and", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/01/dyslexia.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/01/dyslexia.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2013-09-01T15:22:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-01T16:12:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "'Dyslexie' reduces reading errors by emphasizing the integrity and clarity of each letter, making sequences easier to follow."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb044\"", "article_summary": "\u201c[The study showed] a decrease in the reading errors when dyslexics read words that where printed in the font \u2018Dyslexie.\u2019\u201d study author Renske de Leeuw writes.\n\u201cThis is an indication that reading with the font \u2018Dyslexie\u2019 decreases the reading errors.\u201dAccording to the developers of the typeface, the innovation has also galvanized the publishing industry.\nA new typeface may change the way dyslexics with online and computer-based media.\nCompared to stock fonts like Arial, Dyslexie showed a clear advantage.\nDyslexie uses scientific data to facilitate the reading experience for individuals struggling with word and letter recognition."}
