( Heidi de Marco/KHN )\n\nPsychiatric hospitalizations of Latino children and young adults in California are rising dramatically \u2014 at a much faster pace than among their white and black peers, according to state data.\n\nWhile mental health hospitalizations of young people of all ethnicities have climbed in recent years, Latino rates stand out. Among those 21 and younger, they shot up 86 percent, to 17,813, between 2007 and 2014, according to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. That\u2019s compared with a 21 percent increase among whites and 35 percent among African Americans.\n\n\u2018Everybody\u2019s trying to hire Spanish-speaking clinicians. There\u2019s just not enough to meet that demand.\u201d Leslie Preston, the behavioral health director of La Cl\u00ednica de La Raza\n\n\n\nNo one knows for certain what\u2019s driving the trend. Policymakers and Latino community leaders offer varying and sometimes contradictory explanations. Some say the numbers reflect a lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health services for Latinos and a pervasive stigma that prevents many from seeking help before a crisis hits.\n\n\u201cOften, they wait until they are falling apart,\u201d said Dr. Sergio Aguilar-Gaxiola, a professor at the University of California, Davis Medical School and director of the university\u2019s Center for Reducing Health Disparities.\n\nOthers blame stress from the recent recession, family disintegration and an influx of traumatized children fleeing poverty and violence in Central America.\n\nStill others suggest the trend might actually be positive, reflecting an increasing willingness among Latino parents to seek treatment for themselves and their children, at least when they are in crisis.\n\nAmong Latino adults, psychiatric hospitalizations rose 38 percent during the same period. Similar hospitalizations of black adults increased 21 percent, while hospitalizations of white adults remained flat.\n\nMargarita Rocha, the executive director of the nonprofit Centro la Familia in Fresno, said mental health issues are starting to be discussed more publicly in the Latino community.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s helping people to come forward,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKen Berrick, CEO of the Seneca Family of Agencies, which serves children with emotional disturbances in a dozen counties, agreed. Because more Latinos are now getting mental health services, children are more likely to be identified as requiring hospitalization, he said.\n\n\u201cI know for a fact that access to service is better now,\u201d said Berrick, whose operation has a crisis stabilization unit in Alameda County, Calif.\n\nKids\u2019 psychiatric hospitalizations overall rose nearly 45 percent between 2007 and 2014, regardless of ethnicity, a pattern experts attribute to various factors including a shortage of intensive outpatient and in-home services, schools\u2019 struggles to pay for mental health services through special education and a decline in group home placements.\n\n\u201cThose kids have to be treated somewhere,\u201d said Dawan Utecht, Fresno County\u2019s mental health director, of the move to keep kids out of group homes.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t get those services in a community setting, they\u2019re going to go into crisis.\u201d\n\nThe rise among Latino youths is remarkable in part because hospitalization rates for that population historically have been relatively low.\n\nLatino children remain much less likely to receive mental health treatment through Medi-Cal, the state and federal coverage program for poor and disabled residents. Between 2010 and 2014, less than 4 percent of Latino children received specialty mental health services through the traditional Medi-Cal program. That\u2019s compared with 7 percent of eligible black and white children, according to state data. The numbers don\u2019t include those enrolled in managed care.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders seek treatment at a rate even lower than Latinos. Although hospitalizations are also increasing rapidly among that population, the raw numbers remain relatively small.)\n\nLeslie Preston, the behavioral health director of La Cl\u00ednica de La Raza, in East Oakland, says that the shortage of bilingual, bicultural mental health workers limits Latino kids\u2019 access to preventive care, which could lead to crises later on.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to hire the Spanish-speaking clinicians,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough clinicians to meet that demand.\u201d\n\nAccess to care can be even harder for recent immigrants. Spanish-speaking children who have been referred for a special education assessment, which can help them become eligible for mental health services, sometimes wait months or years before someone tests them, she said.\n\n\u201cThe families don\u2019t know the system,\u201d she added. \u201cThey don\u2019t know their rights.\u201d\n\nOther clinicians point to relatively low health insurance coverage among Latinos, particularly those without legal status, and a cultural resistance to acknowledging mental illness.\n\nDr. Alok Banga, medical director at Sierra Vista Hospital in Sacramento, said some immigrant parents he encounters don\u2019t believe in mental illness and have not grasped the urgency of their children\u2019s depression and past suicide attempts. Many are working two or three jobs, he said. Some are undocumented immigrants afraid of coming to the hospital or having any interaction with Child Protective Services.\n\nBut the biggest problem, from his perspective, is the shortage of child psychiatrists and outpatient services to serve this population.\n\n\u201cThe default course for treatment falls on institutions: hospitals, jails and prisons,\u201d he said.\n\nJeff Rackmil, director of the children\u2019s system of care in Alameda County, said sheer population growth \u2014 particularly, an increase in Latino children insured under Medi-Cal \u2014 may also be part of the explanation for the rise in hospitalizations.\n\nYet the state\u2019s Latino population aged 24 and under increased less than 8 percent between 2007 and 2014, which doesn\u2019t nearly explain an 86 percent increase in hospitalizations.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome California communities are working to bring more Latino children into care and to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness.\n\nAt Life Academy of Health and Bioscience, a small, mostly Latino high school in East Oakland, students grow up amid pervasive violence and poverty. \u201cWe\u2019re just told to hold things in,\u201d said 17-year-old Hilda Chavez, a senior.\n\nStudents often don\u2019t seek help because they fear discussing mental health problems will earn them a label of \u201ccrazy,\u201d Chavez said.\n\nLast year, the school, in conjunction with the Oakland-based La Cl\u00ednica de La Raza, started a program to interest students in careers in mental health care. The program provides training in \u201cfirst aid\u201d instruction to help people in crisis, and places students in internships with mental health organizations.\n\nNubia Flores Miranda, 18, participated in the program last year and now is majoring in psychology at San Francisco State University. Miranda said she became interested in a career in mental health after she experienced depression and anxiety during her freshman year at Life Academy.\n\nSeeing a school counselor \u201cchanged my life around,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she saw that her peers were wary of seeking help from counselors at the school, most of whom were white and lived in wealthier, safer neighborhoods. Once, when a classmate started acting out at school, Miranda suggested she talk to someone.\n\n\u201cShe told me she didn\u2019t feel like she could trust the person \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t understand where she was coming from,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shortage of services is especially evident in the Central Valley, where many agricultural workers are Latino. Juan Garcia, an emeritus professor at California State University, Fresno, who founded a counseling center in the city, says the drought and economic downturn have exacerbated depression, anxiety, substance abuse and psychotic breaks among Latinos of all ages.\n\n\u201cThe services to this population lag decades behind where they should be,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Fresno County, psychiatric hospitalizations of Latino youth more than tripled, to 432, between 2007 and 2014. Hospitalizations of their white and black peers about doubled.\n\nLiliana Quintero Robles, a marriage and family therapy intern in rural Kings County, also in the state\u2019s Central Valley, said she sees children whose mental health issues go untreated for so long that they end up cutting themselves and abusing alcohol, marijuana, crystal meth and OxyContin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some really, really deep-rooted suffering,\u201d she said.\n\nOut in the unincorporated agricultural community of Five Points, about 45 minutes from Fresno, almost all of the students at Westside Elementary School are low-income Latinos. When principal Baldo Hernandez started there in 1981, he\u2019d see maybe one child a year with a mental health issue. These days, he sees 15 to 30, he said.\n\nHe blames dry wells and barren fields, at least in part.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had parents crying at school, begging me to find them a home, begging me to find them a job,\u201d he said.\n\nIn some parts of the Valley and other places, the closest hospitals that accept children in psychiatric crises are hours away. Children can be stuck in emergency room hallways for days, waiting for a hospital bed.\n\n\u201cIt makes for a very traumatized experience for both families and children,\u201d said Shannyn McDonald, the chief of the Stanislaus County behavioral health department\u2019s children\u2019s system of care.\n\nRecently, the county expanded its promotora program, which enlists members of the Latino community to talk to their peers about mental health.\n\nIn the small town of Oakdale, a slim, energetic 51-year-old promotora named Rossy Gomar spends 60 to 70 hours a week serving as cheerleader, educator and sounding board for many of the Latino women and children in the town.\n\n\n\n\n\nGomar\u2019s office in the Oakdale Family Support Network Resource Center is cluttered with open boxes of diapers and donated children\u2019s toys and clothing.\n\n\u201cLook at my office,\u201d she laughs. \u201cWe don\u2019t fit.\u201d\n\nGomar says many of the women she works with don\u2019t recognize that they are depressed or abused. Children see their parents\u2019 problems and don\u2019t know where to turn for help.\n\n\u201cThere are many young people who don\u2019t have any hope,\u201d she said.\n\nBut little by little, she has seen some good results.\n\nOne 17-year-old client is a student at Oakdale High School. The girl, whose name is being withheld to protect her privacy, said that earlier this year, problems at school and a break-up with her boyfriend had her struggling to get out of bed each morning. She began drinking, using drugs and thinking about suicide. She was scared to talk to her parents, she said, and kept everything inside.\n\nOne day, she walked into Gomar\u2019s office and started crying.\n\n\u201cShe told me \u2018Everything is ok. We want you here,\u2019\u201d the girl said. \u201cWhen I was talking with her, I felt so much better.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No one knows for sure what's driving the trend.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Big Rise in Psychiatric Hospitalizations for California's Latino Youth\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/01\\/big-rise-in-psychiatric-hospitalizations-for-californias-latino-youth\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-01 10:53:17\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-01 11:14:26\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":155373,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Latino Health\",\"Mental Health\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/latino-kids-3.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "No one knows for sure what's driving the trend.", "title": "Big Rise in Psychiatric Hospitalizations for California\u2019s Latino Youth", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/01/big-rise-in-psychiatric-hospitalizations-for-californias-latino-youth/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/students-9-400x267.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "latino health,mental health,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "While mental health hospitalizations of young people of all ethnicities have climbed in recent years, Latino rates stand out.\nThe program provides training in mental health first aid and places students in internships with mental health organizations.\nBecause more Latinos are now getting mental health services, children are more likely to be identified as requiring hospitalization, he said.\nBetween 2010 and 2014, less than 4 percent of Latino children received specialty mental health services through the traditional Medi-Cal program.\nIn Fresno County, psychiatric hospitalizations of Latino youth more than tripled, to 432, between 2007 and 2014."}
