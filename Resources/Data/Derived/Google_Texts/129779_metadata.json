So I helped him write an essay. Apologies, Justice Scalia, if I didn\u2019t read your mind precisely right.\n\nI now present to you \u201cReading the Mind of Justice Scalia,\u201d by LawProfBlawg.\n\nI\u2019m so mad I could spit.\n\nWhen I think about the Affordable Care Act and same sex marriage decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, I could just spit.\n\nWhether it is the jiggery-pokery of the majority\u2019s interpretation of the Affordable Care Act, a sheer hodge-podge of supercalifragilisticexpialidocious activism, or the egotistical hubris of the humdingery of the bippo-no-bungus arguments hinted at in the majority\u2019s substantive due process arguments in same-sex marriage, they portend deeply troubling times for American democracy.\n\nWe were having a perfectly lovely discussion of same sex marriage, and the majority ruined it. It was very much like watching pro wrestling. Sure, there were people killed and beaten, but this is not of immense personal importance to me. It is not as if the decision made me wear a barbaloot suit or something.\n\nWhat troubles me is who rules me. NO one rules me. That\u2019s who. But I\u2019m tired of writing scathing dissents. I want to write majority opinions, darn it. When I write the opinion, it is based upon STRICT TEXTUALIST interpretation. Specifically, I stare at the text, and its meaning leaps out to me. I am the sole decider of text. Those egotistical justices in the majority don\u2019t get that. That\u2019s clear from its contortionist ACA decision in King. It makes me so mad I want to bang my head against a truffula tree.\n\nI mean, I sat there with Alito. We sat there we two. And we said, \u201cOh, I wish we had a decision or two. Too conservative for R.B. Goldberg, too textualist for Kennedy, too gruff for Breyer, and for Sotomayor too fiffer-feffer-fuff.\u201d\n\nGay means happy. That\u2019s what it meant at the time of the founding fathers and it still means that today. Let me be clear. I\u2019m not gay. I\u2019m not happy in any sense of the term (as I can find in the 100 dictionaries in my possession). You can\u2019t just write into the Constitution something that didn\u2019t exist.\n\nIf you believe in democracy, you should be incensed with the Court\u2019s decision in Obergefell. Same-sex marriage came. Despite my protestations, somehow it came just the same. As I stand here with my feet ice cold as the snow, I ask myself: How can it be so? It came without statute. It came without text. It came without dictionary, constitutional amendment, or context. I keep puzzling and puzzling \u2018til my puzzler is sore, and then I think: The majority is an egotistical bore!\n\nAs I said, I\u2019m deeply concerned about a majority of nine justices deciding the fate of American democracy in a way I wasn\u2019t in Bush v. Gore or Citizens United. Upon what basis has the majority determined that all of a sudden something exists in the Constitution that didn\u2019t before? It was like Justice Horton heard a Who!\n\nI\u2019m going to skip over the discomfort that talking about decisions of the 1960s might cause me. Or about Citizens United or Bush v. Gore. I don\u2019t want angry calls on my whisper-ma-phone.\n\nLawProfBlawg is an anonymous professor at a top 100 law school. You can see more of his musings here.
