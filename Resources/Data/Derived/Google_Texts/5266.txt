Jon Stewart, the recently retired host of “The Daily Show,” exhorted Congress on Wednesday to permanently extend a law providing treatment and compensation to rescue workers who were injured or sickened by the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

The bill, which is set to start expiring next month, has long been a favored cause of the comedian, whose shows in 2010 criticizing the law’s Republican opponents and showcasing emergency medical workers with health problems helped prompt its passage.

The law, called the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, pledged federal money for the health care of rescue workers who had for years been forced to depend on mix of short-term federal, city and private money.

With rescue workers and advocates growing nervous that they will be left shouldering the burden for expensive treatment, a bearded Mr. Stewart, flanked by law enforcement officials and New York lawmakers, spoke at a rally in front of the United States Capitol.

“I want to apologize to all the men and women, first responders, that you had to come down here today,” he said. “I’m embarrassed. I’m embarrassed for our country. I’m embarrassed for New York.

“I’m embarrassed that you, after serving so selflessly with such heroism, have to come down here and convince people to do what’s right for the illnesses and difficulties that you suffered because of your heroism and because of your selflessness.”

Mr. Stewart and the emergency workers planned to talk to lawmakers in meetings on Wednesday. Before that, the comedian warned them about what they might face in the halls of Congress.

“Today on the Hill, you will be exposed to possibly toxic levels” of arrogance and other unpleasant fumes, he said, using a word that became the theme of his last “Daily Show” monologue.
