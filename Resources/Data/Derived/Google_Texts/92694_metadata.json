For 47-years Wise has been mixing drugs, doling out advice and offering service at his Laurel Pharmacy. Wise will be closing the pharmacy and retiring. Hans Gutknecht/Staff Photographer\n\nPACOIMA >> Barry Wise trundled up to the back door of his shop, turned a key in the lock, and stepped into the Pacoima drugstore he\u2019d owned and operated for nearly 50 years.\n\nHe\u2019d served generations of families from his Laurel Pharmacy. He\u2019d run the once go-to store for prescriptions to cosmetics within the San Fernando Valley\u2019s historic community of minorities. He\u2019d been robbed at gunpoint more times than he could remember and had dispensed soothing advice and medicine more times than he could recall.\n\nAnd now the 76-year-old druggist was about to call it quits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be gone, that\u2019s the part that hurts,\u201d said Wise, setting down a McDonald\u2019s coffee and muffin as he gazed around his drugstore a recent morning before it opened. \u201cI wanted there to be a store here. I\u2019ve had three generations of customers \u2014 from parents to kids to their kids.\n\n\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t find a buyer, so it\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nThe Laurel Pharmacy on the corner of Van Nuys Boulevard and Rincon Avenue has for at least six decades stood as a community provider of drugs, whatnots and essential miscellany.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, it will fill its last prescription. Rite Aid will buy its remaining merchandise and pill bottles, while seeking to recruit its remaining customers. Its four long-time employees, including a part-time pharmacist, will look for other work.\n\nFor decades, Wise and his staff had catered to a tight-knit Pacoima \u2014 a white Pacoima; a Japanese-American Pacoima; a black Pacoima; and now a majority Latino Pacoima.\n\nOnce open seven days a week, Laurel Pharmacy was a shoe-box shaped general store once packed with greeting cards and magazines in English and Spanish, cosmetics geared to both blacks and Latinos, multicultural herbs and vitamins, paper goods, candy and gifts. Plus a full-service Rx counter.\n\nDuring Christmas, it was once the place in Pacoima to buy decorations.\n\n\u201cWe know everybody,\u201d said Lupita Marquez, a pharmacy clerk of 36 years. \u201cWe\u2019re an icon of Pacoima. Say Laurel Pharmacy, and right away they know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nIt was Wise who, after obtaining a pharmacy degree after working in his father\u2019s drugstores in their native Connecticut, lit out in a 1962 Mercury Comet bound for California. The money would be good. And in his native Hartford, \u201cthere was nothing to do but bowl.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Los Angeles, he said, \u201chis Jewish nose pointed him to Pico-Robertson.\u201d But he soon gravitated to the Valley, where he worked for White Front Pharmacy in Canoga Park. And when in 1969 he got a chance to buy Laurel Pharmacy.\n\nPeople he knew said, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing in Pacoima? It\u2019s a bad neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Not bad for me. The people are wonderful ... I love it here.\u201d\n\nWise, who has 10 kids, 26 grandchildren and four great grandkids, met his wife Flo in the pharmacy 41 years ago. Over the years, it has supported baseball, basketball and football at San Fernando High School, in addition to local Little League teams.\n\nNext to commendations from the city and local charities along its walls hangs an undated news clip of how Wise and his staff once saved the life of a sick immigrant girl. When her mother brought her in for vitamins, the pharmacy had her rushed to a hospital for virulent tuberculosis.\n\nLoyal customers included local nuns and the family of late Pacoima rocker Ritchie Valens, who has a park named for him nearby. When the 1994 Northridge earthquake turned the pharmacy upside down, neighbors reassembled the store before noon.\n\nBut it was during the street drug epidemic from the 1970s to the 1990s, however, that Laurel Pharmacy was held up regularly at the point of a knife or gun. Nobody was ever hurt. \u201cOne time I was on the phone with my mom, in Connecticut, and said, \u2018Hold it Mom, I\u2019ll call you back. We\u2019re being held up,\u2019\u201d Wise recalled.\n\nWise blames changing retail practices and drug prescription reimbursement policies he says will put all independent full-service, family drug stores like his out of business within five years.\n\nThe drug market is glutted with too many pharmacists, he said. And after the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, he said drug reimbursements from insurance companies have plummeted.\n\nIn addition, some insurance companies are now contracting exclusively with big chain pharmacies, he said, shutting out the mom-and-pop drug stores.\n\nBig-box retail centers such as Target have also lured away Main Street business.\n\n\u201cProfits are eroding,\u201d said Wise, who lives in Northridge. \u201cThat\u2019s really the main reason I want to leave. Plus, my body is eroding. Last year, I had to go into savings to pay my bills. This year, it\u2019s going to be worse.\u201d\n\nOne of the pillars of the Pacoima business community looked out onto the street he\u2019s stared at for 47 years, including its many barber shops, its machine shop, medical clinic and longtime liquor store.\n\nHe then peeled back the security bars for the dawn of another work day that would be near the pharmacy\u2019s last.\n\n\u201cI always listen,\u201d said Wise, slightly stooped, with hazel-green eyes, and a quick laugh, of his years in the corner shop. \u201cI talk to everybody -- those that I can, because I don\u2019t speak Spanish. The customer comes first. Here, they\u2019re patients. At pharmacy chains, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you retire, who\u2019s going to support me?\u201d said Dina Ruiz, 62, of Van Nuys, his first customer of the day. \u201cI am a good customer. This man, he\u2019s a beautiful person; I\u2019ve known him 26 years.\n\n\u201cHe gives me confidence. And comfort, with medicine. He\u2019s sweet. I\u2019ll miss him a lot.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PACOIMA >> Barry Wise trundled up to the back door of his shop, turned a key in the lock, and stepped into the Pacoima drugstore he\u2019d owned and operated for nearly 50 years.He\u2019d served generations of families from his Laurel", "title": "Pacoima\u2019s Laurel Pharmacy to shut down after a half century", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/business/20160409/pacoimas-laurel-pharmacy-to-shut-down-after-a-half-century", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20160409/NEWS/160409505/AR/0/AR-160409505.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "998px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Pacoima\u2019s Laurel Pharmacy to shut down after a half century"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "PACOIMA >> Barry Wise trundled up to the back door of his shop, turned a key in the lock, and stepped into the Pacoima drugstore he\u2019d owned and operated for nearly 50 years.He\u2019d served generations of families from his Laurel", "title": "Pacoima\u2019s Laurel Pharmacy to shut down after a half century", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/business/20160409/pacoimas-laurel-pharmacy-to-shut-down-after-a-half-century", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20160409/NEWS/160409505/AR/0/AR-160409505.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "business,business closing,daily,Pacoima,pharmacy, Pharmacy operators", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "business,business closing,daily,Pacoima,pharmacy, Pharmacy operators"}, "article_summary": "For 47-years Wise has been mixing drugs, doling out advice and offering service at his Laurel Pharmacy.\nHe\u2019d served generations of families from his Laurel Pharmacy.\nAnd when in 1969 he got a chance to buy Laurel Pharmacy.\nBut it was during the street drug epidemic from the 1970s to the 1990s, however, that Laurel Pharmacy was held up regularly at the point of a knife or gun.\n\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t find a buyer, so it\u2019s sad.\u201dThe Laurel Pharmacy on the corner of Van Nuys Boulevard and Rincon Avenue has for at least six decades stood as a community provider of drugs, whatnots and essential miscellany."}
