House rules tend to ensure that the main job of members of the minority is to show up, vote \u201cno\u201d and lose.\n\nAnd in the next Congress, Democrats will have fewer House seats than they\u2019ve had since 1930.\n\nSo not much notice was directed last week at Nancy Pelosi\u2019s first major intraparty defeat since she became House Democratic leader in 2003.\n\nPelosi won that post by defeating colleague Steny Hoyer and has been winning fights ever since. Until now.\n\nThat defeat was the election by the Democratic Caucus of New Jersey\u2019s Frank Pallone to be ranking minority member of the Energy and Commerce Committee over Pelosi\u2019s choice, California\u2019s Anna Eshoo.\n\nThe election was conducted by secret ballot, and the vote was 100-90.\n\nThose numbers are a vivid contrast to the totals in what was probably the most dramatic leadership vote in the Democratic caucus, the contest for majority leader in 1976, 38 years ago.\n\nThe winner then was Texas\u2019 Jim Wright, who\u2019d go on to become speaker after Tip O\u2019Neill retired 10 years later. The loser was California\u2019s Phil Burton.\n\nThe vote was 148-147. Burton spent the rest of his life trying to track down those who had committed to him but cast their secret ballot for Wright.\n\nDo the math. There were 295 House Democrats voting in the caucus that year. This year, 190.\n\nThere is a direct linkage between Phil Burton and Nancy Pelosi. Burton was succeeded by his widow, Salah Burton, who endorsed Pelosi as their successor in 1987.\n\nThough he never reached the leadership heights Pelosi has, Burton played a critical role in changing the House.\n\nFor years, liberal Democrats had decried the seniority system, which automatically made conservative Southerners (and/or senile members) committee chairmen. There they could and did block liberal measures from coming to the floor.\n\nAfter the big Democratic victory in the 1974 election, Democratic leaders conceded that the caucus could vote on chairmanships if a sufficient number of members signed petitions for such a vote.\n\nBurton organized a drive to get signatures to challenge every chairman: Nothing personal, signers could tell chairmen; we just want everyone to get a vote.\n\nThree chairmen were defeated, and the principle was established that the Caucus determined chairmanships. That principle was reaffirmed when Pallone won last week.\n\nAfter their big victory in the 1994 election, House Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich, instituted a similar procedure.\n\nChairmen would be determined by the Republican Steering Committee, on which party leaders had a major share of the votes, and there would be a six-year term limit (occasionally waived) on chairmen.\n\nBoth reforms can be defended on legislative-process grounds. It makes sense for legislative committees to be run by members in line with the views of the majority of the majority party.\n\nAnother result: Members compete for elective chairmanships by raising money for colleagues, largely from Washington insiders.\n\nThat is, the reforms make the House more accountable to voters than the seniority system, but also more responsive to lobbyists.\n\nPelosi has worked the new system ably.\n\nShe has raised $400 million for her fellow Democrats. She supported campaign chairman Rahm Emanuel\u2019s recruitment of moderates who matched their districts, which gave Democrats a House majority in 2006.\n\nShe saw to the ouster in 2008 of Energy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell, the longest-serving House member ever, in favor of her fellow Californian, Henry Waxman.\n\nShe rallied House majorities for the stimulus package in February 2009 and for cap-and-trade ( a favorite of Bay Area environmentalists) in June 2009. She pushed through ObamaCare in March 2010.\n\nBut in November 2010, Democrats lost 63 seats and their House majority. Democratic moderates virtually disappeared. Pelosi\u2019s hold on the leadership remained strong. But this year she stumbled.\n\nShe pushed hard for Eshoo, a close friend, though Pallone had more seniority. Black Caucus members, many with seniority, didn\u2019t like that. Some resented Pelosi\u2019s refusal to allow a pregnant and disabled member to vote by proxy.\n\nBurton\u2019s reform made the House Democratic Caucus more liberal \u2014 but also much smaller.
