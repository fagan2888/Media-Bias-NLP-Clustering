Synergy will deliver more networking opportunities and showcase customers\u2019 stories of how Citrix technologies strategically helped them to enable clinician mobility, streamline workflow, protect patient information, and mitigate costs while improving operations, said Nitin Sharma, Healthcare Solutions Marketing Manager.\n\nThe healthcare Birds of a Feather features IT leaders from Humana, Orlando Health and Southcoast Health interacting with attendees in a moderated roundtable discussion and Q&A session. The three healthcare customers will talk about how their implementation of Citrix mobility, virtualization, networking and cloud solutions helped them resolve challenging clinical and business issues as they transformed to become more value-based, patient-centered, cost-efficient healthcare organizations. Following the session, attendees continue to network and engage with their peers at the post-session networking reception where everyone is encouraged to grab a drink, socialize and connect.\n\nThe Fireside Chat, an inaugural activity last year, will have its own dedicated space, which will encourage more interaction between attendees and speakers. \u201cThe Fireside Chats, a set of 20-minute Q&A sessions with industry leaders, were designed for attendees trying to find solutions to issues that they\u2019re dealing with in their organization from Citrix customers who may have already solved those problems,\u201d Sharma said. Customers Adventist Health, Children\u2019s Hospital of Los Angeles and St Francis will be on hand to guide attendees on, for example, using technology to reduce the cost of operations while at the same time finding new paths to revenue.\n\nLocated in the Citrix Booth Experience, the Citrix Real World Pavilion\u2019s healthcare mobility demonstration follows a doctor\u2019s typical workflow \u2013 securely launching an electronic medical record (EMR) from a mobile cart; viewing patient information on an EMR and then roaming that information to an iPad, where the EMR is not native to the mobile device; and moving to the patient bedside and being able to update and show patients and their families real-time health information. \u201cDoctors are in the business of caring for their patients, so these are all the tools that they\u2019re leveraging to ensure that they\u2019re providing the highest quality of care and giving accurate information to their patient and the patient\u2019s family,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cThese are things our customers are doing right now.\u201d\n\nSharma pointed out that the speakers are not using Citrix for a simple EMR access from a thin client anymore. \u201cThey\u2019re being more strategic with their Citrix deployment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether attendees are existing Citrix customers or not, or looking to expand or invest in Citrix\u2019s other offerings, this is their chance to see what their peers in healthcare are doing so they can bring those ideas back to their own organization.\u201d\n\nThe value to attendees of Synergy bringing together a wide range of audiences from multiple industries and titles is the ability to connect with players outside of healthcare, such as networking, security and innovative IT firms, and share relevant challenges and solutions. \u201cThere are a lot of opportunities for cross-pollination in terms of ideas,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cAt the same time, they\u2019re expanding their professional network.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about the sessions and other activities offered within the Healthcare program at Synergy visit www.citrixsynergy.com.
