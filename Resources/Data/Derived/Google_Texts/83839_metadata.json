The American Civil Liberties Union is so upset that a Michigan baby died just after being born that the group is suing the Catholic Church for not deliberately killing the child earlier.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed on Nov. 29 against the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in U.S. District Court in Michigan, the ACLU contends that the church\u2019s medical directives reflecting a pro-life stance against abortion resulted in negligent care for a woman with a troubled pregnancy who eventually lost the child.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about one woman,\u201d said Kary Moss, executive director of the Michigan ACLU, in a Newsmax report quoted in The Washington Times. \u201cIt\u2019s about a nationwide policy created by nonmedical professionals putting patients in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Either the Catholic Church directs Catholic hospitals to perform abortions or it will be bankrupted, courtesy of the ACLU, which fights for the \u201cright\u201d to abort even full-term, healthy babies.\n\nFor good measure, the ACLU named as defendants the current and past two directors of Catholic Health Ministries, the group that issues national ethical directives for Catholic health institutions.\n\nIn the case at hand, plaintiff Tamesha Means, was 18 weeks pregnant in December 2010 when her water broke and she went to Mercy Health Partners in Muskegon. The ACLU suit contends that during three emergency-room treatments, she was never told that \u201cthe safest treatment option was to induce labor and terminate the pregnancy.\u201d Catholic doctors are bound by their faith to try to save both mother and baby.\n\nOn her third trip to the emergency room, as she was being checked out to go home, Ms. Means began giving birth to a baby, which the doctors delivered but which died 2 hours later, according to the ACLU\u2019s complaint. Because the odds were against the baby\u2019s survival, and Ms. Means had a potentially life-threatening infection, the ACLU contends that doctors should have either aborted the baby or told Ms. Means where to have it done. Hard cases make bad law, and the ACLU is hoping that a jury will find for Ms. Means and dish out a crippling monetary award.\n\nThis is about far more than Ms. Means\u2018 tragic situation or one hospital\u2019s alleged negligence. It\u2019s about forcing Catholic doctors everywhere to violate their faith by facilitating abortions. It strikes at the very heart of religious freedom and freedom of conscience. It\u2019s a corollary to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 mandate under Obamacare that faith-based institutions or businesses run by devoutly religious owners provide contraceptives regarded as abortifacients or face ruinous fines.\n\nSince only the Catholic Church bothered to build a hospital within 30 minutes of Ms. Means\u2018 home, the ACLU contends that the facility should operate without religious principles guiding it or simply switch to the ACLU\u2019s brand of moral relativism, where unborn children are merely options.\n\nIt\u2019s like building the only power plant and providing electricity where there was none and then getting sued for not electrocuting the people that the ACLU thinks are expendable.\n\n\u201cA pregnant woman who goes to the hospital seeking medical care has the right to expect that the hospital\u2019s first priority will be to provide her appropriate care,\u201d said Louise Melling, deputy legal director of the ACLU, in an ACLU press release. \u201cMedical decisions should not be hamstrung by religious directives.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the lawsuit accuses the bishops\u2019 directives of preventing Catholic hospitals from \u201cproviding information about treatment options that are not considered morally legitimate.\u201d Well, duh.\n\nIt will take more research, but I doubt that you could uncover instances in which the ACLU has sued abortion clinics for not informing their clients of the option of keeping their babies and getting aid from, say, faith-based crisis-pregnancy centers.\n\nThe \u201cpro-choice\u201d movement is a one-way street, with the ACLU serving as traffic cop, ensuring that abortion clinics won\u2019t have to meet typical clinical medical standards and that women are not given accurate information about all their \u201cchoices.\u201d The \u201cchoice\u201d they are given is whether to have the abortion or not.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Can the ACLU Make Catholic Hospitals Perform Abortions?", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The ACLU wants Catholic hospitals to practice medicine without morals.
