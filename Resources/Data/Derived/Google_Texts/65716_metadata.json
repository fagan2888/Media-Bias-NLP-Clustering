The maximum amount that a judge could have assessed in the case was $4,300 a barrel.\n\n\n\nThe settlement is the resolution of a 2010 lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against BP. It includes civil claims under the Clean Water Act, for which BP has agreed to pay a $5.5 billion penalty, the largest civil penalty in the history of environmental law. Also, it includes natural resources damages claims under the Oil Pollution Act, for which BP has agreed to pay $7.1 billion, on top of the $1 billion it previously committed to pay for early restoration work.\n\nThe settlement finalizes an agreement first announced in July.\n\nAmong other requirements, BP will be forced to pay $5.5 billion in Clean Water Act penalties and nearly $5 billion to five Gulf states: Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Louisiana, the hardest hit of the states, will receive $5 billion of the $8.8 billion allocated for restoration.\n\nThe spill followed the April 2010 explosion on an offshore rig that killed 11 workers. BP earlier settled with people and businesses harmed by the spill, a deal that's so far resulted in $5.84 billion in payouts.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The Justice Department and five states have finalized a settlement of more than $20 billion arising from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/justice-department-announces-final-settlement-bp-over-2010-oil-spill", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201510/446253402.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Justice Department and five states have finalized a settlement of more than $20 billion arising from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf", "title": "Justice Department Announces Final Settlement With BP Over 2010 Oil Spill"}, "story_id": 446015131, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Associated Press", "org_id": 671, "dc": {"title": "Justice Department Announces Final Settlement With BP Over 2010 Oil Spill"}, "nid": 12217, "datePublished": "2015-10-06", "keywords": "BP oil spill, environmental health", "wordCount": 463, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "It is the largest environmental settlement \u2014 and the largest civil settlement with any single entity \u2014 in the nation\u2019s history.\nThe Justice Department and five states have finalized a settlement of more than $20 billion arising from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe settlement is the resolution of a 2010 lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against BP.\nThe deal announced Monday resolves all civil claims against BP and ends five years of legal fighting over the nearly 134 million-gallon spill.\nBP earlier settled with people and businesses harmed by the spill, a deal that's so far resulted in $5.84 billion in payouts."}
