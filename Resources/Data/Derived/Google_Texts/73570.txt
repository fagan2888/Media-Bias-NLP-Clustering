Miami Beach Police Chief Dan Oates made history Tuesday when he appointed Lauretta Hill to the position of Deputy Chief of Police, making her the highest-ranking African-American in the history of the department.

“Her experience, integrity, professionalism and impressive body of work make her an exceptional choice. Lauretta comes to us from a well-respected and progressive police department. We are extremely fortunate that she has agreed to join us,” Chief Oates said in a statement.

Deputy Chief Hill has worked for 20 years in the Arlington Police Department in Arlington, Texas where she has most recently served as Assistant Chief of Police. She’s also coordinated security operations around the Super Bowl, World Series, and the NBA All-Star Game.

Hill is expected to join the Miami Beach Police Department in August.
