John Hickenlooper\u2019s clemency comments \u2014 which were obtained by a political blogger through an open-records request for the interview recording \u2014 though it did outline how the case has become a political talking point in this year\u2019s gubernatorial election. Hickenlooper told CNN he could grant Dunlap clemency if he is not re-elected in November.\n\n\u201cI think Nathan deserves to meet his maker,\u201d Bobby Stephens, the sole survivor of Dunlap\u2019s rampage, said on the show.\n\nThe 45-minute documentary is part of CNN\u2019s \u201cDeath Row Stories.\u201d The show details how Dunlap shot five people, four of them fatally, at an Aurora Chuck E. Cheese where he once worked. CNN said they chose not to include Hickenlooper\u2019s clemency comments because they could be a \u201cdistraction\u201d to voters.\n\nHickenlooper \u2014 who is barely featured in the documentary \u2014 granted Dunlap a temporary reprieve in May 2013 after a judge set a date for his execution following years of appeals. \u201cWe knew that when we were making this decision, we were making the hardest decision \u2014 we would be criticized from both sides,\u201d Hickenlooper, who is against the death penalty, said on the show of the reprieve. \u201cWe try to hear all the voices and all the perspectives, but you try to get to justice.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThat\u2019s part of the governor\u2019s role, when the governor comes in after this whole arc of judicial process and has to say, \u2018Did we miss anything? Is this really the right decision?\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe documentary also outlines the 2005 killings of Javad Marshall-Fields and his fianc\u00e9e, Vivian Wolfe, for which Sir Mario Owens and Robert Ray were sentenced to death and are now appealing.\n\nGeorge Brauchler, the 18th Judicial District Attorney and outspoken death penalty advocate whose office is presiding over the prosecution of James Holmes for the 2012 Aurora theater shooting, is prominently featured in the show, criticizing Hickenlooper\u2019s handling of the Dunlap case.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one person in Colorado that is more interested in the governor being re-elected than even the governor, and that\u2019s Nathan Dunlap,\u201d Brauchler told CNN.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CNN show on Nathan Dunlap case stirs Colorado\u2019s death penalty debate", "title": "CNN show on Nathan Dunlap case stirs Colorado\u2019s death penalty debate", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/07/cnn-show-on-nathan-dunlap-case-stirs-colorados-death-penalty-debate/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140907_090351_eye-for-eye-hickenlooper.jpg", "height": 368}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140907_090351_eye-for-eye-hickenlooper.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-07T21:00:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:21:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Election 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc1a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s one person in Colorado that is more interested in the governor being re-elected than even the governor, and that\u2019s Nathan Dunlap,\u201d Brauchler told CNN.\nHickenlooper told CNN he could grant Dunlap clemency if he is not re-elected in November.\nCNN said they chose not to include Hickenlooper\u2019s clemency comments because they could be a \u201cdistraction\u201d to voters.\nJohn Hickenlooper\u2019s clemency comments \u2014 which were obtained by a political blogger through an open-records request for the interview recording \u2014 though it did outline how the case has become a political talking point in this year\u2019s gubernatorial election.\n\u201cI think Nathan deserves to meet his maker,\u201d Bobby Stephens, the sole survivor of Dunlap\u2019s rampage, said on the show."}
