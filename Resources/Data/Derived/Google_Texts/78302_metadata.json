Matthieu Alexandre/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris and subsequent shootouts with police raised worldwide fears this week, as residents in metropolises throughout the West wondered whether armed gunmen such as the Kouachi brothers could provoke such a prolonged lapse in security elsewhere.\n\nIn Washington, London or Rome, for example, would it be possible for extremists with automatic weapons to storm a newspaper headquarters, kill 11 people, get into a shootout with police and kill an officer, and drive away? Could they then stop to hijack another car and hold up a suburban gas station, only to escape from there as well?\n\nThat\u2019s to say nothing of the suspects\u2019 evading capture by police and security forces for two days, and ultimately driving as far away as 90 miles before returning toward Paris and engaging in an hourslong hostage standoff on its outskirts.\n\n[READ: Charlie Hebdo Gunmen, Connected Suspect Die in Police Raids]\n\nPhotos: France Mourns, Police Corner Charlie Hebdo Suspects EXPAND GALLERY Photo Gallery x of x Full Screen Armed security forces fly overhead in a military helicopter in Dammartin-en-Goele, France, 30 miles northeast of Paris, on Friday.

Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty Images x of x \u00d7\n\n\u201cCould this happen in America? Yes. Absolutely. And it will, in time,\u201d says Dan Emmett, 21-year Secret Service veteran who worked in the agency\u2019s elite Counter Assault Team before serving on the protective details for Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He was also previously a counterterrorism officer with the CIA\u2019s Clandestine Service. \u201cIn a free society it is impossible to completely stop crimes like this from occurring.\u201d\n\nEmmett credits the likelihood of these attacks to the ease with which modern insurgents can gain access to weapons and training; foreign nationals, for example, can legally purchase weapons in the U.S. And anyone can read materials such as al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula\u2019s online \u201cInspire\u201d magazine, which provides how-to instructions on building weapons such as a car bomb and encourages followers to engage in so-called lone-wolf attacks.\n\nThey key to preventing another string of incidents reminiscent of this week in France lies squarely on intelligence agencies\u2019 ability to learn about and deter them. And if that fails, law enforcement agencies must communicate with one another immediately and effectively after such an attack takes place.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande said this week that France recently had received a higher number of terrorist threats, and had successfully thwarted imminent attacks.\n\nBut the French counterterrorism system is not up to the same level as its American counterpart's, Emmett says. He routinely worked with local law enforcement and across federal agencies in his previous jobs as detailed in his book, \u201cWithin Arm's Length: A Secret Service Agent's Definitive Inside Account of Protecting the President.\u201d\n\n[ALSO: Charlie Hebdo Massacre Prompts Defense of Freedom of Speech]\n\n\u201cParis and the French police in general are not overly aggressive in their methods, and Paris is an easy city to become lost in,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is also relatively easy to execute a border crossing into another country in Europe and disappear in that manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn America, all law enforcement agencies are tied together by an Internet system and work together very well,\u201d he adds. \u201cIn Europe there is still a great deal of dislike and mistrust between some of the countries there, and cooperation is not the best.\u201d\n\nExtremism in Paris is also exacerbated by France\u2019s historical open-door policies to residents of former colonies such as Algeria, where the Kouachi brothers' parents reportedly were from. Many of these immigrants live in second-class urban housing in the neighborhoods that surround Paris, creating an environment where crime \u2013 and extremist recruitment \u2013 could flourish.\n\nBoth Europe and North America now find themselves caught in the virtual crossfire between al-Qaida affiliates like the Yemen-based al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, and the even more violent Islamic State group, which are vying for recruits and the reputation of the most lethal extremist organization.\n\nA member of AQAP said the group directed this week\u2019s attack in Paris, according to The Associated Press.\n\n[MORE: Charlie Hebdo Attack in Paris Professionally Orchestrated, Experts Say]\n\nMaking up roughly two-thirds of AQAP\u2019s top \u201chit list\u201d are journalists, according to some reports. And there are as many as 2,000 French passport holders currently in Syria or Iraq fighting for extremist networks. Meanwhile, ultranationalist, right-wing political movements that have risen in countries such as Norway, Greece, Germany and France likely will use this week\u2019s tragedy to feed into their narrative that Christian Europe is under siege.\n\nSo the chances of another attack on an organization like Charlie Hebdo are almost certain. Whether such an attack could be carried out in the U.S., though, is less clear.\n\n\u201cCould this happen in the U.S.? It could. Is it likely? Probably not,\u201d says Colin Clarke, a political scientist at the Rand Corp. who specializes in international security policy. He finds fault in the way European security forces plan for extremist attacks. \u201cFrench counterterrorism and police forces may be prepped to respond to a bombing or some kind of mass casualty. Too often with jihadists, we assume they\u2019re going to commit suicide somehow.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s less planning that goes into the \u2018chase\u2019 aspect of it \u2013 what you do if these guys get away,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for this chaos, this chaotic scene. But these guys blended right back in with traffic. By the time authorities set up checkpoints, they were clearly far outside Paris.\u201d\n\nAn American city also struggled with its ability to track down terror suspects in 2013, when the Tsarnaev brothers detonated homemade bombs at the Boston Marathon. The city essentially went on lockdown as security searched for the pair. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed while being pursued four days after the bombing, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found later that evening hiding in a stored boat. Jury selection in his trial began this week.\n\nThe Boston Police Department, assisted by the FBI and local authorities, had the skills and training to lock down area neighborhoods and establish the dragnet that ultimately nabbed the perpetrators. Smaller jurisdictions, however, likely do not.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much of the post-shooting events the Kouachi brothers had planned. But both Emmett and Clarke believe they could have disappeared, either in hiding or into a foreign country, if they had prepared to do so with outside help.\n\nInstead, the brothers confronted police and claimed they wished to die as so-called martyrs.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Charlie Hebdo", "title": "The Charlie Hebdo Massacre and Chase: A 3-Day Security Failure", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The Kouachi brothers' daylight slaughter and escape highlighted flaws in Western security and the likelihood of repeat attacks.", "title": "The Charlie Hebdo Massacre and Chase: A 3-Day Security Failure", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/09/the-charlie-hebdo-massacre-and-chase-a-3-day-security-failure", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/54/f2/03c81cb244f5a1690ae179a92732/150109-charliehebdo-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The Kouachi brothers' daylight slaughter and escape highlighted flaws in Western security and the likelihood of repeat attacks.", "card": "summary", "title": "The Charlie Hebdo Massacre and Chase: A 3-Day Security Failure"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Jan. 9, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Paul D.
