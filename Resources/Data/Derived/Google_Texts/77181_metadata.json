Kansas is one of the remaining states where Republican legislators and governors remain resistant.\n\nSheldon Weisgrau, director of the Health Reform Resource Project for the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved, told a group attending the 2015 Kansas Conference on Poverty on Thursday that the lack of progress calls for a new strategy.\n\n\u201cWe all need to figure out how to advocate on this issue,\u201d Weisgrau said. \u201cObviously what we\u2019ve been doing isn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nHe said focusing on numbers \u2014 like the 90,000 uninsured Kansans who would gain coverage through the expansion and the billions of federal dollars it would funnel into Kansas \u2014 has not persuaded lawmakers.\n\nMoving forward, his focus will be on reaching them emotionally, by sharing personal stories from Kansans who can\u2019t pay for medical care that they need.\n\nWeisgrau noted that the group of about 20 he was speaking to at the conference all work with people in poverty, many of whom might fall into the ACA \u201ccoverage gap\u201d because they\u2019re too poor for private insurance subsidies but not eligible for Medicaid.\n\nHe asked if the people they work with know that they could get Medicaid coverage if the Legislature accepts expansion.\n\n\u201cA lot of you are shaking your heads,\u201d Weisgrau said. \u201cThat\u2019s problem No. 1.\u201d\n\nNavigator assistance\n\nOne person in the audience, Steve Henoch, said the clients he works with know if they fall into the gap because telling them is part of his job.\n\nHenoch is a navigator for the healthcare.gov online exchange that the uninsured can use to purchase private insurance with federal subsidies. He works out of Salina Family Healthcare.\n\nHe said that, especially in the first year of the ACA, he had a number of people who desperately needed health care come in and fill out the online application with him, only to find out that they made too little money to qualify for subsidies.\n\nThen he had to tell them there was simply no health insurance they could afford.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible,\u201d Henoch said.\n\nMost of them did not know who their state representatives were or where those officials stood on the issue of Medicaid expansion, he said.\n\n\u201cUsually they didn\u2019t have any idea this was going on,\u201d Henoch said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even know about the expansion.\u201d\n\nWeisgrau said those are the type of people Medicaid expansion advocates need to get registered to vote and politically engaged.\n\nHe said a website to collect their stories soon will be live.\n\nCost remains a factor\n\nOpponents of Medicaid expansion have objected on several grounds, including its cost, which Weisgrau said will continue to be a sticking point given the state\u2019s beleaguered budget.\n\nIt is likely too late for the state to take advantage of the last year of full federal funding for expansion in 2016. After that, the cost-sharing will gradually drop to 90 percent federal and 10 percent state.\n\nWeisgrau said that means expansion would cost about $800 million in state money between now and 2025. But he said that\u2019s a small fraction of what the state is slated to spend in that same time period on subsidies to help lure corporations to Kansas, while the Medicaid expansion would draw $8.5 billion in federal funds that would create economic stimulus and jobs throughout the health care industry.\n\nAdditionally, he said, getting Medicaid coverage for more people would take financial pressure off other state and local programs that serve the uninsured.\n\n\u201cEvery single state that has expanded Medicaid has seen reduced spending on the uninsured in other parts of their state budgets,\u201d Weisgrau said.\n\nWeisgrau agreed with one audience member who said some legislators will continue to oppose anything connected to President Barack Obama, regardless of numbers or emotional stories.\n\nWeisgrau encouraged advocates to rebrand the issue as \u201cKanCare expansion\u201d rather than \u201cMedicaid expansion\u201d to tie it to Republican Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s signature health care initiative rather than Obama\u2019s.\n\nHe said that while Medicaid coverage is far from perfect, it is effective at limiting out-of-pocket costs for hospital stays and preventing medical bankruptcies.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we know about Medicaid is that it \u2014 like health insurance is supposed to \u2014 provides financial security,\u201d Weisgrau said.\n\nAndy Marso is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "One of the leading advocates for Medicaid expansion in Kansas says it\u2019s time to change tactics.
