Ted Cruz (R-TX) hit the late-night talk show circuit.\n\nFiorina, still riding the accolades from her performance in last week\u2019s GOP debate, hit the set of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d where the jovial Jimmy Fallon lobbed mostly softball questions her way \u2013 and the surging White House hopeful knocked each one out of the park.\n\nRelated: Fiorina\u2019s Strong Debate Performance Lands Her in Second Place\n\n\u201cWhen people get to know me they tend to support me, and that\u2019s what you see in the polls,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked what she wanted the American people to know about her, Fiorina practically gave a stump speech, beginning with her first job as a secretary at a small real estate office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only in this country that you can go from being a secretary to the chief executive of the largest company in the world, to running for president,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to make sure that every American, regardless of what they look like, how they start or their circumstances, has the opportunity to find their God-given gifts. That isn\u2019t true in America today.\u201d\n\nThe only time the interview touched upon a controversial topic was when Fallon asked Fiorina to weigh in on the fellow Republican candidate Ben Carson\u2019s recent statement that a Muslim shouldn\u2019t be president, a question she seemed prepared for.\n\nRelated: Spontaneous or Scripted? Clinton Tries to Loosen Up with Jimmy Fallon\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cIt says in our Constitution that religion cannot be a test for office.\u201d\n\nShe also took a shot at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, saying her rival shares some similarities with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201c[They] have a lot in common actually,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll just leave it at that.\u201d\n\nThe interview, as expected, stuck to rosy topics, like how Fiorina sings made-up songs to her grandkids and her dogs, Max and Snickers. She belted out a few bars to the tune of the 1950's hit \"Rock Around the Clock,\" earning applause from the audience and Fallon himself.\n\nCruz, by comparison, didn\u2019t have such a great night.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s What Doomed Scott Walker\u2019s Presidential Campaign\n\nA hero for social conservatives who are pushing for a federal government shutdown in a struggle over funding for Planned Parenthood, Cruz appeared on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d with Stephen Colbert.\n\nIf the Texas lawmaker was hoping the conservative gadfly Colbert played on Comedy Central for so long would make an appearance, he was sorely mistaken.\n\nColbert tried to paint Cruz, who is near the back of the GOP presidential pack, into a corner over the legacy of Ronald Reagan. He noted the Republican icon raised taxes and had an amnesty plan for illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cNeither of those things would allow Reagan to be nominated today,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cSo to what level can you truly emulate Ronald Reagan?\u201d\n\nCruz didn\u2019t directly answer the question, nor another about if he would be willing to compromise and work with Democrats, saying only that Americans should \u201clive within our means, stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids and follow the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd no gay marriage,\u201d Colbert interjected, which sparked a back-and-forth over whether the issue should be decided by Washington or left to the states to decide.\n\nThe strained but civil discussion at one point drew boos from the crowd. Colbert quickly stood up for Cruz.\n\n\u201cGuys, however you feel, he\u2019s my guest, so please don\u2019t boo him,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nLast week, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton passed on the chance to appear during the first week of Colbert\u2019s newly-minted program, and the exchange likely had her top campaign aides breathing a sigh of relief that they had her appear on Fallon instead.\n\nColbert will interview Trump on Tuesday night.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The divergent fortunes of two Republican presidential contenders were on full display Monday night, with former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and Sen.
