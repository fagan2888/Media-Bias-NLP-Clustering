Farmington, MN

A Minnesota woman has been charged with drunken driving after allegedly driving away while her 8-year-old daughter clung to the outside of the car.



Rena Mae Giancherio is due in Dakota County court Aug. 18 on third-degree driving while impaired and child endangerment charges in connection to the Monday incident.



The criminal complaint says police were called to Giancherio's home in Farmington Monday afternoon. A neighbor says her daughter was hanging onto the handle of the vehicle and pounding on the glass but Giancherio pulled out of the driveway.



Giancherio, 46, continued driving after her daughter fell onto the street. A breath test measured her blood-alcohol content at 0.30 percent, more than triple the legal limit.
