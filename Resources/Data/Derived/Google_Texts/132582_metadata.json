( Jeff Stahla / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nSilently, the makeshift lanterns rose into the sky Friday night above Lake Loveland to mark a life ended too soon.\n\nIn the neighborhoods around the lake, residents pulled over to take pictures of the glowing beacons and unknowingly take part in a memorial for a former Loveland resident who died one week ago.\n\nBrandon Perez, 23, died on March 22 when he reportedly lost control of his vehicle on U.S. 34 near Corning, Iowa, about 40 miles southeast of Omaha, Neb. Also in the car were 30-year-old Hilary Knox and a 3-year-old child.\n\nPerez was born in Loveland on Feb. 16, 1992, and lived in the city through his school years, according to friends who gathered Friday night at the shelter near the North Lake Park boat ramp. Before the crash, he was living in Fort Madison, Iowa, with his maternal grandparents, Merlin \"Rusty\" and Dollie Boyd of Fort Madison.\n\nA funeral service for Perez was Saturday in Iowa \u2014 too far for those who gathered to travel.\n\nPriscilla Cordova and Ashley May, among those who helped remember Brandon, said they were there with his school friends to make the event special.\n\nJeff Stahla: 970-635-3691, jstahla@reporter-herald.com", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-03-29T11:46:26-0600", "modificationDate": "2015-03-29T11:47:09-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0328/20150328__29RHALANTERNS~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Jeff Stahla \n \n  Managing Editor", "description": "Silently, the makeshift lanterns rose into the sky Friday night above Lake Loveland to mark a life ended too soon.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:27807718:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0328/20150328__29RHALANTERNS~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Silently, the makeshift lanterns rose into the sky Friday night above Lake Loveland to mark a life ended too soon.", "title": "Lights over Loveland memorialize native"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Silently, the makeshift lanterns rose into the sky Friday night above Lake Loveland to mark a life ended too soon.", "title": "Lights over Loveland memorialize native", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0328/20150328__29RHALANTERNS~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-29T11:46:26-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "sailthru.title": "Lights over Loveland memorialize native", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Jeff StahlaManaging", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0328/20150328__29RHALANTERNS~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-03-29T11:48:50-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland News, Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado news, Loveland News Loveland news, Loveland News Colorado news, US Loveland News news, world Loveland News news."}, "article_summary": "( Jeff Stahla / Loveland Reporter-Herald )Silently, the makeshift lanterns rose into the sky Friday night above Lake Loveland to mark a life ended too soon.\nBrandon Perez, 23, died in a car crash March 22Priscilla Cordova of Loveland lets the warm air and smoke inflate a makeshift lantern on Friday at Lake Loveland.\nShe and Ashley May, behind her, were among a large group paying tribute to former Loveland resident Brandon Perez, who died in a car crash recently.\nBrandon Perez, 23, died on March 22 when he reportedly lost control of his vehicle on U.S. 34 near Corning, Iowa, about 40 miles southeast of Omaha, Neb.\nA funeral service for Perez was Saturday in Iowa \u2014 too far for those who gathered to travel."}
