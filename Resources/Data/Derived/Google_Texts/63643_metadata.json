One store is helping out a good cause while helping high schoolers find the perfect dress.\n\nElegant Xpressions is hosting its Eighth Annual PROM Xtravaganza this weekend. There are discounts on dresses, as well as free dress giveaways. All of the benefits go to Sanford's Children Miracle Network. Owner Shauna Niedan knows first-hand the importance of what the Castle of Care does for children.\n\n\u201cI have two children that received treatment at the castles and without them I truly would not have my children so I feel that it's something to pay back to the community. A lot of people do not realize at Children's Miracle Network that things such as Chemo Chair or Child's Life Specialist, those are all funded by fundraising,\u201d Niedan said.\n\nThe event will be going at the store until Sunday at 4 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Some students and student athletes are getting ready for prom.
