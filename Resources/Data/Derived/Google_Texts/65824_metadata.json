Available in only 12 million homes, the San Diego-based 24/7 news channel feels almost like a vlog rather than a huge journalism operation. Loose and conversational, and openly partisan, you can\u2019t say it isn\u2019t entertaining, especially if you\u2019re politically conservative. This channel was launched expressly for people who think Fox News isn\u2019t conservative enough.\n\nBut even if you haven\u2019t watched it, you\u2019ve no doubt heard about it by now, thanks to a highly publicized appearance by Donald Trump on tonight\u2019s episode of the nightly news talk show On Point, guest-hosted by Sarah Palin. Interest in a Trump-Palin showdown was so high that the channel\u2019s official website was overwhelmed by traffic hours before airtime, crashing the site around 3:00 PM this afternoon. \u201cSo much interest in the interview of Donald J. Trump, Jeb Bush, and Ted Cruz tonight by Sarah Palin at 10 pm EST that you crashed the oann.com website!,\u201d read a statement from the network on its official Facebook page. \u201cIt will be up shortly \u2013 Thank you for the interest in One America News Network!\u201d\n\nThat promise didn\u2019t come true however. The site was still down at the show\u2019s start, forcing interested parties who don\u2019t have the network on their cable service to Roku, Amazon Firesticks and third-party streaming services. Great press for a network few had even heard of before this week. We\u2019ll see if it pays off for the network in an expansion to other cable providers after tonight.\n\nIt didn\u2019t pay off for viewers during the show, however, being by and large a textbook softball game consisting of pre-taped interviews. In addition to Trump, Palin hosted republican presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz, all of whom were given an open mic to make their presidential pitches in the friendliest possible atmosphere. So friendly at times that the interviews could be boiled down mostly to expressions of mutual admiration, with Palin\u2019s folksy affectations peppered in.\n\nFirst up, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, perfecting his moderate persona and emphasizing a gentler presentation of his beliefs, what he called his \u201creformer\u2019s heart\u201d that is \u201cinformed by my faith.\u201d Softballs were lobbed by Palin and Bush batted them back, mainly hawking his upcoming e-book while genteelly hammering Hillary Clinton over the ongoing email scandal.\n\nTed Cruz was next and he at least showed some more fire. Citing Cruz\u2019s intensely religious campaign \u2013 he\u2019s basically pitching himself as the defender of the faith to undecided Republicans \u2013 Palin kicked off the chat with an absolute all-time groaner: it would be great to have the country under \u201cCruz control.\u201d See?\n\nPalin essentially gave Cruz free rein to talk about religious issues, and he delivered, promising that if elected he\u2019ll protect the religious rights of all Americans. As part of this, he vowed to stop enforcing aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Soon after, he turned his sights on Planned Parenthood, angrily denouncing the organization as \u201cmurder in commerce on the sale of human life.\u201d Burn.\n\nBut you tuned in for Trump, who showed up in the last quarter of the hour piped in from Trump Tower so obviously pre-recorded you could still see shoppers walking behind him. Alas, those of you hoping The Donald would deliver one of his trademark headline-grabber quotes walked away disappointed. He was instead very on topic, bringing perhaps the most managed public appearance he\u2019s had in weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve said it ever since he made the sacrifice to go on the campaign trail \u2013 voters crave the anti-establishment candidate,\u201d so Palin introduced him, and that sets the tone more aptly than I can. Compliments for one another came almost as often as questions, and questions, when they did come, yielded little we haven\u2019t heard before. Trump largely stuck to his campaign bullet points.\n\nThe one possible highlight came as Palin asked Trump about his spat earlier this week with Univision reporter Jorge Ramos. Framing it as a chance for Trump to explain how the mainstream media had mistreated him over the incident, Trump surprised by insisting that by and large, the press had been in his corner. At the same time, he also poured cold water on people hoping the Ramos/Trump beef would escalate.\n\n\u201cActually the press has been good to me about that. He was totally out of line, he\u2019s screaming and ranting and raving,\u201d Trump said. Trump then implied the whole thing was a stunt related to his ongoing lawsuit against Univision, before switching gears to suggest Ramos\u2019 daughter being a Clinton staffer might have factored. But ultimately, he dismissed Ramos. \u201cHe was trying to put on a show.\u201d\n\nAll in all, an underwhelming conversation.
