The amount of illicit drugs seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection hasfallen dramatically under President Obama, from 4.75 million pounds in fiscal year 2009 to 2.8 million pounds in fiscal year 2013 - a decrease of 41%.

With headlines dominated by the flood of illegal immigrant children, it is easy to forget that Customs and Border Protection is also responsible for seizing millions of pounds of narcotics every year. On a typical day in 2013, they screened 67,000 cargo containers and seized 6 tons of drugs.

Customs and Border Protection (CBP)'s mission:

We are the guardians of our nation's borders. We are America's frontline.

We safeguard the American homeland at and beyond our borders.

We protect the American public against terrorists and the instruments of terror.

We steadfastly enforce the laws of the United States while fostering our nation's economic security through lawful international trade and travel.

We serve the American public with vigilance, integrity and professionalism.

The CBP has had to handle the brunt of the "humanitarian and security issues" stemming from the tens of thousands of illegal children caught at the southwest border of the U.S.

Interestingly, in the $3.7 billion supplemental appropriation that President Obama requested on July 8 to handle the crisis, Customs and Border Protection would receive a "paltry" $433 million with the majority of the money going to the Department of Health and Human Services, the same agency that implements Obamacare.
