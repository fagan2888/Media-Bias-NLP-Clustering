They will have a 401(k)-style retirement plan similar to what union machinists approved in a contentious contract-extension vote earlier this year.\n\nNonunion Boeing employees hired since 2009 have not had a traditional defined pension plan. Thursday\u2019s announcement applies to those who started working for the company earlier, KING reported (http://tinyurl.com/nrxxahf ).\n\nIn its statement, Boeing said it would make contributions each pay period to nonunion employees\u2019 retirement savings through the 401(k) plan. All benefits earned in the current traditional pension plan will be paid to already-retired employees, and the company said it would also continue to match employee savings in an existing 401(k) plan.\n\nTony Parasida, Boeing\u2019s senior vice president of human resources and administration, said making the switch would help address the \u201cunsustainable growth\u201d of the company\u2019s long-term pension liability.\n\nOn Jan. 3, Boeing machinists in the Seattle area narrowly approved a contract in which they conceded some benefits in order to secure assembly of the new 777X jet in Washington state.\n\nMachinists approved an eight-year contract extension with a slim 51 percent vote in favor. Opponents of the contract opposed the idea of freezing the pension and moving workers to a defined-contribution savings plan. They also criticized increased health care expenses and slower wage growth.\n\nLocal union officials had urged their 30,000 members to oppose the deal, arguing that the proposal surrendered too much at a time of company profitability.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Boeing Co. said Thursday it is freezing the traditional defined-benefit pensions for 68,000 nonunion employees - including managers and executives - starting in 2016.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Boeing Co. said Thursday it is freezing the traditional defined-benefit pensions for 68,000 nonunion employees - including managers and executives - starting in 2016.", "title": "Boeing freezing nonunion workers\u2019 pensions in 2016", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/6/boeing-to-freeze-pensions-for-non-union-workers/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/04/28/japan-boeing_lea.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/04/28/japan-boeing_lea.jpg", "description": "Boeing Co. said Thursday it is freezing the traditional defined-benefit pensions for 68,000 nonunion employees - including managers and executives - starting in 2016.", "card": "summary", "title": "Boeing freezing nonunion workers\u2019 pensions in 2016"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Business Finance, Social Issues, Boeing Co"}, "article_summary": "SEATTLE (AP) - Boeing Co. said Thursday it is freezing the traditional defined-benefit pensions for 68,000 nonunion employees - including managers and executives - starting in 2016.\nIn its statement, Boeing said it would make contributions each pay period to nonunion employees\u2019 retirement savings through the 401(k) plan.\nNonunion Boeing employees hired since 2009 have not had a traditional defined pension plan.\nOpponents of the contract opposed the idea of freezing the pension and moving workers to a defined-contribution savings plan.\nThe Chicago-based aerospace company said in a statement that the employees will transition to a company-funded defined contribution retirement plan, effective Jan. 1, 2016."}
