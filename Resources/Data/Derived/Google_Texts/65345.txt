SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Kayvon Webster didn’t join the Broncos on their trip for Sunday’s preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers after he sprained his ankle during practice Saturday morning.

Webster had been starting at right cornerback while Chris Harris continues to recover from offseason knee surgery. With both Harris and Webster down for the Broncos’ preseason game here Sunday for the christening of Levi’s Stadium, the expectation is either first-round draft pick Bradley Roby or veteran Tony Carter will start.

Roby comes in to play right cornerback, while Webster shifts inside to nickel when the Broncos employ their sub packages.

Webster had a terrific training camp. A third-round pick in the 2013 draft, Webster had been using his full season of NFL experience to stay ahead of the rookie Roby on the depth chart.

Webster’s ankle injury is not considered serious, although he may miss the bulk of the Broncos’ three practices next week against the Houston Texans.

Nevada reunion. San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick and Broncos’ new starting weakside linebacker Brandon Marshall were college teammates at Nevada.

Marshall will be calling the Broncos’ defensive signals Sunday while Kaepernick will be trying to read him from the other side of scrimmage.

“I’m excited,” Marshall said. “If I can get a sack on him that would be great. He’s good, man. He’s probably the hardest working guy in terms of training — and I mean that — of anyone I’ve been around. Every athlete I’ve trained with, he works probably the hardest.”
