But at one Bay Area health care network, doctors were able to instantly huddle with other members of her care team and determine that the patient preferred care that emphasized quality of life and comfort.\n\nCommunication is crucial to excelling in new models of health care. And yet, it can be an enormous hurdle for accountable care organizations such as the Meritage Medical Network based in Novato, Calif. The physician-led, Medicare Shared Savings ACO includes numerous physician practices and a hospital with disparate records systems, covering a 26,000 square-mile region.\n\nIn the absence of interoperability, Meritage has perfected the use of a smartphone-based tool that allows clinicians to huddle virtually and quickly check in on a patient\u2019s care history. After a few short years, the app has shown promise, reducing the number of phone calls by 47 percent and length of stay by a half day, says Andrea Kmetz, R.N., director of care management and quality assurance.\n\n\u201cIt was a giant game of phone tag, and now, with the virtual huddle, that has been eliminated,\u201d she says. \u201cUntil there is a truly meaningful health information exchange \u2014 and we\u2019re a long way from that \u2014 this bypasses that and puts people at the point of care in touch with the whole team across the continuum.\u201d\n\nDeveloped by technology company Zynx Health, the mobile app allows providers to see who is on a patient\u2019s care team and message back and forth with them in a HIPAA-compliant fashion. Doctors also receive reminders and \u201cticklers\u201d about certain markers along a patient\u2019s care path, and alternatively can send out reminders to alert staffers of such things as the need to discharage a patient.\n\nUp next, Meritage will look to incorporate the virtual huddle tool into its outpatient physician practices, as well as an additional rural hospital in Sonoma. Plus, they\u2019re adding the ability to upload and share documents between providers, Kmetz says. Two key lessons learned so far are the importance of understanding each patient\u2019s living situation, and reconciling prescriptions before discharge.\n\nMeritage member Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, Calif., also has seen an uptick in the satisfaction of physicians who have been frustrated with finicky electronic health record systems. One survey at the hospital found that 7 percent of clinicians at the hospital said it was \u201ceasy\u201d to update changes in a patient\u2019s discharge plan, which shot up to 72 percent after implementing virtual huddles.\n\nTerry Winter, R.N., director of care transitions at Marin, says hospitals won\u2019t eliminate the need for an EHR, but this is one way to alleviate some of its communication shortcomings.\n\n\u201cThe electronic medical record is a valuable tool, but it doesn\u2019t do much to improve communication between disciplines and even within the same discipline at different shifts,\u201d Winter says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Communication is crucial to exceling in new models of health care.
