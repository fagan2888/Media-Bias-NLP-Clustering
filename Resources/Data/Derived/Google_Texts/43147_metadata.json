It's going to be a humungous success because it's going to star the biggest, most beautiful, successful, smart, charismatic, rich personality in the whole of television! And note that I said 'smart', so I'm not talking about that bimbo Megyn Kelly folks, I'm talking about me! Me, me, me, me, me!\"\n\nTrump also explained the thinking behind the name of his new show: \"Well, you don't need to be a brilliant brain surgeon or even Ben Carson to work that out. It's simple. I'm extremely good at getting what I want, I'm a great businessman, fantastic at engineering takeovers, and I've taken over the GOP! So hey presto, Extreme Takeover: GOP Edition it is!\"\n\nSarah Palin, who recently endorsed Trump for President, immediately declared her support for his new show -- and in an interview with Good Morning Wasilla, she couldn't have been clearer about her thoughts on it.\n\nShe said: \"I love the, you betcha fact that what I'm saying is you know, ABC's doing, I mean viewers are going to get hooked, and I said to Donald the other day, don't you love that hopey changing thing, it's going to be, trust in the Lord, I'm a rootin' tootin', and the show will go roguey, pokey, so yeah!! Did you get that?\"\n\nExtreme Takeover: GOP Edition is scheduled to start airing immediately in order to help Trump build on his national lead in the polls and secure the Republican nomination for the Presidency. And as expected, the series will be sponsored by Koch Industries, the NRA, Hobby Lobby Stores, Westboro Baptist Church and of course the Oregon Militiamen.\n\nIn late, breaking and totally related news, CNN announced that they have concluded a deal with Hillary Clinton to star in her own TV show too. And after Whitewater, Jennifer Flowers, Monica Lewinski, Bill, Benghazi and the personal email controversy, it'll simply be called... Survivor.\n\nFollow Flora Nicholas on Twitter: www.twitter.com/flora_nicholas", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.expire_date": "2016-02-11 13:31:38 -0500", "og": {"url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/flora-nicholas/donald-trump-to-star-in-n_b_9202492.html", "type": "article", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3337804/images/o-DEFAULT-facebook.jpg", "site_name": "The Huffington Post", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3337804/images/o-DEFAULT-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "site": "@HuffPostComedy", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "flora_nicholas"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-10 13:31:38 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=9202492", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "comedy", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "satire,Political Humor,Donald Trump,donald trump 2016,Republican Party,gop,Hillary Clinton,sarah palin,Bill Clinton", "article": {"section": "Comedy", "tag": "satire,Political Humor,Donald Trump,donald trump 2016,Republican Party,gop,Hillary Clinton,sarah palin,Bill Clinton", "published_time": "2016-02-10 13:31:38 -0500", "modified_time": "2016-02-10 13:59:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "So hey presto, Extreme Takeover: GOP Edition it is!\"\nPhotographer: Gage SkidmoreToday, during the Upfronts, ABC was totally up front about a new political television series that's about to hit the airwaves -- one which will provide conclusive proof that Donald Trump has totally trumped the GOP.\nExtreme Takeover: GOP Edition is scheduled to start airing immediately in order to help Trump build on his national lead in the polls and secure the Republican nomination for the Presidency.\nIt's going to be a humungous success because it's going to star the biggest, most beautiful, successful, smart, charismatic, rich personality in the whole of television!\nIn late, breaking and totally related news, CNN announced that they have concluded a deal with Hillary Clinton to star in her own TV show too."}
