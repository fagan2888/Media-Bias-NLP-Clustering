The Los Angeles Dodgers used their major league-record salary budget to get Brandon McCarthy.\n\nIn baseball, that big bankroll separates the haves and have-nots \u2014 not in superstar talent, but in difference-making depth. McCarthy, a journeyman right-hander from Cheyenne Mountain High in Colorado Springs, is pitching for his sixth big-league franchise. He is the Dodgers\u2019 No. 4 starter.\n\nMcCarthy, 31, would have fit well with the Rockies. But the Dodgers offered a little more money than every other team could spend and signed him to a four-year, $48 million contract, including a $6 million signing bonus. The Rockies\u2019 No. 4 starter, Eddie Butler, makes the big-league minimum: $509,000.\n\nSunday, McCarthy faced off with Butler at Dodger Stadium and showed why he\u2019s worth the big bucks. He pitched six shutout innings and escaped trouble against the Rockies\u2019 best batters, leading the Dodgers to a 7-0 victory and a three-game series sweep.\n\n\u201cHe was a lot better,\u201d Troy Tulowitzki said of McCarthy. \u201cTake a look at his velocity when we faced him last year in Arizona. He was 90, 91 (mph). Today he was 95. He\u2019s a completely different pitcher.\u201d\n\nThe first-place Dodgers (9-3) have won nine consecutive games against the Rockies (7-5) in Los Angeles dating to last season. The Rockies finished their six-game road trip 3-3 after sweeping the Giants in San Francisco, then crashing back to earth at Dodger Stadium. The Rockies were shut out for the first time this season.\n\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\n\n\u201cWe knew we had our hands full,\u201d Tulowitzki said. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re a confident bunch. It just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nBetween a Nolan Arenado single in the second inning and a Charlie Blackmon single in the sixth, McCarthy retired 11-of-12 hitters. The Rockies didn\u2019t get past first base until the sixth inning when pinch-hitting Rafael Ynoa walked, then hustled to third on Blackmon\u2019s single. But he didn\u2019t score.\n\nMcCarthy struck out six and walked only two. In three games this season, he has 25 strikeouts and just three walks.\n\nButler may pitch from the top of the Rockies\u2019 rotation someday. But six games into his career, he\u2019s less than steady. In three games this season, he has 10 strikeouts and 11 walks. Sunday, the 24-year-old allowed six hits in five innings, finishing with four strikeouts and a walk. He forced red-hot Dodgers star Adrian Gonzalez to foul out in the fifth with the bases loaded.\n\nBut the two runs Butler allowed in the second \u2014 on back-to-back RBI doubles from Scott Van Slyke and Joc Pederson \u2014 put the Rockies in too deep a deficit.\n\n\u201cThey put some good swings on it,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThey\u2019re swinging it well right now.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies had an opportunity to rally in the sixth against Mc- Carthy. With runners on first and third and the boppers at bat, Carlos Gonzalez popped up to short and Tulowitzki\u2019s grounder to McCarthy turned into a threat-killing double play.\n\n\u201cWe had our opportunity there,\u201d Tulowitzki said. \u201cThat was really our only chance.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgers took advantage in the sixth. Against reliever Scott Oberg, they busted out with home runs from Howie Kendrick, Van Slyke and Pederson. The Dodgers scored five in the frame. Christian Bergman came in with one out and pitched the rest of the game.\n\nThe Rockies return to Coors Field for a seven-game homestand against the Padres and Giants that starts Monday.\n\n\u201cReality is, we didn\u2019t play well enough to win a series here (in Los Angeles),\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cWe have to play better than we did. You have to play tight, clean games against these guys.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies crash back to earth, swept by Dodgers, Brandon McCarthy", "title": "Rockies crash back to earth, swept by Dodgers, Brandon McCarthy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/19/rockies-crash-back-to-earth-swept-by-dodgers-brandon-mccarthy/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-19T17:22:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-19T17:22:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd556f\"", "article_summary": "The Los Angeles Dodgers used their major league-record salary budget to get Brandon McCarthy.\n\u201cReality is, we didn\u2019t play well enough to win a series here (in Los Angeles),\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.\nHe\u2019s a completely different pitcher.\u201dThe first-place Dodgers (9-3) have won nine consecutive games against the Rockies (7-5) in Los Angeles dating to last season.\nThe Rockies didn\u2019t get past first base until the sixth inning when pinch-hitting Rafael Ynoa walked, then hustled to third on Blackmon\u2019s single.\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 What does a $270 million payroll buy?"}
