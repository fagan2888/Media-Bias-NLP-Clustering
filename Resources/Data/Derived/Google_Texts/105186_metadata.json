But it has improved.\u201d\n\nThomas made an NFL-record 12 touchdown receptions through nine games. He had such a big lead that two weeks later he still tops all NFL players in touchdowns.\n\nC.J. and the blockers. At their team meeting Monday, the Broncos awarded running back C.J. Anderson with their king spot parking space in the players\u2019 lot this week \u2014 his award as the team\u2019s player of the week. Anderson rushed for 167 yards, the most by a Broncos\u2019 undrafted player, against the Dolphins.\n\nThe team also will issue game balls to its five starting offensive linemen \u2014 Ryan Clady, Orlando Franklin, Will Montgomery, Manny Ramirez and Louis Vasquez \u2014 plus tight end Virgil Green and third offensive tackle-eligible Paul Cornick for their yeoman\u2019s blocking work against the Dolphins.\n\nUnstopping the run. Two weeks ago, the Broncos were No. 1 in rushing defense, allowing only 67 yards per game on 3.2 yards per carry. But in their past two games against St. Louis and Miami, Denver\u2019s defense has allowed 228 yards on 54 carries, 4.2 yards per.\n\n\u201cTeams are being tricky now with personnel,\u201d said Broncos defensive tackle Terrance Knighton, who was on the sideline as the Dolphins were doing much of their running damage in the first quarter. \u201cWe just have to adjust.\u201d\n\nRe-introducing Omar. Omar Bolden, a fourth-round pick in the 2012 draft, had one of the best games in his three-year career Sunday as he returned three kickoffs for 100 yards and was in on 15 defensive plays as a safety, outside corner and inside corner.\n\nIt felt good to feel sore again Monday.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the sorest I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Bolden said. \u201cBecause of returning kicks, too \u2014 I\u2019m not used to getting tackled.\u201d\n\nBolden showed promise as a rookie kick returner, going 103 yards for a touchdown in a preseason game at Arizona and averaging 19.3 yards per return in the regular season.\n\n\u201cThen we signed Trindon,\u201d Bolden said, referring to Trindon Holliday, who was a sensational returner in the 2012 season. \u201cThat was that.\u201d\n\nGutsy Fox. A common gripe Broncos fans have with head coach John Fox is he leans on the conservative side. But Fox made two against-the-odds decisions on one late drive Sunday that turned the game in the Broncos\u2019 favor.\n\nIt was the final play of the third quarter, his team was down, 28-17 and facing fourth-and-2 on the Miami 41. Fox had his offense go for it rather than punt and play field position. Just as surprisingly, the Broncos didn\u2019t call a Peyton Manning pass, instead handing off to Anderson, who ran for 20.\n\nThen after finishing the drive with a touchdown to make it 28-23, Fox went for the two-point conversion, even though there was more than 14 minutes remaining. The Broncos\u2019 converted when Manning connected with Emmanuel Sanders to make it 28-25.\n\n\u201cWhen it works, it\u2019s all good,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWhen it doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019re the village idiot.\u201d\n\nInjury update. Backup cornerback Kayvon Webster (right shoulder) will miss practice time this week and might miss the game against Kansas City. Cornerback Aqib Talib is day-to-day with a pulled hamstring. It probably won\u2019t be known until later in the week whether linebacker Brandon Marshall clears the concussion protocol.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Briefs: Julius Thomas (ankle) could return for Broncos vs. Chiefs", "title": "Briefs: Julius Thomas (ankle) could return for Broncos vs. Chiefs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/24/briefs-julius-thomas-ankle-could-return-for-broncos-vs-chiefs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141124__SP14BRONCOSCHIEFS_3AO6951xp1.jpg", "height": 451}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141124__SP14BRONCOSCHIEFS_3AO6951xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-24T16:40:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T14:29:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d82\"", "article_summary": "More healing is necessary but there\u2019s a chance Broncos tight end Julius Thomas will return to play in the AFC West showdown Sunday night at Kansas City.\nBut Fox made two against-the-odds decisions on one late drive Sunday that turned the game in the Broncos\u2019 favor.\n1 in rushing defense, allowing only 67 yards per game on 3.2 yards per carry.\nThomas missed the Broncos\u2019 39-36 victory Sunday against Miami and all but a few plays in their previous week\u2019s loss at St. Louis because of a severely sprained left ankle.\nBackup cornerback Kayvon Webster (right shoulder) will miss practice time this week and might miss the game against Kansas City."}
