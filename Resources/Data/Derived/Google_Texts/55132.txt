Keep The Promise 1, a super PAC supporting Sen.Ted Cruz , released two ads Monday in Iowa and South Carolina attacking Donald Trump on his previous support for partial-birth abortions and show him heaping praise on Cruz for fighting against Obamacare.

The ads titled “I Like Ted Cruz” and “EXTREME” are part of a previously announced $2.5 million TV buy in the two early primary states, and will be airing throughout this week.

Kellyanne Conway, president of Keep the Promise 1, said, “The life of a child at 8 or 9 months gestation is not a political football; it is a matter of principle and conscience.”

Keep The Promise 1 is heavily funded by Hedge Fund CEO Robert Mercer, who donated $11 million to the group in April. The super PAC has in the past given $500,000 to a pro-Carly Fiorina super PAC.
