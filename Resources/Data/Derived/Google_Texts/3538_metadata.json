But he also noted the outbreaks of measles across the country. At last count, there were more than 10 dozen cases across 17 states for 2015.\n\nAnd Murthy is urging measles shots for everyone, especially children.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still many people out there who are unware of the fact that vaccines are safe and effective because we haven\u2019t seen measles in this country in epidemic proportions for a long time,\u201d says Murthy. \u201cMany parents may think that it\u2019s a thing of the past or that it\u2019s not so important to get vaccinated. But it absolutely is.\u201d\n\nHealth officials say for people without the vaccine, they have a 90 percent chance of catching measles from an infected person.\n\nA since-discredited study claiming autism is caused by certain vaccines \u2013 including measles -- has been blamed for discouraging people from getting shots.\n\nThe U.S. Surgeon General also visited Ohio\u2019s sole Ebola Treatment Center. MetroHealth\u2019s Ebola facility shares space with its burn unit.\n\nJennifer Hanrahan, MetroHealth\u2019s Head of Infection Control, showed Murthy around.\n\n\u201cThis is what\u2019s called a negative pressure room,\u201d she explained outside a glass-paned entryway. \u201cIt\u2019s a ventilation system that doesn\u2019t allow the air to come out here, so that people get exposed.\u201d\n\nLast month, the CDC designated MetroHealth as an Ebola Treatment Center. Surgeon General Murthy says he was pleased with the response here in the Greater Cleveland area last fall to an Ebola scare, and is happy there have been no more cases in the U.S. since last year.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly thought that has gone into insuring that we are investing wisely and appropriately in designating treatment centers where there is the greatest likelihood of travelers coming through.\u201d\n\nBut Hanrahan says while state and federal funding will help ensure a ready response here, she\u2019s unsure when and how much.\n\n\u201cThe personal protective equipment, there\u2019s the staff time to do the training, there\u2019s a lot of different things that go into it. Conservatively it\u2019s about 1.6 million dollars per year.\u201d\n\nHanrahan adds that there are still threats with infectious diseases ahead, especially with deployed soldiers coming home soon.\n\nRight now there are 200 staffers trained, and two beds at MetroHealth to house future Ebola patients.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Surgeon General made his first visit to Cleveland yesterday, where he toured the MetroHealth Medical Center. ideastream's Brian Bull reports.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "ideastream", "description": "The U.S. Surgeon General made his first visit to Cleveland yesterday, where he toured the MetroHealth Medical Center. ideastream's Brian Bull reports.", "title": "U.S. Surgeon General Makes First Visit To Cleveland", "url": "http://www.ideastream.org/news/us-surgeon-general-makes-first-visit-cleveland", "image": {"secure_url": "https://ideastream-production.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/2015/0212elevator.jpg", "identifier": "http://ideastream-production.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/2015/0212elevator.jpg"}, "updated_time": "2015-02-12T13:05:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-11T23:44:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-12T13:05:10-05:00"}, "keywords": "ideastream, wcpn, wviz, 90.3, cleveland public radio, channel 25, wviz/pbs, 90.3 wcpn, cleveland public media, wviz/pbs ideastream, 90.3 wcpn ideastream, wcpn ideastream, wviz ideastream, cleveland, ohio, 104.9 FM, WCLV, WCLV 104.9", "google-site-verification": "YaOLAImmbo8IrZtjGAAHQYvbhtD-xUhGeJ1QDi4beRI"}, "article_summary": "Surgeon General also visited Ohio\u2019s sole Ebola Treatment Center.\nMetroHealth\u2019s Ebola facility shares space with its burn unit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ventilation system that doesn\u2019t allow the air to come out here, so that people get exposed.\u201dLast month, the CDC designated MetroHealth as an Ebola Treatment Center.\nA since-discredited study claiming autism is caused by certain vaccines \u2013 including measles -- has been blamed for discouraging people from getting shots.\nSurgeon General Murthy says he was pleased with the response here in the Greater Cleveland area last fall to an Ebola scare, and is happy there have been no more cases in the U.S. since last year."}
