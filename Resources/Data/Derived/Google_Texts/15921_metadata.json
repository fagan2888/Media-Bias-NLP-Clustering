And a similar proportion said it\u2019s difficult for them to afford health care.\n\nMeanwhile, 78 percent of voters said they favored increasing government oversight of health insurance companies to ensure their listings of in-network doctors and other health care providers are up to date. Only 18 percent opposed the idea.\n\nAt the state Capitol on Wednesday morning, DiCamillo presented an early look at the survey to a panel of five health care experts and about 50 audience members.\n\nWhile most of the discussion focused on the first-day poll results that showed a majority of California voters are embracing the reforms introduced by the Affordable Care Act \u2014 commonly called \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 the tobacco tax issue was extremely timely.\n\nThat\u2019s because during this month\u2019s special legislative session, lawmakers began laying the groundwork to pass a new tax on health care plans that would fund health care for the poor, as well as a package of anti-smoking bills that aim to lower the state\u2019s health care costs by reducing the number of Californians who use tobacco products.\n\nDr. Richard Pan, D-Sacramento, is sponsoring the new bill that would raise the cost of a pack of cigarettes by $2 \u2014 a measure similar to his bill that stalled in the Legislature earlier this year. He noted that California\u2019s current 87-cent-per-pack tobacco tax makes the state 33rd in the nation, far below New York, which charges a tax of $4.35 a pack. The state levies are on top of a $1.01 federal tax on cigarettes.\n\nPan\u2019s measure would also impose a groundbreaking tax on e-cigarettes. The legislation also stipulates that the revenue collected must be used to increase the number of physicians in California, combat bootlegging and support existing health care programs managed by the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCalifornia had been a leader in the fight against Big Tobacco, but tobacco is still costing us money and lives \u2014 and it has to stop,\u201d Pan said in an interview with this newspaper.\n\nBecause tax and fee increases require the support of two-thirds of lawmakers in both houses of the Legislature, Democrats seeking to raise taxes will need help from their GOP colleagues.\n\nA rally for the $2-per-pack tax was held Wednesday next to the Capitol by the Save Lives California coalition, made up of groups such as the California Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and the Service Employees International Union.\n\nThe coalition said that if the Legislature fails to muster the two-thirds vote to pass the tax, it will put the tax proposal on the 2016 ballot.\n\nThe need for new revenue to cover the state\u2019s growing health care costs is \u201ccritically important,\u201d she said, noting that there will be a \u201cbig hole\u201d in the state\u2019s budget for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s health program for the poor, unless the Legislature acts to pass a new tax on managed health care plans.\n\nPan said he knows it won\u2019t be easy to convince Republicans to support a tax increase, but he said he believes a tobacco tax is a \u201cwin-win\u201d for taxpayers because it would increase revenue and decrease costs simultaneously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to step away from the rhetoric and look at the facts,\u201d Pan said. \u201cBut if my colleagues refuse to support this, we\u2019ll take it to the ballot. The people will pass this.\u201d\n\nDiCamillo said he\u2019s not surprised that respondents expressed such overwhelming support for a $2-per-pack cigarette tax, because so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d on tobacco and alcohol have always been popular.\n\nIf the Legislature fails to enact the tax, he said, the poll results showing 67 percent support for the measure may not mean much if the issue goes to the ballot and voters are bombarded by negative advertising paid for by Big Tobacco.\n\nOne of the biggest controversies generated by the Affordable Care Act is the issue of inaccurate provider directories listed by health insurers. The issue has remained a sore subject for thousands of Californians who over the last 22 months enrolled in a health care plan under the health law only to discover that doctors and hospitals listed under their plans were not accepting them.\n\nSenate Bill 137, carried by Sen. Ed Hernandez, D-West Covina, would require health plans and insurers to post accurate health care provider directories on their websites.\n\nThe Assembly Appropriations Committee was set to take up the bill on Thursday morning, but the high estimated costs to implement the change may hinder its success.\n\nThe poll of 1,555 California registered voters was done over the phone from June 25 to July 16. While the majority of the interviews were conducted in English, 328 were done in Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog and Hindi. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SACRAMENTO \u2014 A day after a state senator revived a bill to hike the state\u2019s cigarette tax by $2 a pack, a new Field Poll unveiled Thursday found that two-thirds of California voters back such a tax increase.That\u2019s one of th", "title": "Cigarette tax: California voters overwhelmingly back $2-a-pack increase", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20150829/cigarette-tax-california-voters-overwhelmingly-back-2-a-pack-increase", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20150829/NEWS/150829370/AR/0/AR-150829370.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1000px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Cigarette tax: California voters overwhelmingly back $2-a-pack increase"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "SACRAMENTO \u2014 A day after a state senator revived a bill to hike the state\u2019s cigarette tax by $2 a pack, a new Field Poll unveiled Thursday found that two-thirds of California voters back such a tax increase.That\u2019s one of th", "title": "Cigarette tax: California voters overwhelmingly back $2-a-pack increase", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20150829/cigarette-tax-california-voters-overwhelmingly-back-2-a-pack-increase", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20150829/NEWS/150829370/AR/0/AR-150829370.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "State taxes, State taxes news, Los Angeles State taxes news, CA State taxes news, US State taxes news, world State taxes news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "State taxes, State taxes news, Los Angeles State taxes news, CA State taxes news, US State taxes news, world State taxes news."}, "article_summary": "SACRAMENTO \u2014 A day after a state senator revived a bill to hike the state\u2019s cigarette tax by $2 a pack, a new Field Poll unveiled Thursday found that two-thirds of California voters back such a tax increase.\nAnd a similar proportion said it\u2019s difficult for them to afford health care.\nHe noted that California\u2019s current 87-cent-per-pack tobacco tax makes the state 33rd in the nation, far below New York, which charges a tax of $4.35 a pack.\nThe poll of 1,555 California registered voters was done over the phone from June 25 to July 16.\nPan said he knows it won\u2019t be easy to convince Republicans to support a tax increase, but he said he believes a tobacco tax is a \u201cwin-win\u201d for taxpayers because it would increase revenue and decrease costs simultaneously."}
