Will rain dampen Fourth of July fireworks in metro Denver Saturday evening? Maybe, maybe not, depending on which neighborhood you live in.

The sporadic nature of Colorado’s thunderstorms of late gives the metro Denver area 20 percent chance of showers after 3 p.m.

But that could help cool off the 93-degree high, with the expected peak about the same time, according to the National Weather Service office in Boulder.

The chance of showers and thunderstorms along the Front Range persists until 11 p.m.

Scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop over the mountains Saturday afternoon at dusk, sparking isolated storms on the Front Range and Eastern Plains in the late afternoon, the National Weather Service warned.

“The main threat from the storms will be wind gusts to 45 mph, lightning and brief heavy rain,” the National Weather Service stated. “There will be more instability on the Eastern Plains so an isolated severe thunderstorm is possible east of Sterling and Akron with large hail and damaging winds.”

Some areas of the state can’t handle much more rain. A flood warning is in effect for the Arkansas River near Avondale in Pueblo County.

There also is a flood warning Sunday afternoon along the Arkansas River near La Junta affecting Otero County.

Rain chances in Denver climb Sunday to 30 percent from daylight to midnight, with a forecasted high of 88, forecasters said.

All week in Denver the skies could yield afternoon showers, but the temperatures are expected to moderate to a high of 72 degrees on Monday, 78 on Tuesday and 81 degrees Wednesday but could climb back into the upper 80s and low 90s by the weekend.

The average daily high in July at the city’s weather-monitoring station and Denver International Airport is 89.4 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.
