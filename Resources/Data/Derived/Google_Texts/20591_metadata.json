Unfortunately, that\u2019s often just wishful thinking. In fact, re-admissions \u2014 sometimes within just a couple weeks \u2014 are such a big problem that the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) includes measures to address the problem.\n\nPut simply, the law provides financial incentives for hospitals to improve readmission rates and financial sticks with which to punish hospitals where the problem persists. Improve the problem, get more funding. Keep readmitting patients within short windows after discharge, don\u2019t get paid for treatment. The latter scenario is bad for patients and bad for hospitals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to studies, about a quarter of Medicare patients treated for heart failure are readmitted within 30 days, and heart-failure re-admissions alone cost Medicare about $15 billion a year. Predictions about how many of those are preventable range from less than 20 percent up the the Department of Health and Human Services estimate of 75 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you can predict that, that\u2019s a huge, huge cost saving for the hospitals,\u201d said Ankur Teredesai, who manages the Center for Data Science at the University of Washington, Tacoma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, help might be on the way thanks to a research project by Teredesai and his Center for Data Science colleagues. It\u2019s called the Risk-O-Meter, and it\u2019s already being used by one hospital system in the Seattle area. Now, the researchers who created it are looking to commercialize it, either by licensing the access to the cloud-based service or by starting their own company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the hood of the web and mobile applications that allow doctors to enter patient information and receive a risk score is a machine learning system that analyzes more than 100 attributes about each patient. These range from standard stuff such as vital signs, lab results and medical history to more-personal stuff such as a patient\u2019s demographic information and living conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the Risk-O-Meter has much more utility than simply as a one-off risk-scoring app, Teredesai explained. Risk scores change as patients progress through treatment, helping doctors to evaluate treatment options on an ongoing basis. Even after patients leave the hospital, hospital staff can benefit from alerts indicating it\u2019s a good time to check up on a patient, or to call with reminders about taking medication.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoctors can also drill down into the data in order to figure out what factors are causing a score to spike. This type of analysis is important because a high score could be caused by a non-medical factor that\u2019s easy enough to account for once a patient is discharged. For example, Teredesai said, \u201cThe chances of then getting readmitted are higher \u2014 much higher \u2014 if [patients] live alone. \u2026 The models actually show that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the treatment front, he noted that although doctors will often keep patients for 13 days after heart failure, the project\u2019s models show that risk scores drop significantly after 10 days, but then rise again after 13 days. So perhaps those three extra days aren\u2019t really necessary, and might even help cause a readmission, Teredesai said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Risk-O-Meter team is also working on a way to help doctors evaluate the effectiveness, or risk, of various intervention options, although Teredesai noted that\u2019s still a work in progress. It\u2019s potentially a very valuable tool, though, because a system that can model specific treatments against the profiles of specific patients could result in more effective treatment plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team also wants to integrate the risk-scoring system into existing electronic medical records systems in order to cut down on the number of tools doctors have to use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeredesai said the system was designed with privacy in mind, which is why it runs on a HIPAA-compliant cloud platform (Microsoft Azure) and lets hospitals choose what data they want send for analysis. Whatever they send, though, it remains anonymous and is discarded once it\u2019s scored against the models. The system doesn\u2019t keep any patient info, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a lot of activity \u2014 and a lot of capital investment \u2014 at the intersection of big data and health care, but many efforts, including IBM Watson and startup Lumiata, are more diagnostic in nature. A lot have been strictly academic research or the results of individual hospital systems analyzing their own data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat might be most appealing about the Risk-O-Meter is that it\u2019s a broadly deployable cloud service that promises better patient outcomes while also helping hospitals where it matters most to them \u2014 their bottom lines. Hospital CIOs and administrators know they need to do both, and anything that can plausibly deliver has to at least get a serious look.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "How machine learning is saving lives while saving hospitals money", "application-name": "Gigaom", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-14", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "dcterms.creator": "Derrick Harris", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-14", "keywords": "affordable-care-act, big data, data science, electronic medical records, health care, machine-learning, medical data", "news_keywords": "affordable-care-act, big data, data science, electronic medical records, health care, machine-learning, medical data", "author": "Derrick Harris", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ecebe6", "dcterms.publisher": "Gigaom", "description": "Researchers at the University of Washington, Tacoma, have built a machine learning system capable of predicting readmission risks for congestive heart failure", "robots": "NOODP", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://gigaom.com/wp-content/themes/go-ossein/library/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "6AFF4FA8C591A576B80A612AF591A343", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-07-14", "og": {"image": "https://gigaom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2012/11/health-spending.jpg"}, "dcterms.subject": "affordable-care-act; big data; data science; electronic medical records; health care; machine-learning; medical data", "google-site-verification": "qCPIC6UK_23CR6SxLn2bCjE-Ow0OSYoDExoi699IE98", "y_key": "a09dd3172406080e"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb5d\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s called the Risk-O-Meter, and it\u2019s already being used by one hospital system in the Seattle area.\nPut simply, the law provides financial incentives for hospitals to improve readmission rates and financial sticks with which to punish hospitals where the problem persists.\nRisk scores change as patients progress through treatment, helping doctors to evaluate treatment options on an ongoing basis.\nA lot have been strictly academic research or the results of individual hospital systems analyzing their own data.\nEven after patients leave the hospital, hospital staff can benefit from alerts indicating it\u2019s a good time to check up on a patient, or to call with reminders about taking medication."}
