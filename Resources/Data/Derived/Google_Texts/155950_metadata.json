But rebuilding his confidence remains a work in progress.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself one of the favorites here,\u201d the No. 3-ranked Spanish star said Saturday at a pre-tournament news conference. \u201cI would be lying if I say I feel that I am ready to win.\u201d\n\nNadal remains a fixture in the elite group of men\u2019s stars known as The Big Four, along with No. 1 Novak Djokovic, No. 2 Roger Federer and No. 6 Andy Murray. He favors any of those three to win the Australian Open, which starts Monday.\n\n\u201cIn terms of being favorites, the other names are more favorite than me at this time,\u201d he said during the news conference, slumped in his chair and repeatedly casting his eyes downward as he spoke.\n\nAn injury to his right wrist followed by appendix surgery kept Nadal out of competition for most of the last six months of 2014, a year that also had its share of triumphs. Nadal won a record ninth French Open and three other titles in the first half of the year. And despite his subsequent absence, he finished 2014 in the top three for the ninth time in a decade.\n\nNadal\u2019s season opener at the Qatar Open earlier this month, where he lost in the first round to a qualifier, didn\u2019t help his morale. He the first to admit he\u2019s not back at 100 percent.\n\nAsked what aspect of his game he was happiest with, Nadal replied: \u201cNothing.\u201d He followed up with a smile but made it clear he wasn\u2019t entirely joking. \u201cNo, I am not serving bad. My serve is working more or less well. I need to be a little but more dynamic on court with my movements.\u201d\n\nThe big question about Nadal over the years has been his durability, and whether his body could hold up to the constant pounding of his hard-charging tennis style.\n\nNadal did not enter the U.S. Open in 2012, part of an extended absence because of a problem with his left knee. He won the U.S. Open in 2013 but didn\u2019t defend his title because of the right wrist injury.\n\nIt was the second time Nadal chose to not attempt a defense of a major title: A year after winning Wimbledon in 2008, he missed that tournament with knee tendinitis.\n\nAt the start of 2015, he is reluctant to say he is fit, knowing that any match can present dangers.\n\nIs his wrist better? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not 100 percent confident yet.\u201d\n\nAs for his knees: \u201cI am confident about my knees because (they) are working well,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother question mark is his back. He received stem cell treatment to repair cartilage in his back in November shortly after the appendix surgery.\n\n\u201cI need to take care about this for the moment,\u201d Nadal said, referring to his back. \u201cHopefully (it) will be fine.\u201d\n\nNadal knows how to boost his confidence. He needs to win.\n\n\u201cEvery time you come back, you have doubts, you have the feeling that you are far from your best,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cThe only thing I can say is I need to play better, yes. But the only way to play better is to win matches.\u201d\n\nNadal will hope to win his first match on Monday, the third of the tournament on Rod Laver Arena, against former top 10-player Mikhail Youzhny.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Asked to predict who will win this year's Australian Open, Rafael Nadal takes a deep breath, shrugs his shoulders and insists it won't be him.", "Author": "JOCELYN GECKER", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Asked to predict who will win this year\u2019s Australian Open, Rafael Nadal takes a deep breath, shrugs his shoulders and insists it won\u2019t be him.", "title": "Rafael Nadal an extreme pessimist ahead of Australian Open", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/17/a-pessimistic-rafael-nadal-heads-into-the-australi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/17/437e0c50bd1e73026b0f6a706700f730.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/17/437e0c50bd1e73026b0f6a706700f730.jpg", "title": "Rafael Nadal an extreme pessimist ahead of Australian Open", "description": "Asked to predict who will win this year's Australian Open, Rafael Nadal takes a deep breath, shrugs his shoulders and insists it won't be him.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) - Asked to predict who will win this year\u2019s Australian Open, Rafael Nadal takes a deep breath, shrugs his shoulders and insists it won\u2019t be him.\nIs his wrist better?\nNadal won a record ninth French Open and three other titles in the first half of the year.\nHe favors any of those three to win the Australian Open, which starts Monday.\nNadal did not enter the U.S. Open in 2012, part of an extended absence because of a problem with his left knee."}
