In an NBC/WSJ poll taken before the meltdown in Iraq, Obama gets his lowest marks ever on foreign policy, where his claim to \u201csmart power\u201d has evidently reached its expiration date. But the real danger to Obama and to Democrats vying for office in less than five months is the vote of no confidence in Obama\u2019s leadership:\n\nThe percentage of Americans approving of President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of foreign policy issues has dropped to the lowest level of his presidency as he faces multiple overseas challenges, including in Iraq,according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Additionally, the public is evenly split on whether Obama is a competent manager of the federal bureaucracy. And a majority of respondents \u2013 54 percent \u2013 believe the term-limited president is no longer able to lead the country. \u2026 Just 37 percent approve of his handling of foreign policy, which is an all-time low in the survey, while 57 percent disapprove, an all-time high. What\u2019s more, by a 44 percent-to-30 percent margin, Americans disagree with the Obama administration\u2019s decision to secure the release of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five imprisoned Taliban fighters.\n\nObama\u2019s job approval comes in at 41/53, the second-worst in the NBC/WSJ series (March 2014\u2019s 41/54 is the nadir). The 37/57 on foreign policy is a record low for Obama, and the economy is nearly at a historical low at 41/54. But it\u2019s the leadership issues that will make headlines today. In terms of competency, Obama now ranks below Bush at the analogous point in time of his predecessor\u2019s presidency. Post-Katrina Bush had a 53/46 rating for competency, while it\u2019s an even split at 50/50 for Obama. Thirty-one percent say Obama isn\u2019t competent at all, compared to 24% for Bush in the same time frame, and that\u2019s a ten-point increase for Obama from last June.\n\nThat last metric isn\u2019t an anomaly. Only 15% believe that Obama\u2019s performance has improved over the past year, while 41% think it has gotten worse. The top areas in which those respondents believe Obama has gotten worse are ObamaCare, foreign policy \u2014 and the Taliban 5 swap for Bowe Bergdahl, with the economy and Obama\u2019s dishonesty rounding out the top five. Small wonder, then, that only 42% of respondents think Obama can still lead this nation, while 54% reject Obama\u2019s leadership.\n\nAs Chuck Todd tells Morning Joe, \u201cThis is the public saying your presidency is over\u201d:\n\nI\u2019d disagree with Chuck on what this means for Democrats, though. While it\u2019s true that the Congressional polling isn\u2019t a disaster for Democrats, voters will be looking for ways to fill the leadership vacuum and deal with the perceived incompetence and dishonesty at the White House \u2014 and they won\u2019t be choosing Democrats for that mission.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cThis is the public saying your presidency is over.\u201d", "title": "NBC/WSJ poll finds 54% have no confidence in Obama\u2019s leadership", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/06/18/nbcwsj-poll-finds-54-have-no-confidence-in-obamas-leadership/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/PBy5LgQ6Cq4/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/PBy5LgQ6Cq4/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Barack Obama, Chuck Todd, dishonesty, economy, foreign policy, incompetence, leadership, lies, NBC/WSJ poll,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-18T12:41:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-18T14:09:27+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8d4\"", "article_summary": "NBC/WSJ poll finds 54% have no confidence in Obama\u2019s leadershipposted at 8:41 am on June 18, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyThe sixth-year blues have caught up to Barack Obama \u2026 with a vengeance.\nSmall wonder, then, that only 42% of respondents think Obama can still lead this nation, while 54% reject Obama\u2019s leadership.\nThe 37/57 on foreign policy is a record low for Obama, and the economy is nearly at a historical low at 41/54.\n\u2026 Just 37 percent approve of his handling of foreign policy, which is an all-time low in the survey, while 57 percent disapprove, an all-time high.\nIn an NBC/WSJ poll taken before the meltdown in Iraq, Obama gets his lowest marks ever on foreign policy, where his claim to \u201csmart power\u201d has evidently reached its expiration date."}
