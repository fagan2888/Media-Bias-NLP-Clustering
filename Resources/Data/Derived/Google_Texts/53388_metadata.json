John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion blew past projections in its first year, putting 471,452 Ohioans on Medicaid and costing taxpayers $2.1 billion.\n\nBecause enrollment has so dramatically exceeded Kasich administration estimates \u2014 the governor expected 366,00 to enroll by July 2015 \u2014 the Obamacare money appropriated to pay for program benefits will be exhausted months early.\n\nIf recent enrollment and cost trends persist, Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion will be more than $1 billion over budget by the time Ohio\u2019s 2015 fiscal year ends on June 30. Actual Obamacare expansion claim expenditures reported by the Ohio Department of Medicaid are shown below.\n\nIn 2013 after Kasich, a Republican, unilaterally expanded Medicaid to able-bodied, working-age adults with no dependent children, his Medicaid director asked the Ohio Controlling Board to accept Obamacare funds for the expansion. Controlling Board members were warned the state Medicaid program would go bankrupt if they refused.\n\nLed by a Kasich appointee, the quasi-legislative panel approved the Ohio Department of Medicaid\u2019s request to appropriate $2,561,200,000 for Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion. The new federal spending was meant to cover benefit costs from Jan. 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015.\n\nBased on Ohio Department of Medicaid expenditure reports, the state paid out $2,124,778,839 in Obamacare expansion claims from January through December of 2014. With enrollment racing farther ahead of state projections each month, monthly spending increased sharply throughout the year.\n\nBenefit payments for Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion cost taxpayers $301,628,170 in December, $288,605,185 in November and $290,359,524 in October. Program expenditures averaged $266 million per month for the first six months of the 2015 fiscal year.\n\nUnless Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion abruptly breaks from a year-long trend, appropriated funding for the program will run out within the next month. The governor\u2019s Office of Health Transformation did not immediately respond to Ohio Watchdog questions about how this might be addressed.\n\nThe federal government is currently paying 100 percent of benefit costs, but the State of Ohio will be on the hook for 10 percent by 2020. With the national debt exceeding $18 trillion and Republicans in control of Congress, federal matching funds for the Obamacare expansion are likely to be cut sooner.\n\nKasich is well aware of the national debt, and has recently been traveling to other states calling for a balanced federal budget. He promoted the Obamacare expansion during several stops on a six-state Balanced Budget Forever tour this month.\n\nEnrollment in Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion is expected to continue growing, but even at current enrollment it would cost Ohio taxpayers $360 million per year to cover just 10 percent of the program\u2019s benefits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now substantially flown by Governor Kasich\u2019s original and revised estimates for enrollees. With a cost nearing $8,000 per year per enrollee, the tab for Ohioans in just two years is getting bigger by the month,\u201d Matt Mayer, president of free-market think tank Opportunity Ohio, said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cShould Governor Kasich\u2019s balanced budget amendment project succeed, Ohioans will get stuck with an even greater bill, as the federal deficit spending that currently funds Medicaid is slashed,\u201d Mayer added. \u201cGod forbid we go into recession driving enrollment even higher and state revenues down.\u201d\n\n\u201cContrary to Governor Kasich\u2019s view, the best course of action is not to hasten the fiscal collapse of the federal government by increasing deficits and the national debt, thereby guaranteeing states will be forced to carry a greater share of the costs and taxpayers will be hit with higher taxes as part of an entitlement \u2018reform\u2019 package,\u201d Mayer wrote in an Opportunity Ohio policy brief published Thursday.\n\n\u201cAs a wise man once said, when you find yourself in a hole, the best thing to do is stop digging,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe governor is expected to include a continuation of his Obamacare expansion in the proposed 2016-2017 budget his office will release Monday. A two-year appropriation for the expansion would likely cost federal taxpayers more than $6 billion.\n\nOhio House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger, a Clarksville Republican, has signaled surrender to Kasich on the Obamacare expansion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
