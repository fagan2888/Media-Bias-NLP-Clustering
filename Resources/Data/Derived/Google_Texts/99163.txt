DES MOINES—Johnston attorney Adam Gregg today announced his candidacy for Attorney General for the State of Iowa. Gregg announced his resignation effective immediately from the Governor’s office, and will seek the nomination at the Republican State Convention on June 14th. Gregg will then challenge Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who was first elected to the office in 1978.

Gregg is a native of Hawarden, Iowa, where his family still resides. He attended Central College in Pella, Iowa, where he played football and graduated at the top of his class. Gregg then attended Drake Law School in Des Moines on an academic scholarship, and graduated with high honors. Upon graduation, he joined Brown Winick, a prestigious Iowa law firm.

While at the law firm, Gregg maintained a general practice of law, including business matters such as litigation, contracts, and forming new companies. In 2012, Gregg joined the senior staff of the Governor’s office, where he handled legislative liaison duties, and helped secure passage of the largest tax cut in Iowa’s history, historic education reform, and a state based, Iowa alternative to Obamacare.

Gregg said, “I am running for Attorney General for a very simple reason. I’ve got the passion and the energy to fight everyday for Iowa families, Iowa farmers, and our constitutional freedoms. As Iowa’s Attorney General, I’ll be an advocate for open government and I’ll hold Washington, DC accountable when the federal government oversteps its bounds. It’s time Iowa has an Attorney General that represents the people of Iowa.”

“When the interests of Iowa farmers, businesses and individuals are challenged, it is the duty of the Attorney General to stand up for them,” Gregg added. “As Iowa’s Attorney General, I won’t be interested in chasing headlines. I’ll be interested in enforcing the laws and protecting Iowans in every court in which our interests are threatened.”
