Elijah Cummings (MD), the panel\u2019s top Democrat, outdid Gowdy in terms of passion, delivering a bellowing opening statement that unleashed criticism on the GOP for its \u201cfishing expedition\u201d against the former first lady.\n\nRepublican leaders \"set them loose, Madame Secretary, because you're running for president,\u201d he said, to which Clinton subtly nodded.\n\nRelated: House Republicans Give Clinton Another Gift on Benghazi\n\nClinton, fully aware that she was speaking to a national audience, struck a mournful tone that lowered the temperature from the heated back and forth display put on by the committee\u2019s leaders.\n\nIn a measured voice, Clinton spoke about each of the four Americans killed in the attack, particular Ambassador Chris Stevens, saying she \u201cknew and admired\u201d him, and sought to rise above the accusations surrounding the Benghazi siege.\n\n\"I took responsibility and, as part of that, before I left office I launched reforms to help protect our people in the field,\" Clinton said.\n\nHer statement began with a focus on Libya, not the politics surrounding the committee, and expanded into an argument for active U.S. foreign policy, saying America must lead in a dangerous world and diplomats must continue representing the nation in dangerous places. The comments were meant to head off GOP questions about why the U.S. had a presence in Libya in the first place.\n\nClinton noted Benghazi wasn\u2019t the first time U.S. diplomats were killed overseas, naming the Beirut attacks under President Reagan, the attacks in Africa during his husband\u2019s presidency and the September 11 attacks.\n\nShe closed with a bipartisan call to members to come together on proposals that would improve security for U.S. diplomats in the future\n\n\"We need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad, leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The web of politics surrounding the latest congressional investigation in the 2012 ass", "title": "Clinton\u2019s Benghazi Hearing Lays Bare the Politics at Play", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/22/Clinton-s-Benghazi-Hearing-Lays-Bare-Politics-Play", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Hillary%20Clinton%20testifying%20at%20Benghazi%20hearing.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/22/Clinton-s-Benghazi-Hearing-Lays-Bare-Politics-Play", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Hillary%20Clinton%20testifying%20at%20Benghazi%20hearing.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The web of politics surrounding the latest congressional investigation in the 2012 ass", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5d16\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNot a single member of this Committee signed up for an investigation into you or your email system,\u201d he said.\nThe defensive statement was vastly different from the somber opening remarks Gowdy delivered at the panel\u2019s first public hearing a little over a year ago.\nRepublican leaders \"set them loose, Madame Secretary, because you're running for president,\u201d he said, to which Clinton subtly nodded.\nClinton noted Benghazi wasn\u2019t the first time U.S. diplomats were killed overseas, naming the Beirut attacks under President Reagan, the attacks in Africa during his husband\u2019s presidency and the September 11 attacks.\nThe comments were meant to head off GOP questions about why the U.S. had a presence in Libya in the first place."}
