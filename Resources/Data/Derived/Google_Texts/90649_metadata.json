Guys in commando gear doing the robot dance. Really. Drink it in:\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\nThe dancing commandos were part of a ceremony inaugurating Patriot Park, a military theme park that Russian President Vladimir Putin opened this week in the town of Kubinka.\n\nRelated: Putin Lets Criminals Bring Money back to Russia\n\nAccording to state-owned Sputnik News, the park offers visitors \u201ca unique opportunity to \u2018test\u2019 Russia's heavy weapons, such as the T-90 tank, or the famous Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopter. Although only military training simulators are on offer, they still give the full experience of carrying out a special mission to their intrepid pilots and drivers, both young and old alike. Visitors will also be able to shoot Kalashnikov rifles and take part in extreme sports.\u201d\n\nThough construction on some parts of the facility isn\u2019t expected to wrap up until 2017, Putin helped open the park this week to visitors as well as to participants in the 2015 \u201cinternational military-technical expo,\u201d featuring the many defense-related products that Russian arms manufacturers sell around the world.\n\nRelated: 10 Really Weird Things the Russian Army Wants to Sell You\n\nBeyond serving as a conference site, Putin said that the park would be \"an important element in [Russia's] system of military-patriotic work with youth,\u201d Sputnik reported.\n\nAmong other things, the park is slated to offer paintball, extreme sports, slot machines, equestrian grounds, simulated parachute jumps, and displays of Russian military might, including something called \u201ctank ballet,\u201d which is actually a thing.\n\nAbove all, the park will be a monument to the Russian military. It will include large historical reconstructions representing various conflicts, including Napoleon\u2019s ill-fated invasion of Russia in 1812, both world wars, and Russia\u2019s war in Afghanistan in the 1980s.\n\nThe park will be open to families, who will be able to stay in hotels that, according to promotional materials, \u201cwill be in the form of bunkers, dugouts and trenches with stoves, field kitchens and baths. The family can gather in the day and plunge at any time into the history of the Great Patriotic War.\u201d\n\nRelated: U.S. Move in Europe Prompts \u2018Cold War\u2019 Charge from Russia\n\nIt was unclear whether rats, trench foot, and lice would be included.\n\nFinally, like any good amusement park, it has a gift shop.
