Jenn Biela of High-Touch High-Tech led a group of school-age kids in a series of experiments with chemistry Saturday at the Indian Trails Library in Wheeling.

In the program, called "Chemistry Fun," the children learned about chromatography and capillary action, made silly putty and, of course, mixed vinegar and baking soda with an added twist of soap and food coloring.

"The really fun part is that we're going to make silly putty using food coloring, glue and a Borax solution," Biela said just before the event's start.
