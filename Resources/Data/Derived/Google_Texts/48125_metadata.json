The move comes in the wake of CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s last month donation of $25 million. Today the site is asking its users to give to charities such as the Red Cross, Save the Children, and International Medical Corps.\n\nAs crowdfunding sites and grass roots campaigns grow, social media is becoming a go-to method to generate public awareness of certain threats. A well-timed, emotionally charged message can reach millions, and suddenly sites like Twitter and Facebook don\u2019t just connect people; they can give them a reason to care and act.\n\n\u201cWhen people see their friends doing an action, that will generate feed stories and that will have a multiplying effect on the action,\u201d said Naomi Gleit, Facebook\u2019s vice president of product management, according to BusinessWeek. As per the new plans, atop each person\u2019s news feed will be a button the user can click to donate. Facebook is hoping the easy-to-use interface will give people added incentive to open their wallets.\n\nEbola is the most recent disease in a growing line of socially-driven fights. This summer saw the booming popularity of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, a forward-thinking, pyramid-style movement designed to raise awareness and money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research. For each person that dumped a bucket of ice water on his or her head, three more people were called upon to do the same. If you didn\u2019t dump, you donated. The trend worked. In the entire 2013-2014 fiscal year, the ALS Association took in only $26.3 million. Between July and August of this year, it received over $100 million.\n\nHIV spread may also fall to the almighty power of the weak tie. Last month, a team of behavioral psychologists from UCLA took to Twitter to understand how people\u2019s open communication of sexual activity might reveal their personal health risks. The team\u2019s study found 140 characters provide ample information to locate the most at-risk users and to coordinate those people with those who can guide them toward testing. Sean Young, study co-author and founder of the Center for Digital Research at UCLA, called social media a \u201crich source of psychological and health-related data\u201d that gets generated \u201cin an environment in which people are often willing to share freely.\u201d\n\nFacebook and Twitter are research gold mines, in other words. They\u2019re full of useful things people like Young and other public health officials can exploit for the sake of learning about people\u2019s attitudes toward public health threats. People see their friends getting tested and suddenly feel compelled to do the same, either out of a genuine interest in being healthy, a desire not to get left out, or some mix of both. Information moves between populations in an instant. What was once an unknown, underfunded concern can now become an international cause to act.\n\nThe point of social media sites is changing. Ebola\u2019s move from West Africa to the U.S. and other countries reveals people don\u2019t just want to see pictures of their friends\u2019 cats. They want a way to express their civic ideals and to help people in meaningful ways. The sites don\u2019t always work \u2014 people are still fallible creatures \u2014 but each ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and reduced rate of HIV spread is another sign the system has potential for real change.\n\nThe next step is seeing whether people\u2019s news feeds can generate the same response, in order to stop one of the year\u2019s deadliest, most talked-about diseases that has already claimed thousands.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "facebook, installs, ebola, donation, button, effort, leverage, power, social, media", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Sites like Facebook and Twitter don't just connect people, they give them a reason to care and act.", "title": "How Social Media Helps Stop Disease Spread", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/facebook-installs-ebola-donation-button-effort-leverage-power-social-media-309578", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/06/socialmedia.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sites like Facebook and Twitter don't just connect people, they give them a reason to care and act.", "title": "How Social Media Helps Stop Disease Spread", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/facebook-installs-ebola-donation-button-effort-leverage-power-social-media-309578", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/06/socialmedia.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/06/socialmedia.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2014-11-06T11:07:38-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-06T11:07:36-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Sites like Facebook and Twitter don't just connect people, they give them a reason to care and act."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbe8\"", "article_summary": "As crowdfunding sites and grass roots campaigns grow, social media is becoming a go-to method to generate public awareness of certain threats.\nThe point of social media sites is changing.\nThey\u2019re full of useful things people like Young and other public health officials can exploit for the sake of learning about people\u2019s attitudes toward public health threats.\nAs per the new plans, atop each person\u2019s news feed will be a button the user can click to donate.\nA well-timed, emotionally charged message can reach millions, and suddenly sites like Twitter and Facebook don\u2019t just connect people; they can give them a reason to care and act."}
