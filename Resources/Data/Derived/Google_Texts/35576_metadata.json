On Jan. 1, the bank closed its $50 billion purchase of Merrill Lynch, a deal Lewis had hastily negotiated the previous September, as the financial world appeared close to collapse.\n\nJust weeks later, it all came a cropper, after Bank of America revealed, shockingly, that its new unit had lost more than $15 billion during the fourth quarter of 2008. That bank had to ask the government to backstop $118 billion in Merrill\u2019s toxic assets, and to provide it $20 billion in additional capital. The stock dropped below $7 a share from over $33.\n\nFurious shareholders sued. But they also did something else: Led by the Service Employees International Union and Finger Interests, a Houston hedge fund, shareholders offered a binding resolution at the annual meeting calling for Lewis to step down from his role as board chairman. The idea was that having separate people serve as C.E.O. and chairman would provide additional board oversight.\n\nThe resolution narrowly passed. Several participants have since told me that they believe it\u2019s the only example of shareholders passing a binding resolution over a board\u2019s objection.\n\nFast forward to last October. Without question, Bank of America has come a long way since those dark days. Under Brian Moynihan, who has been the chief executive \u2014 but not the chairman! \u2014 since 2010, the company has \u201creduced leverage, rebuilt its capital and simplified its business,\u201d according to Jonathan Finger, comanaging partner of Finger Interests, which remains a shareholder. But the bank has also had trouble passing the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cstress tests,\u201d had a $4 billion accounting error in 2014, and its stock has underperformed its banking industry peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThus for all its improvement, the evidence suggests that the bank still needs the kind of rigorous oversight that an independent board \u2014 with an independent chairman \u2014 is supposed to provide. Yet, in October, without informing shareholders, the board decided to remove the provision in its bylaws splitting the roles, and anoint Moynihan chairman as well as C.E.O.\n\nWhen they discovered what had happened, shareholders and corporate governance experts were, once again, outraged. \u201cWhat hubris!\u201d exclaimed Finger. Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential proxy advisory firm, urged shareholders to vote against the members of the board\u2019s governance committee.\n\nBarraged by shareholder criticism, the board announced just before its annual meeting that it would set up a special meeting to allow shareholders to vote on whether to give the board, as the bank put it, the \u201cflexibility\u201d to split or combine the roles, as it sees fit.\n\nThe most vocal critic of the board\u2019s move has been Mike Mayo, an outspoken bank analyst at CLSA. He was especially scornful of a Securities and Exchange Commission filing the bank made late last month in support of the board\u2019s move. It touted Moynihan\u2019s \u201cunparalleled depth of understanding,\u201d and as proof, pointed to the $11.7 billion Bank of America earned \u201cin the three quarters ending June 30, 2015.\u201d (There was no mention of the $4 billion accounting error.)\n\n\u201cThe gushing is like a teen magazine,\u201d Mayo said. \u201cThis is supposed to be a regulatory filing.\u201d In addition, he complained that using three quarters of a year as a benchmark was an example of the bank\u2019s \u201ccherry-picking data to make itself look good. It does that all the time,\u201d he said. Mayo\u2019s conclusion was that the document itself proved that Bank of America needed more board oversight, not less. Handing the chairman\u2019s role to the chief executive was an example of the board \u201crolling over\u201d for Moynihan instead of holding his feet to the fire.\n\nI should note that Bank of America\u2019s relationship with Mayo is contentious; it essentially believes he has been consistently wrong in his nonstop criticism of the bank. (He is one of the few analysts with a \u201csell\u201d recommendation on the stock, for instance.)\n\nIt also says that its decision to remove the bylaws provision was prompted by necessity; last October its chairman needed to resign quickly, and Moynihan, in the board\u2019s opinion, was the best candidate to fill the role. In failing to inform shareholders, the board misread the situation, the bank acknowledges. It is now trying to rectify its error with the special meeting, set for Sept. 22.\n\nTo my mind, the core issue is not whether the bank is well or poorly run, or whether Mayo is right or wrong about the stock. It is the contempt the Bank of America board showed for its shareholders in quietly amending the bylaw \u2014 a contempt too often shown by boards that are supposed to protect shareholders, not defy them.\n\nWhat the bank\u2019s board did last October is not the biggest scandal ever; I know that. Instead, it\u2019s the kind of small, corrosive scandal that too often marks the behavior of the modern company board.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150814215331, "twitter": {"description": "For a while, bank officials accepted a binding resolution forced upon them.
