Illinois police officers are among the latest Obamacare victims, who had their hours reduced so cities wouldn't have to provide health insurance to part-time employees.In December, Blake Frund, 24, who works for a police department in Central Illinois, was informed that his hours were being reduced from 39 hours per week to 28 hours, which meant $300 less per month in income, a local NBC News affiliate is reporting, according to theFrund said that the loss of income is "almost a paycheck" for him."Why do we need Obamacare?" he asked.Frund said that he knew some of his hours would be cut, he just didn't know how much, as municipalities as well as businesses are also mandated to provide health insurance for employees working over 30 hours per week under Obamacare.Fortunately, after President Barack Obama extended the mandate for businesses to provide health insurance for their employees in early February, Frund received a notice from the police chief that his nearly-40 hours per week were being reinstated, but he's still skeptical about the future."It relieved me, but OK, is it another year? Could it be six months? When am I going back to 28 hours a week?" he said.Frund said that his plan is to save as much money as he can "in case this happens again."
