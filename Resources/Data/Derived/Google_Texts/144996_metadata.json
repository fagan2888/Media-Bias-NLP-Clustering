But it also raises fresh concerns as we rush head first to embrace the latest technology.\n\nConsumers are tracked more than ever before by advertisers and data brokers that monitor their activity on the Web and smartphones. Government agencies can collect and scrutinize that data, too. For corporations, the spread of networked machines raises the specter of electronic attacks. Industrial powers are concerned that rival nations, hacktivists, or terrorists could penetrate the most critical parts of their infrastructure \u2014 say, the power grid.\n\nWe will apply trademark Monitor reporting\u2014 thoughtful, analytical, and solutions-oriented\u2014 as we cover security and privacy. Passcode has a 15-person team of editors, writers, and founding columnists who are leaders in the field. We also have a network of Monitor correspondents around the world, bringing you stories from places like Berlin and Beijing.\n\nWe launch in January.
