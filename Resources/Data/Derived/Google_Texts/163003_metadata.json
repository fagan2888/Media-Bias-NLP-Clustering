Alan Grayson (D-FL) rejected the notion that he is the Democratic Party\u2019s version of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).\n\nIn fact, Grayson is so disgusted at the suggestion that said Cruz is \u201ctrying to hasten the apocalypse\u201d and compared him to Jim Jones, a religious cult leader responsible for the deaths of 909 people.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz represents the element of the Republican Party that\u2019s trying to hasten the apocalypse,\u201d Grayston told MSNBC host Richard Lui. \u201cThese are people who think that Obamcare is helping to save lives, and they want to destroy it anyway. These are people who understand a government shutdown causes chaos to the economy, and they want to do it anyway. These are people who understand defaulting on the national debt would drive unemployment sky high, and they want to do it anyway.\u201d\n\nLui noted that Cruz was recently given the \u201cStatesman of the Year\u201d award by the Sarasota County (FL) Republican Party, despite criticism from prominent Republicans. The host asked how Grayson dealt with criticism from his own party.\n\n\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t gotten that kind of criticism from my own party. But, in any event, calling [Cruz] the \u2018Statesman of the Year\u2019 would be like calling Jim Jones the \u2018Religious Leader of the Year,\u2019 for much the same reason,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to create sort of a mass suicide cult called the Tea Party and lead it. I don\u2019t think I can be accused of anything similar to that.\u201d\n\nThe far-leftist Florida Democrat went on to say that the Democratic Party \u201cis not a fringe group,\u201d adding that \u201c[i]f there were an Olympic gold medal for demagoguery, Ted Cruz would win the gold.\u201d\n\nGrayson is known for lobbing bombs at political opponents. In 2009, he said that Republicans opposed Obamacare because they want the sick to \u201cdie quickly.\u201d That sort of absurd rhetoric cost him his seat in 2010, though he managed to slither his way back into the House in 2012.\n\nMore recently, since going back to Washington, Grayson has compared the Tea Party to the Ku Klux Klan and welcomed the rise of \u201cstealth socialism\u201d in the United States.\n\nH/T: Conservative Intel", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alan Grayson,Democratic Party,Democrats,Jim Jones,Jonestown,MSNBC,ObamaCare,Richard Lui,Tea Party,Ted Cruz,Ted Party,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "description": "Alan GraysonIn an interview last week on MSNBC, Rep.
