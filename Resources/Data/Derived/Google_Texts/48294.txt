UM Health System expands ACO, adds 2,900 doctors statewide

The University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor has expanded its Physician Organization of Michigan ACO, an Affordable Care Act-enabled program that cares for more than 120,000 Medicare patients, by adding more than 2,900 physicians and four medical groups across the state of Michigan.



POM ACO now features 5,700 doctors, nurses and other health care providers in 12 medical groups in 22 counties, said David Spahlinger, M.D., executive director of the University of Michigan Faculty Group Practice and chair of the POM ACO board.



“Our commitment to improving the health of individuals and populations, and containing the growth of health care costs, grows even stronger with this transition,” said Spahlinger in a statement.
