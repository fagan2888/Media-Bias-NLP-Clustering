BOULDER — Police said the man accused of stealing a garbage truck in Boulder and then leading cops on a chase down U.S. 36 may have been “freaked” by officers near his home on an unrelated call just before the alleged theft.

A police report on the incident released Thursday night shed some light on the possible motivation behind the bizarre series of events that led to the arrest of Daniel Morkert, 26, of Boulder, on suspicion of auto theft, careless driving and eluding a police officer on Wednesday.

According to the report, a neighbor said Morkert got “freaked” when officers showed up in the area of his apartment at 2995 College Ave. at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday on an unrelated call.

An officer at the scene wrote in the report that Morkert exited his apartment during the call with his pitbull named Diesel, thanked the officer and then asked, “Can I borrow your police car?”
