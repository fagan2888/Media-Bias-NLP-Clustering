In an exclusive interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Sylvia Mathews Burwell responded to the videos that surfaced this week of MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber in which he criticized American voters and their knowledge of the system.\n\n\u201cI have to start with how fundamentally I disagree with his comments about the bill and about the American people,\u201d Burwell said.\n\nThe controversy began this week when videos surfaced of Gruber speaking about the writing and passage of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe just tax the insurance companies, they pass on the higher prices, that offsets the tax break we get, it ends up being the same thing,\u201d Gruber told an audience at the University of Rhode Island in 2012. \u201cSo (it's) a very clever, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter.\u201d\n\nCritics of the healthcare reform law have used Gruber\u2019s comments to stoke debate about the ACA and a future challenge in Congress. Burwell further pushed back on the comments, saying, \u201cSince I\u2019ve been at the department, one of the things that I\u2019ve focused on is transparency, making sure all of our numbers come out whether they\u2019re good or bad.\u201d\n\nBurwell told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd that 100,000 people submitted applications for plans on the Health Insurance Marketplace, and over 500,000 were able to log in. All told, Burwell says over one million people have been able to \u201cwindow shop\u201d on the site.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Sylvia Burwell: Health Care Law Experiencing Strong and Healthy Growth 1:02 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nWhen asked about projections for 2015 enrollment being lowered from 13 million to roughly 9 million, Burwell cited fewer than expected people switching from employer coverage.\n\n\u201cWe said there\u2019d be 28 percent growth,\u201d said Burwell about the change in projection. \u201cAnd we believe, in the second year of a new Marketplace, 28 percent growth is strong and healthy growth.\u201d\n\nIN-DEPTH\n\n\u2014 Shaquille Brewster and Dale Armbruster", "article_metadata": {"description": "HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told Chuck Todd that she 'fundamentally' disagrees with controversial comments made by an architect of the ACA.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/health-secretary-burwell-im-focused-transparency-n249511", "type": "article", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_42/716816/141015-sylvia-burwell-jsw-718a_5899b0160780af90ac31433e42d8bde8.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told Chuck Todd that she 'fundamentally' disagrees with controversial comments made by an architect of the ACA."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told Chuck Todd that she 'fundamentally' disagrees with controversial comments made by an architect of the ACA.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_42/716816/141015-sylvia-burwell-jsw-718a_5899b0160780af90ac31433e42d8bde8.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Health Secretary Burwell: 'I'm Focused on Transparency' - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-16", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/health-secretary-burwell-im-focused-transparency-n249511", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Meet the Press,Health Care"}, "article_summary": "All told, Burwell says over one million people have been able to \u201cwindow shop\u201d on the site.\nPlay FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusEmbed HHS Secretary: 'Fundamentally Disagree' With Gruber's Comments 1:53 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blogThe Secretary for Health and Human Services said Sunday morning that she does not agree with controversial comments recently made by one of the architects of health care reform.\n\u201cI have to start with how fundamentally I disagree with his comments about the bill and about the American people,\u201d Burwell said.\n\u201cWe said there\u2019d be 28 percent growth,\u201d said Burwell about the change in projection.\nPlay FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusEmbed Sylvia Burwell: Health Care Law Experiencing Strong and Healthy Growth 1:02 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blogWhen asked about projections for 2015 enrollment being lowered from 13 million to roughly 9 million, Burwell cited fewer than expected people switching from employer coverage."}
