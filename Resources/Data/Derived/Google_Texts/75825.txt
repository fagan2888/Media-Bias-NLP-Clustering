ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) â€” The Trump Taj Mahal casino is offering to restore health insurance to its workers as part of a last-ditch effort to keep the struggling Atlantic City casino open.

Trump Entertainment Resorts tells The Associated Press it has offered to restore health insurance to its 3,000 workers for at least two years if the union will drop its appeal of a court order that canceled the health insurance and pension plan for casino workers.

Bob McDevitt, president of Local 54 of the Unite-HERE union, declined comment on the offer, made in a letter to him.

Company president Robert Griffin told McDevitt the casino plans to close Dec. 12 and that the shutdown process will accelerate next week. But he says if the union withdraws its appeal, the Taj will remain open.
