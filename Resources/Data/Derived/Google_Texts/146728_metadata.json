Courtesy Rob Lindsey\n\nHe looked to his insurance company and found not only no financial support but no understanding.\n\n\u201cThe way that I\u2019ve felt is helpless,\u201d Stinson said of his experience in navigating his insurance policy. \u201cBecause my needs are less of an issue because you don\u2019t want to take the time to understand it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of private and public insurance companies have discriminatory exclusions to our health care, even though the medical community has said it is medically necessary,\u201d said Dru Levasseur, a lawyer with the LGBT advocacy organization Lambda Legal.\n\n\u201cSomeone has to do something.\u201d\n\nA few changes have been made in policy, at least regarding public insurance. At the end of May, the Obama administration lifted the 33-year ban on gender reassignment surgery coverage through Medicare. While Medicare covers people 65 or older or on disability, the decision is expected to influence other insurance providers to cover transgender-related surgeries. The Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination based on gender identity, but some in the transgender community have taken issue with the fact that the law leaves defining discrimination to individual states.\n\nBut in the meantime, Stinson, like many, is left feeling that a medical transition is something only the wealthy can undertake.\n\n\u201cIf you are not affluent or don\u2019t have the resources to pull from, a medical transition is nearly impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact you have to have money to feel validated in your identity \u2026\u201d\n\nHe trailed off, unable to find the words.\n\nThe vast majority of the medical community has come out in support of the removal of financial barriers to transgender health needs. The American Medical Association\u2019s policy is that the \u201cAMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender identity disorder as recommended by the patient\u2019s physician.\u201d\n\nThose last words are key, Levasseur said. Gender identity disorder, commonly called gender dysphoria these days, has no set manifestation. The identity and subsequent needs vary from individual to individual. Stinson needs hormone treatment and reconstructive surgery on his chest to feel validated. Another transgender man might have other needs entirely.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that there is the magical formula to transition,\u201d Levasseur said. \u201cIt is an individualized process, and that\u2019s the doctor\u2019s determination of medical necessity.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that many insurers, private and public, have long considered these operations cosmetic.\n\n\u201cThat is where the ignorance lies,\u201d Levasseur said. \u201cIn the meantime, people are really suffering,\u201d\n\nHe went on to describe hearing stories of attempted self-castrations after some individuals felt they have run out of options. A 2014 survey found that transgender individuals report an attempted suicide rate of 41 percent.\n\n\u201cThese exclusions will be a dark point in LGBT history,\u201d Levasseur said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Expensive procedures that many insurance companies see as cosmetic leave many looking for creative financing", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/6/8/crowdfunding-gendertransition.html", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/6/8/crowdfunding-gendertransition/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article", "description": "Expensive procedures that many insurance companies see as cosmetic leave many looking for creative financing", "title": "When costs prohibit gender reassignment surgery, some raise funds online"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/6/8/crowdfunding-gendertransition/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "description": "Expensive procedures that many insurance companies see as cosmetic leave many looking for creative financing", "card": "summary", "title": "When costs prohibit gender reassignment surgery, some raise funds online"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Transgender, Health Care, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Gender identity disorder, commonly called gender dysphoria these days, has no set manifestation.\n\u201cSomeone has to do something.\u201dA few changes have been made in policy, at least regarding public insurance.\n\u201cIf you are not affluent or don\u2019t have the resources to pull from, a medical transition is nearly impossible,\u201d he said.\nStinson needs hormone treatment and reconstructive surgery on his chest to feel validated.\nAt the end of May, the Obama administration lifted the 33-year ban on gender reassignment surgery coverage through Medicare."}
