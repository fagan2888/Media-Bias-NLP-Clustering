Or she got fired in which case you have not confirmed this so I still will not go to the zoo and discourage others from going.\u201d\n\nThe zoo responded: \u201cThis individual is no longer employed by the Zoo.\u201d\n\nMany commenters said they would continue to support the zoo.\n\n\u201cWe hope you continue to hold Brookfield Zoo in high regard and not let the actions of one individual overshadow the longstanding good work of the Chicago Zoological Society,\u201d Ms. Katzen said.\n\nMeanwhile, a Facebook group titled, \u201cI stand with Shana Poohpooh Latrice,\u201d has reached 512 members.\n\n\u201cThis group\u2019s purpose is to decry the violent and racist [upheaval] of one of Brookfield Zoo\u2019s finest employees!
