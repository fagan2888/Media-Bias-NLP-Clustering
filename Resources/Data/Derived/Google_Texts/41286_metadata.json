That\u2019s good for all of us,\u201d said Kerin Mase, president and CEO of Marian Regional Medical Center.\n\n\u2014 Amy Bernstein is a publicist representing CenCal Health.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.noozhawk.com/article/cencal_health_presents_dignity_health_with_healthcare_innovation_award_for", "image": {"width": 628, "identifier": "http://www.noozhawk.com/images/made/images/uploads/Cencal_Dignity_628_419_c1.jpg", "height": 419}, "type": "website", "title": "CenCal Health Presents Dignity Health With Healthcare Innovation Award for Outstanding Care, Service"}, "verify-v1": "2OdRnTnazKl17MQhud6CSYZNIXpr4puwbj3YpymvWFI="}, "article_summary": "Source: Amy Bernstein for CenCal HealthCenCal Health, the health care program serving low-income residents of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, presented a Healthcare Innovation Award to Dignity Health at its board meeting Wednesday, May 18, 2016.\n\u201cHowever, integrating these 50,000 people into the local health care system \u2014 linking them with physicians, conducting health assessments, treating untreated conditions, etc.\nAll area hospitals and many physicians also participated in the CenCal Health program, named the Access to Care for the Expansion Population program (ACE).\nThe ACE program aims to coordinate the many health care needs of thousands of formerly uninsured individuals that now have health coverage through the ACA.\n\u201cBy directing people in need to a medical home, (a team-based health care delivery model) rather than the emergency room, where patients are able to receive quality medical care, and maximize health outcomes at a lower cost."}
