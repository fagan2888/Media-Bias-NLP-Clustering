Now, Lerner is speaking out and offering no apologies for her role in the scandal.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Lerner told Politico, echoing the few words she uttered to a congressional panel investigating the targeting. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my career and the job I did for this country.\u201d\n\n>>> Commentary: Politico Found Lerner. So Why Can\u2019t the U.S. Attorney?\n\nBreaking her silence in the news media since the story of the IRS\u2019s aggressive scrutiny of conservative groups broke more than a year ago, Lerner defended her tenure.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whatever else happens, I know I did the best I could under the circumstances and am not sorry for anything I did,\u201d she told Politico.\n\n\u201c\u2026I did the best I could under the circumstances and am not sorry for anything I did,\u201d former IRS official Lois Lerner tells Politico.\n\nWhile she was head of the IRS division overseeing tax exempt organizations, right-leaning groups were forced to answer invasive questions on applications and waited years before receiving action on their request for tax exempt status. That unusual scrutiny that prompted dozens of congressional hearings and an ongoing investigation into whether Lerner was operating on her own or under orders from the White House.\n\n>>> In Depth: Why Americans Should Be Concerned About the IRS and Political Bias\n\nLerner began working at the IRS in 2001 after 20 years at the Federal Election Commission. She had limited knowledge of tax law and IRS operations.\n\n\u201cHer fuse was short, and if you come to the IRS, you better be able to sit and listen and ask questions and absorb and rethink,\u201d Debra Kawecki, an attorney who worked with Lerner until 2006, told Politico. \u201cAnd she had a hard time doing that.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, Lerner took over the tax exempt organizations division.\n\nFollowing the landmark Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court upholding independent political activity as free speech, she expressed skepticism.\n\nIn several emails, Lerner supported legislation by Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., to require more disclosure from political groups receiving tax exempt status. Similarly, she commended the writer of a June 2012 email about how states created their own disclosure rules in the wake of the Citizens United decision.\n\n\u201cYou done good!\u201d Lerner wrote. \u201cNow, if you can only fix the darn law!\u201d\n\nLerner, though, contended in the Politico interview that she is \u201cnot a political person\u201d and said she has a history of supporting candidates across the political spectrum.\n\n>>> Commentary: More Evidence of Lois Lerner\u2019s Liberal Bias\n\nLarry Noble, Lerner\u2019s former boss at the FEC, agreed and said she was \u201cnever partisan.\u201d\n\nHowever, FEC Commissioner Lee Ann Elliott and Craig Engle, who worked with Lerner at the FEC, said ideology affected her work.\n\n\u201cLois\u2019 ideology is against money in politics, is \u2018anti-contribution;\u2019 that\u2019s her bias,\u201d Engle told Politico. \u201cHer ideology inhibited fair administration of the law.\u201d\n\nOn May 22, 2013, Lerner invoked her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. According to Politico, the IRS placed her on indefinite administrative leave.\n\nFormer IRS official Lois Lerner pled the Fifth before Congress. Now, she\u2019s breaking her silence to the media.\n\nLerner officially retired in September 2013 and now receives a $100,000 annual pension, Politico reported.\n\nLast March, Lerner pleaded the Fifth once more before the House Oversight Committee. Afterward, the entire House voted to hold her in contempt of Congress..\n\nCongressional investigators have released emails from Lerner in which she refers to conservatives as \u201ccrazies\u201d in addition to a vulgar anatomical term.\n\nLerner and husband Michael Miles, a lawyer, said such messages were taken out of context.\n\n>>> Commentary: The Latest Clue That the Justice Department Investigation of the IRS Scandal is a Sham\n\nThe bulk of Lerner\u2019s emails sent between 2009 and 2011 \u2014 the period when conservative groups were targeted \u2014 were reported lost after what the IRS said was a computer crash three years ago. The agency only told lawmakers of the crash in June.\n\nSome House Republicans and other critics contend the IRS tried to cover up the contents of the emails. Lerner, though, rebuffed the idea that she crashed her own computer.\n\n\u201cHow would I know two years ahead of time that it would be important for me to destroy emails,\u201d she said, \u201cand if I did know that, why wouldn\u2019t I have destroyed the other ones they keep releasing?\u201d\n\nSeveral emails obtained by congressional investigators show Lerner became aware that tea party groups faced additional scrutiny in 2010 and attempted to correct the agency\u2019s \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d criteria when she found out about it in 2011. IRS employees, Politico reported, continued the practice.\n\nSome congressional Republicans have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor. Lerner\u2019s allies, though, call her a scapegoat.\n\nFormer IRS official Lois Lerner on IRS targeting scandal: \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\n\n>>> Exclusive: Liberal Senator Preparing Report That Dismisses Allegations of IRS\u2019 Tea Party Targeting\n\n\u201cYou could take her out of there and just stand in a different person, and no matter who it is, we would have the same result,\u201d Karen Gries, a tax lawyer who previously worked with Lerner, told Politico. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is reflective of Lois the individual or Lois the professional.\u201d\n\nLerner told Politico she struggles to find employment and has received a multitude of hate mail and death threats. Federal agents were called to protect her at home following one threat. Her two daughters and mother-in-law also received \u201chate calls.\u201d\n\nLerner staunchly told Politico that the public was hearing only one side of the story.
