FRANKLIN (Somerset) An Elizabeth man is being held in the Somerset County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail after he was charged with robbing a township convenience store on Aug. 25.

Junior Perez, 22, has been charged with armed robbery, conspiracy, possession of cocaine and possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana.

Somerset County Prosecutor Geoffrey Soriano said a video surveillance camera captured a light-colored Nissan Altima driving in the area of the Hamilton Street store at the time of the robbery. The vehicle had a black bumper and was missing a rear driverâ€™s side hubcap..

At about 4:11 p,m, Aug. 31, a Franklin Township patrol officer stopped a vehicle, driven by Perez, that matched the description of the car in the surveillance video, Soriano said. When Perez got out of the car, a small bag containing cocaine fell to the ground, Soriano said. Perez was then placed under arrest without incident and transported to Franklin Township Police Headquarters

In their investigation, Franklin Township detectives discovered that Perez drove unknown individuals on Aug. 25 to the area of the convenience store for committing an armed robbery, the prosecutor said.

One of his passengers entered the store brandishing a gun and demanded money from the clerk. An altercation ensued between the suspect and store employees, and the suspect fled the store without getting any money, Soriano said.

Perez acted as a lookout and was to whistle if he saw the police responding, Soriano said.

A search of Perez's car found a BB gun and a small bag of marijuana, the prosecutor said.
