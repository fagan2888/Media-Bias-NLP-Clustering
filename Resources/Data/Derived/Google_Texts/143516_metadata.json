The students found Americans have little faith in the U.S. government. (Photo: Photo: Provided)\n\nA majority of Americans don\u2019t place much trust in the government, according to a national poll by Purdue University undergraduates.\n\nNine students in the Purdue Institute of Civic Communication crafted 75 questions among four polls, which were distributed to more than 4,500 American adults between October and April by Penn Schoen Berland, a global political research organization.\n\n\u201cWe spend a lot of time outside of class trying to think of questions that aren\u2019t just surface level questions, that are insightful, that will offer unique perspective and kind of break through the noise,\u201d said Frank Speek, a senior studying political science and history.\n\nThe polling unit will present its findings at 6 p.m. Wednesday at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201c(It\u2019s) the first time a national poll, as far as we know, has ever been done by undergraduate students,\u201d said Carolyn Curiel, a professor of communications and former ambassador. \u201cIt\u2019s a poll on civic competence and there\u2019s three measurements: What do you know, what do you do and how do you feel about the state of civic society?\u201d\n\nHow do you feel?\n\nWhile some statistics are encouraging, others are frightening.\n\nIn the civic confidence portion, for instance, nearly 40 percent of Americans reported they don\u2019t trust any branch of government.\n\nHalf reported they don\u2019t think the U.S. is prepared to protect them from unseen crises, and two-thirds said they think government is more concerned more about protecting big business.\n\nWhat do you know?\n\nOn the bright side, the civic knowledge portion found a large majority \u2014 more than 90 percent \u2014 of Americans correctly identified \u201cObamacare\u201d as the Affordable Care Act, the purpose of the Social Security program, the definition of a tax and the country to which New Mexico is home.\n\nSmaller majorities \u2014 between 68 percent and 84 percent \u2014 correctly identified the three branches of government, the amount of national debt, the definition of the Federal Reserve and what comprises the Bill of Rights.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nWhen it comes to civic participation, nearly a third of Americans said they don\u2019t volunteer or give money to support a community service; 43 percent said they rarely participate in local programs or initiatives.\n\nThose living in the Midwest were the most likely to volunteer, according to the polling report.\n\nMore than half said the best way to affect change is through voting, while a concern about the country\u2019s direction drives more than a third to the polls for presidential elections.\n\nForty-three percent said they seek news daily, while more than half value accurate news content over unbiased, serious, timely or satirical reports.\n\nThe presentation at the National Archives coincides with an Institute for Civic Communication\u2019s annual Maymester in Washington, D.C. Students attending this year will meet for class sessions at C-SPAN, The Washington Post and the White House.\n\n\u201cIt really bridges the gap between the Midwest and D.C. in a way I don\u2019t think any other program does,\u201d said Katie Cahill, a graduate assistant for the civic institute at Purdue. \u201cIt\u2019s important for students.\u201d\n\nBy the numbers\n\n37%\n\nof Americans reported they don\u2019t trust any branch of government\n\n50%\n\nsaid they don\u2019t think the U.S. is prepared to protect them from unseen crises\n\n62%\n\nsaid they think the government cares more about protecting big business\n\n28%\n\nsaid they don\u2019t volunteer or give money to support community services\n\n48%\n\nrarely participate in local programs or initiatives\n\n51%\n\nbelieve the best way to affect change is through voting\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.jconline.com/1bNofLB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "9 Purdue students polled 4,500 Americans to assess civic engagement in the country today", "og": {"site_name": "Journal and Courier", "description": "9 Purdue students polled 4,500 Americans to assess civic engagement in the country today", "title": "Adults don\u2019t trust gov\u2019t, Purdue report says", "url": "http://www.jconline.com/story/news/college/2015/05/12/adults-trust-govt-purdue-report-says/27196727/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/jconline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "9 Purdue students polled 4,500 Americans to assess civic engagement in the country today", "title": "Adults don\u2019t trust gov\u2019t, Purdue report says", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b52be4510d606b930ea315096d25a6e7e3644b0/c=286-0-1143-857&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/12/LafayetteIN/B9317318946Z.1_20150512171811_000_GR4AP0OBG.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@JCOnline", "site": "@JCOnline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=815251197", "fb": {"app_id": 150121088373528}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Photo: Provided)A majority of Americans don\u2019t place much trust in the government, according to a national poll by Purdue University undergraduates.\nHalf reported they don\u2019t think the U.S. is prepared to protect them from unseen crises, and two-thirds said they think government is more concerned more about protecting big business.\nIn the civic confidence portion, for instance, nearly 40 percent of Americans reported they don\u2019t trust any branch of government.\n\u201cIt really bridges the gap between the Midwest and D.C. in a way I don\u2019t think any other program does,\u201d said Katie Cahill, a graduate assistant for the civic institute at Purdue.\nNine students in the Purdue Institute of Civic Communication crafted 75 questions among four polls, which were distributed to more than 4,500 American adults between October 2014 and April 2015."}
