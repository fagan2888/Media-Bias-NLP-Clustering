Chris Christie\u2019s \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal\n\nPresident Barack Obama is blaming his rocky relationship with Republicans in Congress on Rush Limbaugh, and the constant stream of bad press he receives from Fox News.\n\nIn the New Yorker follow-up interview to the magazine\u2019s in-depth portrait of the President, Obama is described as being \u201cparticularly touchy\u201d when discussing the notion that his inability to compromise with Republicans prevents him from passing more legislation. The publication\u2019s initial interview made media waves earlier this week due to his comments about marijuana.\n\nAlso read: Glenn Beck Cops to Making Many Mistakes at Fox News; Helping \u2018Tear the Country Apart\u2019\n\n\u201cThe issue has been the inability of my message to penetrate the Republican base so that they feel persuaded that I\u2019m not the caricature that you see on Fox News or Rush Limbaugh,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut I\u2019m somebody who is interested in solving problems and is pretty practical, and that, actually, a lot of the things that we\u2019ve put in place worked better than people might think.\u201d\n\nIf the voters don\u2019t trust him, Obama explained, then the Republican politicians they elected can\u2019t compromise with him, because their constituents will consider it \u201ca betrayal.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Bill O\u2019Reilly to Interview Barack Obama on Super Bowl Sunday\n\n\u201cAnd as long as there\u2019s that gap between perceptions of me within the average Republican primary voter and the reality, it\u2019s hard for folks like John Boehner to move too far in my direction,\u201d Obama added.\n\nWhen asked to weigh in on the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal surrounding New Jersey\u2019s Republican governor, Chris Christie, Obama avoided giving an opinion on the matter.\n\nSee video: #ICYMI: Pop Culture\u2019s Craziest This Week \u2013 Lena Dunham, Chris Christie, and Michael Bay\n\n\u201cWell, I like Christie personally, and we\u2019ve had a good working relationship on specific issues like the Hurricane Sandy recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond that, I just don\u2019t have enough facts to offer a judgment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/President_Obama-New-Yorker-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Greg Gilman", "description": "The President says propaganda has left him unable to reach across the aisle, and he refused to offer \"judgement\" on New Jersey Gov.
