Creates more loopholes for individuals to not get coverage.\n\n\u201cThe individual mandate will no longer be in place, which means many of the 17 million people who obtained health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act [ACA] may find themselves reverting to being uninsured,\u201d Shirvani-Mahdavi says.\n\n2. Insurance standards would be weakened.\n\n\u201cOne of the strengths of the ACA is that it sets standards for what insurance must cover, which is why premiums under the ACA are higher than the basic plan premiums available before the ACA went into effect,\u201d he says. \u2018[Bush] would like to make very basic, comprehensive coverage available, which would eliminate the standards set by the ACA.\u201d\n\n3. Employers will no longer be required to provide health insurance to employees in the same way.\n\nThat means fewer people will be covered by their employer, according to Shirvani-Mahdavi. \u201cWhile these people may be able to access tax credits that would help them buy insurance on the individual market, they may be less likely to do so,\u201d he says.\n\n4. Lower-income individuals may be only able to afford catastrophic coverage plans, leaving them unable to afford basic preventive care or other necessary services such as mental health services and physical therapy.\n\n5. Medicaid would be handed over to state control and caps on spending would be put in place.\n\n\u201cIn order to reduce costs, Medicaid would likely need to cover fewer people and fewer services, overall reducing access to healthcare for lower-income individuals,\u201d he says.\n\n6. Overall, this plan would cut costs, but only because it would result in reduced coverage for individuals, especially lower-income individuals, according to Shirvani-Mahdavi.", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "Presidential hopeful Jeb Bush unveiled his healthcare plan; one expert offers his ideas about it.", "Description": "Presidential hopeful Jeb Bush unveiled his healthcare plan; one expert offers his ideas about it.", "og": {"url": "http://managedhealthcareexecutive.modernmedicine.com/managed-healthcare-executive/news/jeb-bush-s-healthcare-plan-six-takeaways", "image": "http://images.alfresco.advanstar.com/alfresco_images/HealthCare/2015/10/22/bab32cf8-7891-45f9-9600-748c984ebee0/ali_0914.jpg", "site_name": "Managed Healthcare Executive", "description": "Former Florida governor and 2016 Presidential Republican candidate Jeb Bush recently announced his plan for reforming the healthcare system.\n\n\tThe plan, which has been called the &ldquo;Republican", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s healthcare plan: Six takeaways"}, "DC.identifier": "http://managedhealthcareexecutive.modernmedicine.com/node/412838", "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "DC.date": "2015-10-22", "last-modified": "Thu, 22 October 2015 21:41:55 GMT", "DC.creator": "Tracey Walker", "DC.source": "Managed Healthcare Executive", "google-site-verification": "WZJsn2WE41IwLNlFfGQmdu6DHXhiwsg_s5ZCzVREpaM", "DC.subject": "2016 election, Affordable Care Act, Jeb Bush, MHE Articles, obamacare, Politics and Policy, Republicans", "emsContentType": "Jeb Bush\u2019s healthcare plan: Six takeaways", "DC.title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s healthcare plan: Six takeaways"}, "article_summary": "Former Florida governor and 2016 Presidential Republican candidate Jeb Bush recently announced his plan for reforming the healthcare system.\nEmployers will no longer be required to provide health insurance to employees in the same way.\nOverall, this plan would cut costs, but only because it would result in reduced coverage for individuals, especially lower-income individuals, according to Shirvani-Mahdavi.\nInsurance standards would be weakened.\nThe plan, which has been called the \u201cRepublican answer to Obamacare,\u201d is looking to repeal and replace Obamacare."}
