Tuesday night during a televised town hall meeting hosted by CNN, Democrat Frontrunner Hillary Clinton doubled down on her refusal to release transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street. She's willing to do it, so long as everyone else does too.

Cuomo: Will you agree to release these transcripts? They have become an issue.

Clinton: Sure, if everybody does it and that includes the Republicans.

Translation: No transcripts.#DemTownHall â€” David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) February 24, 2016

Clinton has raked in nearly $3 million from Wall Street speech payments.
