Chris Christie got a lot of attention for pointing out how robotic Sen. Marco Rubio seemed to be after he delivered the same canned line over and over again. Christie was right, of course. Rubio's seeming inability to say something unscripted was both odd and worth remarking upon.\n\nBut the irony is that Christie himself, in the same debate, repeated a standard line just as robotic and pre-programmed as Rubio's. Christie asserted that New Jersey millionaires fled the state after his predecessor signed into law a tax increase on them, and that raising taxes on the super-rich actually ends up costing the government money.\n\n\"Let New Jersey be the canary in the coal mine,\" he said. \"It is a failed idea and a failed policy, it's class warfare. It happened in my state.\"\n\n\n\nChristie was referring to a tax increase on high-income New Jersey residents, passed in 2004, that he has repeatedly claimed caused a mass exodus of millionaires from the Garden State, costing the treasury billions of dollars in revenue. But that's not what happened. Scholars at Stanford and Princeton found that, while some high-income households did leave New Jersey, people at lower income levels left the state at just about the same rate.\n\nIn other words, unless Christie is claiming that a tax increase on the very rich caused people of all income levels to leave New Jersey, those millionaires left for other reasons.\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the 2016 Presidential Elections]\n\nBut this idea \u2013 that raising taxes on the very rich will simply drive them away, failing to generate any revenue and hurting the economy in the process \u2013 is dearly held among most Republican leaders. It's pretty much the central theory of \"supply-side\" or \"trickle-down\" economics. Under that theory, the engine of economic growth lies in the hands of the super-wealthy. They have the money, they \"create the jobs,\" and if you treat them right, good things happen.\n\nBut that theory has crashed and burned under the weight of 30 years of experience and evidence. When President Bill Clinton pushed for higher taxes on the rich in 1993, supply-siders warned that tax increases would crash the economy. That's not exactly what happened. When President George W. Bush pushed for huge tax cuts that heavily benefited the rich, those same supply-siders promised enormous growth and prosperity. Again, that's not what happened.\n\nBut even if Christie somehow forgot the ups and downs of the economy under the Clinton and Bush administrations, surely he remembers what happened just a few years ago. At the end of 2012, President Barack Obama signed into law a bill that raised taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year. That law, combined with some of the taxes in the Affordable Care Act, meant significant tax hikes for the very rich. The average income tax rate for households making more than $1 million went up from about 23 percent in tax year 2011 to 28 percent in 2013. (We're ignoring 2012 because rich households, knowing that their tax rates would go up in 2013, did everything they could to move income into 2012.) For the richest 400 taxpayers in the country \u2013 households making an average of $265 million in 2013 \u2013 their income tax rate went from 17 percent in 2011 to 23 percent in 2013.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nIf Christie is right, tax increases of that magnitude on the \"job creators\" should have meant a mass exodus of rich people from the United States, accompanied by less government revenue and economic calamity. Suffice it to say, that's not what happened. In 2011, there were 300,891 tax returns with more than $1 million of adjusted gross income. In 2013, there were 345,883 such returns. Federal income tax revenue in fiscal year 2011 was $1.1 trillion, or about 7 percent of gross domestic product. In fiscal year 2013, federal income tax revenue was $1.3 trillion, or 8 percent of GDP. And, of course, since the tax increases went into affect, average annual job creation has been better than in any single year of the Bush administration (when taxes on rich people were much lower).", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Economic Intelligence [Opinion]", "title": "What Chris Christie Got Wrong About Millionaire Taxes in the GOP Debate", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Chris Christie has his own prepackaged myth about taxing millionaires.", "title": "Million Dollar Misleading", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/articles/2016-02-08/what-chris-christie-got-wrong-about-millionaire-taxes-in-the-gop-debate", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/07/af/fe7d392d41c78f81d51b1f504f67/160206-christie-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Chris Christie has his own prepackaged myth about taxing millionaires.", "card": "summary", "title": "What Chris Christie Got Wrong About Millionaire Taxes in the GOP Debate"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Feb. 8, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Michael Linden,picks,Christie, Chris,2016 presidential election,campaigns,politics,taxes,op-ed,Economic Intelligence [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Chris Christie has his own prepackaged myth about taxing millionaires."}, "article_summary": "Federal income tax revenue in fiscal year 2011 was $1.1 trillion, or about 7 percent of gross domestic product.\nIn fiscal year 2013, federal income tax revenue was $1.3 trillion, or 8 percent of GDP.\nBut the irony is that Christie himself, in the same debate, repeated a standard line just as robotic and pre-programmed as Rubio's.\nThe average income tax rate for households making more than $1 million went up from about 23 percent in tax year 2011 to 28 percent in 2013.\nThat law, combined with some of the taxes in the Affordable Care Act, meant significant tax hikes for the very rich."}
