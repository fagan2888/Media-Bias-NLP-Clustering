Ted Cruz is willing to do anything to defund the Affordable Care Act.

When asked if he would filibuster the vote in a press conference Thursday with other members of the GOP, Cruz said he is willing to do “everything necessary and anything possible to defund Obamacare.”

Cruz called Obamacare the “biggest job killer in this country,” and said the upcoming vote is a “moment” for Sen. Harry Reid and the Democratic party to listen to the needs of the American people.

In regard to restrictions placed on the amount hours some workers are allowed to put in at their jobs, Cruz said, “the people who are hurt are the most vulnerable among us,” and urged legislators to listen to the American people when considering whether or not to support the plan.

Congress will have to develop a budget bill by Oct. 1 to avoid a government shutdown.

And if Obamacare is defunded, the credit goes to the GOP, Cruz said.

“If and when we win this fight, it’s going to be because House Republicans have stood up and shown the courage,” Cruz said.
