He\u2019s slight, intense, balding, wears two hearing aids and two earrings, and boasts, in an endearing, not irritating way, about his three sons and three grandchildren. He speaks lovingly of his wife, Bernardine Dohrn 72, now also retired; she as a professor at Northwestern University School of Law.\n\nThe two spent a decade in hiding, on the run from the law as members of the Weather Underground. The label \u201cunrepentant domestic terrorist\u201d does not fit the man, who grew up in Glen Ellyn, and now sits across from me at a coffee shop on Wells Street in Old Town. He suggested meeting me in my neighborhood rather than asking me to travel to his in Hyde Park.\n\nAyers has stressed over the years that no one was ever hurt, much less killed, by he or Dohrn. And yet he acknowledges having a role\u2014direct or indirect is never clear\u2014in planting bombs in government buildings, including the Pentagon, New York City Police Headquarters, and a Capitol building. \u2018\u2019Even though I didn\u2019t actually bomb the Pentagon\u2014we bombed it, in the sense that Weathermen organized it and claimed it,\u201d as said to New York Times reporter Dinitia Smith, is a typical Ayers hedge.\n\nI nursed a latte; he ate and drank nothing as our conversation spanned almost two hours. It took so long because he seldom liked my questions and insisted on enumerating their flaws. He carried a dog-eared, marked-up copy of his new book, Public Enemy: Confessions of an American Dissident, a sequel to Fugitive Days (2001).\n\nHere\u2019s an edited and condensed transcript of our conversation:\n\nLast year, conservative pundit Tucker Carlson bid $2,500 and won a Public Square/Illinois Humanities Council auction item\u2014dinner for six hosted and prepared by you and Bernardine here in Chicago. Sounds like everyone had a delightful time, but then a bit more than three weeks later\u2014Ayers writes in Public Enemy that it was a \u201cfew days\u201d later\u2014one of Carlson\u2019s invitees, Andrew Breitbart, dropped dead of a heart attack. Were you accused of putting some slow-acting poison in his food?\n\nIt was all over the right-wing blogs; filled with stories of murder. What was in the tofu? If you really want to see the loony tunes, that\u2019s where you have to go. It has very little to do with me; has to do with the right-wing campaign to bring Obama to heel by connecting him to me and Jeremiah Wright and Rashid Khalidi.\n\nWhy would [Fox News\u2019] Sean Hannity care about me at all? He wants me to come on his show in January. I may do it.\n\nSo Hannity\u2019s producer called you and asked to come on?\n\nI was signing books in Baltimore or Washington\u2026. Somebody came up and asked, \u201cWill you make this out to Sean Hannity?\u201d I said, \u201cYou know him?\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m one of his producers.\u201d So they contacted me and we\u2019ll work out a date. Hannity said, \u201cWhat I\u2019m interested in talking about is your relationship with the president of the United States.\u201d And I wrote back and said I think that\u2019s the most boring thing we could possibly talk about.\n\nSo what is your relationship with Obama?\n\nHe was a guy around the neighborhood and I was a guy around the neighborhood.\n\nI have lots of friends in Hyde Park whose kids went to the [University of Chicago] Lab School, and your kids went to Lab, and I\u2019ve been told that you were friends like they were friends, went to pot luck dinners together, etc.\n\nYes, exactly, as a family we did exactly what they [your friends] did.\n\nSo you were in the Obamas\u2019 house and they were in your house\u2026.\n\nAbsolutely. We were friendly. Let\u2019s examine this. Here\u2019s the absurdity of pushing this question of my relationship with Obama. What in my politics is reflected in the Obama presidency? Can you show me one thing?\n\nAre you disappointed in his presidency?\n\nNot in the least. Are you?\n\nAre you surprised by how curtailed he\u2019s been?\n\nWhy? What did his record show that would be different from how he has governed?\n\n\u2018What in my politics is reflected in the Obama presidency? Can you show me one thing?\u2019 Bill Ayers\n\nLet\u2019s back up. First you asked if I\u2019m disappointed and my response to that was he was exactly who he said he would be. He said he was a moderate, pragmatic, liberal politician\u2026. What in Obama\u2019s presidency reflects any of my political positions at all? \u2026. I would close Guantanamo. I would never do drone strikes. I would close every foreign American military base. I would probably shut down the Pentagon.\n\nYou would have been for a single payer health care system?\n\nNot would have been, am. I\u2019m 68 years old. I\u2019m on Medicare. Why shouldn\u2019t I have been on Medicare when I was 60, why 65? And why not 55, and then, if 55, why not 50? Why shouldn\u2019t we all be on Medicare? Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act is a great boon to the health insurance industry. I hate the health insurance industry. Why should they be making money on your misfortune? That\u2019s bullshit.\n\nDid you work for Obama\u2019s election in 2012?\n\nYeah, I did. I voted democratic three times in my life. Obama twice and then George McGovern.\n\nWhen you didn\u2019t vote for democrats, who\u2019d you vote for?\n\nSocialists, Greens.\n\nWho do you want to see as the Democrats\u2019 nominee in 2016?\n\nI doubt I\u2019d vote for any Democrat in 2016. But who would I want to see? Angela Davis.\n\nI am afraid that most people and probably including you attribute to voting much more than I do. I don\u2019t think that voting is the be-all and end-all to a democratic society. In fact I think in some ways in our country it is the least important right that we have, so exercising all the other rights is much more important\u2014the right of protest, the right of speech, these are the rights that we have to exercise or we will lose them\u2026.\n\nThe reason I say this is because with the corruption of money and advertising voting means less and less. It has always been Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber\u2026. I plan to vote for Tweedle Dumb if I have the choice in local elections, but even there the corruption of money is so profound that we have to find other avenues to express ourselves.\n\nSo in both \u201908 and \u201912 you didn\u2019t have great expectations of Obama?\n\nNo expectations.\n\nThen why did you vote for him?\n\nBecause I was voting against white supremacy.\n\nAnd it was your first opportunity?\n\nNot my first. I voted for Jesse Jackson. I voted for Shirley Chisholm\u2026. Do I think that this election was a blow against white supremacy? I do. Was it a fatal blow? Absolutely not.\u2026 White supremacy endures and abides and you see it clearly in the mass incarcerations. That\u2019s white supremacy.\n\nYour mention of mass incarceration brings to mind Toni Preckwinkle, who has spoken often of the over-incarceration of African American young men. Do you like her?\n\nI love Toni Preckwinkle.\n\nSo when she runs for reelection as Cook County board president you\u2019ll go out and vote for her?\n\nI don\u2019t know.\u2026Voting is a two-second exercise\u2026 a rather simple expression of my rights. I spend 365 days a year expressing my rights. So the voting is two seconds and then I have billions of seconds left to do other things. I think that we spend\u2026 way too much time staring at the places of power we have no access to\u2014the White House and the medieval auction block we call the Congress. I have no access to them.\n\nWho did you vote for in the last mayoral election?\n\nMiguel del Valle. The thing that\u2019s so pathetic about Chicago is that Rahm Emanuel does not have any popularity, but he does have millions of dollars. And nobody wants to run against him.\n\nWho would you like to see run against him?\n\nToni Preckwinkle. She could be a formidable opponent but the problem is she doesn\u2019t have anything like the money he has and she screwed herself [by being too close to] the Democratic machine.\n\nBack to Obama; you have to admit that he has tried to pull us out of two wars and he didn\u2019t bomb Syria.\n\nThe war in Vietnam we lost. We lost the war in Afghanistan\u2026 you\u2019re attributing to Obama not only good intentions but good actions around Afghanistan and Iraq. Actually he\u2019s not acting well. He\u2019s acting like any imperial leader would act. He wants to have an agreement with [Afghan President Hamid] Karzai because he wants to keep American troops there, trainers there, to keep our interest in oil and all the rest of it on the front burner\u2026.\n\nWe are the imperial guard. Go back in history. This is true of every puppet that the Americans have put up in the last hundred years.\u2026 We always say at the end of the day, why are these brown people such a disappointment to us? We gave them everything, and look they can\u2019t do it right, they fuck it up\u2026. In [Ngo Dinh] Diem\u2019s case we shoot him. In Karzai\u2019s case we demean him.\n\nDid you reconcile with you father? [Thomas Ayers was chairman of Commonwealth Edison and a member of a couple of the city\u2019s most exclusive nonprofit boards.]\n\nWhat do you mean \u2018reconcile\u2019?\n\nThe quote that\u2019s always attributed to you is \u201cKill all the rich people. Break up their cars and apartments. Bring the revolution home, kill your parents, that\u2019s where it\u2019s really at.\u201d\n\nI was 20 years old and I was asked by [a reporter at the New York Times], and I said that there was a plot started in this country and it was the majority against the rich, and he said your parents are rich. I said, you know, \u201cKill your parents,\u201d and it was glib and superficial and stupid as anything I\u2019ve ever said.\n\nThe idea that that becomes a quotable quote that\u2019s worth anything is ridiculous. My parents both lived in an old peoples\u2019 settlement in Wheaton. My mother had Alzheimer\u2019s very bad. After she died he started to slip into Alzheimer\u2019s\u2026. We took him out and brought him to my house\u2026. My dad lived with me for the last three years of his life. Lovely, lovely person. And yes, we had different political outlooks, but don\u2019t you have people you\u2019re close to who don\u2019t actually agree on every political issue?\n\nWhat newspapers do you read?\n\nI read the New York Times everyday. It\u2019s like a heroin habit. It always makes me slightly sick, but I do it\u2026. I don\u2019t read the Tribune or Sun-Times.\n\nDo you listen to NPR?\n\nI listen to it all the time. I call it National Pentagon Radio. NPR is a major cheerleader for war, both subtly and overtly and I find it appalling.\n\nWhat about blogs?\n\nMy favorite blog in Chicago is retired CPS teacher Fred Klonsky\u2019s blog. He blogs on the pension fund and he\u2019s the smartest guy on pensions that I know.\n\nWhat did you feel when you heard that Nelson Mandela had died?\n\nVery, very sad and very, very happy, both. Great, great, great life\u2026. You can be sure that NPR will call him a civil rights leader, although he never called himself that. And you can be sure the New York Times will call him a peaceful person even though he led the armed resistance through a bombing campaign that landed him in jail for life. He\u2019s also a Communist. He\u2019s also a black nationalist. He\u2019s many, many things. The President goes to his prison cell on Robben Island and says, this shows what one man with vision and courage can do. I\u2019m sorry, it was a political movement; it was not one man. And he\u2019d be the first to say that. He\u2019d never say, \u201cI did it.\u201d He would say, \u201cWe did it.\u201d\n\nDo people recognize you on the street?\n\nYes, all the time. One day at O\u2019Hare Airport, a month ago, I was in the pre-approved line and I got to the front. The guy checking my ID looked at me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re Bill Ayers.\u201d I said \u201cI am,\u201d and he said, \u201cThank you for everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d I got down by my gate and a guy, a middle aged businessman, walks up to me and he says, \u201cYou\u2019re a disgrace. You should go back to Russia.\u201d\n\nDo you ever feel unsafe in your house?\n\nI get e-mails every day threatening me; telling me what a bad person I am. I got a lot of those after Breitbart died. I feel safe in the world. I don\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying [about it].\n\nSo did you spend Thanksgiving with the Obamas?\n\nNo, with the Khalidis. And that\u2019s another thing. Do you think that if Obama really listened to Khalidi, he [Obama] would have the attitude toward Israel that he has?\n\nAIPAC thinks Obama is a nightmare.\n\nAIPAC is a nightmare. Why should the US [do the bidding] of this tiny little country Israel? \u2026.Why should the United states bow to them? Is there anything Obama has done that reflects Khalidi\u2019s views on human rights?\n\nSo the idea that Obama\u2019s been somehow influenced by these three cartoon characters [Ayers, Wright, Khalidi] is absurd on its face\u2026. Jeremiah Wright. I think they were friends. I think they were close. I think Jeremiah Wright was kind of a mentor for Obama\u2026. You\u2019d have to show me something in Obama\u2019s program that is [influenced by Wright].\n\nYou lived an author\u2019s worst nightmare when the New York Times profile of you appeared on the morning of September 11, 2001, one day after the pub date for your earlier memoir, Fugitive Days. [The headline read, \u201cNo Regrets for a Love of Explosives,\u201d and Ayers is quoted in the first line, \u2018\u2019I don\u2019t regret setting bombs. I feel we didn\u2019t do enough.'\u2019] Did it ruin the sales?\n\nI have no idea; that\u2019s one thing I know nothing about and I\u2019m not that interested. I know that all book sales died in the days after 9/11. The only book that was selling was the Koran. My publicity tour was put on hold because no airplanes were flying, but as soon as the airplanes flew, I made every commitment\u201431 cities.\n\nAny cancelations?\n\nThe only groups that canceled me were the Chicago Public Library, the Chicago Humanities Festival, and one university, which will remain unnamed. At CPL I was scheduled to be part of an authors series\u2014right behind Salman Rushdie; right before Alice Walker. They canceled me. And why did they cancel me? Because Mayor Daley called [the top librarian] and said to cancel me.\n\nAnd the Humanities Festival, American Airlines was a major sponsor. And they told them they better cancel me\u2026. The University of Wyoming canceled but a student sued them and \u2026 a federal judge enjoined the University\u2026. I had 1100 students, and I probably would have had 20 without the drama. I could almost feel the disappointment. They saw this old professor and they were waiting for a terrorist. I just don\u2019t fit the bill in any way.\n\n\u2018Jon Stewart is the Walter Cronkite of his generation. That\u2019s where you go if you want to know what\u2019s true.\u2019 Bill Ayers\n\nWhat are you reading now?\n\nThe book that I can\u2019t put down is [James McBride\u2019s] Good Lord Bird. This book is unbelievable; about John Brown through the eyes of a 12-year-old slave boy.\n\nDid you send a copy of Public Enemy to President Obama?\n\nNo, that\u2019s a good idea, I should. How do I get it to him?\n\nAll three of your sons went to the private Lab School. Why not public school?\n\nWe looked at the public schools and they were not very good, and we had the great privilege and advantage of sending them to a private school, so we did.\n\nIn the state of Illinois, 30 percent of teachers\u2019 evaluations are based on standardized test scores. So I went to the Lab school and asked the head of the school and the head of the union how they do teachers evaluations, and I liked their answer. Look what they have at the Lab School; classes capped at 15, respect for the unionized teachers. What\u2019s not to like? If it\u2019s good enough for Rahm\u2019s kids and Mayor Daley\u2019s kids\u2014his kids were classmates of my son\u2019s\u2014and Obama\u2019s kids, why shouldn\u2019t there be schools like Lab available to kids on the West Side?\n\nWhat\u2019s your next book? [Ayers is the author of many books on education, including To Teach: The Journey of a Teacher and A Kind and Just Parent.]\n\nThe working title is, What If\u2026.?: Releasing the Radical Imagination\u2014ten issues that I want to reframe and reimagine; for example, What if we abolished the prisons in the United States? What if we closed all U.S. military bases around the world? Why is it that the Italians do not have an air base in the Adirondacks, but we have an air base in the Italian Alps.\n\nDo you watch TV news?\n\nVery rarely. The only things I watch regularly are Colbert and the Daily Show, every night if I can.\n\nThat\u2019s where college kids get their news.\n\nIt\u2019s a much more reliable place to get their news. Jon Stewart is the Walter Cronkite of his generation. That\u2019s where you go if you want to know what\u2019s true.\n\nHave you been to the White House since Obama was elected?\n\nNo, well, yes. I go to the White House every Monday morning before work, so I can tell Obama what to do and see Valerie Jarrett\n\nWhat do you make of Jarrett\u2019s role?\n\nExactly what you\u2019d predict. Because Valerie was a Democratic party operative in Chicago and a middle-of-the-road Democrat, and that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing. I am very close to Valerie\u2019s mother, Barbara Bowman, who is a genius on early childhood, which is my world.\n\nThere\u2019s some rumbling that [New York mayor-elect] Bill De Blasio might bring [CPS chief] Barbara Byrd-Bennett to New York to run the schools there.\n\nYou\u2019re fucking kidding\u2026. If he takes BBB I\u2019d be horrified for a lot of reasons. School closings, because she went on this public relations listening tour in the neighborhoods before she closed the schools; didn\u2019t listen for one minute, is not a defender of public education, is a dismantler of public education. She would be a catastrophe; big on charter schools which have been a catastrophe for the public education system.\n\nShe\u2019s also seems okay with Rahm\u2019s appointed school board.\n\nThere should be an elected school board. The reason there should be an elected school board is the same reason there\u2019s an elected school board in Winnetka. If the one percent get to elect their people, why don\u2019t we get to elect our people? What is it? Black people don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them.\n\nAny response to Public Enemy that particularly surprised or amused you?\n\nI got a wonderful note from [New Yorker editor] David Remnick. \u201cI\u2019m reading your book and it\u2019s brilliantly written\u2026. But how can you call me incredibly nerdy? [Ayers\u2019 description of Remnick when Remnick, while writing his biography of Obama interviewed Ayers, was \u201cRemnick couldn\u2019t have been any more nerdy\u201d.] I always thought of myself as the Warren Beatty of journalism.\u201d\n\nI wrote him back and said, \u201cWarren Beatty can play you in the movie and Warren Beatty always said he wanted to be editor of the New Yorker.\n\nAnyone in the U.S. Senate or House you admire?\n\nDamn.\n\n[Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders in the Senate?\n\nYeah, I like Bernie Sanders. Yeah I like him because he speaks truth to power in the same way that [former Massachusetts Congressman] Barney Frank did.\n\nIf Obama gets another shot at a Supreme Court justice, who would you like to see him appoint?\n\nBernadine Dohrn. She\u2019d be great.\n\nI heard Rush Limbaugh the other day when they got rid of the filibuster. He said this gives Obama carte blanche. He could appoint [Syrian president Bashar Hafez al-]Assad to the 9th Circuit. He could also appoint Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers to the Supreme Court. I immediately wrote to Jeremiah and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d [Ayers exaggerated here; Limbaugh was suggesting he and Wright as \u201cjudges\u201d on a lower court.]\n\nI also think Charles Ogletree from Harvard would be fantastic. He came to my reading at the Harvard Bookstore and we had a great evening together.\n\nCarol Felsenthal is a lifelong Chicagoan and self-proclaimed political junkie.
