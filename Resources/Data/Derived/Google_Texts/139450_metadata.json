That estimate was based in part on the expectation that tax revenues would increase 9 percent from 2013 to 2014.\n\nBut less than a month later, in early May, the CBO said that in the first seven months of the fiscal year, total tax receipts are only up 8 percent so far.\n\n\u201cThat increase is $10 to $20 billion less than what CBO expected when it published its most recent projections in its April 2014 report,\u201d the agency said in its monthly budget review.\n\nWith 4 1/2 months left in fiscal year 2014, the year is hardly over. But budget-watchers agreed that April is an informative month, since it\u2019s when most individuals pay their tax bills, and a shortfall in April means the government is likely going to see a budget deficit that is somewhere north of $500 billion for the year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re through the big chunk of money,\u201d a Senate Budget Committee staffer told TheBlaze.\n\nThe aide added that while the government ran a surplus in April, as it usually does, the bad news in the CBO report was that tax revenue still grew more slowly in April than government spending grew. The CBO report said receipts were up 2 percent in the first seven months of fiscal year 2014 compared to the prior year, while spending rose 2.5 percent in the same period.\n\n\u201cTo me this points to the unsustainability of our situation,\u201d the aide said. \u201cEven in the best month you\u2019ve had since the recession, revenue is still not growing faster than spending.\u201d\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and former CBO director, said the latest CBO report shows that the good economic forecast the CBO made in June just hasn\u2019t happened yet, which is leading to smaller tax receipts.\n\nHoltz-Eakin agreed that April is a big month that reveals a lot of information about where the deficit will finally land. Based on all the available information out there now, he told TheBlaze that the government is \u201clikely to have a bigger deficit\u201d by the end of the fiscal year.\n\nHe added that one bad sign for both the economy\u2019s performance and the government\u2019s ability to collect taxes is non-withheld tax receipts. Holtz-Eakin said that category reflects tax revenues that aren\u2019t withheld in people\u2019s paychecks \u2014 such as advance tax payments from book authors, business owners and sole proprietors that aren\u2019t captured in routine paychecks.\n\nThe CBO said earlier this month that in this category, receipts are up $19 billion, but also said that\u2019s $30 billion less than the agency first anticipated.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re behind [in this category], it suggest we\u2019re not having a very vigorous recovery,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said.\n\nIn the meantime, government spending overall is down 2 percent, largely due to declining military spending and increased payments from mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the government.\n\nBut spending in key \u201cmandatory\u201d areas of the government rose. Social Security spending is up 5 percent through the first seven months of fiscal year 2014, and spending for Medicaid is up 9 percent.\n\nThe CBO expects Medicaid spending to jump 13 percent by the time 2014 is over, and the Senate aide said this rise is due to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe knew Medicaid was going to start going up because of the influx of new people, new eligibility from Obamacare,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The federal government appears to be on track for a bigger-than-expected budget deficit in 2014, as the government is not taking in tax revenues at levels it expected so far.
