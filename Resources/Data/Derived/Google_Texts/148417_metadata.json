Huntsman is known for his work as the 16th Governor of Utah, United States Ambassador to Singapore and China, and 2012 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nHuntsman addressed the factionalism within the Republican Party during the 2016 election cycle, citing theatrics as a major problem. Politics is no longer about having a conversation with the American people about important issues, he argues, but rather about seizing media attention through spin cycles and sound bites of campaign attacks.\n\n\u201cAnger and high volume debates are not a strategy toward victory in the sense of problem solving,\u201d Huntsman said.\n\nHuntsman remarked further on the incendiary nature of contemporary politics in his analysis of Donald Trump\u2019s controversial presidential campaign. Though, he noted, parties tend to react in opposition to incumbents, Huntsman called Trump\u2019s popularity an unparalleled form of populism that is, \u201cto the 10th power,\u201d a response to the Obama administration.\n\nHuntsman questioned how the business tycoon would carry out his plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act and build a wall between the United States and Mexico. At one point, chuckling at the peculiarity of Trump\u2019s rise to political stardom, Huntsman remarked that he had never foreseen a politically inexperienced, non-veteran, and thrice-married businessman who resides in a gold-plated Park Avenue apartment as a potential president. Huntsman found common ground with Trump, however, in Trump\u2019s unapologetic identification of a dysfunctional system.\n\n\u201cI actually applaud him for saying [the political system] is broken and \u2018I want to do something about it,\u2019\u201d Huntsman said.\n\nHuntsman did not endorse a specific candidate but maintained that he would vote Republican no matter what.\n\nHuntsman, who served as ambassador under the Obama administration, said President Obama was an imperfect leader. According to Huntsman, Obama had good intentions regarding economic and political relationships with Asia but came up short in execution and communication. Arguing that the president needed to be more blunt and straightforward with the Chinese government, Huntsman compared the relationship of the two nations to an \u201cincomplete conversation.\u201d\n\nComparing the party systems of the United States and China, Huntsman stated that politicians from each nation will look to gain political bonus points in the upcoming American election and Chinese five-year plan pronouncements by critiquing the other nation. The ambassador said that China, which has struggled to control its near abroad and instill domestic stability, is envious of America\u2019s tactile approach to short-term problems and \u201ccreative dysfunction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey look at our system and can\u2019t figure it out. They can\u2019t figure out how we remain so great of a country with such a dysfunctional political system,\u201d Huntsman said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Chicago Maroon", "description": "\u201cAnger and high volume debates are not a strategy toward victory in the sense of problem solving.\u201d", "title": "Huntsman Talks Republican Presidential Nomination at International House", "url": "http://chicagomaroon.com/2016/02/23/huntsman-talks-republican-presidential-nomination-at-international-house/", "image": "http://chicagomaroon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2-22-Jon-Huntsman-Zoe-Kaiser-3.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-23T08:43:52+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://chicagomaroon.com/wp-content/themes/maroon_bones/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheChicagoMaroon", "section": "News", "published_time": "2016-02-23T01:35:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-23T08:43:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "They can\u2019t figure out how we remain so great of a country with such a dysfunctional political system,\u201d Huntsman said.\nHuntsman is known for his work as the 16th Governor of Utah, United States Ambassador to Singapore and China, and 2012 Republican presidential nominee.\nPhoto: Zoe Kaiser /The Chicago MaroonOn Monday, Ambassador Jon Huntsman spoke to University students at International House.\n\u201cI actually applaud him for saying [the political system] is broken and \u2018I want to do something about it,\u2019\u201d Huntsman said.\nAccording to Huntsman, Obama had good intentions regarding economic and political relationships with Asia but came up short in execution and communication."}
