The Shanghai Composite Index closed at a 13-month low on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 Index has lost over 7 percent year-to-date.\n\nAnd with more storm clouds brewing on the horizon, many investors are looking for ways to help them batten down the hatches.\n\nMany investors, sensing additional risk in stocks, have been able to find shelter in muni bonds, which in the past have provided a certain level of stability in times of turmoil. It\u2019s important to be aware, though, that interest rates and bond prices have an inverse relationship. When one rises, the other declines, and vice versa.\n\nMuni bonds also come equipped with attractive tax advantages, shielding investors from taxes at the federal level and often at the state and local levels too. That means they can help \u201cObamacare-proof\u201d your interest from the 3.8 percent Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax on investment income (applicable to those who make more than $200,000 in taxable income per year).\n\nIn 2015, muni bonds, as represented by the Barclays Municipal Bond Index, were actually the top fixed-income asset class, beating both Treasuries and corporate debt. But they also outperformed S&P 500 stocks, gaining more than double what equities delivered.\n\nOur own Near-Term Tax Free Fund (NEARX) saw its 21st straight year of positive returns in 2015, a rare accomplishment that has been achieved by only 39 out of 31,306 equity and fund bonds\u2014around 0.12 percent\u2014according to Morningstar data.\n\nFor more than two decades, we\u2019ve continued to deliver this exceptional level of performance, whether rates were falling or, as is the case now, rising. NEARX invests in short-term municipal bonds, which are much less sensitive to these changes.\n\nMuni Bonds \u2013 Demand Likely to Climb Higher\n\nBillions of dollars fled domestic equity funds on a near-weekly basis in 2015 as investors anticipated a rate hike, which the Federal Reserve finally implemented in December. Meanwhile, muni fund inflows gained momentum in the second half of the year as global stock markets began to show signs of trouble.\n\nSo far this year, investors are piling into the $3.7 trillion muni market at a rate of about $1 billion per week.\n\nAccording to Kiplinger\u2019s 2016 Outlook for muni bonds, incremental rate hikes pose much less downside risk to municipal bonds than to Treasuries of equivalent maturities. In the past, Kiplinger says, the market value of muni bonds has fallen between 50 and 60 percent less than the market value of Treasuries has fallen. Government bonds have typically been more sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates, as they have a much higher proportion of foreign buyers and sellers from countries where local rates might be more stable or moving in the opposite direction. Supply and demand in the muni market, limited mostly to U.S. buyers, is much tighter.\n\nLimiting Volatility\n\nWe\u2019ve managed to provide investors with 21 straight years of positive growth in not only various interest rate environments but also in equity bull markets and bear markets.\n\nIf a hypothetical $100,000 had been invested in both NEARX and S&P 500 stocks at the end of 1999, it would have taken 13 years for the equities to climb ahead. (Figures include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, but the performance does not include the effect of any direct fees described in the fund\u2019s prospectus which, if applicable, would lower your total returns.)\n\nGranted, the two major drops in value during this period\u2014first when the tech bubble burst, then during the financial crisis\u2014were among the worst the market has ever witnessed, investors shouldn\u2019t expect NEARX to outperform at all times. Also, we just ended a phenomenal seven-year equity bull run. What the chart above shows is that the fund has historically demonstrated a greater likelihood of dodging the dramatic swings the equity market has experienced in times of uncommonly high volatility.\n\nPlease consider carefully a fund\u2019s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.
