That\u2019s less than last year\u2019s $101 million, when two donors chipped in $50 million to smash the record. But it\u2019s a bit more than the year before, when times were better by many measures. The decade\u2019s low was $47 million in 2011.\n\nWhat a dinner for 4,000 looks like Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomber\n\nThe daylong event dubbed \u201cNight for NYC\u201d culminated in a benefit dinner at the Javits Center in Manhattan on Monday. Wallets opened again this year despite a further slump in investment bank profits, a jump in hedge-fund withdrawals and a presidential race with candidates arguing over who\u2019ll be toughest on the industry. As Katie Couric gave her opening remarks, she welcomed a crowd she called \u201cBernie Sanders\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d\n\nMelissa Bley, Oprah Winfrey and Ken Griffin Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve weathered all the different points of economic cycles,\u201d David Saltzman, the foundation\u2019s executive director, said in an interview before the event. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found to be truly remarkable about our donors is at the toughest times they continue to be generous, because they know they\u2019ve been blessed by good fortune and they still want to be generous to others.\u201d\n\nBlaming Obamacare\n\nLloyd Blankfein and Gary Cohn Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg\n\nGuests included Goldman Sachs\u2019s Lloyd Blankfein, BlackRock\u2019s Laurence D. Fink and investors Bill Ackman and David Einhorn. The evening featured a surprise country-music guest, the Zac Brown Band, and closed with a set by Usher. Comedian Jim Gaffigan warmed up the crowd by mocking how people complain about the cold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s freezing,\u201d he parroted. \u201cDamn Obamacare. Without Obamacare it\u2019d be 72 degrees out there.\u201d\n\nJohn and Laura Overdeck Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg\n\nLooking beyond Wall Street\u2019s malaise helped. This year\u2019s fundraiser was spurred by a $15 million challenge grant from the Bezos Family Foundation and the Overdeck Family Foundation. Jackie Bezos, president of her family\u2019s efforts, sits on the board of Robin Hood Foundation. She\u2019s the mother of billionaire Jeff Bezos, founder and head of Amazon.com Inc., and Mark Bezos, a senior vice president at Robin Hood.\n\nPaul Tudor Jones, exhibit A on healthy brain development Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg\n\nThe Bezos and Overdeck grant will help Robin Hood start an effort to help parents, grandparents and caregivers become \u201cbrain carers\u201d to prepare toddlers for school through a program called the Metropolis of Early Learning, Saltzman said. He said adults can learn to use everyday experiences such a trips to the grocery store to help children learn about topics like colors, shapes and numbers at an early age.\n\nEarly Learning\n\nLarry Robbins, Dan and Jane Och Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time where a human brain is more plastic and able to learn and develop than between zero and three,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cLet\u2019s take full advantage of that and make sure kids from all income brackets and all neighborhoods get to school ready to soar.\u201d\n\nHe said Robin Hood intends to spend $50 million over five years on the program as it continues other initiatives to fight poverty, including job training and support of food pantries and homeless shelters. But readiness for school can help diminish those needs, helping children reach milestones necessary to avoid poverty.\n\nUsher Photographer: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cEarly childhood programs pack a poverty-fighting wallop and that\u2019s why we want to support them,\u201d Saltzman said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Amanda L Gordon", "twitter": {"description": "A hard year for Wall Street is still a solid year for its biggest charity gala.", "title": "Robin Hood Gala Raises $61 Million, Helped by Bezos Family", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-10/robin-hood-gala-raises-61-million-helped-by-bezos-family-cash", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ionHH.mje06U/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Amanda L Gordon", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Amanda E Gordon,Family,Jeff Bezos,Tech", "news_keywords": "Amanda E Gordon,Family,Jeff Bezos,Tech", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-10/robin-hood-gala-raises-61-million-helped-by-bezos-family-cash", "parsely-title": "Robin Hood Gala Raises $61 Million, Helped by Bezos Family", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-05-10T01:44:40.359Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "A hard year for Wall Street is still a solid year for its biggest charity gala.", "parsely-tags": "Amanda E Gordon,Family,Jeff Bezos,Tech,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2016-05-10T01:44:40.359Z", "parsely-section": "industries", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "A hard year for Wall Street is still a solid year for its biggest charity gala.", "title": "Robin Hood Gala Raises $61 Million, Helped by Bezos Family", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-10/robin-hood-gala-raises-61-million-helped-by-bezos-family-cash", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ionHH.mje06U/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "A hard year for Wall Street is still a solid year for its biggest charity gala."}, "parsely-post-id": "O6XGYESYF01W01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ionHH.mje06U/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "She\u2019s the mother of billionaire Jeff Bezos, founder and head of Amazon.com Inc., and Mark Bezos, a senior vice president at Robin Hood.\nJackie Bezos, president of her family\u2019s efforts, sits on the board of Robin Hood Foundation.\nWithout Obamacare it\u2019d be 72 degrees out there.\u201dJohn and Laura Overdeck Photographer: Amanda Gordon/BloombergLooking beyond Wall Street\u2019s malaise helped.\nThis year\u2019s fundraiser was spurred by a $15 million challenge grant from the Bezos Family Foundation and the Overdeck Family Foundation.\nThe Robin Hood Foundation, dedicated to fighting poverty in New York City, took in about $61 million at its annual fundraiser with the help of wealthy donors from the financial industry and beyond."}
