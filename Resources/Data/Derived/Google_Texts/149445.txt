Two-time Cy Young Award winner Roy Halladay has retired after 16 seasons in the major leagues with Toronto and Philadelphia.

The 36-year-old right-hander signed a one-day contract Monday to retire as a member of the Blue Jays, where he spent the first 12 years of his career. He made the announcement at a news conference at the winter meetings in Orlando.

Halladay played for the Phillies from 2010-13, finishing with two injury-plagued seasons. He won an NL Cy Young Award in 2010, throwing a perfect game that season and a no-hitter in his first postseason game.

Halladay was 203-105 with an ERA of 3.38 in 416 career games, including 390 starts. He had 67 complete games and 20 shutouts.
