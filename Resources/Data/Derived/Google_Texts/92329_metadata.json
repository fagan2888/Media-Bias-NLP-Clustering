Salkicevic will likely be taken to St. Louis next week.\n\nDuring Saturday morning\u2019s brief appearance in court, Salkicevic, who wore a hijab with her bright orange jail scrubs, asked to be freed on bond so that she can drive herself to St. Louis \u2014 a topic the judge said he would revisit on Monday.\n\nHer attorney, Andrea Gambino, said Salkicevic was \u201canxious\u201d to reunite with her children, and Salkicevic told court officers that she suffers from seizures.\n\nBut Salkicevic dispensed with the services of a Serbian translator and spoke in clear, confident English as she addressed the court. She seemed relaxed as she spoke to a relative who was supporting her in the courtroom, and even winked at an FBI agent.\n\nHer Facebook page contains few clues to the illegal fundraising activities she\u2019s accused of, suggesting only a devoted Muslim.
