Community Health Systems on Tuesday said it planned to divest ownership in two South Carolina hospitals, but did not cite any reasons for the sale.

CHS said it would sell the 59-bed Chesterfield General Hospital and the 102-bed Marlboro Park Hospital to M/C Healthcare, a financing company. No sale price was listed.

The deal should close in two months if approved by regulators.

CHS said the current hospital leases will expire on April 30 and will then transfer to M/C Healthcare.

The sale is not expected to be draw on CHS finances, the company said.

CHS, which runs 203 hospitals, sold another South Carolina hospital in January.
