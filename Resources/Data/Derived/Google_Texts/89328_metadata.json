Rubio even accused Cruz of \u201ctelling lies\u201d about his position on executive amnesty\u2013 even though nationally-televised video footage of Marco Rubio confirms Cruz\u2019s allegation, and reveals that Rubio lied in front of a nation-wide viewing audience during tonight\u2019s debate.\n\nCruz said: \u201cMarco right now supports citizenship for 12 million people here illegally. I oppose citizenship\u2026 Marco has a long record when it comes to amnesty. In the state of Florida, as Speaker of the House, he supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. In addition to that, Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama\u2019s illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office. I have promised to rescind every single illegal executive action, including that one.\u201d\n\nCruz was referring specifically to President Obama\u2019s 2012 executive amnesty for illegal immigrants who allegedly came to the country as minors. The unconstitutional amnesty known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2013 or DACA\u2013 remains fully operational to this day. DACA not only gives illegal immigrants immunity from deportation, but also grants them work permits and access to federal benefits.\n\nIndeed, video footage of Sen. Rubio confirms Cruz\u2019s assertion. In an April Spanish-language interview, Rubio told Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t undo it [DACA] immediately.\u201d Rubio elaborated in English, telling Ramos: \u201cI don\u2019t think we can immediately revoke that [DACA]\u2026 I\u2019m not calling for it to be revoked tomorrow, or this week, or right away.\u201d\n\nYet Rubio\u2013 seemingly comfortable in the knowledge that the debate moderators would not be presenting any actual information on Rubio\u2019s immigration record\u2013 simply denied Cruz\u2019s charge, despite the existence of a readily available transcript which confirms Cruz\u2019s claim. Rubio argued that Cruz didn\u2019t know what he was talking about because\u2013 unlike Rubio\u2013 Cruz is not fluent in Spanish.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn\u2019t speak Spanish,\u201d Rubio said in response to Cruz\u2019s accusation.\n\nAsserting that non-Spanish speakers will never find out what you promise Spanish-speaking voters so long as you promise it in Spanish, is a curious tactic for someone who has been accused of telling voters one thing in English and another thing in Spanish. Rubio is essentially acknowledging that if he delivers a message in Spanish, English speakers won\u2019t be able to catch on to what he\u2019s saying.\n\nRubio then accused Cruz of fabricating the entire account: \u201cLook, this is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies. He lied about Ben Carson in Iowa. He lies about Planned Parenthood. He lies about marriage. He\u2019s lying about all sorts of things. And now he makes things up.\u201d\n\nHowever, video footage confirms Cruz\u2019s accusation\u2013 and suggests that it is Rubio who is \u201ctelling lies\u201d about his record.\n\nIndeed, in both Spanish and English language interviews, Rubio said that he would not \u201cimmediately\u201d rescind Obama\u2019s unconstitutional 2012 executive amnesty. Rubio even said that his \u201cideal\u201d plan would be to leave Obama\u2019s unconstitutional amnesty in place until Rubio\u2019s long-sought after legislative amnesty can replace it\u2013 i.e. Rubio has the same position on DREAMer amnesty as does President Obama.\n\nRUBIO\u2019S SPANISH-LANGUAGE UNIVISION INTERVIEW\n\nIn April of last year, Rubio appeared on a Spanish-language interview with Jorge Ramos and said that he would not \u201cundo\u201d Obama\u2019s unconstitutional amnesty \u201cimmediately\u201d.\n\nIt is perhaps bizarre that Rubio would now try to deny the existence of this exchange, since Rubio\u2019s campaign\u2013 in an on-the-record interview with Breitbart News \u2014 confirmed the Univision translation of Rubio\u2019s comments.\n\nAccording to the Univision transcript, Rubio said in Spanish:\n\nWell, DACA is going to have to end at some point. I wouldn\u2019t undo it immediately. The reason is that there are already people who have that permission, who are working, who are studying, and I don\u2019t think it would be fair to cancel it suddenly. But I do think it is going to have to end. And, God willing, it\u2019s going to end because immigration reform is going to pass.\n\nThis is not the first time Rubio has been caught in linguistic amnesty games before. As Phyllis Schlafly has pointed out, in 2013 Rubio told Rush Limbaugh that, under the Gang of Eight bill, border enforcement would precede amnesty. However, \u201cRubio had a different message in Spanish media. As Byron York reported: \u2018Let\u2019s be clear,\u2019 Rubio said. \u2018Nobody is talking about preventing the legalization. The legalization is going to happen. That means the following will happen: First comes the legalization. Then come the measures to secure the border. And then comes the process of permanent residence.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn April of 2015, following the Senator\u2019s Univision interview, Rubio\u2019s campaign suggested that a President Rubio\u2019s DREAMer amnesty would precede border security. As Breitbart News previously reported: \u201cThe chief spokesman for the presidential campaign of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said in an on-record interview with Breitbart News that the senator, if elected president, would not require a secured border before he gives legislative and permanent amnesty to recipients of President Barack Obama\u2019s first executive amnesty, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program\u2026 \u2018I mean when we were working on the 2012 bill, that was independent of the border,\u2019 [Alex] Conant said. \u2018These are the kids that already \u2014 I mean, the kids are in a very unique situation because they didn\u2019t willingly break the law.\u2019\u201d\n\nRUBIO\u2019S ENGLISH-LANGUAGE UNIVISION INTERVIEW\n\nRubio reiterated his desire not to rescind DACA immediately in an English-language interview with Jorge Ramos in April. Rubio said \u201cDACA\u2026 applies to young people that arrived in this country at a very young age before they were adults and I don\u2019t think we can immediately revoke that\u2026 I\u2019m not calling for it to be revoked tomorrow, or this week, or right away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it will have to end at some point and I hope it will end because of some reform to the immigration laws,\u201d Rubio said in English.\n\nAs Breitbart News has previously explained, this is the same policy supported by Barack Obama: namely that the President ought to leave the executive amnesty for DREAMers in place until Congress submits to the order by legislatively ratifying amnesty. After a legislatively ratified DREAM Act, illegal aliens would be able to vote in U.S. elections and bring their relatives to work and collect entitlements in the United States.\n\nIndeed, even the similarity of Rubio\u2019s rhetoric to that of President Obama\u2019s is striking. President Obama told Congress: \u201cif folks are serious about getting immigration reform done [they should be] passing a bill and getting it to my desk. And then the executive actions that I take go away.\u201d\n\nAnother striking feature of Rubio\u2019s declarations regarding DACA is that, like much of Rubio\u2019s rhetoric, he relies on repeat verbal constructions that have the effect of sounding highly rehearsed.\n\nIn November of last year, Rubio elaborated on his support for DREAMer amnesty. Rubio told reporters at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire that his \u201cideal way\u201d of transitioning out of Obama\u2019s amnesty would be for it to be \u201creplaced by a reform system that creates an alternative.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ideal way for it to end is that it\u2019s replaced by a reform system that creates an alternative,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nIn other words, Rubio is saying that there is no situation in which illegal aliens are not authorized to fill American jobs. In Rubio\u2019s mind, it is just a question of when the legalization transitions from an executive amnesty to a legislative amnesty.\n\n\u2014\n\nWhile Rubio dismissed Cruz\u2019s assertion as \u201clies,\u201d Rubio noticeably declined to say whether he would immediately terminate Obama\u2019s DREAMer amnesty. Rubio also avoided addressing Cruz\u2019s correct assertion that Rubio \u201cright now supports citizenship for 12 million people here illegally.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, none of the debate moderators challenged Rubio on the substance of Cruz\u2019s claim\u2013 nor anything else of substantive on the subject of immigration. Neither John Dickerson, Major Garrett nor Kimberley Strassel of the open borders Wall Street Journal editorial board asked Rubio whether he would rescind DACA immediately.\n\nInstead, Major Garrett asked Rubio if he could \u201cdefine amnesty.\u201d However, in his questioning, Garrett failed to note that Rubio had offered an amnesty bill in 2013\u2013 in essence, Garrett gave pro-amnesty Rubio a free opportunity to explain how he is allegedly not for amnesty\u2014just as he did throughout his Gang of Eight push.\n\nJohn Dickerson asked Rubio: \u201cIs it the case that in your list of accomplishments you can\u2019t mention that [i.e. the Gang of Eight\u2019s immigration reform]?\u201d Rubio replied by saying that the Gang of Eight\u2019s so-called \u201cimmigration reform\u201d was not an accomplishment because \u201cit didn\u2019t pass.\u201d\n\nDickerson did not follow up with his question to explain that the Gang of Eight did pass the Senate and would have passed the House if not but for a grassroots rebellion against the plan. Dickerson similarly failed to point out that Rubio still supports all of the substantive policies outlined in the Gang of Eight bill.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller has explained, there are \u201cthree core provisions to the Gang of Eight bill: (1) citizenship for illegal aliens, (2) massive expansions of foreign guest worker programs, and (3) large expansions to the rate of permanent annual immigration. He [Rubio] is in favor of and is campaigning in favor\u2026 of all three of those provisions. Everything else is just details. That\u2019s the core essence of the Gang of Eight bill, that\u2019s the core essence of Rubio\u2019s immigration platform today, that is the core essence of what he\u2019ll do as President.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one consistent through line of his [Rubio\u2019s] career, it is that every decision appears to be perfectly calculated to try and open America\u2019s borders,\u201d Miller has said. He is the \u201cfront man for the open borders syndicate\u2026 Rubio is determined to finish what he started with the Gang of Eight bill and to be President Obama\u2019s third term on immigration.\u201d\n\nMiller explained that the reason Rubio can\u2019t apologize for his role in pushing Obama\u2019s immigration agenda through the Senate is because \u201che believes to this day in everything that\u2019s in the Gang of 8 bill and wants to be in the Oval Office so that he can implement everything in the Gang of 8 bill\u2026 The reality is that Rubio is proud of the Gang of 8 bill. And his pride for the product, for the contents of the product, is so intense that he can\u2019t bring himself to even pretend to be remorseful about it.\u201d\n\nPhyllis Schlafly has pointed out that \u201cRubio\u2019s entire career rests on the fact that no one will question his syrupy scripted bites and homeroom-president style rehearsed speeches\u2026 Rubio would have a much, much better chance than Obama of getting an open borders bill through Congress \u2014 while Boehner could refuse to bring up Obama\u2019s mass immigration/amnesty bill for vote in 2014, Ryan would never refuse Rubio\u2019s bill. Rubio\u2019s presence, as it did with the Gang of Eight, would create the cover for both certain Republicans and all Democrats to get behind a far more open borders plan\u2026 There is likely no person in the United States of America in a better position to enact mass immigration legislation than a President Rubio.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s demonstrably false declaration tonight regarding his record on executive amnesty could arguably be a campaign-ending misstep. However, Fox News\u2019 enthusiastic reception of another Rubio debate performance in which he concealed his immigration record suggests that corporate media will be able to paint over the remarkable moment and can continue to boost Rubio\u2019s floundering campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Interview Transcript Proves Rubio Promised Hispanics en Espa\u00f1ol He'd Keep Executive Amnesty in Place", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Interview Transcript Proves Rubio Promised Hispanics en Espa\u00f1ol He'd Keep Executive Amnesty in Place", "title": "Interview Transcript Proves Rubio Promised Hispanics en Espa\u00f1ol He'd Keep Executive Amnesty in Place - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Ted-Cruz-Marco-Rubio-Getty-1.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-02-15T06:53:56-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/14/interview-transcript-proves-rubio-promised-hispanics-en-espanol-hed-keep-executive-amnesty-place/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Interview Transcript Proves Rubio Promised Hispanics en Espa\u00f1ol He'd Keep Executive Amnesty in Place", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Ted-Cruz-Marco-Rubio-Getty-1.jpg", "title": "Interview Transcript Proves Rubio Promised Hispanics en Espa\u00f1ol He'd Keep Executive Amnesty in Place - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism,rubio", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2016-02-14T13:19:24-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Big Journalism,2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-02-15T06:53:56-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In Rubio\u2019s mind, it is just a question of when the legalization transitions from an executive amnesty to a legislative amnesty.\nIn addition to that, Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama\u2019s illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.\nI have promised to rescind every single illegal executive action, including that one.\u201dCruz was referring specifically to President Obama\u2019s 2012 executive amnesty for illegal immigrants who allegedly came to the country as minors.\nIndeed, in both Spanish and English language interviews, Rubio said that he would not \u201cimmediately\u201d rescind Obama\u2019s unconstitutional 2012 executive amnesty.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn response to attacks leveled against him by Ted Cruz, Rubio made a demonstrably and provably false declaration about his position on President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty."}
