The Charlottesville Free Clinic has been addressing the needs of uninsured people in the area for many years.

New Executive Director Colleen Keller began her role there last month. She says that despite many more people having access to health care insurance, there are still many people in the community that are uninsured, and large numbers of under-insured people.

Keller says the Charlottesville Free Clinic is able to help fill that need in many ways, thanks in large part to their volunteers. Keller also says the expansion of mental health care into the primary care atmosphere, and their work with expanding the dental clinic, have created even more ways for them to reach patients.

She says, moving forward, they hope to add more chairs for patients needing dental care.
