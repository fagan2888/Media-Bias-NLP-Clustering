Former Vice President Dick Cheney has never been shy with his criticism for President Barack Obama, and a Monday conversation with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt marked no exception.

Sitting for an interview to promote wife Lynne Cheney's new book on James Madison, the former second-in-command said that, though he's a "big advocate of the strong executive office," he believes Obama has taken things too far.

"I really feel as though Barack Obama is ignoring the law in many cases, and going far beyond what was ever intended," he said. "I mean he, all by himself, sort of routinely changes the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, if it suits his will."

Cheney added that he believes the president teeters the line of unconstitutional behavior.

"I think much of what's been done does in fact skate up to the edge of violating the constitution in terms of the way he's interpreted his executive power," Cheney said.

Only one day earlier, the former vice president was calling Obama "weak" over his his approach to the crisis in Ukraine and confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"He's demonstrated repeatedly, I think, that he in fact can be pushed around, if you will, by Putin," Cheney said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday.
