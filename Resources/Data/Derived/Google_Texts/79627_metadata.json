He has appealed to the Civil Service Board, which hears appeals from workers who think they were unfairly disciplined or fired.\n\nFryer, 61, says those disciplinary actions were an orchestrated campaign by county higher-ups to get rid of him. The Civil Service Board denied the county\u2019s motion for summary judgment which, if approved, would have ended Fryer\u2019s hopes of getting his job back.\n\nThe county\u2019s motion for a swift end to Fryer\u2019s appeal included charges he had broken six civil service rules that dealt with incompetence, neglect of duties, and insubordination. The Civil Service Board did not find evidence any of those rules had been broken.\n\n\u201cThe board went through each of those charges and disagreed,\u201d Fryer said.\n\nIn answer to a request for comment on Fryer\u2019s case, the county responded with this statement: \u201cThe Civil Service Board ruled on a preliminary matter and now the case will move forward and be considered on its merits.\u201d\n\nFryer handled his civil service case without a lawyer, crafting an appeal supported by county documents he obtained through public records requests. Fryer said he will now hire an attorney to represent him in mediation with the county and a possible evidentiary hearing.\n\nCounty Administrator Mike Merrill fired Fryer about the same time three other Social Servicessocial services managers were let go. Sammie Walthour, the former division director, and Jim Silverwood, manager of the Homeless Recovery Program, were fired because of revelations that the homeless program was putting clients in unsafe, unsanitary apartments and mobile homes.\n\nReginald Earl, who managed the division\u2019s West Tampa Service Center, was fired for accepting county payments to house clients in rental apartments he owned.\n\nAmong the documents Fryer submitted to the Civil Service Board were several years\u2019 worth of personnel evaluations in which his performance was rated \u201cexceptional.\u201d\n\nThat changed in June 2012 when Mary Jo McKay, interim social services director, gave Fryer mostly \u201cmarginal\u201d ratings with no category rated above \u201csatisfactory.\u201d McKay had only been Fryer\u2019s supervisor for four months; Fryer said he never met McKay during that time and they worked in buildings miles apart.\n\nAlso during that time, McKay was reported to be on \u201cindefinite medical leave of absence,\u201d according to a statement by her supervisor, Family and Aging Services Director Venerria Thomas. She made the statement at a May 19, 2012, meeting of the Community Action Board, an advisory board made up of residents.\n\nFryer said he believes the poor performance evaluation was ordered by Thomas or her boss, Deputy County Administrator Sharon Subadan.\n\nFryer was especially incensed when Thomas, in an October interview with The Tampa Tribune, blamed him for a potential conflict of interest uncovered in her department during an internal investigation. Thomas said Fryer had ordered a social services manager named Anika Coney to send 12 students to a nonprofit job-training agency run by Coney\u2019s husband.\n\nFryer said the department\u2019s organizational chart shows he was not Anika Coney\u2019s boss and thus could not have given her orders. The county confirmed in an e-mail to the Tribune that Fryer was not Coney\u2019s supervisor.\n\nAlso backing Fryer\u2019s contention that Thomas and Subadan were out to get him was an affidavit submitted to the Civil Service Board from Sammie Walthour. The former social services director said it became apparent soon after he hired on with the county in July 2012 that it was the county administration\u2019s goal to fire Fryer.\n\n\u201cThe goal of firing Fryer, and my progress toward such, became a constant theme of my weekly one-on-one meetings with (Venerria) Thomas,\u201d Walthour wrote in the affidavit. \u201cThomas expressed that removal of Walthour was an aim of Deputy County Administrator Sharon Subadan.\u201d\n\nThe county argued that Walthour\u2019s affidavit consisted of \u201cinaccurate, misleading and outrageous allegations\u201d that were only raised after the county fired Walthour.\n\nIn her evaluation, McKay said Fryer\u2019s \u201ccredibility with his supervisors and the (Community Action Board) has been undermined by ineffective and/or unresponsive communication.\u201d\n\nThe evaluation also blamed Fryer for unfavorable audits of programs he oversaw.\n\nFryer said those unfavorable audits were not the fault of his team of four to five people who oversaw writing grant applications and communicating with the Community Action Board. To support his argument, Fryer submitted a letter from the West Central Florida Area Agency on Aging Inc. The agency made a grant of federal energy assistance funding to Hillsborough County.\n\nThe agency found a number of deficiencies in documentation that recipients were eligible for help paying their electric bills. But the agency also said one factor affecting the quality of the client files was the county\u2019s organizational structure. Fryer\u2019s team, while providing \u201ctechnical oversight to ensure program compliance ... do not directly supervise the social workers who dispense the funds,\u201d the Agency on Aging wrote in its audit.\n\n\u201cThe people who actually interact with the customers don\u2019t report to me,\u201d Fryer said. \u201cThe people who make the errors don\u2019t report to me.\u201d\n\nThe county claims Fryer had chances to improve his performance, but continued to under-perform by failing to submit budget modifications and grants in a timely fashion.\n\n\u201cYour failure to adequately plan and execute the timely submission in both these instances created an undue hardship on the county and jeopardized the receipt of over $2 million in funding,\u201d county attorneys said in a \u201cState of Charges.\u201d\n\nFryer said the late budget modifications were largely the fault of the county\u2019s Fiscal and Support Services Department, which must complete them.\n\nmsalinero@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-8303", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 16 Mar 2014 23:23:15 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 A former Hillsborough County social services manager who was fired last year when the county cleaned house over problems in its homeless housing program is trying to get his job back.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 A former Hillsborough County social services manager who was fired last year when the county cleaned house over problems in its homeless housing program is trying to get his job back.", "title": "Fired social services manager trying to get job back", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/fired-social-services-manager-trying-to-get-job-back-20140316/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-03-16T23:23:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Fired social services manager trying to get job back"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-03-16T23:23:15Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-03-16T23:23:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde526\"", "article_summary": "TAMPA \u2014 A former Hillsborough County social services manager who was fired last year when the county cleaned house over problems in its homeless housing program is trying to get his job back.\nCounty Administrator Mike Merrill fired Fryer about the same time three other Social Servicessocial services managers were let go.\nHe has appealed to the Civil Service Board, which hears appeals from workers who think they were unfairly disciplined or fired.\nThe Civil Service Board did not find evidence any of those rules had been broken.\nThomas said Fryer had ordered a social services manager named Anika Coney to send 12 students to a nonprofit job-training agency run by Coney\u2019s husband."}
