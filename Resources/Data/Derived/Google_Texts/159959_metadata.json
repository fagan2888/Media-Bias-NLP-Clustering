The series superficially resembles Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cBatman\u201d trilogy, in that it presents a view of urban life whose grim determinism can only be defeated by a man in spandex. However, the quality of the visuals \u2014 the pilot is directed by veteran \u201cMad Men\u201d director of photography Phil Abraham \u2014 and the series\u2019 complex moral calculus and dogged despite-it-all optimism set it apart from most contemporary comic fare.\n\nNot everyone agrees with my assessment of the series. In her Washington Post review, Alyssa Rosenberg (disclosure: she\u2019s a friend and early supporter of mine) accuses the show of possessing a \u201csense of certainty about guilt or innocence [that] feels awfully out of step with the [current] moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the killings of black men, teenagers and boys that have gripped this country in recent years have taught us anything,\u201d she continues, \u201cit should be that such fantasies of certainty are dangerous delusions.\u201d Rosenberg is correct that such fantasies can be dangerous \u2014 and that the extrajudicial manner in which blind lawyer-cum-crime-fighter Matthew Murdock (Charlie Cox) acts them out strays dangerously close to George Zimmerman territory.\n\nThe comic book fan in me would respond by saying that the dangers of such fantasies are exaggerated by the fact that the series itself poorly communicates the powers its titular character possesses. In the second episode, Murdock says he can smell cologne from three floors away and hear a man breathing from across a city block, but there\u2019s no real effort to explain how that set of skills would enable him to figure out \u2014 with absolute certainty \u2014 whether someone is lying. And that\u2019s a significant omission, because Murdock\u2019s moral clarity is a function of his those powers. He claims on multiple occasions that he knows when someone is lying, but it\u2019s not because of some nebulous gut instinct \u2014 being a human lie detector is one of his actual super powers, as he can sense changes in heart rate, galvanic skin response and the like.\n\nBut my real point of contention is one of scale. The larger argument the show makes is about the nature and necessity of different kinds of heroism \u2014 and the kind of social responsibility they entail. \u201cDaredevil\u201d almost never strays from Hell\u2019s Kitchen, an area of New York City which, the audience is repeatedly told, was effectively demolished by the events in Joss Whedon\u2019s first \u201cAvengers\u201d film. The Avengers were responsible for repelling an alien invasion, which is highly commendable, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 but someone has to pick up the pieces of the society that\u2019s shattered by the collateral damage, and that\u2019s what shows like \u201cDaredevil\u201d are explicitly about.\n\nIn fact, all of the shows Marvel will be producing with Netflix take place in this same small slice of the Marvel cinematic universe \u2014 and all of them address the human cost of having your city host a Hollywood action sequence. This is something Hollywood itself has never done, and television only rarely. Even the closest, the third season of \u201cBattlestar Galactica,\u201d had the feel of a reconstruction happening elsewhere, due to its visual and narrative references to Iraq.\n\nDaredevil\u2019s certainty \u2014 and the desire for it \u2014 isn\u2019t a reflection on the world the audience lives in, but in the large cinematic one Marvel is creating. Which is, I acknowledge, something of a cop out. The work is produced and proving to be quite popular in a historical moment rife with divisions between the authority of those who govern and the people they are supposed to protect \u2014 but in traditional noir fashion, the show is quite critical of the established authorities. \u201cDaredevil\u201d does not encourage viewers to kowtow to police, as the NYPD is institutionally and irrevocably corrupt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first of 4 Marvel shows coming to Netflix tries to rebuild what \"The Avengers\" alien battle destroyed", "title": "Marvel\u2019s gritty \u201cDaredevil\u201d: Fighting corruption in an urban war zone with an unlikely power \u2014 hope", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The first of 4 Marvel shows coming to Netflix tries to rebuild what \"The Avengers\" alien battle destroyed", "title": "Marvel\u2019s gritty \u201cDaredevil\u201d: Fighting corruption in an urban war zone with an unlikely power \u2014 hope", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/14/marvels_gritty_daredevil_fighting_corruption_in_an_urban_war_zone_with_an_unlikely_power_hope/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/daredevil.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The first of 4 Marvel shows coming to Netflix tries to rebuild what \"The Avengers\" alien battle destroyed", "title": "Marvel\u2019s gritty \u201cDaredevil\u201d: Fighting corruption in an urban war zone with an unlikely power \u2014 hope", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/daredevil.jpg", "creator": "@scottekaufman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Eric Kaufman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Daredevil, Marvel, Netflix, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1343\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Daredevil, Marvel, Netflix, TV, Entertainment NewsOn Friday, Marvel released the first for four collaborations with Netflix, \u201cDaredevil,\u201d which follows the trials of a blind lawyer who fights for the rights of the downtrodden in courtrooms by day and back alleys by night.\n\u201cDaredevil\u201d does not encourage viewers to kowtow to police, as the NYPD is institutionally and irrevocably corrupt.\nAnd that\u2019s a significant omission, because Murdock\u2019s moral clarity is a function of his those powers.\nThe series superficially resembles Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cBatman\u201d trilogy, in that it presents a view of urban life whose grim determinism can only be defeated by a man in spandex.\nDaredevil\u2019s certainty \u2014 and the desire for it \u2014 isn\u2019t a reflection on the world the audience lives in, but in the large cinematic one Marvel is creating."}
