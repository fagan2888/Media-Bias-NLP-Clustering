“Don't be mean; keep the river clean.” That's the philosophy of one local organization.

On Saturday, several members of NAS Meridian were on hand at Chunky River Shoals Fish Camp to help clean up along the riverbank. The event is sponsored by the East Mississippi Foothills Land Trust and is actually the organization’s 12th event to host. EMFLT board president Chris Phillips says the organization is focused on protecting places of significant cultural influence.

"We're able to come out and enjoy our time in the great outdoors on the river and also allow those individuals to see what damage pollution does and when we neglect our environment. It allows us to educate them, as well," Phillips says.

Volunteers from Saturday’s cleanup say feel free to contact NAS Meridian for any assistance you may need with future community service projects.
