Chris Christie and other state officials including the state\u2019s director of gaming enforcement, David Rebuck.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe leagues argued that the New Jersey law violated the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which Congress passed in 1992 to prohibit state-sanctioned sports gambling.\n\nWriting the court\u2019s decision Tuesday, Judge Marjorie Rendell said federal judges are \u201cduty-bound to interpret the text of the law as Congress wrote it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile PASPA\u2019s provisions and its reach are controversial and, some might say, unwise, we are not asked to judge the wisdom of PASPA and it is not our place to usurp Congress\u2019 role simply because PASPA may have become an unpopular law,\u201d she said.\n\nJustice Julio Fuentes dissented from the court's majority and sided with the state, which argued that its 2014 law complied with PASPA because it did not create a comprehensive scheme or provide for a state regulatory role in sports gambling.\n\nFuentes said Congress did not intend for private sports wagering in casinos to violate PASPA.\n\n\u201cThe majority fails to illustrate how the 2014 Law results in sports wagering pursuant to state law when there is no law in place as to several locations, no scheme created, and no state involvement,\" he said.\n\nThe American Gambling Association said the Third Circuit's ruling shows the need for a deeper examination into the best path forward on the issue of sports betting and how gaming should be regulated.\n\n\u201cWith Americans betting at least $140 billion on sports illegally each year, it's clear that current law is not achieving its intended result,\u201d AGA President and CEO Geoff Freeman said in a statement. \u201cAs the AGA leads an industry-wide task force to study sports betting, we will assess the implications of the court's decision as the gaming industry continues to develop innovative ways to provide products and experiences that meet consumers' demands.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The federal ruling reaffirmed that state-sanctioned sports gambling is illegal.", "description": "The federal ruling reaffirmed that state-sanctioned sports gambling is illegal.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The federal ruling reaffirmed that state-sanctioned sports gambling is illegal.", "title": "Court rules against New Jersey's sports betting law", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/251913-court-rules-against-nj-in-sports-gambling-case", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/christiechris_110213getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/251913-court-rules-against-nj-in-sports-gambling-case", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-25T14:22-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Gambling, Casino, Law, Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, Sports betting,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-25T14:22:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/251913-court-rules-against-nj-in-sports-gambling-case", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The federal ruling reaffirmed that state-sanctioned sports gambling is illegal.", "card": "summary", "title": "Court rules against New Jersey's sports betting law"}, "dcterms.title": "Court rules against New Jersey's sports betting law"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe majority fails to illustrate how the 2014 Law results in sports wagering pursuant to state law when there is no law in place as to several locations, no scheme created, and no state involvement,\" he said.\nIn a 2-1 vote, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision to strike down the law that deregulated professional, collegiate and amateur sports betting at casinos and racetracks.\nADVERTISEMENTThe leagues argued that the New Jersey law violated the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which Congress passed in 1992 to prohibit state-sanctioned sports gambling.\nA federal appeals court ruled against New Jersey Tuesday in a case challenging a sports gambling law the state passed in 2014 to revive its failing casinos and racetracks.\n\u201cWith Americans betting at least $140 billion on sports illegally each year, it's clear that current law is not achieving its intended result,\u201d AGA President and CEO Geoff Freeman said in a statement."}
