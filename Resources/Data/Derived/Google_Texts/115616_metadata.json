I don\u2019t shame ANYone for anything they choose to do with their lives or bodies\u2026,\u201d Jones responded. \u201cBUT I think we ALL need to take a look at what we are accepting as \u2018the norm\u2019\u2026There is a whole generation of young women watching. Sure, be SEXY but leave something to the imagination.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday night, the actress offered a lengthier explanation decrying the \u201cpornification of pop stars\u201d in an op-ed in Glamour Magazine. Though Jones \u201cwould never point a finger at a woman for her actual sexual behavior\u201d and thinks that \u201call women have the right to express their desires,\u201d she argues that \u201cThis isn\u2019t showing female sexuality; this is showing what it looks like when women sell sex.\u201d\n\nShe wrote:\n\nMy hashtag was \u201cstopactinglikewhores.\u201d Key word, acting. Like I said, I\u2019m not criticizing anyone\u2019s real sex life; as George Michael tells us, \u201cSex is natural, sex is fun.\u201d But the poles, the pasties, the gyrating: This isn\u2019t showing female sexuality; this is showing what it looks like when women sell sex. (Also, let\u2019s be real. Every woman\u2019s sexuality is different. Can all of us really be into stripper moves? The truth is, for every woman who loves the pole, there\u2019s another who likes her feet rubbed. But in pop culture there\u2019s just one way to be. And so much of it feels staged for men, not for our own pleasure.)\n\nJones\u2019s line of thinking is tempting: Women are still fighting to be taken seriously on all social fronts; we want to have it all, we are leaning in, and we are demanding agency over our bodies. Seeing young women flaunting their physical assets seemingly to fulfill male fantasies is the antithesis of that.
