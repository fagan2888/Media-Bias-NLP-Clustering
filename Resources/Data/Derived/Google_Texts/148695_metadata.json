But scale will also give health plans better negotiating leverage. Providers obviously won\u2019t love that, but it will help the health-care marketplace move faster toward payment for value instead of paying providers on a fee-for-service basis. And that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nIt may be counterintuitive that consolidation could have a positive impact on pricing, Winkler acknowledges. And indeed, he says, less choice of carriers likely would enable insurers to jack up their fees for administering health plans. But the fees account for only 15% to 20% of overall health costs. \u201cThe reality is that the far bigger chunk of costs is for claims, and those costs are a function of the contracted rates negotiated between providers and insurance carriers.\u201d\n\nIf anything, it\u2019s consolidation among providers, rather than insurers, that employers should be worried about, according to Winkler. There is substantial activity in that arena today, with hospital systems merging and buying up physician practices. \u201cThat\u2019s starting to lead to increased cost,\u201d he says. \u201cA hospital that buys stand-alone physician practices is essentially turning itself into an out-patient facility but charging more for that\u201d than the stand-alone practices did.\n\nBut, he reinforces, he expects the negotiating advantage would tip toward new mega-insurers, if the announced and potential deals are completed, regardless of bigger provider groups. \u201cNet net, if it all plays out the way it should, it would be favorable to the health-care [cost] trend.\u201d\n\nSo far, most employers seem not to be grasping the concept. During a recent webinar attended by 100 of its clients \u2014 mostly human resources officers but also some finance executives \u2014 Aon Hewitt polled them on how they believe insurer consolidation would affect their benefits plans. Forty-six percent said they expected a negative impact, compared with only 21% who foresaw a positive outcome.\n\nMore than half (56%) of the participants said they would take some action in response to consolidation. Most of those said they\u2019d reassess their choice of health-plan providers.\n\nFor Winkler\u2019s part, while he says such re-evaluation would be prudent, he sees the gloomy forecast on the effects of consolidation as shortsighted thinking.\n\nTo be sure, there are visible concerns \u2014 not only having less choice of carriers, but also that big insurers would be distracted from innovation during the integration process.\n\n\u201cAetna and Humana have two claims systems, two administrative models, different clinical approaches to managing care, and different sales forces and leadership teams,\u201d he says. \u201cBringing all that stuff together into one company would be distracting. Insurance leaders who would normally be thinking about new client solutions or be out in the marketplace talking to customers would have to be in meetings talking about things like who should run the sales office in Topeka.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s a short-term concern, he notes. In fact, the reduced roster of health insurers may be as well. \u201cIf employers have less choice, inevitably new solutions will emerge [in the form of] regional or local health plans,\u201d Winkler says. \u201cThe next logical step for the hospital systems that are buying physician practices so they can have an integrated delivery system would be buying or renting claims processing capability, [thereby] becoming local health plans themselves.\u201d\n\nImage: Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "It may be counterintuitive, but insurer consolidation like Aetna's planned purchase of Humana could lead to lower pricing from medical providers.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Could Insurer Consolidation Check Health Costs?\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2015\\/07\\/insurer-consolidation-check-health-costs\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-15 13:43:03\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-07-15 13:43:03\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":420240,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"Aetna\",\"Anthem\",\"Aon Hewitt\",\"Cigna\",\"Health insurance\"],\"categories\":[\"Banking &amp; Capital Markets\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\",\"M&amp;A\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/07\\/Insurer-consolidate-2.jpg\"}", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "It may be counterintuitive, but insurer consolidation like Aetna's planned purchase of Humana could lead to lower pricing from medical providers.", "title": "Will Insurer Consolidation Pare Health-Cost Hikes?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2015/07/Insurer-consolidate-2.jpg", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2015/07/insurer-consolidation-check-health-costs/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "It may be counterintuitive, but insurer consolidation like Aetna's planned purchase of Humana could lead to lower pricing from medical providers.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "Will Insurer Consolidation Pare Health-Cost Hikes?", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Could Insurer Consolidation Check Health Costs?", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "date": 20150715, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "M&A", "tag": "Jim Winkler", "published_time": "2015-07-15T13:43:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "aetna, anthem, aon hewitt, cigna, health insurance, humana, insurance industry consolidation, jim winkler"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf employers have less choice, inevitably new solutions will emerge [in the form of] regional or local health plans,\u201d Winkler says.\nIn fact, the reduced roster of health insurers may be as well.\nBut the fees account for only 15% to 20% of overall health costs.\nBut scale will also give health plans better negotiating leverage.\nAnd indeed, he says, less choice of carriers likely would enable insurers to jack up their fees for administering health plans."}
