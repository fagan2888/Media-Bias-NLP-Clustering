Writing over at Cosmopolitan, Jill Abramson addressed her unceremonious ouster after becoming the first woman to serve as executive editor at the New York Times (“the loudness of the coverage was surprising”), what she did next (boxed, watched Yankees games), her advice to aspiring journalists (“master the basics of really good storytelling”) and how to get yourself paid in an industry that is pretty bad about paying a lot of people (“become a confident negotiator”).

Abramson also addressed her apparent misandry (remember that?):

When I was managing editor, for the first time the masthead [the list of top editors at the Times] was half women, but it was because they were great and they deserved it. I am totally proud of that. A couple of times I had to explain that to men. I think there was some surprise at the speed at which some women got promoted.
