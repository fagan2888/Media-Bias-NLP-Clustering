We\u2019ve only been in the market for 5 years. This is a very burdensome tax because it is based on sales, not profits, and the only way we can pay a tax like this is to cut expenses,\u201d OrthoPediatrics CEO Mark Throdahl told The Daily Caller.\n\n\u201cIn terms of magnitude, [the tax] is about the size of our entire product development budget,\u201d Throdahl said. \u201cWe have had to reduce our development budget. We\u2019re developing less products than we otherwise would. It has cut into our development expenses. The only way we can trump up the money to pay this tax is to reduce expenses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not cut people because that\u2019s not our program but we have deferred adding additional positions at the company so as to make room for the expense reductions.\u201d\n\nIndiana-based OrthoPediatrics develops products for children worldwide including \u201canatomically appropriate implants, instrumentation and biologics for pediatric and small stature patients,\u201d produced with the assistance of its Surgeon Advisory Board, and owns exclusive rights to two of the world\u2019s largest collections of pediatric skeletal data.\n\n\u201cWe are focused exclusively on developing orthopedic implants for children. In the operating room our products are being used on the bone\u2026to treat deformities in the legs and the spine. A lot of our products are used for children with cerebral palsy. They reduce discomfort. Sometimes they allow kids to walk for the first time,\u201d Throdahl said. \u201cWe are the only company in the world focused exclusively on this.\u201d\n\nObamacare\u2019s medical device excise tax has already created a job loss of 33,000 people in the medical device industry and 132,000 more job losses are expected with other jobs expected to be outsourced outside the United States, according to a recent report from the industry trade group the Advanced Medical Technology Association. Nearly one-third of the medical device companies surveyed by AdvaMed reported cutbacks in research and development (R&D).\n\n\u201cAn excise tax which is what this is \u2014 a tax on sales \u2014 is used typically for things like liquor and tires, and it\u2019s incredible that the government has levied this tax on medical devices for kids,\u201d Throdahl said, adding that the tax impacts American \u201cglobal competitiveness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have spent about a third of my career living and working outside the United States. The U.S. medical device industry is one of the few industries left where our country has competitive advantage. We really are the global leader. It is so maladroit that the U.S. government is burdening one of the few industries where we\u2019re still a leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of companies in our industry are small businesses. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re tacking a 2 percent tax onto Pfizer. There are hundreds of companies just like ours that are struggling with this tax\u2026The expenses in this industry are enormous. We have 16 surgical systems in the market now. These are very expensive to maintain. We have a direct sales force. We\u2019re selling [products] outside the United States. It will be several more years before we break even.\u201d\n\nThrodahl noted that the tax does not threaten the company\u2019s survival, and that OrthoPediatrics is still growing 40 percent per year and revenues are rising. But he\u2019s afraid of the impact the tax will have on the industry\u2019s overall investment in research and development.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that nationally there have been headcount reductions in the major firms and a slowdown in hiring, There\u2019s no question that this is having an impact,\u201d he said, particularly with respect to reduced R&D.\n\n\u201cR&D is the lifeblood of an industry like this which is based on new technology.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not return a request for comment.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "'It's incredible that the government has levied this tax on medical devices for kids'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The world's only company specializing in making orthopedic equipment for children is slashing its product development budget and freezing hiring as a result of Obamacare's medical device tax.    \"We a", "title": "Company that makes medical equipment for kids hit hard by Obamacare", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/25/company-that-makes-medical-equipment-for-kids-hit-hard-by-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 766, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-26T003633Z_1_CBREA1P01P000_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1393388154530.jpg", "height": 330}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'It's incredible that the government has levied this tax on medical devices for kids'", "title": "Company that makes medical equipment for kids hit hard by Obamacare Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/25/company-that-makes-medical-equipment-for-kids-hit-hard-by-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-26T003633Z_1_CBREA1P01P000_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1393388154530.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-25 23:16:17", "sailthru.title": "Company that makes medical equipment for kids hit hard by Obamacare", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "The world's only company specializing in making orthopedic equipment for children is slashing its product development budget and freezing hiring as a result of Obamacare's medical device tax.    \"We a", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-26T003633Z_1_CBREA1P01P000_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1393388154530.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The U.S. medical device industry is one of the few industries left where our country has competitive advantage.\nNearly one-third of the medical device companies surveyed by AdvaMed reported cutbacks in research and development (R&D).\n4107297The world\u2019s only company specializing in making orthopedic equipment for children is slashing its product development budget and freezing hiring as a result of Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax.\nIn the operating room our products are being used on the bone\u2026to treat deformities in the legs and the spine.\nA lot of our products are used for children with cerebral palsy."}
