Meet Sue Sherlock, one of a less numerous yet supportive group of Vermonters helping to tame the often intimidating paperwork and computer programs that spring up during income tax season.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people who are nervous about doing even the simplest of returns,\u201d she says.\n\nThat\u2019s why Sherlock, a Brattleboro accountant, devotes a day a week to the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program \u2014 just one of several free in-person and online services available for low- to middle-income and senior Vermonters.\n\nThe VITA program, sponsored by the Internal Revenue Service and United Ways of Vermont, helps people with a 2015 household income of up to $54,000, as well as those who are older, disabled or speak limited English.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very much needed service,\u201d Sherlock says, \u201cespecially because taxes can be complicated, and it can be costly to have them done.\u201d\n\nTake the case of a reporter seeking to both calculate his federal and state taxes and chronicle the free assistance options for fellow math-phobes.\n\nCalling Vermont 211 to schedule an appointment, I was asked to bring my Social Security card, W-2s and other revenue and expense statements.\n\nDabble in freelance writing? Don\u2019t expect an easy time reporting it.\n\n\u201cThere are so many codes for obscure businesses,\u201d Sherlock says. \u201cTile and terrazzo contractor, coal miner \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many self-employed coal miners there are \u2014 but you can\u2019t find one that says writer.\u201d\n\n(The answer: Try \u201cother.\u201d)\n\nThe nation\u2019s new Affordable Care Act and its 1095 health insurance statements are proving equally problematic.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing has caused confusion,\u201d says Sherlock, who has seen mistakes on many state forms.\n\nBut soon the accountant, working on a laptop, presses a few buttons to electronically file a federal and state return and print copies for safekeeping.\n\nThe IRS and the Vermont Department of Taxes train and test volunteers for both the VITA program and AARP Foundation Tax-Aide, which focuses on people age 60 and older.\n\nPreparers can file federal and state income tax returns, household income schedules and homestead declarations, property tax adjustment and renter rebate claims, and take advantage of tax credits.\n\nFor Vermonters who prefer to file themselves, those with a 2015 household income of up to $62,000 can complete their federal and state taxes online without charge at the MyFreeTaxes website (www.myfreetaxes.com/vermont) with phone assistance at 855-My-Tx-Help (855-698-9435).\n\nThe state also is promoting a Vermont Free File partnership between the IRS and several tax preparation software companies, with information available on the websites www.irs.gov/freefile and tax.vermont.gov/individuals/free-file.\n\n\u201cWe want more Vermonters to take advantage of Free File,\u201d state Tax Commissioner Mary Peterson said in a statement, \u201cbecause it not only saves taxpayers time and money, it also provides valued savings to Vermont\u2019s government, with fewer processing costs and errors than paper returns.\u201d\n\nMore information about all free options is available here.\n\nThe VITA program, for its part, is always seeking volunteers to assist others.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of people who don\u2019t have the confidence to do it themselves or don\u2019t have access to a computer or the means to pay a professional,\u201d Sherlock says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "irs, taxes, vermont department of taxes, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "Low- to middle-income and senior residents are finding more federal and state assistance with tax forms both in person and online.", "title": "Vermont promotes free tax preparation help | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/VTD-Free-tax-help.jpg", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2016/04/03/vermont-promotes-free-tax-preparation-help/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Low- to middle-income and senior residents are finding more federal and state assistance with tax forms both in person and online.", "creator": "@vtdigger", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/VTD-Free-tax-help.jpg?fit=4000%2C3000", "title": "Vermont promotes free tax preparation help | VTDigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "taxes, Vermont Department of Taxes, IRS", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Business & Economy", "tag": "Vermont Department of TAxes", "published_time": "2016-04-03T14:13:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Preparers can file federal and state income tax returns, household income schedules and homestead declarations, property tax adjustment and renter rebate claims, and take advantage of tax credits.\nThe state also is promoting a Vermont Free File partnership between the IRS and several tax preparation software companies, with information available on the websites www.irs.gov/freefile and tax.vermont.gov/individuals/free-file.\nMeet Sue Sherlock, one of a less numerous yet supportive group of Vermonters helping to tame the often intimidating paperwork and computer programs that spring up during income tax season.\nThat\u2019s why Sherlock, a Brattleboro accountant, devotes a day a week to the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program \u2014 just one of several free in-person and online services available for low- to middle-income and senior Vermonters.\n\u201cWe want more Vermonters to take advantage of Free File,\u201d state Tax Commissioner Mary Peterson said in a statement, \u201cbecause it not only saves taxpayers time and money, it also provides valued savings to Vermont\u2019s government, with fewer processing costs and errors than paper returns.\u201dMore information about all free options is available here."}
