D\u2019Baha and other civil rights activists are calling for a review board outside police control.\n\nLess than a day after video of Walter Scott\u2019s death flickered on computer screens worldwide, some residents of North Charleston called for a new committee with the power to examine police abuses.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying Donta Bowens, president of the Accabee Neighborhood Association, on whether residents report police brutality at community meetings attended by officers: \u201cWe\u2019re there for the neighborhoods, but there are no complaints. ... You\u2019ve got some bad cops, but until it\u2019s documented, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201d The Rev. Robert Kennedy of St. Peter\u2019s AME Church, member of Community and Police Panel, on the possibility of a review board with subpoena powers: \u201cI think it could be a case where it may be needed.\u201d Activist Thomas Dixon on the city\u2019s response to call for review board: \u201cThe dialogue phase has never gotten off the ground. Once again, it\u2019s those people saying the same thing: \u2018It\u2019s really not as bad as you think.\u2019 \u201d Charleston NAACP President Dot Scott on fear that police critics will create civil unrest: \u201cI don\u2019t think the city realizes how close they are with some younger people who are saying, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 If they don\u2019t get heard, they\u2019re going to do it their own way. ... The dog you mistreat will turn around and bite you.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t trust internal investigators to root out the problems they thought contributed to Scott\u2019s fatal encounter with Michael Slager, a white officer who shot the fleeing black man in the back.\n\nMayor Keith Summey sees the idea as unreasonable. He refused to meet with some people making the demand. He didn\u2019t see the need for a panel with subpoena powers, and he didn\u2019t have the authority to create one anyway, he said.\n\nBut the divide between the police in North Charleston and some residents will never narrow unless city leaders listen to ideas from their harshest critics, according to former police officials, law enforcement experts and activists beyond South Carolina where review boards have worked. Last week, local advocates spoke of a fear that shutting out detractors who have issued veiled threats of unrest could have dangerous consequences.\n\nWhen Chicago considered civil rights reforms over a decade ago, then-Police Superintendent Terry Hillard fought off allegations that his department didn\u2019t thoroughly investigate misconduct. Hillard, now retired from the force and running a private consulting firm, eventually saw the benefit of getting outside input \u2014 no matter how extreme it seemed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a believer that the police cannot investigate themselves when it comes to certain issues like brutality,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in order to do something about it, you have to sit down with the people who don\u2019t agree with you \u2014 the people who like the police and the people who don\u2019t like the police.\u201d\n\nThe oversight system that\u2019s best for North Charleston likely would come from the community, either through discussions or a ruling in a class-action lawsuit that prompts a new law, experts said. It has taken different forms nationwide, from a former judge hired as an inspector general to a panel of appointed residents and hired citizen investigators and attorneys who recommend penalties for rule-breaking officers.\n\nSeveral religious and neighborhood leaders on North Charleston\u2019s Community and Police Panel, which the city created eight years ago during its first attempt to mend ties with alienated populations, said a new group was worth considering.\n\nSummey, meanwhile, has vowed to open up police practices and policies for scrutiny, his spokesman said. Walter Atkinson, a community relations expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, also will visit the city. The Justice Department is looking for any civil rights implications in Scott\u2019s death.\n\nThe mayor \u201chas not been sitting idle,\u201d spokesman Ryan Johnson said, but he won\u2019t work to build a citizen board with subpoena powers.\n\nGovernment organizations, usually courts, and attorneys issue subpoenas to compel someone to testify or produce evidence. Penalties for not complying can include jail time.\n\nSummey \u201chas always had an open door to discuss any reasonable issue,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBuilding trust and mending relationships is a difficult task, and the city is dedicated to achieving this goal.\u201d\n\nA source of insight\n\nChuck Wexler\u2019s heart broke when he saw the video of Slager shooting Scott. A former Boston police official who heads the Police Executive Research Forum in Washington, Wexler has considerable emotional stock in the North Charleston Police Department.\n\nIn 2007, coming off the deadliest year in the city\u2019s history, then-Police Chief Jon Zumalt sought Wexler\u2019s advice for finding community input on how to tackle the violence.\n\nThe Community and Police Panel was born, and Wexler oversaw the group\u2019s early meetings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in citizen involvement,\u201d he said. \u201c(Zumalt) was really trying to get them involved. But that was eight years ago, and it has to be a sustained effort.\u201d\n\nPanel members met monthly with police commanders and talked about the department\u2019s saturation patrols in high-crime areas \u2014 a measure critics would label as an \u201coccupation\u201d \u2014 and cookouts where officers mingled with residents.\n\nThe panel offered feedback, and its discussions gave rise to an \u201cimmersion\u201d program in which officers met residents by knocking on doors. Zumalt, now retired and living in Kansas, said last week that he often tweaked crime-fighting initiatives based on the group\u2019s suggestions.\n\nThe panel never was designed to review police actions, he said.\n\n\u201cI found it to be very valuable,\u201d Zumalt said. \u201cI would get a lot of insight from them on what we were doing and how we could do a better job.\u201d\n\nWexler recommended including a local leader considered at the time to be the department\u2019s nemesis: James Johnson, now president of the local chapter of the National Action Network.\n\nJohnson had complained for years about alleged abuses and racial profiling. The panel gave him an outlet. But he said few others wanted to hear his concerns about the aggressive tactics used to stifle the violence that made North Charleston a Top 10 most dangerous U.S. city in 2006 and 2007.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to talk good about the department all the time, and I didn\u2019t want to be a part of that,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe panel would not make a decision to change the department. Until we can get a citizens review board, there will never be any true reform.\u201d\n\nFrustrated, Johnson quit going to meetings three years ago. He complained that the city had hand-picked other members because they fell in line with Summey\u2019s views.\n\nOne member, activist Charles Tyler, said he was chosen because he mentors children in the community.\n\n\u201cThe city is going to pick people they think are good for that board,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Bridge the gap\u2019\n\nThe panel\u2019s goal always has been to bridge the gap between residents and the police, said Lydia Cotton, a Hispanic community activist seen as a group leader. Cotton often set out into her Stall Road neighborhood to bring what she had learned from the police to residents.\n\n\u201cWe, the people, were making more mistakes than the Police Department,\u201d she said. \u201cThey needed to understand how the police and the city work.\u201d\n\nPanel members saw homicides plummet from 29 in 2006, before their group formed, to five in 2010. It was a fruit of their labor to help narrow that divide, they said.\n\nComplaints, though, rose. In 2011, 36 people filed written complaints against the police compared with 22 in 2008. The Post and Courier has requested more recent data from the city.\n\nAfter Police Chief Eddie Driggers took over the department in early 2013, Cotton said her panel doesn\u2019t meet as often as it used to. Members now get together every other month.\n\nA dozen of the 22 members consistently attend the meetings, police spokesman Spencer Pryor said. But they\u2019re still crucial to the police in \u201cidentifying issues of concern from citizens and bringing those issue to the department,\u201d Pryor said.\n\n\u2018Stick with it\u2019\n\nThe panel never had legal authority to serve in a true oversight role. Many members, though, welcomed talk of the idea.\n\nOne of the citizen complaints against the police in 2013 was filed against Slager, the patrolman jailed in Scott\u2019s slaying. A resident said Slager had wrongfully shocked him with a Taser, and despite other accounts to back up the man\u2019s story, internal investigators exonerated the officer.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. David Mack, a North Charleston resident and panel member who acknowledged that he hadn\u2019t been to a meeting in a while, said the group never delved deeply into complaints, but an oversight panel might help attack a perception that a \u201cblue code of silence\u201d leaves misconduct unaddressed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the chief and us are going to work together closer than ever,\u201d said Cotton, who declined to take a stance on the issue. \u201cThe fire in the heart of the people on the panel is very high because of what happened.\u201d\n\nBut the call for a powerful board outside police control has been persistent. In a recent town hall meeting, activists, City Council members and national political leaders took on the topic.\n\n\u201cIf we have subpoena powers,\u201d said Muhiyidin d\u2019Baha, a leader of the Black Lives Matter Charleston group who has led protests since Scott\u2019s death, \u201cwe can ask an officer to be summoned to the court to say, \u2018Hey, buddy, you\u2019ve been messing around, profiling and harassing folks. Answer for that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nState Sen. Marlon Kimpson, D-Charleston, and U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., told d\u2019Baha that it would take a new city ordinance.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great concept to think about,\u201d City Councilman Michael Brown said at the meeting, \u201cbut it has to be talked about.\u201d\n\nRyan Johnson, the city spokesman, told The Post and Courier last week that the mayor won\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s not possible.\n\n\u201cThe city does not have and cannot grant subpoena powers,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, yes, that is unreasonable.\u201d\n\nOther cities have found ways to create a review board.\n\nThe mayor of Newark, N.J., issued an executive order Thursday to create a police oversight panel with subpoena powers.\n\nIn cities like Chicago, such an organization has come about more painstakingly.\n\nHillard, the former Chicago police superintendent, said city leaders created the civilian-staffed Independent Police Review Authority in 2007 to replace the department\u2019s internal affairs division.\n\nIn Cincinnati, residents filed a class-action lawsuit after officers killed two unarmed black men in 2001, said Iris Roley, a businesswoman and activist with the Cincinnati Black United Front.\n\nCity leaders and police unions fought the idea of a powerful oversight panel. But many people, Roley said, didn\u2019t trust internal investigators to take their complaints and come up with repercussions for officers.\n\nAfter a federal judge approved a settlement in the suit, the city was forced to create the Citizens Complaint Authority through a new ordinance. Now, the authority\u2019s retired law officers and private investigators have subpoena powers. Hired by the City Council, they go behind the yellow crime tape to investigate misconduct and recommend penalties for officers to the city manager, Roley said.\n\n\u201cChange hasn\u2019t been easy, and it doesn\u2019t get easier,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s something the people must do, and they must stick with it.\u201d\n\nFinding a solution\n\nWhether a review board will work for North Charleston is an unanswered question, but many community leaders and officials, aside from the mayor, said it deserves more thought.\n\nWexler, the adviser for the former police chief, said the city should seek input from people who don\u2019t agree with the mayor and the new chief. A police watchdog could come in the form of a retired, respected judge who serves as a police inspector general or an ombudsman, Wexler said.\n\n\u201cThere is no one best model,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what they all share is a way for citizens to play an important oversight role. But if you don\u2019t fund it and it doesn\u2019t have subpoena power, it\u2019s not going to be very effective.\u201d\n\nThe power typically lies in attorneys who use subpoenas for investigations in civil lawsuits, former S.C. Attorney General Charlie Condon said. To look into criminal matters, attorneys usually can use subpoenas when a court case is open, Condon said.\n\nLegislative panels also use subpoenas for their own probes.\n\nIt likely would take an act by the state General Assembly or the City Council to create an oversight board with such powers, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a monumental government power to give to an unelected board,\u201d Condon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a laudable purpose, but it could be subject to abuse.\u201d\n\nJohn Freeman, a professor emeritus at the University of South Carolina School of Law who has studied ethical aspects of subpoenas, said that an oversight board would need the power to be effective. But the issue requires close study, he said.\n\n\u201cWithout having a compulsory way to accumulate facts, basically all you\u2019ve got is a feel-good operation that does not have the ability to produce results,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a toothless lion.\u201d\n\nCharleston County School Board Chairwoman Cindy Bohn Coats thinks the city\u2019s current police panel that she joined five years ago could address the demand without forming a new organization.\n\n\u201cThis would be a good conversation for the city to have,\u201d Coats said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel, but, of course, you can always improve your processes.\u201d\n\nMembers met two weeks after Scott\u2019s death and talked about how they could better define their leadership. Mention of becoming more of an oversight body didn\u2019t come up.\n\nEd Bryant, president of the North Charleston chapter of the NAACP, is a community leader who has the mayor\u2019s ear. Coats\u2019 group, he said, has never prompted meaningful change.\n\nHe thinks the City Council, rather, should assemble a review board by hiring attorneys, paralegals and investigators.\n\n\u201cWhen it gets down to the nuts and bolts, you\u2019re not doing anything without experts,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a Girl Scout cookie club investigating criminals at the Police Department.\u201d\n\nThe mayor has welcomed input from Bryant, Johnson, the city\u2019s spokesman, said.\n\n\u201cThere will be opportunities\u201d over the next several months, he said, \u201cfor the residents to express their concerns, in an open format, and be a part of the solution.\u201d\n\nBut some area advocates said last week that they feared peace here would not last if younger residents grow frustrated with the pace of change. North Charleston has dodged the violent riots that erupted in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore, where officers\u2019 treatment of black men also has come into focus.\n\nJames Johnson, the activist who defected from the police panel, said he had grown tired of complaining about an \u201coppressive\u201d police system here.\n\n\u201cIf the mayor thinks this will disappear, he\u2019s got another thing coming,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it in Baltimore. If you push people into a corner, they\u2019re going to come out fighting.\u201d\n\nGlenn Smith and Melissa Boughton contributed to this report. Reach Andrew Knapp at 937-5414 or twitter.com/offlede.
