Costly turnovers. Missed tackles.\n\nIt\u2019s been the same story for the Philadelphia Eagles all season.\n\nKirk Cousins threw four touchdown passes and had a season-high 365 yards and the Washington Redskins beat the Eagles 38-24 on Saturday night to clinch the NFC East title.\n\nThe Eagles (6-9) entered the game in control of their playoff hopes. They needed to beat the Redskins and Giants next week to win the East. Washington\u2019s win also eliminated New York (6-8).\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re good enough,\u201d coach Chip Kelly said. \u201cWe just have to put them in better position to make plays. It\u2019s 100 percent on my shoulders. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\n\nWhile the Redskins head to the playoffs, the Eagles and Kelly face a challenging offseason. Kelly took control of personnel decisions last year and overhauled a team that went 10-6 in each of his first two seasons.\n\nIt clearly didn\u2019t work out.\n\nBut Kelly isn\u2019t concerned about losing his job. Owner Jeffrey Lurie made a big commitment to Kelly, who has two years remaining on his contract.\n\n\u201cAnybody in my situation, if they are worried about being fired, they probably already should\u2019ve been fired,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nKelly got rid of several star players, including DeSean Jackson, LeSean McCoy and Jeremy Maclin. His biggest additions were Sam Bradford, DeMarco Murray and Kiko Alonso. Murray and Alonso have been busts.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not good enough, it\u2019d not good enough,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to continue to work as hard as I can, show up early in the morning, stay late at night.\u201d\n\nMurray went from leading the NFL in rushing and setting records in Dallas to third-string running back in Philadelphia after getting a $40 million contract.\n\nDeAngelo Hall returned Murray\u2019s fumble 17 yards for a momentum-changing TD in the third quarter. Cousins then threw TD passes to Chris Thompson and Pierre Garcon after a pair to Jordan Reed in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s been a tough season \u2014 individually and collectively \u2014 but these are the things that make you want to work harder and make you more hungry,\u201d Murray said.\n\nTwo teams have clinched division crowns in Philadelphia in six days. Arizona won the NFC West with a 40-17 win over the Eagles last Sunday night.\n\nOnly 4-12 in 2014, the Redskins (8-7) began their turnaround when Cousins rallied them from a 24-0 first-half deficit to a 31-30 win over Tampa Bay on Oct. 25. After that game, he yelled at reporters: \u201cYou like that?\u201d It\u2019s become a rallying cry for the Redskins and their fans, who continued the chant for several minutes after the game.\n\nCousins was outstanding down the stretch with 16 TD passes and only two interceptions in the last seven games. He showed resolve after a mental blunder at the end of the first half cost the Redskins at least three points.\n\nCousins took a knee with no time-outs and 6 seconds left from the Eagles 6 with a 16-10 lead. He realized his mistake and tried to spike the ball, but the clock ran out. He made up for it in the second half.\n\nCousins tossed a 12-yard touchdown pass to Thompson to give Washington a 23-10 lead. He converted three third-down passes on the series after Jaylen Watkins dropped an interception.\n\nThe Eagles missed a chance to take the lead early in the second quarter when Bradford overthrew a wide-open Zach Ertz on third-and-9. It would\u2019ve been a 60-yard TD.\n\nThey missed another opportunity on the following series when Nelson Agholor dropped a 28-yard TD pass and settled for Caleb Sturgis\u2019 34-yard field goal that cut it to 13-10.\n\nAfter going three-and-out on their first possession, the Redskins scored touchdowns on the next two. Cousins connected with Reed over the middle on a 22-yard scoring pass to cut it to 7-6. Dustin Hopkins missed the extra point wide left.\n\nCousins then hit Reed over the middle again for a 12-yard TD pass and a 13-7 lead.\n\nNotes: Bradford had 380 yards passing. \u2026 Reed had nine catches for 129 yards. \u2026 Jackson had four catches for 40 yards. \u2026 The Redskins are 2-5 on the road, 3-12 in Gruden\u2019s two seasons.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kirk Cousins throws 4 TD passes, Washington beats Eagles, 38-24", "title": "Kirk Cousins throws 4 TD passes, Washington beats Eagles, 38-24", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/26/kirk-cousins-throws-4-td-passes-washington-beats-eagles-38-24/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151226_113403_kirk-cousins.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151226_113403_kirk-cousins.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T23:24:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:58:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24c2\"", "article_summary": "Cousins was outstanding down the stretch with 16 TD passes and only two interceptions in the last seven games.\nCousins then threw TD passes to Chris Thompson and Pierre Garcon after a pair to Jordan Reed in the first quarter.\nCousins then hit Reed over the middle again for a 12-yard TD pass and a 13-7 lead.\nIt\u2019s been the same story for the Philadelphia Eagles all season.\nKirk Cousins threw four touchdown passes and had a season-high 365 yards and the Washington Redskins beat the Eagles 38-24 on Saturday night to clinch the NFC East title."}
