David Vitter (R-LA). Vitter goes against everything the Left holds to be true, like the idea that Obamacare works and federally-funded universal pre-school is essential to education.\n\nFor as long as the Left has hated Vitter, they have also managed to use the same failed tactics to rail against him.\n\nTake for instance, the Gumbo PAC, which is designed to pick Vitter apart on a number of issues from the past that voters have already disproved and disregarded. A new ad by the Gumbo PAC paints Vitter to be almost like a mob-boss, hanging out with the wealthiest and biggest corrupt-o-crats in Washington.\n\nWatch the ad to see what we\u2019re talking about:\n\n\u201cJust imagine the things you haven\u2019t heard about \u2026 yet,\u201d the ad says at the end, attempting to deceive the viewer into believing that there are a ton of skeletons in Vitter\u2019s closet that the public is not aware of. Yet, there is no evidence of those skeletons, just speculation at the end of the ad.\n\nNot surprising at all, is that Trey Ourso is the chairman of the Gumbo PAC, the same man who managed Charlie Melancon\u2019s 2010 Senate campaign against Vitter. And the attacks Ourso is using on Vitter now, are exactly the same attacks Melancon used on Vitter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a childish and pathetic attempt to besmirch Senator Vitter,\u201d said political consultant James Hartman, who worked on Vitter\u2019s 2010 Senate campaign.\n\nAside from the attacks being petty and washed up, they are not in-line with a larger national narrative that the Left is trying to push about Vitter.\n\nIn Salon.com\u2019s article today, \u201cEverybody hates David Vitter: How the wingnut managed to tee off everyone in Washington,\u201d the conservative Senator is portrayed as being hated by the inside-beltway of Washington DC and all the staffers on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cSen. David Vitter is running for governor of Louisiana this year, and just about everyone on Capitol Hill hopes that he wins because they hate him, because he is useless and awful,\u201d the Salon.com article states.\n\nHowever, the Gumbo PAC\u2019s narrative of Vitter is that he is a man of Washington, a politician who has many friends and political allies in DC, almost the exact opposite narrative than that is used in the Salon.com piece.\n\nSo which Vitter is it? The one with all the corrupt connections in Washington? Or the one who is hated by Washington-insiders?\n\nThe Left\u2019s phony and problematic portrayals of Vitter, though, speak to the larger picture of Democrats and Republicans in Louisiana.\n\nMost recently, political dynasties have proven to be a burden for politicians in the state, rather than an asset, as we saw with Mary Landrieu\u2019s failed re-election bid last November. And now, we\u2019ve seen it with Landrieu\u2019s brother, Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, who is not even attempting to run in the gubernatorial race.\n\nEven with the changing views of Louisianians on politicians, their connections and political views, the Louisiana Democratic Party\u2019s attack on Vitter has remained the same. Not to mention, the content of the attacks are old issues that the Left tried to hit Vitter on years and years ago.\n\nWhich calls the question: Do political action committees like Gumbo PAC even care about successfully defeating conservatives, or are these PAC\u2019s merely a form of income for the well-connected consultant class?\n\nFor now, there is nothing new to see. Just another day of ineffective attacks from the past.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Hayride", "description": "The Left has long not been able to stand Sen. David Vitter (R-LA).
