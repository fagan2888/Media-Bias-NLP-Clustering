Foiled by slippery slopes on the way there, the team rerouted the vehicle and chose a westward path.\n\nThe mission\u2019s strategic planning keeps multiple route options open to deal with such situations.\n\n\u201cMars can be very deceptive,\u201d said Chris Roumeliotis, Curiosity\u2019s lead rover driver at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. \u201cWe knew that polygonal sand ripples have caused Curiosity a lot of drive slip in the past, but there appeared to be terrain with rockier, more consolidated characteristics directly adjacent to these ripples. So we drove around the sand ripples onto what we expected to be firmer terrain that would give Curiosity better traction.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, this terrain turned out to be unconsolidated material too, which definitely surprised us and Curiosity.\u201d\n\nIn three out of four drives between May 7 and May 13, Curiosity experienced wheel slippage in excess of the limit set for the drive, and it stopped mid-drive for safety.\n\nThe rover\u2019s onboard software determines the amount of slippage occurring by comparing the wheel-rotation tally to actual drive distance calculated from analysis of images taken during the drive.\n\nThe rover was heading generally southward from near the base of a feature called \u201cJocko Butte\u201d toward a geological contact in the eastern part of the \u201cLogan Pass\u201d area.\n\nRoutes to this contact site would have required driving across steeper slopes than Curiosity has yet experienced on Mars, and the rover had already experienced some sideways slipping on one slope in this area.\n\n\u201cWe decided to go back to Jocko Butte, and, in parallel, work with the scientists to identify alternate routes,\u201d Roumeliotis said.\n\nThe team spent a few days analyzing images from the rover and from NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to choose the best route for short-term and long-term objectives.\n\n\u201cOne factor the science team considers is how much time to spend reaching a particular target, when there are many others ahead,\u201d said Curiosity Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of JPL. \u201cWe used observations from NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to identify an alternative site for investigating the geological contact in the Logan Pass area.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a little mind-blowing to drive up a hill to a site we saw only in satellite images and then find it in front of us,\u201d said Vasavada.\n\nCuriosity has been exploring on Mars since 2012.\n\nIt reached the base of Mount Sharp last year after fruitfully investigating outcrops closer to its landing site and then trekking to the mountain.\n\nThe main mission objective now is to examine successively higher layers of Mount Sharp.\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ashwin vasavada,chris roumeliotis,homepage,mars,nasa,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/NASA-Rover-Martian-Mountain-580-3.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "NASA's Curiosity Mars rover climbed a hill Thursday to approach an alternative site for investigating a geological boundary, after a comparable site proved hard", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "NASA: Curiosity Mars Rover Fixes Route Up Martian MountainBy NASA.gov // May 24, 2015NASA \u2013 NASA\u2019s Curiosity Mars rover climbed a hill Thursday to approach an alternative site for investigating a geological boundary, after a comparable site proved hard to reach.\nTwo weeks ago, Curiosity was headed for a comparable geological contact farther south.\nThe team spent a few days analyzing images from the rover and from NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to choose the best route for short-term and long-term objectives.\n\u201cMars can be very deceptive,\u201d said Chris Roumeliotis, Curiosity\u2019s lead rover driver at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.\nThe rover was heading generally southward from near the base of a feature called \u201cJocko Butte\u201d toward a geological contact in the eastern part of the \u201cLogan Pass\u201d area."}
