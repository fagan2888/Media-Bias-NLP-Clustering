They have said these plans do not meet the minimum value standards as set by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe rule states that these employer plans must include inpatient coverage and physician coverage. This ruling is important for employees who might rely on these skinny plans, thinking they have comprehensive coverage. No one wants to find out that the parachute isn\u2019t all there, particularly after they have jumped from the airplane.\n\nThe other side of the coin is that healthy low-income workers were able to have a relatively inexpensive plan and not have to pay for benefits that they might not use.\n\nSome employers were relying on these plans in hopes that they would avoid fines by providing these skinny benefits to their employees.\n\nTransitional relief will be available to these plans. If a qualifying employer has already enrolled or began enrollment as of Nov. 4, 2014, the employer mandate tax penalty is to be forgiven through the plan year that begins on or before March 1, 2015. This is a relatively short time frame, but will give some relief to the \u201cskinny plans.\u201d\n\nThese plans were often found in the food service industry or retail firms. The argument was that these plans met the 60 percent minimum value test. It has been my opinion that these plans simply did not meet the intention of the ACA. How can you provide benefits that do not include hospitalization when the risks are so high? We have all heard stories of hospital bills that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Isn\u2019t that why we have insurance? We want to protect against catastrophic risk.\n\nI have a client who had no insurance and incurred a $200,000 hospital bill after having been in a coma for about a month. After much negotiating with the hospital, it was reduced to about $75,000. They were forced to sell the two rental properties that they had been hoping to use as their retirement income.\n\nThey are now in their early 60s and have dramatically reduced their retirement plans. Fortunately for them, the ACA will allow them to have some peace of mind as they can afford the subsidized premiums. This will hopefully take them through to age 65 and Medicare.\n\nAs of my press deadline, the Supreme Court will be hearing arguments that could undermine this new financial security for them and others who have relied on subsidies to cover a portion of their premium.\n\nThe latest challenge is over four words \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d Essentially if the plaintiffs win the argument, subsidies for those who bought coverage on the federal exchange, rather than an exchange established by the state, would not be allowed their subsidy. Initially this would not effect a state-based exchange like Covered California\n\nHowever, it\u2019s likely that the state-based exchanges would feel the aftermath of the total disruption of the market. The insurance companies are like a huge ocean liner that has been tossed around in a storm as it tries to navigate and comply with the myriad of changes that continues to hit from all sides.\n\nOne cornerstone to the market stabilization is the mandate. Another factor stabilizing the participation is the subsidy that helps people to afford to participate the plan. Should those subsidies be withdrawn and if there is a mass exodus from the market, actuaries will have to reset rates.\n\nThe insurers maintain that there is a possibility of what we call a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d in the market. Simply this means only the sick people stay in the plan and the healthy ones leave. Rates increase exponentially until the pool simply implodes because there are not enough healthy people paying premiums to support the sick.\n\nI find it interesting that the \u201cbig business\u201d community is not backing this challenge. While I can see sound business reasons for them to want the subsidies to continue, I can\u2019t help but wonder how much of this is simply fatigue. The next few weeks will be very interesting.\n\nNote: All information in this column is provided \u201cto the best of my knowledge\u201d subject to final regulation by the respective agencies.
