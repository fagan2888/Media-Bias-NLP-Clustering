Distracted driving led to a semi collision Sunday morning on a stretch of highway in north-central Kansas.

It happened around 6:45 a.m. about 20 miles west of Salina on Interstate 70 in Lincoln County.

Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper J.L. Riedel tells KAKE News the driver of a semi was distracted when coming up on a slower-moving log truck and rear-ended it.

One person suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was taken to a Salina hospital for treatment.

The interstate has reopened.
