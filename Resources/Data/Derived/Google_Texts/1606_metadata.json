There are a couple of factors he fails to mention, although they reinforce his central point.\n\nWheeler\u2019s unhappy thesis, and the facts backing him up:\n\nSilicon Valley is tossing millennials aside like yesterday\u2019s laptop. The commonly held belief is that with hard work and a good education, a young person in America can get a good job. But despite falling unemployment, college grads age 22 to 27 are stuck in low-paying jobs that don\u2019t even require a college degree. The percentage of young people languishing in low-skill, low-paying jobs is 44%, a 20-year high. Only 36% of college grads have jobs that pay at least $45,000, a sharp decline from the 1990s, after adjusting for inflation. Perhaps most depressingly, the percentage of young people making below $25,000 has topped 20%, worse than in 1990. In other words, those with a bachelor\u2019s diploma were better off before the digital revolution.\n\nWheeler could have thrown in some numbers about the gigantic, ObamaCare-inflated student loan debt these young people are carrying (it was the Affordable Care Act\u2019s nationalization of student loans that opened the floodgates of easy money and caused those university cash sponges to swell like never before.) Maybe he thought the picture he painted was depressing enough already without mentioning how much debt millennials are incurring to qualify for jobs that aren\u2019t there.\n\nMuch of the remaining concerns the unreal expectations young people have developed about the tech sector, based on both real-life rags-to-digital-riches stories such as Mark Zuckerberg, and fictional Internet moguls. In reality, the percentage of young people who start up their own business ventures has dropped to a 24-year-low, while Wheeler argues that automation and online efficiency are wiping out more jobs than they create. He\u2019s also strongly critical of the \u201csharing economy\u201d and its informal employment relationships:\n\nBut wait \u2013 won\u2019t the digital economy eventually lead to better jobs? After a period of adjustment, won\u2019t things get better? Unfortunately that\u2019s not the path we\u2019re on. One of the biggest misconceptions about the digital economy is that for every middle-class job rendered obsolete by technology, there\u2019s a new, equally good (or better) job created by Silicon Valley. But exactly the opposite is happening. The digital economy is vaporizing the good jobs and replacing them with two kinds of jobs: minimum wage jobs (think Amazon warehouse employees) and so-called \u201csharing-economy jobs\u201d (think Uber drivers). The sharing-economy jobs are even worse than minimum wage jobs because they offer no stability or protections for workers. Sharing economy jobs aren\u2019t really jobs at all; they\u2019re freelance gigs. Sure, Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t owe America jobs. But something is wrong with the picture of a handful of tech billionaires overseeing a kingdom of falling wages, decreased worker protection and zero job security.\n\nThe relationship between technology and job creation is complex; one must always take care to avoid the path of \u201cATMs kill jobs\u201d foolishness President Obama led us down, when he was fumbling for excuses to cover the failure of his \u201cjob creation\u201d policies. One of the reasons that was such a painfully silly discussion is that, as banks and ATM manufacturers surprised to find themselves on Obama\u2019s ever-expanding enemies list pointed out, automatic teller machines did not cause a net loss of jobs. The banks found other, better users for labor than manning a vast row of teller windows.\n\nIn order for a healthy destruction-and-creation life cycle to function properly, it must be relatively easy to launch or expand business enterprises, and affordable to hire new employees. When that\u2019s not true \u2013 and entrepreneurship never stops getting harder under Democrat economic policies, especially the current President\u2019s \u2013 the result is the kind of economic paralysis that leads to the automation and sharing-economy contract work Wheeler describes. Traditional employment has been burdened so heavily by regulations, mandates, and taxes that entrepreneurs are seeking alternative arrangements. Reducing the high cost of traditional labor, and evading anti-competitive regulations designed to protect established players in protected markets, help companies like Uber offer remarkably low prices to customers suffering from years of flat wage growth.\n\nTechnology always plays a role in labor disruption \u2013 that has been true since the cutting edge of technology involved tools beaten out of iron. Whether that disruption leads to growth or stagnation depends largely on how heavily capitalism has been shackled. Make it easy to launch a business and hire people to work there, and automation can lead to productive opportunities and new services. Put capitalism under the boot of activist government and its rapacious masters, and you get big restaurants looking at ways to operate without human wait staff, while small restaurants go out of business.\n\nOne other major factor in Silicon Valley Wheeler doesn\u2019t mention is the H-1B visa program. Those high-tech jobs are being outsourced, kids, and people like Mark Zuckerburg and Bill Gates are 100 percent behind it. There\u2019s no way that process could go forward without a great deal of cooperation between Big Business and Big Government. It\u2019s no accident that the nominal requirements for companies to \u201cprove\u201d they tried to \u201chire Americans first\u201d were hollowed out into an easily-avoided joke.\n\nGood luck complaining about that situation, millennials, because our entire immigration system is a sham, but anyone who complains about any segment of it will be denounced as a bigot. That\u2019s especially true of the high-tech job sector, where it\u2019s conventional wisdom that we need as many skilled immigrants as we can get, no matter how many displaced or never-employed American workers there might be. In truth, this is one of the few areas in which a serious call for reduced legal immigration has been made, but that call is resolutely ignored, because it comes from a relatively small number of people who are blithely assumed to have good prospects after they finished training their replacements and pick up their final paychecks.\n\nWheeler\u2019s concluding suggestions for immediate action are: \u201cFirst, we can stop glorifying tech titans and start talking openly about Silicon Valley\u2019s questionable tactics and its real job creation record (i.e., just follow the numbers). Second, we can encourage more lawsuits against the abusive practices of \u2018sharing-economy\u2019 powerhouses. Third, we can elect leaders who are vocal about holding Silicon Valley accountable for their power over the entire American workforce, including white-collar employees.\u201d\n\nTwo of those suggestions amount to talking tough about Silicon Valley CEOs, and encouraging more legal entanglements is not a formula for robust economic growth. We\u2019ve got more than enough rich lawyers in America, thanks. I\u2019m all in favor of calling out anyone for bad practices and deception, but I don\u2019t need more \u201celected leaders\u201d to do it for me; on the contrary, they\u2019re the group most in need of a good calling-out. And if we\u2019re going to fix a big problem that stands to ruin the hopes of an entire generation, we need to think about big solutions, not just finger-pointing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Warning To Millennials: Silicon Valley and Washington Are Deleting Your Prospects", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Warning To Millennials: Silicon Valley and Washington Are Deleting Your Prospects", "title": "Warning To Millennials: Silicon Valley and Washington Are Deleting Your Prospects - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/ATM.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/19/warning-to-millennials-silicon-valley-and-washington-are-deleting-your-prospects/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Warning To Millennials: Silicon Valley and Washington Are Deleting Your Prospects", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/ATM.jpg", "title": "Warning To Millennials: Silicon Valley and Washington Are Deleting Your Prospects - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bill Gates, H-1b visas, Mark Zuckerberg, silicon valley, student loans,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "student loans", "published_time": "2015-03-19T09:01:23-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc55f\"", "article_summary": "Third, we can elect leaders who are vocal about holding Silicon Valley accountable for their power over the entire American workforce, including white-collar employees.\u201dTwo of those suggestions amount to talking tough about Silicon Valley CEOs, and encouraging more legal entanglements is not a formula for robust economic growth.\nThere\u2019s no way that process could go forward without a great deal of cooperation between Big Business and Big Government.\nOne other major factor in Silicon Valley Wheeler doesn\u2019t mention is the H-1B visa program.\nSharing economy jobs aren\u2019t really jobs at all; they\u2019re freelance gigs.\nSure, Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t owe America jobs."}
