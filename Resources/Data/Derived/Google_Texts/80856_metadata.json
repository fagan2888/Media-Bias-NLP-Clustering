In fact, we\u2019re adding features.\n\nIn addition to the new front-page design, we\u2019re increasing the size of the Metro section each day to provide more space for local and state news. During annual legislative sessions, we will set aside space for coverage of our Florida lawmakers.\n\nThe Metro expansion gives us more room to cover everything from the inner workings of city hall to news about the hometown heroes who make our community better.\n\nWe will also use the expanded space to highlight the goings on across the bay from where you live.\n\nFor reader convenience, we are providing a quick scan of the day\u2019s headlines in a small box, outlined in red on the front page, called \u201cBelow the Fold.\u2019\u2019 This gives readers who purchase the Tribune in shops and from newspaper racks an easy way to scan what the paper is offering beneath the fold in the middle of the page.\n\nWe hope you enjoy our bold new look.\n\nEmail news@tampatrib.com to let us know what you think.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 05 Jan 2014 09:56:56 -0400", "Description": "By now you\u2019ve noticed that your morning Tampa Tribune looks bolder and more colorful.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "By now you\u2019ve noticed that your morning Tampa Tribune looks bolder and more colorful.", "title": "Koehn: What do you think about the revised Tampa Tribune?", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/koehn-what-do-you-think-about-the-revised-tampa-tribune-20140105/", "image": {"width": 2243, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140105/ARTICLE/140109658/EP/1/1/EP-140109658.jpg", "height": 2728}, "updated_time": "2014-01-05T10:09:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "By now you\u2019ve noticed that your morning Tampa Tribune looks bolder and more colorful.", "title": "Koehn: What do you think about the revised Tampa Tribune?", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140105/ARTICLE/140109658/AR/0/AR-140109658.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-01-05T09:56:56Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-01-05T10:09:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ken koehn,newspapers,tampa tribune"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd2e\"", "article_summary": "By now you\u2019ve noticed that your morning Tampa Tribune looks bolder and more colorful.\nWe hope you find it visually engaging, easy to read and enjoyable.\nThe main difference you will notice each day is bolder type and a more visually striking front page with larger color photographs.\nWe will also use the expanded space to highlight the goings on across the bay from where you live.\nThe Metro expansion gives us more room to cover everything from the inner workings of city hall to news about the hometown heroes who make our community better."}
