But economists, analysts and officials agree that the economic challenge has been compounded by the Western handover of security to Afghan forces, completed at the end of last month, whose knock-on effect has left key sectors lacking investment and struggling for funds.\n\nEconomic growth that was above 14 percent in 2012 will fall to just 1.4 percent this year, the World Bank predicts. In recent months, fears about the state of the economy have outstripped security concerns in opinion polls taken across the country.\n\nThe Central Bank spends tens of millions of dollars weekly to stem the fall of the afghani as money continues to leave the country, traders said, reflecting a general lack of confidence in the government\u2019s ability to introduce reforms, stimulate growth, guarantee security and cut corruption.\n\nAt Kabul\u2019s Saraye Shahzada money market, traders dealing in dollars, rubles, euros, rials, rupees and dirhams, are concerned about capital flight.\n\n\u201cAt least twice a week, the Central Bank sells $40 million to $50 million to support the afghani,\u201d said Mohammad Khan Baz, the market\u2019s manager. \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t pay attention to security and provide opportunities for investors, I am afraid that the economic situation for ordinary people will go from bad to worse.\u201d\n\nImports vastly outstrip exports, Ghani recently told parliament, exacerbating the country\u2019s dependence on financial support from international partners \u2014 who are already spending billions annually on the military and police.\n\nAfghan authorities had four years\u2019 notice that the U.S. military, which spent more than $1 trillion between 2001 and 2014, would close most bases and withdraw combat troops at the end of last year. About a third of Afghanistan\u2019s population lived close enough to a military base to benefit from its presence. On top of war costs, the U.S. spent more than $100 billion on development.\n\nConstruction, one of the few industries that offered employment outside of aid projects, has stalled with half-finished buildings dotting the capital and other cities. Kabul rents, once among the world\u2019s highest, have plummeted.\n\nFormer construction engineer Hamid Sahak, 38, said he noticed the downturn creeping up more than a year ago.\n\n\u201cEven though a lot of projects are half-completed \u2014 not only office blocks but hospitals, clinics, schools and roads all over the country \u2014 the money has simply run out and everything has closed down,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Afghan economic crisis looms as foreign aid dollars depart", "author": "Rahim Faiez and Lynne O'donnell", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Afghan economic crisis looms as foreign aid dollars depart", "title": "Afghan economic crisis looms as foreign aid dollars depart", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/26/afghan_economic_crisis_looms_as_foreign_aid_dollars_depart/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/afghanistan-economy-in-trouble.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Afghan economic crisis looms as foreign aid dollars depart", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/afghanistan-economy-in-trouble.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Afghan economic crisis looms as foreign aid dollars depart", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Afghan economic crisis looms as foreign aid dollars depart", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f22\"", "article_summary": "At Kabul\u2019s Saraye Shahzada money market, traders dealing in dollars, rubles, euros, rials, rupees and dirhams, are concerned about capital flight.\nEconomic growth that was above 14 percent in 2012 will fall to just 1.4 percent this year, the World Bank predicts.\nIn recent months, fears about the state of the economy have outstripped security concerns in opinion polls taken across the country.\nFormer construction engineer Hamid Sahak, 38, said he noticed the downturn creeping up more than a year ago.\nConstruction, one of the few industries that offered employment outside of aid projects, has stalled with half-finished buildings dotting the capital and other cities."}
