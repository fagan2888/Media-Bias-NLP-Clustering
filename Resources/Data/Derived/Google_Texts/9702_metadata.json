Authored by Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, the measure would open Medi-Cal to undocumented immigrants as well as create a marketplace for new plans.\n\nCalifornia counties currently provide health care to undocumented immigrants, but the coverage varies greatly among counties.\n\nHealth advocates contend the legislation is needed to fully achieve the promises of the federal Affordable Care Act in California. Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n, D-Los Angeles, and chairman of the upper house's fiscal committee, described a \"two-tiered\" system that discriminates against millions of people that but \"for lack of paperwork are Americans.\"\n\n\"SB 1005 is a necessary measure, but we need to continue to find responsible funding sources so that we don't already over-strain our safety net, and make sure it doesn't come apart,\" de Le\u00f3n said.\n\nLara and advocates were given the summer to develop a funding mechanism for the expansion. At the hearing, Lara said he respected the decision.\n\n\"Expanding healthcare for all Californians is not a question of if but ... a matter of when,\" he said.\n\nPHOTO: Sen.
