The film, among the most eagerly awaited at Cannes, is a grimly visceral adaptation of \u201cMacbeth,\u201d shot partly in Scotland, striking in the bleak beauty of its earthy violence.\n\nTo play the Scottish warrior, Fassbender gravitated to the idea that Macbeth suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. He credited Kurzel for making the connection to contemporary warfare.\n\n\u201cThat changed everything for me,\u201d Fassbender told reporters Saturday. \u201cWe know from soldiers today coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan that describe post-traumatic stress disorder and the fact that they have these hallucinations. They can be walking down the street here, the Croisette, and the next thing, it\u2019s Basra.\u201d\n\nCotillard drew the loudest raves for her Lady Macbeth. Hers is a tender version of the character, not the manipulative monster often depicted.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of love between these two characters,\u201d said Cotillard. \u201cThey\u2019re just too damaged to be able to turn toward something more luminous.\u201d\n\nThe challenge of tackling Shakespeare was especially steep for the French actress. Fassbender praised her as \u201cthe best in the business\u201d and an actress \u201cwho brings a grace to everything she does.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cannes hails premiere of a bloody, stylish \u2018Macbeth\u2019", "title": "Cannes hails premiere of a bloody, stylish \u2018Macbeth\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Cannes hails premiere of a bloody, stylish \u2018Macbeth\u2019", "title": "Cannes hails premiere of a bloody, stylish \u2018Macbeth\u2019", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/cannes_hails_premiere_of_a_bloody_stylish_macbeth/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-cannes-macbeth-photo-call.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cannes hails premiere of a bloody, stylish \u2018Macbeth\u2019", "title": "Cannes hails premiere of a bloody, stylish \u2018Macbeth\u2019", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-cannes-macbeth-photo-call.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jake Coyle", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "To play the Scottish warrior, Fassbender gravitated to the idea that Macbeth suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\u201cWe know from soldiers today coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan that describe post-traumatic stress disorder and the fact that they have these hallucinations.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsCANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Something wicked came the way of the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday when Justin Kurzel premiered his bloody, stylish adaptation of \u201cMacbeth\u201d with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard.\nCannes hailed the premiere of the Australian director\u2019s interpretation of the Shakespeare tragedy, the final film to screen in competition at the festival, which concludes Sunday.\nThe film, among the most eagerly awaited at Cannes, is a grimly visceral adaptation of \u201cMacbeth,\u201d shot partly in Scotland, striking in the bleak beauty of its earthy violence."}
