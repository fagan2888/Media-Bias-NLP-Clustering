Vance McAllister at tonight\u2019s State of the Union Address. Robertson is CEO of the Robertson family\u2019s Duck Commander company \u2014 and the State of the Union Address has become one of a handful of Washington\u2019s Celebrity Petting Zoos, though it trails the White House Correspondents Dinner by many, many laps. Willie also is the son of family patriarch Phil Robertson, who landed in hot water after giving an interview to GQ in which he waxed headline-hoggingly about gays and blacks. A&E, you\u2019ll recall, suspended him from the show for an indefinite period but unsuspended him pretty quickly in the wake of wrist-slap blow-back.\n\nMcAllister\u2019s returning a favor the Robertson family did for him last November, when Republicans credited Duck Dynasty with a political upset in Louisiana that wound the political newbie in office, thumping both the Tea Party and the GOP establishment. Now it\u2019s the Robertson family that needs help. Returning to A&E\u2019s lineup after Phil\u2019s fiery GQ interview, Duck Dynasty posted its first year-to-year declines, and, last week, Episode 2 of Season 5 continued the downward trend: The adventures of the Robertson clan drew 6.7 million total viewers, down an eye-opening 21% from the season opener. The 3.6 rating in the adults 25-54 demo was down a less-rough 14% from last week.\n\nRelated: Did Louisiana Pol Ride \u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 Vote To Victory?\n\n\n\nLast November, when the Robertsons were riding high, Lousiana state Sen. Neil Riser was considered something of a certainty in the election to determine who would replace former Rep. Rodney Alexander; Alexander resigned from Congress in September to join the administration of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Riser was backed by the Tea Party, the GOP establishment, and the outgoing Alexander. In the other corner: GOP businessman McAllister, who was quoted saying the state should expand Medicaid under Obamacare because the rural district he\u2019d represent is one of the nation\u2019s poorest. Riser responded with ads declaring a vote for McAllister to be \u201ca vote for Obamacare,\u201d which, in theory, should have polished McAllister off in the state described by the Wall Street Journal as \u201cdeep red.\u201d Instead, McAllister won with 60% of the vote. Caddo Parish GOP chair Harold Coates sniffed that McAllister was pals with the Duck Dynasty guys, who live in McAllister\u2019s 5th District and endorsed him in ads and in personal appearances. This plays into the whole It\u2019s Hollywood\u2019s Fault storyline, or, as Coates put it: \u201cEntertainers should stay out of elections.
