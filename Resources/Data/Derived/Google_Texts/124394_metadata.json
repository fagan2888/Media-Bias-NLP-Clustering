But two years later \u2014 after heavy lobbying by oil and gas industries \u2014 the agency reversed itself and denied protection for the lizard. When Fish and Wildlife\u2019s highest-ranking official in Texas alleged the reversal was the result of political influence and scientific misconduct, he was suddenly transferred to Albuquerque and subsequently retired after filing a whistleblower complaint against the agency. It was eventually settled.\n\nMore recently, in 2013, the service proposed protecting the northern long-eared bat as endangered after populations of the bat plummeted by more than 90 percent.\n\nBut two years later \u2014 after powerful special interests lobbied against that recommendation \u2014 the bat was listed under the less-protective \u201cthreatened\u201d status, opening the door to the service approving exemptions that allow ongoing logging, ranching and energy development in the core of the bat\u2019s habitat.\n\nCreating sweeping industry-friendly exemptions in the habitat of protected species has become commonplace at the service. The northern long-eared bat rule, called a 4(d) rule, is the eighth such rule adopted by the Obama administration that authorizes ongoing destruction by industries of a threatened species\u2019 habitat.\n\nA report released late last year by the Center for Biological Diversity documents that no single presidential administration has approved more of these damaging industry loopholes than the Obama administration.\n\nIn addition, a 2015 survey by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that three out of every four Fish and Wildlife Service scientists reported that consideration of political interests was too high at the agency. And two-thirds of Fish and Wildlife scientists reported that they had witnessed congressional interference that led to the withdrawal or modification of policies or decisions.\n\nA quote included in the report of one agency scientist proved particularly prescient: \u201cOutside interest groups (especially the States, BLM, and energy companies) have too much influence on FWS decisions. We need more backbone to make the right decisions regardless of political posturing, especially in Region 6.\n\n\u201cLook at the wolverine decision, for example.\u201d\n\nAndrea Santarsiere is a staff attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s office in Victor, Idaho.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Protecting wolverines from Fish and Wildlife", "title": "Protecting wolverines from Fish and Wildlife", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/15/protecting-wolverines-from-fish-and-wildlife/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160415__DP_NGPS_Export20160417_Z00_OP17G_SANTARSIEREp1.jpg", "height": 449}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160415__DP_NGPS_Export20160417_Z00_OP17G_SANTARSIEREp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-15T12:52:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T01:46:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And two-thirds of Fish and Wildlife scientists reported that they had witnessed congressional interference that led to the withdrawal or modification of policies or decisions.\n\u201cLook at the wolverine decision, for example.\u201dAndrea Santarsiere is a staff attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s office in Victor, Idaho.\nThe northern long-eared bat rule, called a 4(d) rule, is the eighth such rule adopted by the Obama administration that authorizes ongoing destruction by industries of a threatened species\u2019 habitat.\nIn addition, a 2015 survey by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that three out of every four Fish and Wildlife Service scientists reported that consideration of political interests was too high at the agency.\nFish and Wildlife Service\u2019s \u201celeventh-hour\u201d decision to suddenly reverse itself and deny protections for the estimated 300 wolverines remaining in the lower 48 states, Judge Dana Christensen revealed an agency grasping for research to support its predetermined conclusion."}
