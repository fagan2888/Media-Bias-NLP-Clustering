The state would put together workshops on 12 different subjects with parents required to attend four, one of which must be a workshop on sexual abuse. That\u2019s the bill\u2019s saving grace potentially; even Democrats who might otherwise balk at forcing parents to take state instruction on caring for their kids (are there any Democrats like that left?) will think twice before opposing a law that seeks to prevent child abuse. And for the ones who won\u2019t balk, this makes for a nice foothold for future expansions of state oversight into largely private matters. Bloomberg\u2019s much-mocked Big Gulp ban operated the same way. It was a small inconvenience in practice, but the principle is significant. That\u2019s why it was worth his time.\n\nInteresting tidbit about the chief sponsor, Ruben Diaz Sr.: He is indeed a Democrat but he\u2019s also (somewhat notoriously in a very blue city) a Pentecostal minister and social conservative. He\u2019s pro-life and voted against legalizing gay marriage more than once as a state senator. If anyone can build some bipartisan support for this in the legislature, he might be the guy.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cPeople who are truly offended by it are probably the ones that need it the most.\u201d", "title": "Coming soon to New York: Mandatory state-run parenting classes?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/02/21/coming-soon-to-new-york-mandatory-state-run-parenting-classes/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-21T21:01:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-22T13:04:31+00:00"}, "keywords": "class, grade, New York, parenting, ruben diaz, seventh, sixth,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Coming soon to New York: Mandatory state-run parenting classes?\nIf anyone can build some bipartisan support for this in the legislature, he might be the guy.\nAnd for the ones who won\u2019t balk, this makes for a nice foothold for future expansions of state oversight into largely private matters.\nThe state would put together workshops on 12 different subjects with parents required to attend four, one of which must be a workshop on sexual abuse.\nHe\u2019s pro-life and voted against legalizing gay marriage more than once as a state senator."}
