Kensington is infamous for being an open-air drug market in the city.\n\nMore than $2.7 million in federal funding to fight opioid and heroin addiction will go to health centers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- including one in Philadelphia and another in Camden -- as part of $94 million recently awarded by the federal government to combat the heroin epidemic across the nation.\n\nThe funding, provided by the Affordable Care Act, is administered through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and will be spread among 271 health centers in 45 states, according to the department. The funding is aimed at supporting substance-abuse treatment among under-served populations.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Public Health Management Corporation, a nonprofit public-health institute that runs intensive outpatient programs and a recovery residence in West Philadelphia, will be awarded $325,000 in funding. Another $379,000 each will go to Berks Community Health Center in Reading and Community Health and Dental Care Inc. in Pottstown, while centers in York and Chambersburg will receive the other roughly $650,000 in funding given to Pennsylvania. Project Hope in Camden will also receive about $324,000, while AtlantiCare Health Services in Egg Harbor Township will receive $325,000. Henry J. Austin Health Center in Trenton will be awarded about $352,000.\n\nThe funding is among a number of recent pushes by the federal government in the fight against the heroin and opioid addiction epidemic.\n\nNBC10 recently took an in-depth look at heroin and opioid addiction in the Delaware Valley and beyond in Generation Addicted, an exclusive special report.
