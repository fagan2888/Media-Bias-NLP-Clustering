Or so he said.\n\nSubbing for Bill O\u2019Reilly last night, Watters hosted a debate about the term \u201canchor baby,\u201d asking, \u201cSo, Republicans making a mistake by using the term \u2018anchor baby\u2019 or is it just the latest example of political correctness run amok?\u201d\n\nWatters gave away what he thought the answer should be before either of his two guests had a chance to speak, when he \u201cjoked\u201d up front that he\u2019s an anchor baby because he was substituting for anchor O\u2019Reilly. \u201cI don\u2019t find it offensive at all,\u201d Watters said.\n\nWhich is no surprise given Watters\u2019 own race-baiting record and the cesspool of racism he presides over at Fox Nation.\n\nWatters put another thumb on the scale of \u201cfair and balanced\u201d when he said to liberal guest Cathy Areu, \u201cYou have to admit, Cathy, that people do break into this country and have babies \u2026in order to gain citizenship. That\u2019s a fact. So what do you find offensive? Is it \u2018anchor\u2019 or \u2018baby?\u2019 What\u2019s the offensive part?\u201d\n\nAfter Areu explained why she finds the term offensive, Watters took a gratuitous swipe at Planned Parenthood. \u201cYou think anchor baby is offensive. You know what I think is more offensive is Planned Parenthood harvesting the body parts of babies and then selling them for a profit on the tax payer dime. Isn\u2019t that more offensive?\u201d\n\nIn the first place, that\u2019s a lie about Planned Parenthood. And secondly, if Watters is so pro life, then why does he keep allowing readers to talk murder on his Fox Nation site?\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough smarminess from Watters. He said he was watching CNN in an airport the day before \u201cbecause anytime anybody watches CNN, it\u2019s in an airport.\u201d According to Watters, all CNN was talking about was anchor babies.\n\nWATTERS: Anchor baby, anchor baby, anchor baby. You know why? I think it\u2019s a diversion. They don\u2019t want to talk about Hillary being investigated by the FBI. They don\u2019t want to talk about criminal illegal aliens. They don\u2019t want to talk about the president letting the Iranians nuclear inspect theirselves (that\u2019s a falsehood). So they want to talk about this \u2018cause they think this makes Republicans look insensitive.\n\nLater, as Areu continued to argue that the term is insensitive, Watters sneered, \u201cYou\u2019re OK with aborting the baby, you just don\u2019t want to deport the baby, is that what it is?\u201d\n\nToo bad Watters doesn\u2019t have the same \u201cpro life\u201d attitude toward the born fetuses that his readers openly wish get murdered.\n\nWatch Watters\u2019 phony-baloney sanctimony below, from the August 21 The O\u2019Reilly Factor.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "5bJyCs48nPXrFtBONdGtnjPqVL3XXMVcwh6k+xq9e1o=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_s_jesse_watters_argues_anchor_baby_controversy_is_a_liberal_media_conspiracy_082215", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Fox\u2019s Jesse Watters Argues \u2018Anchor Baby\u2019 Controversy Is A Liberal Media Conspiracy"}, "Title": "Fox\u2019s Jesse Watters Argues \u2018Anchor Baby\u2019 Controversy Is A Liberal Media Conspiracy"}, "article_summary": "WATTERS: Anchor baby, anchor baby, anchor baby.\n\u201cYou think anchor baby is offensive.\nIs it \u2018anchor\u2019 or \u2018baby?\u2019 What\u2019s the offensive part?\u201dAfter Areu explained why she finds the term offensive, Watters took a gratuitous swipe at Planned Parenthood.\nWhich is no surprise given Watters\u2019 own race-baiting record and the cesspool of racism he presides over at Fox Nation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t find it offensive at all,\u201d Watters said."}
