As further proof of this, a new Walmart training video leaked online has illustrated the specific propaganda the company feeds their employees to prevent them from organizing.\n\nIn a particularly revealing sound bite from the video, the company explains, \u201cOur company prefers to have open and direct communication with our associates\u2014we don\u2019t think a labor union is necessary here. And because our associates have said time after time that they don\u2019t want a union, we usually don\u2019t spend a lot of time talking about them.\u201d All of this comes on the heels of Walmart shutting down five stores in four states for \u201cplumbing problems,\u201d an excuse many are interpreting as \u201cunion problems.\u201d\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201cThis death metal band fronted by a parrot is real and it\u2019s amazing\u201d\n\nIn terms of labor regulations, Walmart is basically the Michael Jordan of retail chains. At one point, it was estimated that they were receiving around 5,000 lawsuits a year from workers at Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club stores alike. This is why criticism of Walmart has become about as common the store itself; the Wikipediapage on this very subject is not what you would call light reading.\n\nIt\u2019s important that people remember just how toxic Walmart\u2019s views on unions are, but it\u2019s also important not to forget all of their other equally problematic corporate policies. For Walmart, unions are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to atrocities.\n\nTo that end, here\u2019s a quick rundown of all the other reasons the company is so awful.\n\n1) Walmart hurts local communities\n\nOf all of Walmart\u2019s egregious practices overtime, this is the one that\u2019s probably the most well-known. For additional evidence, check out the 2005 documentary, Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price. Many people are aware that when Walmart comes to town, the company drives out smaller mom-and-pop businesses, but what not everybody realizes is that the presence of Walmart actually does little to bolster the economy of local communities in the long run either.\n\nAs Jared Cram at Generation Progress points out:\n\nA study commissioned by the Los Angeles City Council in 2003 found that Walmart is a net loss for the communities it moves into. An influx of \u201cbig box retailers\u201d such as Walmart was estimated to cost an additional $9 million in state health care costs and a loss in pensions and retirement benefits so large that the increase in public assistance necessary to make up the shortfall could not even be covered by increased sales and property taxes.\u201d\n\nThe truth is that when Walmart moves in, they don\u2019t make things better. Instead, they make things much worse, and create unsustainable economic models in surrounding communities for years to come.\n\n2) The company uses foreign labor, including child workers\n\nIt\u2019s been estimated that over 50 percent of Walmart goods come from overseas suppliers. This doesn\u2019t just take away American jobs in favor of cutting costs; it also creates a living hell for those forced to meet Walmart\u2019s hefty supply needs. The corporation has been accused of paying off officials in foreign companies in order to keep many of the details silent, but various stories paint a gruesome picture.\n\nA great example of this is Bangladesh, where the minimum wage for garment industry workers is just $37 a month. The conditions in the facilities where these products are made are incredibly unsafe. A 2012 fire in one factory which made garments for Walmart killed 111 people, while another in 1990 killed 32. And aclass-action lawsuit from 2010 alleged that one woman worked seven days a week, from 7:45am to 10pm, putting chalk marks on pants, without a day off for six months.\n\nThe corruption doesn\u2019t stop at Bangladesh, though. Global supply chains which aid companies like Walmart have even been linked to the slave trade in Thailand.\n\nTo top it all off, it\u2019s been noted in the past that most of the employees at Walmart\u2019s overseas factories may be underage. Harvard Law cites a human rights study from 2006 which found that describes the conditions at one factory in Bangladesh:\n\nThe children report being routinely slapped and beaten, sometimes falling down from exhaustion, forced to work 12 to 14 hours a day, even some all-night, 19-to-20-hour shifts, often seven days a week, for wages as low as 6 \u00bd cents an hour. The wages are so wretchedly low that many of the child workers get up at 5:00 a.m. each morning to brush their teeth using just their finger and ashes from the fire, since they cannot afford a toothbrush or toothpaste.\n\nOf course, Walmart isn\u2019t the only company who has employed child labor, but as the United States\u2019 top retailer, its continued use of the practice is even worse. While the company claims to be changing many of these policies, there is ampledocumentation which suggests otherwise. By now, child and foreign labor has become such a key part of the fabric of Walmart, and of the product they sell, it\u2019s hard to imagine anything less than a complete overhaul of Walmart\u2019s business methods will change that.\n\n3) Walmart underpays women and neglects pregnant workers\n\nAlthough working at Walmart may not necessarily be great for anybody, it may also be additionally tough for women. Beginning in 2001, the case of Wal-Mart vs. Dukes sought to change that, but unfortunately, the Supreme Court shot it down in 2011, making it harder for female employees at Walmart and everywhere else to break free from being underrepresented and underpaid.\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201c\u2018The Crow\u2019 is recasting its supervillain as a woman\u201d\n\nAs recently as 2013, despite the fact that women account for as much as 57 percent of Walmart\u2019s U.S. workforce (and that they employ more women than any other U.S. company), women were paid $1.16 less per hour. That adds up to $1,100 less per year than men doing the exact same jobs, and female employees in salaried positions of $50,000 or over earned $14,500 less than their male counterparts.\n\nAnd if you think working at Walmart as a woman is hard already, forget about working there when you\u2019re pregnant. Multiple lawsuits against the company are currently fighting for women who\u2019ve been overworked, put in dangerous situations, and fired by Walmart while pregnant. (Fortunately, these cases are coming on the heels of the Supreme Court ruling in favor of pregnant women inYoung vs. United Parcel Service.)\n\nFor now, we can only hope that this time around, the courts rules in favor of justice, and against Walmart.\n\n4) The company also discriminates against workers with a disability and elderly employees\n\nBesides women, the other marginalized groups Walmart goes after are the disabled and the elderly. In 2001 alone, the company paid $6 million to settle 13 lawsuits filed by various disabled workers. And in 2014, Walmart was forced to shell out $363,419 to settle a suit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of an employee with an intellectual disability who had been sexually harassed.\n\nThis year, the company coughed up $150,000 to settle a suit filed by the EEOC for age and disability discrimination. However, the Supreme Court recently ruled against Julie Heimeshoff in Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., with Heimeshoff denied disability benefits by the company.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The retail giant's famous anti-union policies are nothing new and appear to be getting worse all the time", "title": "10 reasons Wal-Mart is the worst company in America", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The retail giant's famous anti-union policies are nothing new and appear to be getting worse all the time", "title": "10 reasons Wal-Mart is the worst company in America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/10_reasons_wal_mart_is_the_worst_company_in_america_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_186861932.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The retail giant's famous anti-union policies are nothing new and appear to be getting worse all the time", "title": "10 reasons Wal-Mart is the worst company in America", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_186861932.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chris Osterndorf", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, michael jordan, the daily dot, union busting, Unions, Wal-Mart", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86a8\"", "article_summary": "For Walmart, unions are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to atrocities.\nTopics: michael jordan, the daily dot, union busting, Unions, Wal-Mart, Business NewsThis article originally appeared on The Daily DotWalmart and unions go together like oil and water.\nIn a particularly revealing sound bite from the video, the company explains, \u201cOur company prefers to have open and direct communication with our associates\u2014we don\u2019t think a labor union is necessary here.\n(Fortunately, these cases are coming on the heels of the Supreme Court ruling in favor of pregnant women inYoung vs. United Parcel Service.)\n2) The company uses foreign labor, including child workersIt\u2019s been estimated that over 50 percent of Walmart goods come from overseas suppliers."}
