This time, she says in a Nov. 15 interview with the British Broadcasting Company that many Americans now disrespect the office of the president because Obama is black. (It still bothers me all those racists that hate non-blacks call him black. HE IS ONLY HALF BLACK.) \u201cThere is a level of disrespect for the office that occurs,\u201d Winfrey said. \u201cAnd that occurs in some cases and maybe even in many cases because he\u2019s African American. There\u2019s no question about that, and it\u2019s the kind of thing that nobody ever says but everybody is thinking it.\u201d This is only the latest proof Oprah is a dedicated racist. She was called \u201ca liar\u201d by the sales clerk she besmirched in Europe who didn\u2019t assist Oprah fast enough for the ego-maniac \u201clittle rich\u201d black girl. I can imagine Oprah laughing all the way to the bank, \u201cI\u2019ve fooled these honkies for years and years and have them eating out of my hand.\u201d Well power to her, I\u2019ve got to admit she has worn sheep\u2019s clothing for a long time and made billions off the fools that \u201clove\u201d her. But, she\u2019s never made a dime off me and never will. In her BBC interview, Oprah pointed to the fact that Congressman Joe Wilson yelled \u201cYou lie\u201d during a 2009 speech Obama was giving to Congress. \u201cWinfrey took her comments one step further, saying that the issue of racism is largely generational. Specifically, she said that cultural prejudice in the U.S. will largely recede after the last generation of individuals have died off,\u201d reported Eric Pfeiffer in a Nov. 15 article on Yahoo.com. \u201c\u2018I said this, you know, for apartheid South Africa, I said this for my own, you know, community in the South \u2014 there are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in it, in that prejudice and racism, and they just have to die,\" Winfrey said,\u2019\u201d Pfeiffer added. She needs to re-think her phoney \u201cevidence\u201d against Rep. Joe Wilson proving racism. Wilson wasn\u2019t being a racist, he was telling the truth. Obama was telling the world that \u201cillegal immigrants would not be getting health care under his proposed Affordable Care Act.\u201d We all know that was not the truth. So what do you call it? \u201cObama misspoke? No, it was exactly what Wilson said. Now we\u2019re sitting here almost five years later, and some \u2013 or \u201cmaybe even in many cases\u201d \u2013 people have learned Obama is quite adept at spinning yarns, to be kind. (As adept as Winfrey). And Wilson has been vindicated throughout the years \u2013 and as late as last month in a piece by Richard Kline on www.americanthinker.com, where Kline looked at facts from Wilson\u2019s shout to what\u2019s happened in the last five years. \u201cAs we look back \u2026 we see that Obama and his Administration do lie,\u201d Kline wrote. \u201cAnd they lie a lot.\u201d He pointed to several proven untruths. \u201cBoth Eric Holder and Barack Obama stated that \u2018Fast and Furious was a program begun in the Bush Administration.\u2019 That was a lie. The Bush Administration had, in fact, shut down any efforts to track illegal shipments of guns to Mexico.\u201d There was the fact that, \u201cHillary Clinton, Susan Wright and Obama all stated that the attack in Benghazi was caused by Islamists\u2019 spontaneous reaction to an anti-Islamist video produced in the United States.\u201d Obama carried on with this \u201cuntruth\u201d for two weeks into the United Nations speech. Obama \u201c\u2026 assured us that \u2018..... the IRS targeting of conservative groups like the Tea Party...\u2019 was an isolated instance of rogue IRS employees in the Cincinnati office.\u201d We know that was very, very untruthful. Obama \u201c\u2026 and the National Director of Intelligence reassured the American people time and time again that the phone calls and emails of Americans were not being monitored and recorded as part of our intelligence programs.\u201d Oops, another little fib. Kline then gets to Obama\u2019s signature legislation \u2013 otherwise called an enema \u2013 that he and the Democrats forced upon the American people. Kline refers to the rollout of Obamacare as \u201cfertile fields for more lying.\u201d \u2022 \u201cIf you like your current insurance plan, you can keep it. Period.\u201d \u2022 \u201cIf you like your current doctor, you can keep that doctor.\u201d \u2022 \u201cYour premiums will go down an average of $2,500 per year.\u201d \u2022 \u201cThe cost of this national healthcare program will be less than $1 trillion.\u201d \u2022 \u201cObamacare would not cover abortions.\u201d \u2022 \u201cObamacare would not cover illegal aliens.\u201d Notice Wilson\u2019s objection in 2009 is listed there again. So, I ask Oprah, \u2018Why would you call Rep. Joe Wilson a racist when he spoke the truth?\u201d Her answer might be, \u201cWell nobody has ever done that to a president before.\u201d That can\u2019t be proven in the history of the presidency, but I would counter with, \u201cWe have never had a president stand before a joint session of Congress and utter such garbage before either.\u201d That also can\u2019t be proven. But Oprah can take her racism and share it with her rich, black friends, and I hope all the millions of whites she slandered last Friday wake up and see her for what she is: A dedicated (and filthy rich) black racist \u2013 who is never challenged by the leftist media, I might add. Shame on her and her ilk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leader & Times Online", "generator": "Joomla! 1.5 - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Larry Phillips", "title": "I\u2019m tired of Oprah and her racism", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 425976307478411}, "keywords": "daily, leader, daily leader, high plains, liberal, liberal kansas, 67901, daily newspaper, kansas daily newspaper, liberal daily newspaper, liberal kansas daily newspaper, liberal kansas news, southwest kansas newspaper"}, "article_summary": "By L&T Managing Editor Larry Phillips The racist Oprah Winfrey is in the news again.\n\u201cAs we look back \u2026 we see that Obama and his Administration do lie,\u201d Kline wrote.\nShe needs to re-think her phoney \u201cevidence\u201d against Rep.
