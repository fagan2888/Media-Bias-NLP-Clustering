But the result was undeniable: He fell in love with archery.\n\n\u201cShe bought me a bow for Valentine\u2019s Day years ago, and I just went from there and figured it all out,\u201d Tenbrook said. \u201cI started tinkering with bows, and now I have a pro shop right out of the house.\u201d\n\nHailing from the humble mountain town of Eagle, Tenbrook\u2019s subsequent achievements as an archer are noteworthy. He has won more Colorado State Archery Association (CSAA) tournament championships than he can recall and is now the association\u2019s president. In 2009, he was crowned a champion at the National Field Archery Association World Archery Festival in Las Vegas. Last weekend, he finished out of the money among more than 2,200 archers competing at the $165,000 tournament many consider to be the indoor archery world championships. He blamed the result on the bright lights of Sin City.\n\n\u201cWe had a bachelor party on Thursday night and a wedding on Friday night, so my shooting wasn\u2019t that great,\u201d Tenbrook said. \u201cBut it was fun.\u201d\n\nFun is the foundation of the sport that Tenbrook shares with his wife, Lisa, and 26-year-old son, Tyler. And while he\u2019s serious enough about competition to travel as a tournament archer and pro staffer for Precision Shooting Company most weekends, it\u2019s the good times shared among his homegrown archery club that get him through long Western Slope winters between elk hunting seasons.\n\nLike most of the 40-some members of the Brush Creek Archery Club, Tenbrook is first and foremost a bowhunter. But bringing down a bull elk with a bow and arrow demands accuracy. And after a bit of offseason target practice, Tenbrook soon discovered that he was more accurate than most.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve hunted for a long time, and I\u2019ve been archery hunting most of that. Then I started into the competitive side of it just to better my shooting,\u201d he said. \u201cWith targets, you really have to be on your game. Like in Vegas, you\u2019ve got all those people breathing down your neck and you have to shoot perfect scores to be there at the end, so it adds a lot to it, having that adrenaline rush. I think it\u2019s harder than shooting an elk. Usually elk run right in and you don\u2019t have time to think about it. You pull up and aim and fire.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much the regimen every Wednesday night at the Eagle County Fairgrounds as well \u2014 pull up, aim and fire. There\u2019s nothing formal about the small group that gathers to shoot at paper targets from a dirt floor designed for livestock while others toss horseshoes in the corner of the building. But for this casual group of offseason bowhunters, it\u2019s more than they ever dreamed of.\n\n\u201cWe started as just a couple guys shooting in the little hay barn at the fairgrounds. And then it kind of grew,\u201d said Ron Hedrick, president of the 5-year-old club. \u201cMost of us got into it for the hunting, so a lot of guys don\u2019t particularly like doing (targets). But it sure helps out.\u201d\n\nThe club recently hosted one of four state tournaments sanctioned by the CSAA in 2014, drawing more than 130 competitors as young as age 8 to compete on a Saturday in January. As a tournament archer in the \u201cbowhunter\u201d class himself, Hedrick agrees with his friend about the value of competition.\n\n\u201cA lot of our guys would rather shoot the 3D targets, but this makes you pretty good. Those tournaments, I never thought you\u2019d get so nervous up there in front of all those people,\u201d Hedrick said. \u201cIt gets you almost as nervous as having an elk there, with all those people around and the pressure is on you. You really have to concentrate.\u201d\n\nBeyond concentration, the archer\u2019s best friend is repetition. And with some dedication, who knows where that friendship might lead?\n\n\u201cI like the 3D much better than targets, because it\u2019s real hunting situations. And tournaments. But I like hunting the most,\u201d said Tenbrook, Eagle County\u2019s only certified bow tech. \u201cI love it all. I spend countless hours doing archery in general. I put in way more hours on archery than I do at my job, and I\u2019ve got a 40-hour-a-week job. The rest of it is all archery.\u201d\n\nScott Willoughby: swilloughby@denverpost.com or twitter.com/willoughbydp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bowhunters hone their skills even in offseason with tournaments", "title": "Bowhunters hone their skills even in offseason with tournaments", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/15/bowhunters-hone-their-skills-even-in-offseason-with-tournaments/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140215__20140216_CC14_SP16OUTFEATUREp1.jpg", "height": 415}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140215__20140216_CC14_SP16OUTFEATUREp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-15T17:56:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:56:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5c7e\"", "article_summary": "Like most of the 40-some members of the Brush Creek Archery Club, Tenbrook is first and foremost a bowhunter.\n\u201cI\u2019ve hunted for a long time, and I\u2019ve been archery hunting most of that.\nBut I like hunting the most,\u201d said Tenbrook, Eagle County\u2019s only certified bow tech.\nIn 2009, he was crowned a champion at the National Field Archery Association World Archery Festival in Las Vegas.\nHe has won more Colorado State Archery Association (CSAA) tournament championships than he can recall and is now the association\u2019s president."}
