It was the first time they had ever been exhibited in public.\n\nPope Francis prayed before the fragments at the start of Sunday\u2019s service and then clutched the case in his arms for several minutes after his homily.\n\nNo pope has ever definitively declared the fragments to belong to the Apostle Peter, but Pope Paul VI in 1968 said fragments found in the necropolis under St. Peter\u2019s Basilica were \u201cidentified in a way that we can consider convincing.\u201d\n\nSome archaeologists dispute the finding.\n\nBut last week, a top Vatican official, Archbishop Rino Fisichella, said it almost doesn\u2019t matter if archaeologists one day definitively determine that the bones aren\u2019t Peter\u2019s, saying Christians have prayed at Peter's tomb for two millennia and will continue to, regardless.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if pilgrims who go to the altar (of Peter's tomb) think that in that moment in which they profess their faith that below them are the relics of Peter, or of another or another still,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThey go there to profess the faith.\u201d\n\nThe relics were discovered during excavations begun under St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in the years following the 1939 death of Pope Pius XI, who had asked to be buried in the grottoes where dozens of popes are buried, according to the 2012 book by veteran Vatican correspondent Bruno Bartoloni, \u201cThe Ears of the Vatican.\u201d\n\nDuring the excavations, archaeologists discovered a funerary monument with a casket built in honor of Peter and an engraving in Greek that read \u201cPetros eni,\u201d or \u201cPeter is here.\u201d\n\nThe scholar of Greek antiquities, Margherita Guarducci, who had deciphered the engraving, continued to investigate and learned that one of the basilica workers had been given the remains found inside the casket and stored them in a shoe box kept in a cupboard. She reported her findings to Paul VI, who later proclaimed that there was a \u201cconvincing\u201d argument that the bones belonged to Peter.\n\nTop Vatican Jesuits and other archaeologists strongly denied the claim but had little recourse.\n\n\u201cNo Pope had ever permitted an exhaustive study, partly because a 1,000-year-old curse attested by secret and apocalyptic documents, threatened anyone who disturbed the peace of Peter's tomb with the worst possible misfortune,\u201d Mr. Bartoloni wrote.\n\nThe Vatican newspaper, l\u2019Osservatore Romano, published excerpts of the book last year, giving his account a degree of official sanction.\n\nIn 1971, Paul VI was given an urn containing the relics, which were kept in the private papal chapel inside the Apostolic Palace and exhibited for the pope\u2019s private veneration each June 29, for the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul.
