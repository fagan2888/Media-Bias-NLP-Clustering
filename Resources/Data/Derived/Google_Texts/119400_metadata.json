Yesterday, the Republican-controlled House voted for legislation to do just that.\n\nCongressman Tom Price, a pro-life Republican member from Georgia and also a medical doctor, told LifeNews in a statement that he\u2019s glad the House voted to repeal.\n\nHe said: \u201cPatients, families, and doctors should make medical decisions, not Washington, DC. The Independent Payment Advisory Board is a direct threat to quality, innovative and responsive health care for America\u2019s seniors. This board of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats has the power to deny care to seniors by deciding unilaterally what care will be paid for. Repealing IPAB will help protect the patient-doctor relationship for Medicare beneficiaries. It is part of what must be a broader effort to focus attention on solutions that put patients first.\u201d\n\nConcerned Women for America president Penny Nance talked about the problems with the IPAB and why it needs to be repealed.\n\n\u201cObamaCare was signed into law in 2010, and its ramifications are astronomical, with IPAB being one of the most contentious portions of the health care law. Although the reasoning behind IPAB was to keep Medicare spending down, the facts show that it will ignore the essential problems associated with Medicare and lower costs by rationing treatment to seniors,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats will decide what treatments our elderly parents receive. No longer will we be able to make decisions in conjunction with medical professionals about our parents\u2019 needs; these decisions will be decided by reimbursement rates set by an inauspicious board. CWA views this as a small victory on the long road to stopping this egregious health care law that tramples economic freedom and religious liberties. We will continue to shed light on the wrongheaded health care law until it is fully dismantled.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nPro-life NRLC attorney Jennifer Popik talked previously about the pro-life rationale for ending the program.\n\n\u201cIntegral to the Obama Administration\u2019s stated mission to drive down what Americans choose to spend for life-saving and health-preserving health care, the IPAB is charged with a key role in suppressing health care spending by limiting what treatment doctors are allowed to give their patients,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile the focus throughout this debate has been on the IPAB\u2019s authority to cut Medicare with very limited Congressional authority to override or alter those cuts, National Right to Life has been emphasizing a still graver concern \u2013 one at the core of rationing in ObamaCare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe health care law instructs the IPAB to make recommendations to limit what all Americans are legally allowed to spend for their health care to hold it below the rate of medical inflation. The health care law then empowers the federal Department of Health and Human Services to implement these recommendations by imposing so-called \u201cquality\u201d and \u201cefficiency\u201d measures on health care providers,\u201d Popik continues. \u201cWhat happens to doctors who violate a \u201cquality\u201d standard by prescribing more lifesaving medical treatment than it permits? They will be disqualified from contracting with any of the health insurance plans that individual Americans, under the Obama Health Care Law, will be mandated to purchase. Few doctors would be able to remain in practice if subjected to that penalty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis means that treatment a doctor and patient deem advisable to save that patient\u2019s life or preserve or improve the patient\u2019s health\u2013but which exceeds the standard imposed by the government\u2013will be denied even if the patient is willing and able to pay for it. Repeal of IPAB is critically important to prevent this rationing of life-saving medical treatment,\u201d she adds.\n\nRep. Joe Pitts, a pro-life Pennsylvania Republican,also chimed in.\n\nHe said that the IPAB would make it more difficult to administer Medicare policy, saying, \u201cSupporters of IPAB tell us there is nothing wrong with having 15 unelected bureaucrats making binding decisions about Medicare policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are not troubled by the fact that there is no requirement for public comment prior to IPAB issuing its recommendations. That IPAB\u2019s actions are not subject to judicial review does not alarm them,\u201d Pitts said.\n\nHe said that, although the law claims the board can\u2019t make decisions that result in rationing, the term is undefined: \u201cFor example,\u201d he asked, \u201cis it rationing if IPAB slashes provider reimbursements to the point that doctors decide they can no longer see Medicare patients?\u201d\n\n\u201cRepeal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) is critical to prevent the rationing of life-saving medical treatment,\u201d said Burke Balch, J.D., director of National Right to Life\u2019s Robert Powell Center for Medical Ethics. \u201cThe IPAB would recommend drastic limits for the Department of Health and Human Services to impose on what Americans are allowed to spend out of their own funds to save their own lives and the lives of their families.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to members of the Subcommittee on Health, National Right to Life noted that \u201c[t]he Obama law directs the Board to issue recommendations to limit what ordinary citizens and their health insurance coverage can pay for medical treatment so as to prevent it from keeping up with the rate of medical inflation.\u201d\n\nThe letter also noted that in order to \u201cimplement these recommendations, the Department of Health and Human Services is empowered to impose so-called \u2018quality\u2019 and \u2018efficiency\u2019 measures on health care providers. Doctors who violate a \u2018quality\u2019 standard by prescribing more life-saving medical treatment than it permits will be disqualified from contracting with any of the health insurance plans that individual Americans, under the Obama Health Care Law, will be mandated to purchase.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimply put, the IPAB is bad medicine,\u201d added Balch. \u201cIt is outrageous that a government entity would be allowed to dictate and limit what Americans could spend \u2013 of their own money \u2013 to save their own lives.\u201d\n\nThe IPAB has come under question before and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius faced questions from members of Congress over the board last year.\n\n\u201cThe Independent Patient Advisory Board makes recommendations to Congress,\u201d Sebelius said. \u201cIt is forbidden by law to do exactly what the Republican budget plan does. They may not shift costs to seniors. They may not change benefits.\u201d\n\nTony Perkins of the Family Research Council has said the IPAB \u201ccould lead\u2013not only to the death of patients, but also to the death of innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Board, made up of 15 unelected members of the President\u2019s choosing, will be the sole authority over what kind of care\u2013if any\u2013we receive,\u201d he explained. \u201cStarting in 2015, IPAB will be tasked with bringing down medical costs\u2013and unless Congress can find a super-majority to oppose them, IPAB\u2019s recommendations will carry the force of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Board could deny payment for certain care or medications, change the service options doctors have, and drive expensive, life-saving treatments out. Instead of discussing the options with your doctor, IPAB will be sitting at the controls in Washington making health decisions for you,\u201d Perkins explained.\n\n\u201cWhat should control health care isn\u2019t IPAB. It isn\u2019t even Congress. What should control health care is the relationship between doctors and patients. Injecting more government into the equation only punishes patients and squeezes out the cutting-edge science that could treat them. This is just one more reason to contact your congressmen and tell them to not rest until ObamaCare is laid to rest,\u201d Perkins said.\n\nBalch said one of the big pro-life concerns with Obamacare is that it \u201crequires the Independent Payment Advisory Board to make recommendations, which the federal Department of Health and Human Services is given coercive power to implement, effectively to limit what private nongovernmental resources Americans are allowed to devote to health care for their family so that they cannot even keep up with the rate of medical inflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, the Board will play a crucial role in limiting the ability of Americans of all ages to spend their own money to save their own lives,\u201d Balch said. \u201cWhile public attention seems focused on the Board\u2019s impact on Medicare, too many overlook how it is charged with crafting measures that will result in the denial of life-saving medical treatment \u2013 rationing\u2013 for people of any age.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Votes to Repeal Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), Obamacare's \u201cDeath Panels\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The U.S. House of Representatives yesterday voted to repeal a portion of the Obamacare law that pro-life advocates strongly opposed because it could lead to rat", "title": "House Votes to Repeal Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), Obamacare\u2019s \u201cDeath Panels\u201d", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/06/24/house-votes-to-repeal-independent-payment-advisory-board-ipab-obamacares-death-panels/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/senate2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "house votes to repeal independent payment advisory board (ipab),obamacare\\'s \u201cdeath panels\u201d", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2253\"", "article_summary": "The Independent Payment Advisory Board is a direct threat to quality, innovative and responsive health care for America\u2019s seniors.\nCWA views this as a small victory on the long road to stopping this egregious health care law that tramples economic freedom and religious liberties.\n\u201cWhat happens to doctors who violate a \u201cquality\u201d standard by prescribing more lifesaving medical treatment than it permits?\nThey will be disqualified from contracting with any of the health insurance plans that individual Americans, under the Obama Health Care Law, will be mandated to purchase.\n\u201cObamaCare was signed into law in 2010, and its ramifications are astronomical, with IPAB being one of the most contentious portions of the health care law."}
