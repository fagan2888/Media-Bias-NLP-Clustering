That amount is projected to climb at an average annual rate of 5.4 percent, reaching $1.1 trillion \u2014 or 4.1 percent of GDP \u2014 by 2026.\n\nHere are six more things to know from the CBO report.\n\n1. For the period between 2017 and 2026, the projected net subsidy is $8.9 trillion.\n\n2. Two types of costs account for most of this amount, according to the report. Federal spending for Medicaid and CHIP benefits provided to people under 65 is projected to reach $3.8 trillion, or 43 percent of the total net subsidy. This includes the $1 trillion in subsidies for people eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n3. Additionally, federal subsidies associated with employer-sponsored insurance for people under 65 are projected to reach $3.6 trillion, or 41 percent of the total net subsidy.\n\n4. Medicare benefits for non-institutionalized beneficiaries represent a much smaller cost to the government. These are projected to amount to $1 trillion, or 11 percent of the total net subsidy, according to the report.\n\n5. Subsidies for health insurance obtained in the nongroup market, including the insurance marketplaces and through the Basic Health Program, are estimated to cost $0.9 trillion, or 10 percent of the total net subsidy.\n\n6. The cost of subsidies for Medicare benefits and health insurance obtained in the nongroup market are offset to a small extent \u2014 $0.4 trillion, or 5 percent \u2014 by taxes and penalties collected from health insurance companies, uninsured people and employers.\n\nMore articles on finance:\n\nFormer Presence CEO: Illinois' budget woes, malpractice climate contributed to system's $186M operating loss\n\nNCRC and KeyBank announce landmark $16.5 billion community benefits agreement\n\nFocus on drug pricing: Three areas to look at rising cost and declining reimbursement\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
