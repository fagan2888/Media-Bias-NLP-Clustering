Vernon residents are showing their support for a young girl that was injured in a hunting accident last month.

The Vernon volunteer fire department put together a car wash and cook-out at Vernon high school for Andrea Wright.

Members of the community are coming together during the teen's recovery.

16-year-old Andrea Wright continues to heal at sacred heart hospital in Pensacola after accidentally shooting herself in the leg while duck hunting. Her leg had to be amputated.

Outside of Vernon High School Saturday, dozens from the community came to support Andrea.

Andrea’s Friend Cheyenne Paridon said, "I think it makes her feel good knowing that she has a lot of people that love her and everything, they're trying to support her."

Residents were washing cars and cooking food at the school to raise money for Andrea’s medical bills.

Vernon volunteer firefighters decided to hold the fundraiser at Andrea’s high school so classmates, friends, and even strangers could help her cause.

Organizer Bobby Pippin said, "We heard about the story and we asked kids you know and we're hunters and all and it just, it hit close to home and we just try to find something small, you know a way to help out."

Even a local band, Cypress Spring, came to the event to help out Andrea.

Band Member Kalan Miller said, "Just try to pretty much give back just help out as much as possible."

Miller knows Andrea through her brother. He said if he could see Andrea today he'd offer some words of encouragement.

"Stay strong keep your head up everything is going to be alright,” said Miller.

The Vernon volunteer fire chief says more than $3,000 was raised from Saturday’s fundraiser.
