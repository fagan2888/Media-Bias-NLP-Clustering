Municipal money in various forms accounted for about $36 million.\n\n\u201cPeople are interested. People are intrigued,\u201d Joe Jolliff, a front-desk clerk, said about a steady number of folks who checked out the new lodging at 533 Main St.\n\nThe facility\u2019s unveiling coincided with a change in project managment.\n\nAt midnight Friday, First Hospitality Group of Rosemont took over from Marriott International Inc. That firm also was operating the refurbished Marriott Pere Marquette, which opened last June and is adjacent to the Courtyard.\n\nHours after the switch became official, the new hotel welcomed its first guests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique situation,\u201d said Joe LoMonaco, the properties\u2019 new managing director. \u201cTo open a hotel and to take over a management contract that\u2019s connected, that\u2019s a very rare thing. And it\u2019s exciting, very exciting.\u201d\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, 16 rooms had been sold for that night at the 116-room Courtyard, according to LoMonaco. Next week, two nights are sold out.\n\n\u201cThe first three days, we didn\u2019t want to have too many (occupancies), because we\u2019re still working out the kinks,\u201d LoMonaco said. \u201cWe\u2019re still a little bit rough around the edges. But by Monday, we\u2019ll be perfect.\u201d\n\nLoMonaco, who once managed the Embassy Suites East Peoria, leads the new management contingent. Project developer Gary Matthews cited its local ties, among other things, as a reason for the switch. The City Council approved it July 1.\n\nAlso opened Friday was the skywalk that connects both hotels to the Peoria Civic Center. The link includes a 400-space parking garage that opened last March.\n\nThe Courtyard, which LoMonaco said is geared toward business travelers, is to receive a more formal christening within three or four weeks. The Pere Marquette is to be included in the festivities.\n\n\u201cThe city is owed that,\u201d LoMonaco said. \u201cI think the people of the city should get a real, live ribbon-cutting.\n\n\u201cNot only will we be presenting this to the city, but we want them to be able to walk through both properties and enjoy what we really want to give back to them.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated July 19 to say the City Council approved the management change July 1. The original date was incorrect.\n\nNick Vlahos can be reached at 686-3285 or nvlahos@pjstar.com.
