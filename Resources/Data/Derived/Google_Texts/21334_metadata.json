The nascent Bush campaign \u2013 which is already attempting to craft a message to appeal to middle and working class Americans \u2013 plans to move early on to crush efforts by either Democrats or rival Republicans to paint the former governor as a super-wealthy creature of Wall Street.\n\nPart of that effort was on display this week as Bush announced the creation of his \u201cRight to Rise\u201d political action committee with casual remarks in English and Spanish made directly to the camera on a New York city street and posted on Facebook.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Bush leadership PAC raising money fast)\n\nThe new PAC\u2019s web site shows that Bush is looking to tap into the current national mood of economic populism. \u201cWhile the last eight years have been pretty good ones for top earners,\u201d the site\u2019s mission statement reads, \u201cthey\u2019ve been a lost decade for the rest of America.\u201d\n\nThis week also displays Bush\u2019s challenge in pushing back against efforts to portray him as a wealthy member of a political dynasty with patrician, Wall Street roots. Bush is scheduled to be in Greenwich, Conn. on Wednesday, home to some of the wealthiest financial elite, for a fundraiser for his newly created PAC. Greenwich was home to Bush family patriarch and former Senator Prescott Bush.\n\nNo final plans for the release of Bush\u2019s returns or other financial information have been made. But people close to the matter note that as governor of Florida and as a candidate for the office, Bush released over 20 years worth of tax returns. These people say he is prepared to make a similar move in any presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cPeople forget that he spent eight years as governor in a state with the most pro-transparency laws in the country,\u201d a person close to Bush said. \u201cHe is used to living in the sunshine. Most of the other likely candidates aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCandidates for president are not required to release tax returns. But many have done so \u2013 to greater and lesser degrees \u2013 for decades.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Warren takes swipe at Reagan, trickle-down economics)\n\nBush associates and other senior Republicans say that in addition to dispelling comparisons to Romney, the effort to be transparent about his finances is also meant to contrast with Hillary Clinton, the favorite for the Democratic nomination. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, amassed tens of millions of dollars over the last 14 years. Republicans are expected to press for disclosure of extensive tax return information as well as more detailed accounting of the finances of the non-profit Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s smart and the main advantage is that Jeb gets to be in control of the release of this information rather than having that control dictated by his opponents and the media,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a strategist at Hamilton Place Strategies who served as a top adviser and spokesman for Romney in 2012. \u201cYou also have more certainty around it by putting it out there and telling the story and then it is not new information coming out later.\u201d Madden added that the Obama campaign in 2012 successfully turned the tax return question into a \u201ccharacter issue\u201d that hurt Romney. \u201cIn that sense it would become a character attribute for Jeb Bush to get ahead of it and proactively put this financial information out there.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s possible plans to release detailed financial information come as the former governor winds down the lucrative corporate board assignments, investment ventures and well-paid public speaking he has done since leaving the Florida governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nBush, who worked as a real estate developer before becoming governor, left office in 2007 with a net worth of just over $1 million and set out to aggressively build wealth for himself and his family. He set up Jeb Bush and Associates, a consulting firm, in 2007. He followed that in 2008 with Britton Hill Partners, the umbrella organization for his investment funds. (Britton Hill is the tallest point in Florida.)\n\nAmong Bush\u2019s investment ventures are UK-based BH Global Aviation, which raised $61 million \u2013 much of it from foreign investors \u2014 to invest in Hong Kong-based aviation firm Hawker Pacific and BH Logistics, which is involved in the shale oil industry.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Jeb Bush's burden)\n\nBush served as an adviser to Lehman Brothers before its collapse and later advised Barclays, the British bank that bought Lehman out bankruptcy. Bush ended his relationship with Barclays at the end of 2014. He has also stepped down from the boards of real estate investment trust Rayonier and Tenet Health Care. Bush also ended his role as a paid adviser to for-profit education company Academic Partnerships. He is also no longer accepting the kind of speaking engagements that earned him him tens of thousands of dollars each over the last several years.\n\nTax returns would likely show how much wealth Bush managed to build from these endeavors over the last seven years. However, Bush is still in the process of exiting the private investment funds, people close to the matter say, so gains or losses might not show up in prior years\u2019 returns. They could, however, appear on financial disclosure forms Bush would have to fill out under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act should he formally announce his candidacy for president.\n\nIn August of 2011, Romney\u2019s disclosure showed a range of between $85 million and $264 million in assets. The campaign later said the figure was between $190 million and $250 million. Bush is not likely to show assets anywhere near that range.\n\nDemocrats relentlessly attacked Romney for the limited nature of his financial disclosure as well for how he earned the money, much of it through private equity investments at Bain Capital. Some of those investments included restructuring companies in ways that eliminated jobs. Romney never found a strong rebuttal to these critiques though he argued that most of his private equity work actually saved companies that might otherwise have failed.\n\nBush is planning a much earlier and more robust defense of his private sector career.\n\nBush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell declined to comment on any plans for financial disclosure, saying nothing was finalized as Bush continues to explore a possible run. But she cited the release of 250,000 private emails from Bush\u2019s tenure as governor in arguing that he will set a high standard of transparency. And she said Bush will talk openly about his private investment and corporate work and that extensive scrutiny of that work will turn up nothing that would damage Bush\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely nothing about Governor Bush\u2019s business interests that would hinder a run for president in any way,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocrats, of course, disagree. Outside groups are poring over Bush\u2019s business records and plan to make an issue of how he earned his money after leaving office. \u201cThere is no doubt that Jeb\u2019s business career will be heavily scrutinized in the coming months, as it should be,\u201d said Jesse Lehrich of the left-leaning research and tracking organization American Bridge 21st Century.\n\nThe Bush campaign is banking on American Bridge \u2013 and others \u2013 coming up empty.\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Bush is willing to release decade of tax returns, associates say.", "title": "Jeb to come clean", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/jeb-bush-tax-returns-114045.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/07/150107_jeb_bush_3_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Republicans,2016 Elections,Tax Returns,Jeb Bush,Florida,Governors", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Bush is willing to release decade of tax returns, associates say.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3113\"", "article_summary": "Most of the other likely candidates aren\u2019t.\u201dCandidates for president are not required to release tax returns.\n\u201cThere is absolutely nothing about Governor Bush\u2019s business interests that would hinder a run for president in any way,\u201d she said.\nNo final plans for the release of Bush\u2019s returns or other financial information have been made.\nTax returns would likely show how much wealth Bush managed to build from these endeavors over the last seven years.\nAs he lays the groundwork for a likely presidential campaign, Jeb Bush is prepared to make an early disclosure of a decade or more of personal tax returns, according to people close to the former Florida governor."}
