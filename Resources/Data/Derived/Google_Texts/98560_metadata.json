These closed-end funds (CEFs) are very different from traditional mutual funds, and they are different from exchange traded funds (ETFs). The key difference is this ability to trade at deep discounts of high premiums to the NAV, as well as the notion that they are at a fixed size in the number of shares they have.\n\nWith all the value investors looking for new ideas ahead of a fed funds rate hike cycle, and with stocks trading at all-time highs, many investors might be more interested than normal in assets trading at a discount to what they are really worth. Investors in high effective tax brackets are still looking at the tax-free municipal bond sector for opportunities. After all, there are some massive yields out there and investors do not generally have to pay the Affordable Care Act 3.8% fee (tax) on their coupon payments from municipal bonds.\n\nThere are many caveats in a review on closed-end funds, with many reasons as to why some of these may have big discounts or premiums to the NAV. 24/7 Wall St. also included the stated discount to NAV that was registered at the Closed-End Fund Association (CEFA) website. This is to help smooth out any delayed data on discounts to NAV from the prior week\u2019s report.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch recently highlighted some of the top CEFs covering bonds and fixed income, and the first part of this report focused more in-depth on the closed-end fund sector and focused on mostly taxable bond funds. Of the 43 CEFs covered in the Merrill Lynch report, 24/7 Wall St. focused on four top muni bond CEFs trading at deep discounts to NAV.\n\nALSO READ: How to Protect Yourself From a Summer Stock Market Correction\n\nLeveraged National Muni CEFs\n\nBlackrock Municipal Income Trust (NYSE: BFK) trades around $13.44, with an implied yield of 6.7%.
