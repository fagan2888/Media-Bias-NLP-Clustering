Also, HHS recently estimated 10 million people would have plans next year, half the industry expectations of 20 million.\n\nIn addition to UnitedHeath Group's potential exit from the exchanges, this year saw about a dozen small cooperative insurers collapse paying more medical claims than expected. Government payments to cover sicker patients will be reduced and eventually phased out by 2017.\n\nAnthem said its enrollment dropped by 69,000 people to 824,000 in the third quarter, but CEO Joseph Swedish said the company remains committed to the business and is \"continuing our dialogue with policy makers and regulators regarding how we can improve the stability of the individual market.\"\n\nAetna announced last month it lost money last year on the business, and is in the red this year but expects improvement as it learns more about its customers.\n\nIndustry analyst David Windley told Yahoo, \"The exchanges currently are an unprofitable, untenable book of business.
