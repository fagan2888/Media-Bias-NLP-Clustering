Especially political rumors.\n\nIn an upcoming paper, to be published in the British Journal of Political Science, MIT political scientist Adam Berinsky details just how difficult it is to correct untruths once they\u2019ve taken hold in the political sphere. As a case study for his piece, \u201cRumors, Truths, and Reality: A Study of Political Misinformation,\u201d Berinsky looked at the persistence of the death panel myth.\n\nA bit of context here \u2014 the \u201cdeath panel\u201d rumor circulated in 2009 after members of the Republican party (we\u2019re looking at you, Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann) described a nonexistent provision of the Affordable Care Act: A panel of healthcare officials that would decide whether the sick and elderly deserved to receive medical care, based on how valuable they were to society. Politifact soundly debunked the claim a few days later, writing:\n\n\u201cWe have read all 1,000-plus pages of the Democratic bill and examined versions in various committees. There is no panel in any version of the health care bills in Congress that judges a person\u2019s \u2018level of productivity in society\u2019 to determine whether they are \u2018worthy\u2019 of health care.\u201d\n\nPolitifact suggested that the kernel of truth that spawned the lies is actually quite different from the dystopian death panels of the right-wing imagination:\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the health bill allows Medicare, for the first time, to pay for doctors\u2019 appointments for patients to discuss living wills and other end-of-life issues with their physicians. These types of appointments are completely optional, and AARP supports the measure.\u201d\n\nSo, not death panels, at all.\n\nBut the rumor persisted, and became an ideal case study for those interested in political myths. In 2013, researcher Brendan Nyhan led a study which found that, in some cases, reading a death-panel correction reinforced their belief in their existence. The Washington Post explained at the time:\n\n\u201cFor high information Palin supporters though, the correction backfired: They appeared more likely to believe in death panels after reading the appended information, and have less favorable opinions of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nBerinsky also examined the death panel rumor, and found even more troubling results. In a phone interview, Berinsky told Fusion that issuing a correction actually serves to exacerbate the problem: \u201cThis is not a very effective strategy\u2026 by simply saying \u2018here\u2019s a particular rumor,\u2019 you\u2019re increasing what we call the fluency or the familiarity of the rumor.\u201d The problem, he added, \u201cis that rumors are really sticky.\u201d\n\nThis means that even if the truth sticks in the short run, the rumor will likely stick in the long run. Berinsky asked participants in his study to read a falsehood, and then an explanation of why it\u2019s wrong. In the process, he made sure that the participants were actively engaging with the rumor, and followed up to see which they remembered. The rumor stuck.\n\nThere are other factors that make rumors difficult to shake. \u201cA lot of political issues are very much emotional issues,\u201d said Berinsky, and \u201cthese types of rumors can really spread.\u201d\n\nAnd Internet news cycle doesn\u2019t help. \u201cIt\u2019s made it easier for people to find like-minded individuals. In some way I think having a 24-hour news cycle, where things are constantly repeated, could spark it\u2026 stories can get hold and spiral on top of each other, continuously,\u201d said Berinsky.\n\nSo how do you stop rumors from spreading? One thing you can do (as many news editors will tell you) is make the correction without repeating the untruth.\n\nBut the best way, says Berinsky, is to ask a credible, opposing party to debunk the rumor themselves. In the death panel scenario, for example, a Republican senator\u2019s statement calling the rumor false would go much further towards cementing the change in people\u2019s mind than negation by a Democratic official. \u201cNothing is more credible than a person who says something that is clearly against their own interest, \u201c Berinsky explained, adding \u201cpeople are very attuned to the credibility of a source.\u201d He found that both Democrats and Republicans were more likely to remember the correct healthcare information if it was offered by a Republican source.\n\nNorthwestern\u2019s Dr. Gary Alan Fine, who has spent years studying rumor (along with Ralph L. Rosnow, Fine co-authored a book called Rumor and Gossip: The Social Psychology of Hearsay back in 1976) confirmed that much of what Berinsky found applies to rumors more generally. In a phone interview with Fusion Fine, who is not familiar with Berinsky\u2019s work, explained:\n\n\u201cIn some of my writing I talk about two fundamental processes: One I call the politics of plausibility. The other I speak of as the politics of credibility.The first has to do with the content of the rumor: Does it make sense in terms of what people believe in?\u2026 the second, the politics of credibility, has to do with who spreads the information. Does that source seem to be a credible source?\u201d\n\nFine added that the types of rumors that appeal to us are ones that fit in with our worldview \u2014 to derail them, we need to be presented with more convincing information. \u201cSometimes, you can [debunk a rumor] by providing more information, by providing facts.\u201d He offered an anecdotal example:\n\n\u201cThis goes back now about 35 years. There was a rumor that was spread that McDonald\u2019s used worms in their hamburgers. Kind of an implausible rumor, but it was spread quite a bit. That was one of the reasons that the hamburgers were so juicy.\u201d\n\nThat legend, said Fine, was debunked by the head of another fast food company \u2014 a credible, opposing source like the one mentioned by Berinsky. Fine continued: \u201cThe CEO of another hamburger chain said that he knew for sure that that rumor was false, because a pound of red worms costs more than a pound of red meat.\u201d\n\nThis presents a convincing counterpoint \u2014 why would a large corporation spend more to replace beef (or beef product) with worms? The rumor fell away.\n\nThe example, however, represents more than just convincing, new information. The debunking story is as satisfying as the rumor itself. When asked if the quality of the CEO-tale played a role in its success, Fine said yes. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that drives these stories \u2014 at one point someone described rumor as \u2018verbal chewing gum.\u2019 There\u2019s pleasure in communicating stories.\u201d\n\nSo the truth, too, can spread \u2014 if it\u2019s sexy enough.
