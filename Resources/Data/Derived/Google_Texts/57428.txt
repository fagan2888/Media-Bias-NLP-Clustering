Onida, SD

An Onida man was the victim of a fatal crash Sunday morning on US Highway 83, 10 miles south of Onida.

53-year-old Lynn Weischedel was driving south when his vehicle started moving over to the shoulder as the road curved to the east. Weischedel reportedly overcorrected to the west, where the vehicle went into the ditch and rolled.

Weischedel was not wearing a seatbelt and was ejected from the vehicle. He died from his injuries.

Authorities cite speed as a factor in the accident; it is still being investigated if alcohol was also a factor.

No other vehicles were involved, and there were no other passegers.
