Judging from her tweet, \u201cHard secret to hold in ;)\u201d on September 11, it appears that Mackenzie found out on Wednesday, but she has kept it from her fans and her husband\u2026 until now!\n\nYesterday Mackenzie revealed how the announcement was going to go down by tweeting, \u201cI cant wait for everyone to see the video of josh cutting the cake. Its either pink or blue on the inside; )\u201d That announcement apparently didn\u2019t assuage Josh\u2019s anxiousness because Mackenzie followed that by tweeting, \u201cJosh is driving me crazy with these text. He wants to know what it is more than any of you.\u201d\n\nThe teasing finally ended just a short while ago when Mackenzie tweeted, \u201cWatch to find out what im having\u201d with a link to this instagram video:\n\nIt\u2019s pink y\u2019all! That means\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a girl!\n\nCongratulations to Josh and Mackenzie! I\u2019m sure she\u2019s ecstatic to have a potential little tumbler on the way.\n\nUPDATE \u2013 And it appears Josh is ecstatic to have a little girl on the way as well! Mackenzie tweeted this about the pop to be:\n\nJosh cannot stop smiling. He's always wanted a little princess to look after \u2014 Mackenzie McKee (@DouthitKenzie) September 15, 2013\n\nOn a more serious note, Mackenzie has drawn some criticism from some for getting pregnant again so soon \u2014 but she pretty much silenced detractors with her response on Twitter on September 8:\n\nIf a doctor told you your body would no longer be able to have babies after the age 21. And your married and 19. What would you do? \u2014 Mackenzie McKee (@DouthitKenzie) September 8, 2013\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know, Mackenzie has type 1 diabetes, a condition that caused her some serious issues during her pregnancy with Gannon. We spoke with Mackenzie about the impact of her type 1 diabetes on her pregnancy (and on her birth control choices) back in June of 2012.\n\n\u201cAlthough pregnant people like to eat a lot, I had to eat everything just right,\u201d Mackenzie said of her diet while pregnant. \u201cIf I had a low blood sugar it was suffocating the baby, and when I had a high blood sugar, it was giving the baby extra sugar, which made him gain weight. It was very hard with all the hormones to keep my blood sugars normal. I did everything right and STILL had mess ups. So, yes, I had LOTS of complications. It was very hard. I honestly didn\u2019t think i would make it.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a throwback photo of lil Mackenzie Douthit (at the time) and her not-so-lil baby bump mountain:\n\nThere was also a report from the very reliable blog The Ashley\u2019s Reality Roundup that Mackenzie suffered a late-term miscarriage prior to Gannon being born. The Ashley\u2019s source says that Mackenzie and Josh had even decided on a name, Oakley, for their unborn son. The source adds that Mackenzie got pregnant again soon after the miscarriage and that the miscarriage will probably be a storyline in the first season of Teen Mom 3.\n\nOnce again, congratulations to Mackenzie and Josh \u2014 and we wish her a healthy and happy pregnancy!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Video clip of Teen Mom 3's Mackenzie McKee revealing to her husband Josh (and everyone else) the sex of her 2nd baby with a gender reveal cake that is either blue or pink on the inside", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "starcasm.net", "description": "It\u2019s been more than a month since Teen Mom 3 star Mackenzie Douthit (now Mackenzie McKee) made the shocking announcement that she was pregnant with her second child, and since that time fans \u2026", "title": "VIDEO Teen Mom 3\u2019s Mackenzie McKee reveals sex of 2nd baby with cake", "url": "http://starcasm.net/archives/242784", "image": {"width": 490, "identifier": "http://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Gannon_Josh_Mackenzie_McKee_swimsuits.jpg", "height": 561}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "NK-iCNPutuKpqc_K6NfWujiyP1Gn3pHXdVSfS-utqiE", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-15T03:20:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-01T03:47:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde439\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Mackenzie McKee (@DouthitKenzie) September 8, 2013If you didn\u2019t know, Mackenzie has type 1 diabetes, a condition that caused her some serious issues during her pregnancy with Gannon.\nThe Ashley\u2019s source says that Mackenzie and Josh had even decided on a name, Oakley, for their unborn son.\nThe source adds that Mackenzie got pregnant again soon after the miscarriage and that the miscarriage will probably be a storyline in the first season of Teen Mom 3.\nOnce again, congratulations to Mackenzie and Josh \u2014 and we wish her a healthy and happy pregnancy!\nYesterday Mackenzie revealed how the announcement was going to go down by tweeting, \u201cI cant wait for everyone to see the video of josh cutting the cake."}
