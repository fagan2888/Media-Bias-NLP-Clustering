Ted Cruz over his stance on net neutrality.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like a flying Tweet that calls out Cruz by name and states, \u201cDon\u2019t Be an Enemy of the Internet\u201d\n\nThe difference is over the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s recent decision to regulate the Internet as a public utility and enforce a rule that Internet providers deliver all content equally and without preference. Phone and cable companies had wanted to allow certain enterprises to pay more and have their data use prioritized.\n\nCruz called it more government regulation that he believes will stifle innovation. He dubbed it \u201cObamacare for the Internet.\u201d\n\nThe banner was commissioned by net neutrality advocates Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, and the Free Press Action Fund.\n\nFight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer accused Cruz of siding with cable companies over consumers.\n\n\u201cTexans love their freedom,\u201d Greer said. \u201cThe Internet is rising and showing its power. Any politicians standing in its way should know by now that they are standing on the wrong side of history, and will pay the political cost for selling out their constituents.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: The net neutrality group might need another plane.\n\nIt should be pointed out that Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is attending the SXSW Interactive Festival and on Monday is opening a tech office in Austin to focus on digital engagement, also opposed the FCC\u2019s rule.\n\nHe has said in interviews that regulation of the Internet is the wrong way to go.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wMy9mbHlpbmctYmFubmVyLWF0LXN4c3ctdGFrZXMtY3J1ei10by10YXNrLW9uLWludGVybmV0LXN0YW5jZS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Christy Hoppe", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "As thousands of geeks and techies converge on Austin for the annual South by Southwest festival - starting today with interactive events - some are literally airing their beef with\u2026", "title": "Flying banner at SXSW takes Cruz to task on Internet stance", "url": "http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2015/03/flying-banner-at-sxsw-takes-cruz-to-task-on-internet-stance.html/", "image": "http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-03-13T11:47:02Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}}, "article_summary": "He dubbed it \u201cObamacare for the Internet.\u201dThe banner was commissioned by net neutrality advocates Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, and the Free Press Action Fund.\nHe has said in interviews that regulation of the Internet is the wrong way to go.\nAs thousands of geeks and techies converge on Austin for the annual South by Southwest festival \u2013 starting today with interactive events \u2013 some are literally airing their beef with Sen.
