Not just because Ford's top executives gave an elaborately choreographed update on the state of the company before revealing the all-new truck (see it here, here, here, here, here, and here), but because the media presence was absolutely massive.\n\nHundreds of journalists from around the world crowded the arena, and mobbed the stage afterward to get up-close looks at the new trucks. Several key Ford executives stuck around to talk to the media, including Ford Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields -- likely the next CEO of Ford.\n\nFields' comments to the media were fascinating, and we've captured them in this short video. He explained how the new trucks were expected to actually help Ford's corporate fuel-economy averages, and pointed out some key features that Ford thinks will increase the new pickups' appeal to families. He also gave some insights into Ford's expectations for profitability and spending in 2014.\n\nWe tried in this video to give you the flavor of the events following the reveal of the new pickups -- but Fields' comments are also worth a close listen for any Ford shareholder. Take a look, and then scroll down to leave us a comment with your thoughts on the new F-150.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "18:30", "description": "The Motley Fool was there as Ford's COO gave a group of reporters some inside thinking about the new F-150.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_2-things_50", "author": "John Rosevear and Rex Moore", "promo": "The Motley Fool was there as Ford's COO gave a group of reporters some inside thinking about the new F-150.", "twitter": {"title": "Ford's Chief Operating Officer Talks About the 2015 F-150 --  The Motley Fool", "description": "The Motley Fool was there as Ford's COO gave a group of reporters some inside thinking about the new F-150.", "site": "@themotleyfool"}, "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "The Motley Fool was there as Ford's COO gave a group of reporters some inside thinking about the new F-150.", "title": "Ford's Chief Operating Officer Talks About the 2015 F-150 --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/02/27/fords-chief-operating-officer-talks-about-the-2015.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F107085%2F2015fordf-150_skv_9468.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "headline": "Ford's Chief Operating Officer Talks About the 2015 F-150", "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-industrials", "STORY_UID": "40c4c628-9fc8-11e3-87c0-0050569d32b9", "pitch": 388, "date": "2014-02-27T23:30:00Z", "gsa_date": "2014 02 27", "tickers": "F", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd859\"", "article_summary": "Several key Ford executives stuck around to talk to the media, including Ford Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields -- likely the next CEO of Ford.\nWe (The Motley Fool's John Rosevear and Rex Moore) were there in Joe Louis Arena when it happened, and we can tell you that it was a very impressive event.\nTake a look, and then scroll down to leave us a comment with your thoughts on the new F-150.\nHundreds of journalists from around the world crowded the arena, and mobbed the stage afterward to get up-close looks at the new trucks.\nHe also gave some insights into Ford's expectations for profitability and spending in 2014."}
