WASHINGTON — President Obama pandered to stoner college bros yesterday by appearing on actor Zach Galifianakis’ bizarre Web talk show, “Between Two Ferns.”

Obama looked like he was once again commander-in-chief of his high school “Choom Gang,” as he traded deadpan wisecracks with the co-star of “The Hangover.”

“What’s it like to be the last black president?” Galifianakis asked the prez. Obama feigned shock.

“Seriously?” he said. “What’s it like for this to be the last time you ever talk to a president?”

Galifianakis continued: “Is it going to be hard in two years when you’re no longer president and people will stop letting you win at basketball?” Obama countered: “How does it feel having a 3-inch vertical leap?”

The president appeared on the show, which runs on the “Funny or Die” Web site, to sell ObamaCare to young adults.

Galifianakis, an outspoken pot-legalization advocate, listened with a glazed look as the president turned the jokey meeting serious with his ObamaCare pitch.

The actor interrupted the president, saying: “Is this what they mean by drones?”
