With a slightly dated nod to pop culture, Cruz responded, \u201cLet me quote the movie Jerry Maguire: You had me at hello,\u201d then went on to lambaste the June 26 marriage equality ruling as well as one the court made the day before, upholding federal subsidies for health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe saw last summer, in a period of 24 hours, two lawless decisions back to back,\u201d said the U.S. senator from Texas. \u201cFirst the Supreme Court rewrote federal law, ignored the text of Obamacare, in order to rewrite that statute and force that failed policy, that failed law, on millions of Americans. And then 24 hours later, five unelected judges ignored the Constitution and purported to tear down the marriage laws of all 50 states. Those decisions were fundamentally illegitimate, they were lawless, and they will not stand.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the conversation, Cruz called on evangelical Christians to vote, claiming they failed to turn out strongly in the past two presidential elections, resulting in a government \u201cadvancing a secular agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a federal government that is waging a war on life, a war on marriage, a war on religious liberty,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a federal government that is advancing a secular agenda that puts the ability of Bible-believing Christians to live our faith more and more in jeopardy and that is appeasing radical Islamic terrorism, in fact refuses even to acknowledge its name. And if you look at the federal government, you might say, \u2018Why do we have government attacking life, attacking marriage, attacking faith, attacking religious liberty?\u2019 Well, is it any wonder, when a majority of believers are staying home? If we allow nonbelievers to elect our leaders, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when our government doesn\u2019t reflect our values.\u201d\n\nIowa voters will state their preferences for the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees in caucuses to be held February 1.\n\nCaffeinated Thoughts, an Iowa-based conservative blog, posted video of the Cruz-Dobson conversation.
