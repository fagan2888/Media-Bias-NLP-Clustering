He suggests that it\u2019s a sign of weakness, because the GOP isn\u2019t willing or able to go after the big items like Medicare. But this begs the question, why does the inability to go after programs that really are problems (although the disability story isn\u2019t nearly as problematic as he thinks) mean that you should go after a program that isn\u2019t a problem? There\u2019s no significant money to be saved \u2014 if and when the economy recovers, SNAP will be back down to something like 0.25 percent of GDP.\n\nWell, I have a theory. Republicans know, just know, that there has been a huge expansion of government under Obama; witness Rand Paul\u2019s flabbergastedness (flabbergastnicity?) when I told him that public employment was down. The trouble is that the data don\u2019t say what they know must be true. Here\u2019s federal spending as a percentage of potential GDP:\n\nPhoto\n\nSo here\u2019s the thing about SNAP: it\u2019s one federal program that really has exploded in size in recent years, with the number of beneficiaries rising around 80 percent. Of course, it\u2019s exploded for a very good reason, namely a once-in-three-generations economic crisis, and the program has stayed large because our so-called recovery hasn\u2019t trickled down to the bottom half of the income distribution. But the right doesn\u2019t care about any of that; in food stamps, it gets to see what it wants to see \u2014 surging government spending! Millions of takers! And so food stamps become public enemy #2.\n\nNumber 1 is, of course, Obamacare, which really does represent a major expansion of the government\u2019s role. And that, perhaps, is where Cowen\u2019s weakness theory may come in: Republicans, frantic over their inability to kill health reform, may be trying to make themselves feel better by lashing out at the poor.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20130922141431, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 22, 2013", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Hating On Food Stamps ( 20130922 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Looking for takers in all the wrong places.", "title": "Hating On Food Stamps", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/hating-on-food-stamps/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Looking for takers in all the wrong places.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 22, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1379873671, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2013-09-22T18:14:31-04:00"}, "utime": 20130922181431, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20130922, "pdate": 20130922, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Looking for takers in all the wrong places.", "title": "Hating On Food Stamps", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/hating-on-food-stamps/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/hating-on-food-stamps/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Hating On Food Stamps", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab6d\"", "article_summary": "And so food stamps become public enemy #2.\nBut the right doesn\u2019t care about any of that; in food stamps, it gets to see what it wants to see \u2014 surging government spending!\nRepublicans know, just know, that there has been a huge expansion of government under Obama; witness Rand Paul\u2019s flabbergastedness (flabbergastnicity?)\nTyler Cowen wonders why Republicans have chosen to go after the food stamp program, which he concedes is actually pretty good.\nHe suggests that it\u2019s a sign of weakness, because the GOP isn\u2019t willing or able to go after the big items like Medicare."}
