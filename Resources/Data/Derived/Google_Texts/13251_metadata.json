After the highly publicized GOP debate on Thursday went as expected with Trump again taking center stage, it appears Icahn is willing to accept the GOP candidate\u2019s offer.\n\nJust several weeks ago, the 79-year old billionaire had declined Trump\u2019s offer for whatever reason. Icahn, famous for nearly forcing tech companies to restructure, was somewhat taken aback by Trump\u2019s Treasury Chief role, but his willingness to go along with Trump surprised everyone who knows the situation more intimately. Although Trump hasn\u2019t officially formed an economic plan of attack, he\u2019ll count on his business stability and job creation talents to get him through the toughest parts of debating. He\u2019s even stressed he\u2019ll \u201cstraighten out\u201d America\u2019s trillion dollar national debt, and has made it clear Obamacare would receive an overhaul for the ages \u2013 both of which are areas where Icahn could provide guidance and planning.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s campaign stats are rising by the week, Icahn\u2019s funds are falling. Icahn\u2019s stock, Icahn Enterprises (IEP), has tumbled 17 percent since January, right on the heels of 2014 abysmal stock performance which saw his shares get shaved by 30 percent. As 44 percent of Americas place economic impact atop their biggest needs list, putting someone in charge of our country\u2019s treasury with a history of bold moves could jeopardize the financial fabric which Obama was destined to sew \u2013 but has failed.\n\nDonald Trump is neither an advocate of minimum wage increases, nor a fan of rich folks getting by with slimmer tax rates. Since he\u2019s already stated he\u2019d prefer putting Wall Street heads in charge of turning our national economy around, putting Icahn in charge could actually be of incredible benefit to Americans. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would destroy 500,000 jobs, yet would lift millions of United States\u2019 poorer urban families out of financial oppression.\n\nEven after the presidential debate, which many thought painted Trump into corners, the real estate magnate has sustained his lead in polls. In fact, his misogynist commentary and no-holds barred approach to backlashes received from opposition seems to be increasing his lead in many preliminary polls. His approach to restoring American values, including the highly touted immigration reform subject, would make him the perfect candidate. Which means Icahn, who loves controversial subjects and knows the financial industry better than most, would make the perfect Treasury Chief.\n\n[Photo by Michael Nagle/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carl Icahn, an outspoken investor who loves giving unsolicited advice to tech firms, could become Treasury Chief if Donald Trump has his way.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Carl Icahn, an outspoken investor who loves giving unsolicited advice to tech firms, could become Treasury Chief if Donald Trump has his way.", "title": "Donald Trump Would Put Carl Icahn In Treasury Chief Role", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2321255/donald-trump-would-put-carl-icahn-in-treasury-chief-role/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GettyImages-56775025.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-09T17:03:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-09T17:18:13+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GettyImages-56775025.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-08-09T17:03:24+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential race,carl icahn,donald trump,gop candidate,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GettyImages-56775025.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Carl Icahn, an outspoken investor who loves giving unsolicited advice to tech firms, could become Treasury Chief if Donald Trump has his way."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ed0\"", "article_summary": "Already appointing cabinet members as if he\u2019s won the race, Donald Trump is preparing to appoint billionaire hedge fund guru Carl Icahn into a role fit for his expertise \u2013 treasury chief.\nIcahn, famous for nearly forcing tech companies to restructure, was somewhat taken aback by Trump\u2019s Treasury Chief role, but his willingness to go along with Trump surprised everyone who knows the situation more intimately.\nWhich means Icahn, who loves controversial subjects and knows the financial industry better than most, would make the perfect Treasury Chief.\nIcahn\u2019s stock, Icahn Enterprises (IEP), has tumbled 17 percent since January, right on the heels of 2014 abysmal stock performance which saw his shares get shaved by 30 percent.\nDonald Trump is neither an advocate of minimum wage increases, nor a fan of rich folks getting by with slimmer tax rates."}
