AL HUNT interviews White House counselor JOHN PODESTA: “When I asked him about [possibly chairing Hillary’s campaign] in an interview for ... ‘Charlie Rose’ ... he replied: ‘If she runs, as I hope she will, I will do whatever she asks me to do.’ ... Asked if he has spoken with Clinton about his role in a campaign, he replied, ‘I talk to her from time to time.’ There may be no one in Democratic circles who commands more respect than Podesta. His standing is similar that of James Baker.” http://bv.ms/1zpFMQA

--“Biden: Middle Class ‘Was Declining’ During Clinton Years” -- Washington Free Beacon Staff: “Speaking before the American Federation of Teachers, Biden [said:] ‘The fact is, the middle class started to get into trouble in the late ’80s ... All through the ’90s, with the exception of two years, the middle class was declining.” http://bit.ly/1sOdo66

THE BIG IDEA -- JOHN HARRIS, “The Dark Art of Political B.S.” -- the perils of long-range forecasting: “Decades ago branches of journalism and political science developed that tended to view politics through the metaphors of geology. There were long-term factors of class and partisan identity that were like tectonic plates. Every generation or so, an earthquake would come along ... and a new set of political assumptions would shape the next couple decades. I suspect ... that the fluid nature of modern life—the constancy of communication, more geographic and career mobility, weaker attachments to traditional institutions—means that politics simply moves faster. We should be studying it not as geography but as something more like meteorology. ...

“Yes, it’s true that Republicans face huge problems if they don’t improve their appeal among Hispanics and young people. But there is no reason to suppose the GOP will stand still, any more than Bill Clinton’s Democratic Party stood still in the 1990s when his party faced problems with voters who thought Democrats were too soft on crime and foreign policy. Republicans like New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez challenge the notion that the GOP can’t compete among women and Hispanics, just as Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is hoping to challenge the notion that the party can’t improve its appeal to young voters.” http://politi.co/14pzl6o

THE JUICE – New NRSC, DSCC executive directors:

--WARD BAKER at NRSC, per James Hohmann: “Baker is currently political director ... Kevin McLaughlin, a senior adviser at the NRSC, ... will also stay on, likely as deputy executive director. ... Baker is working out the final terms of his contract. An announcement could come ... next week. ... Baker served in the Marines before getting into politics. The Tennessee native got his start on Rep. Marsha Blackburn’s 2002 campaign, worked for Haley Barbour’s 2003 election as Mississippi governor and George W. Bush’s 2004 reelection campaign.” http://politi.co/1tTHzs5

--TOM LOPACH at DSCC, per Hohmann and John Bresnahan: “Lopach, a Helena native, has been ... chief of staff [to Montana Sen. Jon Tester, picked Thu. to chair the DSCC] since 2010. He was the DSCC’s finance director during the 2008 cycle under Sen. Chuck Schumer ... and ... was finance director for ... Ted Kennedy’s final 2006 reelection campaign in Massachusetts.” http://politi.co/1zY1y0T

OBAMACARE 2.0 (second round of open enrollment) BEGINS TODAY – “Obamacare's 'Burwellian' rollout,” by Jennifer Haberkorn: “Sylvia Mathews Burwell was brought in to run HHS with one big goal: make sure the second round of Obamacare goes a whole lot better than last year’s disaster. After months of distractions — Ebola, a border crisis, an unusual enterovirus that sickened hundreds of children — the new HHS secretary [is being praised] for her efficiency in managing the HHS behemoth. ‘It’s a very Burwellian, straightforward type of management structure,’ White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said.’” http://politi.co/1xqItna

--N.Y. Times 1-col. lead, “COST OF COVERAGE UNDER CARE ACT SET TO INCREASE: CHANGES VARY BY STATE -- G.O.P. Pounces on New Data as Enrollment Is Set to Resume,” by Robert Pear, Reed Abelson and Agustin Armendariz: “The Obama administration on Friday unveiled data showing that many Americans with health insurance bought under the Affordable Care Act could face substantial price increases next year — in some cases as much as 20 percent — unless they switch plans. The data became available just hours before the health insurance marketplace was to open to buyers seeking insurance for 2015. ...

“By the government’s count, 25 percent more insurers will be participating in the exchange next year, and consumers will have a choice of 40 different plans, on average, up from 31 this year.” http://nyti.ms/1sPKhQ5

SUNDAY’S PARADE MAGAZINE -- “43 on 41: George W. Bush's Heartfelt Tribute to Dad”: “The afternoon before [the 90 th birthday parachute] jump, I sat next to Dad on the porch of his beloved home at Walker’s Point, perched on a rocky outcropping over the Atlantic. I had been painting an ocean scene and was wearing cargo pants stained with oil paint. For a few peaceful minutes, we stared quietly at the sea. ‘What are you thinking about, Dad?’ I asked. ‘It’s just beautiful,’ he said, still looking out at the ocean. ... ‘Do those pants come in clean?’ I laughed, something I have been doing with my father all my life. His quip was typical. He was not nervous about his jump or his life. He was at peace. And he was sharing his joy with others.” http://bit.ly/14nXL00

WASHINGTON INC. – N.Y. Times, top of col. 5, “Cash Amplifies Call to Reshape Immigration: Liberal Groups Spent Over $300 Million,” by Julia Preston: “A vital part of that expansion has involved money: major donations from some of the nation’s wealthiest liberal foundations, including the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Open Society Foundations of the financier George Soros, and the Atlantic Philanthropies.

GREAT WEEKEND READS, curated by Daniel Lippman:

--“Extreme Wealth Is Bad for Everyone—Especially the Wealthy,” by Michael Lewis in The New Republic, reviewing Billionaires: Reflections on the Upper Crust by Darrell M. West (Brookings): “A body of quirky but persuasive research has sought to understand the effects of wealth and privilege on human behavior ... [O]ne study ... [found that] people driving expensive cars were four times more likely to cut in front of other drivers than drivers of cheap cars. ... The drivers in the cheap cars all respected the pedestrians’ right of way. The drivers in the expensive cars ignored the pedestrians 46.2 percent of the time ... [In] another study, the Berkeley researchers invited a cross section of the population into their lab .... Upon leaving ... the subjects passed a big jar of candy. The richer the person, the more likely he was to reach in and take candy from the jar—and ignore the big sign on the jar that said the candy was for ... children.” http://bit.ly/11oOIea West’s book on Amazon $16.11: http://amzn.to/1EM2CFa

--“Broken sleep,” by Karen Emslie in Aeon Magazine: “People once woke up halfway through the night to think, write or make love. What have we lost by sleeping straight through? ... All humans, animals, insects and birds have clocks inside, biological devices controlled by genes, proteins and molecular cascades. These inner clocks are connected to the ceaseless yet varying cycle of light and dark caused by the rotation and tilt of our planet. They drive primal physiological, neural and behavioural systems according to a roughly 24-hour cycle, otherwise known as our circadian rhythm, affecting our moods, desires, appetites, sleep patterns, and sense of the passage of time.” http://bit.ly/1GY8pcC

--“Fallen Arches: Can McDonald's get its mojo back?” by Fortune’s Beth Kowitt: “The world’s largest restaurant company is losing market share, losing sales, and suffering one heck of a corporate identity crisis. ... [T]he company has ... an existential [problem] ... It has risen to the top of the fast-food chain by being comfortably, familiarly, iconically ‘mass market’ and so ubiquitous ... Neither of these selling points, however, is as high as it was even a decade ago on Americans’ list of dining priorities. ... In the third quarter of 2014, while McDonald’s same-store sales were falling about 3%, those at Chipotle Mexican Grill, the big cheese of the burrito world, were soaring 20%.” http://for.tn/14nY2A8

--“The Knowledge, London’s Legendary Taxi-Driver Test, Puts Up a Fight in the Age of GPS,” by Jody Rosen in T Magazine: “The examination to become a London cabby is possibly the most difficult test in the world — demanding years of study to memorize the labyrinthine city’s 25,000 streets and any business or landmark on them. ... Its rigors have been likened to those required to earn a degree in law or medicine. It is without question a unique intellectual, psychological and physical ordeal, demanding unnumbered thousands of hours of immersive study, as would-be cabbies undertake the task of committing to memory the entirety of London, and demonstrating that mastery through a progressively more difficult sequence of oral examinations — a process which, on average, takes four years to complete, and for some, much longer than that.” http://nyti.ms/1GY8fSL

--“All Dressed Up For Mars and Nowhere to Go,” by Elmo Keep in Medium: “Mars One ... might have come to your attention when it announced via press release that it had received over 200,000 applications for the chance to be the first human being on the surface of Mars. Despite not being a space-faring agency, it claims that by 2025 it will send four colonists to the planet ... [Volunteers] will have to prove themselves adept and nimble learners, able to amass an enormous amount of new practical knowledge, not only in the high-pressure intricacies of spaceflight, but in learning how to perform rudimentary surgery and dentistry, how to recycle resources, how to take commands, and maintain a harmonious team dynamic for the rest of their natural lives.” http://bit.ly/1xYE2wL (h/t Longreads.com)

--“Alex From Target: The Other Side of Fame,” by NYT’s Nick Bilton: “Two weeks ago, 16-year-old Alex Lee was your run-of-the-mill teenager. ... But as everyone on social media now knows, something bizarre was about to happen to him online. A teenage girl from Britain said she randomly came across a Tumblr photo of Alex that was surreptitiously taken a week earlier. She thought Alex was cute and posted the picture on her Twitter account, @auscalum, with the caption ‘YOOOOOOOOOOO.’ But while Alex’s rise from high school student to global celebrity may be the stuff that teenagers dream of today, there is also a negativity to instant web celebrity ... For starters, Alex says he can barely go outside for fear of being accosted.” http://nyti.ms/1GYdhi7

-- “Why I Left United Airlines,” by Tim Wu in The New Yorker: “Modern American corporations rarely degrade service in bold, attention-getting ways. Rather, it is a kind of suffering by a thousand cuts, each individually unnoticeable but collectively defeating. On the ‘new’ United, seats got smaller as the airline jammed more people into the same tube; upgrades, to escape the sardine effect, seemed to become harder to book. The number of boarding groups began to resemble something like a caste system; ‘change fees,’ which have always been outrageous, grew higher ... while baggage fees soared to as high as a hundred dollars. The cross-country flights somehow seemed to all be on old, broken-down planes, while gate agents and flight attendants all just seemed crabbier.” http://nyr.kr/1zpFTvB

-- “Jon Stewart Gets Serious With 'Rosewater,’” by Bloomberg View’s Margaret Carlson: “Isn’t being able to make people laugh enough? Why does he have to go and get all serious? ‘I tell stories,’ he said [in an interview]. ‘... Making a movie is not an alien process to what we do on the show. Some stories need a longer narrative to be told, a cinematic structure. And, of course, a film is indelible. It lasts.’ ... [Iranian-Canadian Maziar] Bahari is Stewart’s kind of journalist; he put everything on the line to tell a life and death story. The other type are the ones Stewart ridicules daily for their herd mentality, their shallowness, for making a mountain out of a molehill to fill the news maw. We Washington reporters hop on a flight to Iowa to cover a candidate castrating a hog and feel as if we’re practicing journalism.” http://bv.ms/1pYwWsY Trailer: http://bit.ly/1ulDmEh
