The press has been suppressed, if not completely silenced, and the government-controlled media is ascendant.\n\nAs the Economist cleverly points out in its recent issue, the surest way to tell that there is an economic crisis in Russia right now is that there is no news about the economy on the television.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nThe path Russia takes in terms of its relationship with the West won\u2019t have an immediate or direct effect on the United States. The U.S. trade relationship with Russia is, as a percentage of GDP, trivial. However, a Russia that continues to isolate itself would damage U.S. trading partners in Europe, and be a net negative for the global economy.\n\nRelated: A Desperate Putin Makes a Private Sector Power Grab\n\nAt a time when the country\u2019s currency is plummeting in value and the government is contemplating huge spending cuts in order to keep its books balanced, media are treating the public to stories, such as this one from leading newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, about the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris.\n\nIt suggests (deep breath) that the United States orchestrated the attack in order to punish French President Francois Hollande for suggesting that international sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula might need to be dialed back.\n\nThe strategy seems clear. By casting Russia as the victim of shadowy conspirators abroad, the Putin regime is able to make a case that current and future economic privation is the fault of Russia\u2019s enemies and that Russians have a patriotic duty to come together in solidarity.\n\nThe Kremlin wants its citizens to replace their anger about their personal economic pain with nationalist anger about supposed attacks on Russia.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Woes Worsen as Russia-Backed Rebels Reportedly Kill Civilians\n\nThe question is: will it work?\n\nPutin himself has been stoking nationalist fervor for months, repeatedly invoking the greatness of Russia in defending both his decision to send troops into Crimea and, more vaguely, Russia\u2019s continued support for armed rebels in Ukraine\u2019s east, who have used Russian weaponry in attacks on both soldiers and civilians. In his year-end press conference, he cast Russia as beset on all sides by enemies wishing to \u201cstuff\u201d the Russian bear.\n\nTo that same end, despite an announcement yesterday that the government was considering 10 percent across-the-board spending cuts, Kremlin officials made it clear that the one institution that would be spared is the Russian military.\n\nAgain, the effort is to play to the country\u2019s pride and self-image \u2013 Russia as the global military power facing down legions of enemies around the globe.\n\nRelated: Oil Drop Further Rocks Putin\u2019s Economy\n\nHowever, while feeding the Russian people propaganda in order to get them to accept a second-world lifestyle was a relatively simple matter when Vladimir Putin was a young KGB agent, it may not be the case any longer.\n\nA generation ago, for example, Russian citizens were subject to travel restrictions and the government exerted tight control over foreign media.\n\nRecreating a Soviet-style system of misinformation in the 21st century, however, faces a few major roadblocks. The first, and most obvious, is the fact that information simply flows more freely across borders now than it did a generation ago, making it difficult to keep the Russian people in the dark about opinions \u2013 and facts \u2013 that conflict with the Kremlin party line.\n\nHowever, as China and North Korea demonstrate, heroic efforts by the government can still shut down much of the traffic in information about the outside word.\n\nRelated: Fallout from Obama\u2019s Russia Strategy Is Spreading Through Europe\n\nMore important is the fact that the Russian people have changed.\n\nFor generations prior to the fall of Communism in the 1990s, Russians saw little of the outside world. Young and middle-aged Russians today, though, have enjoyed a generation of freedom unknown to their grandparents. Foreign travel was common, and Moscow, rather than a drab city of state-run shops, at least until recently teemed with foreign luxury car dealerships, nightclubs, restaurants, and all the trappings of 21st century Western life.\n\nIn the 1980s, an ordinary Russian\u2019s experience of the West might have been limited to his grandfather\u2019s stories about driving the Third Reich back to Berlin through bombed out cities. In 2015, that experience is more likely to be memorialized in Facebook-posted pictures of his own Paris vacation.\n\nThose memories won\u2019t be erased, and will likely be top of mind for many Russians when they experience what economists are predicting for Russia\u2019s economic future.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Government Jails critic\u2019s Brother. Crushes Political Protest\n\nThe government, with dwindling income due to dramatic drops in oil prices, will slash spending on various services. More than most developed countries, government spending is a huge driver of the Russian economy, so the effect will be negative and pronounced.\n\nAccording to former Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, the spending cuts will manifest themselves in declines in the quality of education, healthcare, and workforce training, all of which will exacerbate an economic decline and hinder a recovery.\n\nAt the same time, the Russian people will see resources flowing unabated to the military.\n\nWhile this happens, ordinary Russians will likely continue to suffer. The value of the ruble is down by nearly half against global benchmark currencies this year, meaning that Russians\u2019 savings has lost much of its purchasing power when it comes to foreign goods. Additionally, consumers are being squeezed by high inflation, which is further constraining their ability to buy goods regardless of their origin.\n\nPutin promised that the millions of Russians living on government pensions need not worry, and last month he even promised a five percent increase in payments. However, with double-digit inflation, pensioners\u2019 purchasing power will still be reduced, not increased, in the coming year.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s New Storyline \u2013 Oil Shock Has a Silver Lining\n\nThis is not a recipe for public support, when the public in question has had a couple of decades to view the rest of the developed world as a generally welcoming place filled with opportunity for both profit and pleasure, not a capitalist hellscape.\n\nPutin can try his best to convince Russians that going back to beet soup and bread lines is their patriotic duty, but it will be an awfully hard sell.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin seems more and more intent on dragging Russia back into Soviet era through information control and nationalist urging.
