Viguerie, just returned from a trip to Israel, has added his name to the list of conservatives opposed to giving away the one major conservative victory of the 113th Congress \u2013 maintaining the spending reductions in the 2011 deal to raise the debt limit.\n\nThe text of the letter and the list of signers as of December 12, 2013, follows.\n\nConservative Leaders to Congress: Oppose Any Budget Deal That Raises Spending Levels or Increases Revenue\n\nAs budget negotiations between the House and Senate continue, we write to urge Congress to oppose any legislation that increases spending above current law or raises new federal revenue.\n\nAccording to reports, the House and Senate conference committee that was recently convened to negotiate the federal budget is considering a plan that would violate Congress' promise on discretionary spending caps and increase federal revenue. Legislation that raises federal revenue and spending levels is unacceptable to conservatives and the majority of Americans and should be rejected by Congress.\n\nThough conservatives support more spending restraint, the discretionary spending limits defined in the Budget Control Act represent a promise to the American people to marginally slow the growth of government. The budget conference committee represents an opportunity for Congress and President Obama to honor their bipartisan agreement; it is not a vehicle to break budget limits or increase revenue. Rather than searching for ways to abandon a bipartisan spending agreement, Congress should pass legislation that upholds the caps and then focus their energy on something productive, like stopping the train wreck that is Obamacare.\n\nWhile many have expressed legitimate concerns about the nature of the spending limits, Congress has the ability to repurpose the BCA's caps and limit other areas of discretionary spending as it deems prudent, such as protecting our national defense, without exceeding the $967 billion spending limit. Congress and the President have no excuse to violate their existing budget agreement. Conservatives cannot support any legislation that raises spending levels or increases revenue.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Honorable Edwin Meese III\n\nFormer Attorney General\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan\n\nThe Honorable David McIntosh\n\nFormer Member of Congress\n\nIndiana\n\nBrent Bozell\n\nChairman\n\nFor America\n\nMike Needham\n\nCEO\n\nHeritage Action for America\n\nTim Phillips\n\nPresident\n\nAmericans for Prosperity\n\nTony Perkins\n\nPresident\n\nFamily Research Council\n\nColin Hanna\n\nPresident\n\nLet Freedom Ring\n\nErick Erickson\n\nEditor-in-Chief\n\nRedState\n\nJenny Beth Martin\n\nCo-Founder\n\nTea Party Patriots\n\nMatt Kibbe\n\nPresident\n\nFreedomWorks\n\nAl Cardenas\n\nChairman\n\nAmerican Conservative Union\n\nAmy Kremer\n\nChairman\n\nTea Party Express\n\nDavid Bossie\n\nPresident\n\nCitizens United\n\nPenny Nance\n\nPresident\n\nConcerned Women for America\n\nDuane Parde\n\nPresident\n\nNational Taxpayers Union\n\nDavid Williams\n\nPresident\n\nTaxpayers Protection Alliance\n\nBill Walton\n\nChairman\n\nRappahannock Ventures LLC\n\nThe Honorable J.
