Reuters A couple looks at the New York skyline from New Jersey during the snowfall on December 10.

On Wednesday, Greater New York will see sunny skies and in very cold temperatures.

High pressure builds into the region from the west Tuesday night, followed by a cold front on Wednesday. This system enables the sun to reappear, but the day will be blustery and very cold. Temperatures will run around 15 degrees below normal with highs struggling to reach above freezing in most locations. Areas of coastal Connecticut and Long Island won’t see a high above 30 and across the region, wind chills are unlikely to climb out of the teens. These freezing conditions are guaranteed to keep any ice and snow on the ground for the rest of the week.

A cold front passes through the region on Wednesday evening, but no precipitation is expected, with the exception of a few flurries in far northwest Orange County. Lows Wednesday night will generally be in the lower teens inland to around 20 in New York City and northeastern New Jersey.

Dry but unseasonably cold weather continues across the tri-state area through the end of the week. Highs on Thursday will again have trouble reaching the freezing mark. Another storm is developing south of the mid-Atlantic states and, as of Tuesday, odds favor at least a period of snow or icy mix impacting Greater New York on Saturday night and Sunday.
