And political independent U. S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, 74, of Vermont, has been called an \u201cunlikely white-haired rock star.\u201dMeanwhile, Republican frontrunner, and business mogul Donald Trump, 69, has managed to avoid questions based on his age to date, largely because he is so controversial. However, he has not completely escaped the negative perception of him based on his age.Trevor Noah on The Daily Show (Jan. 5) mocked his New Year\u2019s Eve appearance on Fox stating, \u201cDonald Trump is the human embodiment of Times Square: Their both old, loud, flashy and full of garbage.\u201d Why \u201cold\u201d?How Americans view aging was brought up throughout the five-day 68th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) in Orlando, Fla., in November. The event attracted over 4,000 researchers in aging from around the world.During one press presentation, for example, The FrameWorks Institute shared a video of street interviews with people being asked to describe aging. For the most part, people highlighted the negative aspects of aging, focusing on illness and disability.GSA\u2019s opening keynote speaker, Ezekiel Emanuel, MD, brother of Democratic Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, was key in shaping Obamacare policies. He had shared similar -- though perhaps extreme -- views about aging, particularly the end years.In October 2014, The Atlantic published his article, \u201cWhy I Hope to Die at 75,\u201d in which he focused on some of the horrors of care at the end of life and the difficulties he expects might await him as he ages.\u201cDoubtless, death is a loss,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLiving too long is also a loss. It renders many of us, if not disabled, then faltering and declining, a state that may not be worse than death but is nonetheless deprived. It robs us of our creativity and ability to contribute to work, society, the world.\u201dEmanuel went on in the article, \u201cWe are no longer remembered as vibrant and engaged but as feeble, ineffectual, even pathetic.\u201dInterestingly, his view might be challenged by the vast amounts of energy emitted by most of the leading presidential contenders during debates and on the campaign trail. More directly, however, various health journalists, experts and academics have criticized Emanuel\u2019s stance, pointing to the larger issue of how Americans view aging.Even though Emanuel avoided mentioning his provocative ideas in his keynote speech, a panel of experts on aging zeroed in on his negative views of living beyond age 75 and how his ideas reflect U.S. culture, as well as ways in which to transform such narratives.Author Wendy Lustbader , a lecturer at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Social Work, said that some of the most important opportunities for growth occur when people are vulnerable, as they age. Further, she added, illness, frailty, disability and the approach of death can be \u201cvehicles for change,\u201d allowing people the opportunity to make sense of the past and make peace with their loved ones as they urgently desire to become complete.Emmanuel\u2019s article, Lustbader said, \u201c[gave] us a catalogue of fear.\u201d She countered his view by adding that the deprivation some people feel when aging can lead for some to creativity, which \u201cbrings up the needs of the soul.\u201dJennifer Sasser, who chairs the Department of Human Sciences at Marylhurst University in Portland, Ore., said what Emanuel described in his piece could really apply to people of any age, as all people are subject to frailty and pain.\u201cWe need to shift consciousness,\u201d said Sasser, who directs Maryhurst\u2019s Gerontology Program. \u201cThis is about being a human being.\u201dMembers of the audience contributed their views, some alluding to a fear and anxiety around death that is pervasive in U.S. culture. One woman mentioned that in dictionaries, the word \u201cgeriatric\u201d is defined in negative terms, suggesting nothing about health in older years.For example, the onlinedefines \u201cgeriatrics\u201d as \u201cthe process of growing old and the medical care of old people\u201d and adds the metaphorical definition, \u201cbeing old and outmoded (geriatric airplanes).\u201dEven though we might not be able to change those negative terms, Sasser added, we can expand on the positives of aging.When it comes to the leading presidential candidates, none are showing signs of decline from old age. Despite what voters might think of their views, these candidates are challenging and maybe even changing some stereotypes about aging.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ageism, presidential campaign, hillary clinton, bernie sanders, donald trump, ezekiele manuel, frameworks institute, gerontological society", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
