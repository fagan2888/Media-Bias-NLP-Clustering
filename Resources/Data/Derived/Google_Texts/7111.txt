A new report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation provides a sobering look at how children are faring in North Carolina.

The 2014 KIDS COUNT Data Book, which looks at 16 separate factors, ranks our state 38th in overall economic well-being, 28th in education, and 32nd in health.

The annual report concludes:

‘Although unemployment is slowly declining, job growth has been concentrated in low-wage sectors and in nonstandard employment that tends to be less stable and offer few or no benefits, such as health insurance and paid sick leave.

A stronger labor market and an increase in job quality, along with continued efforts to boost the education and training levels of low-income parents, would help to further reduce child poverty.’

In North Carolina, 26% of children lived in poverty in 2012, according to the new report.

Locally, the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle is working to help address this problem by creating long-term solutions to hunger for North Carolina’s low-income families. To learn more about this week’s special HungerFreeNC community movement, click here.
