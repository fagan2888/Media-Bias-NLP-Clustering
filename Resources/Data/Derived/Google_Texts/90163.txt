How adequate are the services provided under health insurance plans bought through the new Obamacare healthcare marketplace and are Atlanta residents getting all the benefits they should be? The answer might surprise you.

Signing up for medical insurance in the health marketplace means access to network health providers. But in exchange for having that access, the network controls almost every decision that is made – from the doctor a patient can see to the hospital a patient can visit.

Insurance companies operate this way in order to negotiate lower rates with network providers, which keeps costs down.

But what happens when that network has so few doctors it's almost impossible to get an appointment? Or if the closest in-network hospital is hours away?

Ensuring that networks not only have the right providers, but also enough of them, is known as "network adequacy." And that's a top focus of state lawmakers, who have formed a committee to look into healthcare delivery concerns here in Georgia.

The executive director of Georgians for a Healthy Future, Cindy Zeldin, was recently appointed to the study committee.

“When we sign up for health insurance we really want it to do two things,” Zeldin said during an interview on “A Closer Look.”

“We want it to provide some financial protection in the event that we get sick, but also it’s the gateway to the healthcare system and we want it to provide access to all the healthcare providers that we may need – either for preventive services or treatment.”

Zeldin discussed network adequacy, why some networks may be struggling to provide all the services required in an insurance policy, what it means for the patient and more on “A Closer Look.”
