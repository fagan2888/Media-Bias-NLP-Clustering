Impractical, but impossible to resist.\n\nCoupe glasses \u0097 the round, low bowl-shaped glasses used to serve Champagne or cocktails \u0097 are experiencing a revival. Their popularity is linked to the midcentury modern trend.\n\nWe are also seeing a lot more trumpet or V-shaped flutes available, and the variety of beer glasses is exploding to satisfy the sophisticated tastes of serious beer connoisseurs.\n\nCathy Pinkerton, of Nielsen's Exclusive Gifts, said she still owns the Fostoria coupe glasses that she bought in the '60s for $5 a stem.\n\n\"At the time, that was a lot of money,\" Pinkerton said, noting that the glasses were also called sherbet glasses because they are equally useful for a variety of desserts.\n\n\"That is what people used back then instead of the flute,\" Pinkerton said.\n\nBut she also has a set from the line of coupe glasses released by Waterford that Nielsen's sells at its two locations, 8138 S. Lewis Ave. and 3515 S. Peoria Ave.\n\n\"They have a tall, unique look. They just came out. They're pretty,\" Pinkerton said.\n\nGlasses with unique finishes \u0097 such as romantic etchings or metallic rims and designs \u0097 are also popular. So are glasses that have been totally infused with color, making them solid rather than clear, she said.\n\nThe varied and unique glassware used at The Vault downtown reflects the restaurant's retro style and the owner, Libby Auld's, slight obsession.\n\n\"The Vault has a crisp, clean environment; we wanted to use the glassware to bring a little bit of our personality out ... modern and eclectic,\" Auld said.\n\nHer glass collection spans the spectrum of color and includes other current trends such as gold rims and etchings.\n\n\"I really enjoy collecting them,\" Auld said. \"People joke that I just don't have enough room at home so I have to collect them here at work.\"\n\nOne of Auld's favorite places to find glasses that go with the restaurant's style is Retro Den, 2735 E. 15th St., she said.\n\n\"That is where we go when we are in a bind a need something right away,\" Auld said.\n\n\"But when I travel, I stop at all the antique shops on the road. That's where you can find some of the best deals.\"\n\nThe rapid expansion of beer glass choices has paralleled the growth of the craft beer movement, noted Tony Collins, head bartender with the McNellie's Group.\n\nGone are the days when the trusty pint glass was the only choice when sipping on a cold brew.\n\nWhen designing the bar at McNellie's South City, they made space for eight or nine different types of beer glasses to keep up with trend, Collins said.\n\nThis trend has migrated from countries such as Germany and Belgium where chalices and tulip-shaped glasses are used to showcase Belgian ales and IPAs. Teku glasses, with a broad base and angular design, have become increasing popular, also.\n\n\"For a long time, America has really been the land of pint glasses, but with the craft breweries producing more craft beers \u0097 and strong beers with 10 percent alcohol especially \u0097 it is good to have a smaller pour,\" Collins said.\n\nHe explained that the designs of the glasses also enhance the aroma of the beer.\n\n\"It is like a white wine glass that is meant to be paired with chardonnay. Different styles of beer are meant to be served in different glasses,\" Collins said.\n\nThe evolving glassware trends also reflect increasingly sophisticated consumers.\n\n\"People are becoming more savvy with their wines, beers and whiskeys,\" Collins said. \"And that means they are becoming more particular.\"", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "With the revival of retro stemware styles and rapid growth in European-inspired beer glasses available, barware is a booming trend.", "title": "In a glass by itself: Retro stemware, unique beer vessels lead barware boom", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/style/in-a-glass-by-itself-retro-stemware-unique-beer-vessels/article_47b1d355-042a-52a8-8bd7-94ef95f8a4e2.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/25/82513ebc-0489-5685-a4a8-c58fd700584e/52da36234ca70.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C327", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "With the revival of retro stemware styles and rapid growth in European-inspired beer glasses available, barware is a booming trend.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "glasses,barware,beer,glass,unique,auld,stemware,collins,retro,showcase,style,scene,scenehomepage1,scenelatest", "news_keywords": "glasses,barware,beer,glass,unique,auld,stemware,collins,retro,showcase,style,scene,scenehomepage1,scenelatest"}, "article_summary": "With the revival of retro stemware styles and rapid growth in European-inspired beer glasses available, barware is a booming trend.\nCoupe glasses \u0097 the round, low bowl-shaped glasses used to serve Champagne or cocktails \u0097 are experiencing a revival.\nThe rapid expansion of beer glass choices has paralleled the growth of the craft beer movement, noted Tony Collins, head bartender with the McNellie's Group.\nWe are also seeing a lot more trumpet or V-shaped flutes available, and the variety of beer glasses is exploding to satisfy the sophisticated tastes of serious beer connoisseurs.\nDifferent styles of beer are meant to be served in different glasses,\" Collins said."}
