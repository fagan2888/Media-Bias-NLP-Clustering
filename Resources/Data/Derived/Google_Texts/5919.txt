Just because we had a little election in which the Democrats got exactly what they deserved doesn’t mean President Obama is finished. Take his recent pronouncement in favor of net neutrality and Ted Cruz’s hissy fit about it. And, by the way, I cannot have a lower opinion of Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz is a word I cannot say. I cannot say what he is because I’m held to the same high standards on this blog that the editorial writers are. This could be a rule that goes back to the first publisher of The Hartford Courant Thomas Green in 1764, but I doubt it. It sounds to me like some rule a high-falutin’ college educated editor would make up. Cruz is calling net neutrality “Obamacare for the Internet” because he’s against all things Obama, although net neutrality fits right in with the GOP’s obsession with fewer regulations. Again, a bunch of hypocrites. The only people who could possibly be against net neutrality are the word I cannot say Republicans. Read about the details here: http://bit.ly/1oD3Lej
