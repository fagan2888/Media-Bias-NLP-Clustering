Her response is telling. The Guardian reports:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous that Paul would sue not only the school but one of my past professors for allowing me to make an art piece,\u201d Sulkowicz said in an email to the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that he would read it as a \u2018bullying strategy\u2019, especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation, when really it\u2019s just an artistic expression of the personal trauma I\u2019ve experienced at Columbia. If artists are not allowed to make art that reflect on our experiences, then how are we to heal?\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that Sulkowicz publicly accused Nungesser of choking and raping her. The university cleared him, and the police declined to file charges due to a lack of reasonable suspicion. Deprived of justice (in her view), Sulkowicz then received permission from a faculty adviser to conduct a performance art project\u2014dubbed the \u201cMattress Project (Carry That Weight)\u201d\u2014which involved her carrying her mattress to class in protest of Nungesser\u2019s continued presence on campus. She denounced him by name, in violation of certain privacy policies. Nungesser\u2019s lawsuit blames the university for endorsing these efforts.\n\nWhether or not the art project\u2014and the university\u2019s sponsorship of it\u2014is permissible under civil rights law is indeed the point of the lawsuit. But I can\u2019t understand why Sulkowicz would bother addressing this aspect of the dispute, when her position (at least previously) was that Nungesser brutally raped her. If that\u2019s true, it trumps any disagreement over artistic expression. If that\u2019s true, her actions were justified, regardless.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Lawsuit targets Columbia U., not Emma Sulkowicz", "title": "Mattress Girl Defends Right to \u2018Artistic Expression\u2019 in Response to Lawsuit Over Rape Claims", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/04/25/mattress-girl-defends-right-to-artistic", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14300030986162.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lawsuit targets Columbia U., not Emma Sulkowicz", "creator": "@robbysoave", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14300030986162.jpg", "title": "Mattress Girl Defends Right to \u2018Artistic Expression\u2019 in Response to Lawsuit Over Rape Claims", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-04-25T23:15:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "If that\u2019s true, it trumps any disagreement over artistic expression.\nOn Friday, Emma Sulkowicz addressed Paul Nungesser\u2019s lawsuit against Columbia University, which accuses the university administration of aiding her gender-based \u201charassment campaign\u201d against him.\nIf that\u2019s true, her actions were justified, regardless.\nNungesser\u2019s lawsuit blames the university for endorsing these efforts.\nWhether or not the art project\u2014and the university\u2019s sponsorship of it\u2014is permissible under civil rights law is indeed the point of the lawsuit."}
