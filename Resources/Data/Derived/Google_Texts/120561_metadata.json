The Superticket will be honored at AMC Theatres and available for purchase on Comcast\u2019s Fandango.com.\n\nThe original \u201cAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\u201d opened in 2004 and grossed a healthy $85.3 million before enjoying a long shelf life thanks to catchphrases and characters that have become some of Mr. Ferrell\u2019s most popular trademarks. The sequel follows Burgundy, a San Diego news anchor lacking self-awareness, as he and his team try their hand at a 24-hour news channel.\n\nThe announcement marks a significant step in Hollywood\u2019s experimentation with premium-priced tickets that include special perks like early screenings or digital downloads. Paramount is the only Hollywood studio to have experimented with such offerings domestically, charging $50 over the summer at five U.S. theaters for a \u201cMega Ticket\u201d to \u201cWorld War Z.\u201d\n\nMega Ticket buyers got to see the Brad Pitt zombie movie two days before its national release and received a digital download when it hit home video. The package also included a poster, small popcorn and branded 3-D glasses. In its limited offering, the program was a success: four of the five theaters that opened for Mega Ticket showings to \u201cWorld War Z\u201d were at capacity, and a fifth was filled to 80%. Executives at Time Warner\u2019s Warner Bros. have said the studio plans to offer a bundled ticket promotion on a movie at the end of this year or in early 2014.\n\nUntil now, nationwide rollouts of bundled theatrical tickets appeared only in Canada as part of a program that the country\u2019s main exhibitor, Cineplex Inc., has done on three films this year. Supertickets at Cineplex tie theatrical tickets to subsequent digital downloads, allowing studios to consolidate marketing budgets and commit moviegoers to owning a home video option before they leave the theater. For a Superticket tied to the summer release \u201cThe Smurfs 2,\u201d Cineplex tied an in-theater ticket with a download of the original film in the franchise from Sony Corp.\u2019s Sony Pictures Animation.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Paramount Pictures is offering the first-ever nationwide \u201cSuperticket\u201d in the U.S. on \u201cAnchorman 2: The Legend Continues,\u201d giving moviegoers the chance to pay extra and see the Will Ferrell sequel before its wide release.", "title": "Want to See \u2018Anchorman 2\u2019 Early?
