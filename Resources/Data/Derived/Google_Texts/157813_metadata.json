It also would renew the popular Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and provide $7.2 billion for community health centers \u2014 crucial to both rural and urban areas where doctors are scarce \u2014 over two years.\n\nThe compromise between Mr. Boehner and Ms. Pelosi had something for everyone to dislike. Democrats for the most part were not happy about the premium increases and the fact that the children\u2019s health program extension lasts two years rather than four. And some Republicans were displeased that over half the cost of the package, which is estimated to total $200 billion over 10 years, was not paid for.\n\nBut many Senate Democrats have expressed opposition to the bill because they believe the measure codifies abortion restrictions beyond the longstanding language already in many health care spending laws.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said. Over the weekend, several Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, led by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, expressed distress about the bill. \u201cWe want to be clear that any legislation of this magnitude sent to the Senate must be balanced,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, our current understanding of what the House is negotiating does not sufficiently pass that test.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Reid took up the fight as well. \u201cI\u2019ll stand up for women against Republican efforts to codify and expand the scope of Hyde restrictions,\u201d he wrote in a Twitter message on Friday, referring to the Hyde Amendment, which generally prohibits taxpayer funds from being used for abortions. On Tuesday, he said he was waiting to read the bill.\n\nFor their part, House Democrats, now well accustomed to life in the minority, said their Senate colleagues ought to embrace the bipartisan deal. Abortion rights advocates in the House also pushed back on the idea that the measure imposes additional restrictions.\n\n\u201cWe will be supporting this bipartisan compromise,\u201d said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, and Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado, in a joint statement. \u201cAnd we encourage other members of the Pro-Choice Caucus to do the same.\u201d\n\nSince the 1970s, Congress has imposed restrictions on the use of federal money for abortions. A day after signing the Affordable Care Act in 2010, President Obama issued an executive order stating that money provided in the law to community health centers generally could not be used for abortion services, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered.\n\nMr. Obama had promised to issue the order as part of his effort to win the support of several anti-abortion congressional Democrats whose votes were needed for passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDaniel R. Hawkins Jr., a senior vice president of the National Association of Community Health Centers, which represents 9,000 clinics around the country, said he was perplexed by the furor.\n\n\u201cI do not know of a single community health center that has performed a single abortion any time anywhere in my 45 years in the business of working with community health centers,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said. But he added, \u201cCommunity health centers provide prenatal care, delivery services and postpartum care to half a million women a year.\u201d\n\nMost Senate Republicans are expected to support the measure. \u201cI think we have to bite the bullet,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cI understand Pelosi is taking this quite personally.\u201d\n\nShould the bill receive a strong vote from both parties on Thursday in the House, Senate Democrats will be under pressure to help push it over the line. \u201cFor an issue that has been plaguing us for years,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, \u201cif there is a bipartisan compromise that comes out of the House, it deserves a look.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHowever, nearly a dozen Democrats expressed skepticism. \u201cThe Democrats are going to stick together here,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you say yes to doctors and no to 10 million children.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150324204315, "twitter": {"description": "Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and other Democrats have begun to undermine what was poised to
