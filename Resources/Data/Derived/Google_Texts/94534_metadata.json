She is a Democrat who has been in the Indiana legislature for 24 years. This week she accused an 18-month-old boy of being a racist.\n\nWhen race becomes the explanation for everything, no one is safe from accusations of racism. Even innocent little children. Don Surber , the eagle-eyed chronicler of the absurdities of contemporary politics, highlights what he calls a \u201chorrible woman\u201d who has been in the Indiana state legislature for 24 years and cannot see anything but race as the explanation for the most commonplace of child-like behavior.\n\nInstead of treating the young McMillian lad as a normal child, Summers accused him of the cardinal sin of our age. Just because of his race. If that is not racism, I would like to know what is. We are lectured that black people have no power so they cannot be racist. To an 18 month old, a 56 year old has all the power in the world.\n\nRacism, we have been endlessly lectured, causes people to deny the humanity of others based on their skin color. Humanity, in its child phase, includes a healthy dose of shyness and even fear of strangers. Given the hazards of childhood, that may be an occasionally healthy response.\n\n\"He (the toddler) looked at me like I was a monster and turned around and cried. And I told him (McMillin) you need to introduce your child to some people that are dark-skinned so he will not be scared.\"\n\nDuring a debate on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- which surprisingly she opposes -- Vanessa Summers turned on Republican Jud McMillin\u2019s baby boy. She said , \"I love his little son, but he\u2019s scared of me because of my color \u2014 and that\u2019s horrible.\" Really? Maybe he's scared of her because she is a big woman with a loud mouth. Nope, it turns out he is shy around strangers. Jud McMillin had to defend his son against her implication that the lad is a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The father said: \u201cIf he reacted the same way he reacts with anybody brand new, he buries his head in his dad\u2019s shoulder. Whoever it is, it\u2019s what he does. He\u2019s an 18-month-old kid; he\u2019s in a new environment up here in the place like the Statehouse but doesn\u2019t know anybody. I honestly don\u2019t remember anything out of the ordinary.\u201d\n\nWhen race becomes the explanation for everything, no one is safe from accusations of racism. Even innocent little children.
