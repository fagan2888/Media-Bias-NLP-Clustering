WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) — We told you last month about an event happening the weekend before Easter and Saturday it was on as expected.

Peggy’s Passion was started by Ashley Patterson after her sister Peggy passed away in January. Peggy’s passion was to make those less fortunate feel beautiful by giving them a hair cut before Easter and to motivate them to attend church.

With the support from Vigilant Hope, Charlie Graingers, friends and family, Patterson said the event was a success.

People filled the building on Willard Street to get a hot meal, a blessing bag, and a free hair cut, all in honor of Peggy.

“I am just overwhelmed by the fact that people will give unselfishly,” said Patterson. “I thought it was going to be a lot of hard work, but will all of the helping hands, it was perfect.”

Volunteers and friends of Peggy’s offered their Saturday to help whoever walked in and needed assistance.

People who needed clothes to wear next Sunday for Easter also had the opportunity to pick out an outfit free of charge.
