What did all that money buy? A lot of false and misleading TV ads.\n\nOnce again, we had no shortage of material for our annual Whoppers article. The candidates and their increasingly well-financed allies flooded the airwaves with ads accusing one another of dishonoring veterans, slashing Medicare benefits, threatening Social Security and lining their pockets with ill-gotten gains.\n\nThe facts too often did not support the over-the-top rhetoric used by both sides.\n\nThere were repeats from years past, including one that made our Whoppers list in 2006, as well as new twists on perennial topics, such as abortion and taxes. One Democrat claimed his opponent \u201cproposed making women criminals for having an abortion,\u201d even though the bill his opponent co-sponsored clearly stated a woman could not be prosecuted in \u201cthe death of her unborn child.\u201d A Republican boasted that he \u201csaved\u201d 99 percent of taxpayers from \u201cObama\u2019s tax increases,\u201d even though he could only credibly claim to have \u201csaved\u201d at most 2 percent.\n\nFor these and other examples of this year\u2019s most common and wackiest misstatements, please read on to the Analysis section.\n\nAnalysis\n\nImmigration Imagination\n\nBy now, it\u2019s routine for opponents of an immigration overhaul to yell \u201camnesty\u201d at any supporter of a bill that includes a path to citizenship. There were many examples of that in this campaign cycle, too. But some candidates got more imaginative this year when it came to using the immigration issue as a blunt political weapon.\n\nFor example, in the Republican primary in North Carolina\u2019s 7th Congressional District, David Rouzer claimed Woody White is \u201cpart of a group that is pushing for amnesty.\u201d Really? The short answer is: No. The long answer is more entertaining: White belongs to a lawyer\u2019s association that advocated for driver\u2019s licenses to be issued to immigrants who are in the country illegally, so they can purchase car insurance. But that\u2019s not amnesty and, even if it was, White doesn\u2019t even share the group\u2019s position on driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nWe also wrote about false \u201camnesty\u201d claims in Republican Senate primaries in Georgia and Mississippi. But Republicans weren\u2019t the only ones to get creative on the issue of \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mary Landrieu claimed in a TV ad that she \u201cvoted nine times to block amnesty.\u201d She didn\u2019t, of course. No one proposed legislation that would have given blanket legal status to those living in the U.S. illegally, and no votes were taken. Her tortured logic: The immigration system amounts to \u201cde facto amnesty,\u201d so her support for a comprehensive immigration bill that included a path to citizenship amounted to votes to \u201cblock amnesty.\u201d\n\nThere were some immigration chestnuts, too.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee served up a vintage Whopper (circa 2006) in a TV ad saying Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor \u201cvoted to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants.\u201d Nobody proposed paying benefits to those in the country illegally \u2014 not until and unless they gain legal status. Pryor voted in 2006 to kill a Republican amendment that would have changed current law to prevent legal immigrants from getting credit toward future Social Security benefits based on taxes paid while working in the U.S. illegally. Ten Republicans, including 2008 presidential nominee John McCain, voted against changing current law, too. We first debunked this claim in October 2006, and later put the claim on our list of the \u201cWhoppers of 2006.\u201d\n\nDueling \u2018Amnesty\u2019 Claims in N.C., April 30\n\nKingston\u2019s False \u2018Amnesty\u2019 Connection, July 17\n\nTwisting Cochran\u2019s Record, May 23\n\nPlaying Politics with Immigration, Sept. 17\n\nHeaded for the Hall of Shame, Aug. 20\n\nQuestionable Ethics Charges\n\nCampaigns design attack ads to make voters think the worst of the opposing candidate, and sometimes those attacks are personal.\n\nIn Michigan\u2019s 4th Congressional District Republican primary, state Sen. John Moolenaar accused businessman Paul Mitchell of \u201clining his pockets with Obama\u2019s stimulus.\u201d On the screen, viewers see stacks of bills and the words: \u201cMitchell took $100,000 from Obama\u2019s stimulus.\u201d The Moolenaar ad cited an unimpeachable source for the claim: recovery.gov, the government website for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. But there\u2019s a lot less here than meets the eye. Michigan received funding to retrain laid-off workers, some of whom signed up for classes at a medical education center Mitchell once headed. The stimulus money helped pay for the tuition of laid-off workers who were seeking training in careers such as dental assistant and pharmacy technician; it did not go to line Mitchell\u2019s pockets.\n\nIn another GOP primary, this one in Pennsylvania\u2019s 9th District, Rep. Bill Shuster accused his tea party-backed challenger, Art Halvorson, of \u201clining his pockets with taxpayer subsidies.\u201d The ad said: \u201cHis farm in Iowa got half a million dollars.\u201d That was not the case at all. Halvorson rents property to farmer Jon Charles Jacobson, who has received $423,019 worth of USDA subsidies over 18 years. Jacobson received those subsidies, not Halvorson. And Jacobson told us he farms 700 acres and only a fraction of the subsidies he received came from farming that was done on Halvorson\u2019s 40-acre property.\n\nIn the general election, the conservative Ending Spending Action Fund attacked Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen\u2019s ethics by claiming she profited \u201cfrom her votes,\u201d and specifically accusing her husband of engaging in \u201ca shady stock deal\u201d and the New Hampshire senator of \u201ca conflict of interest.\u201d As a result of this family conspiracy, the ad says, Shaheen\u2019s \u201cwealth has surged while in public office.\u201d The facts are far less tantalizing. The ad\u2019s claims all stem from her vote for the stimulus \u2013 which all Senate Democrats supported \u2013 and the fact that her husband had a small financial stake in a company that received a $77,715 stimulus grant. The kicker: The Shaheen family\u2019s estimated net worth had actually declined since she took office in January 2009. And the Shaheen campaign said her husband\u2019s stock option in the company expired, so the family did not earn a dime from the \u201cshady stock deal.\u201d\n\nIn the Arkansas gubernatorial race, the Republican Governors Association claimed the Democratic nominee, former Rep. Mike Ross, got a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d when he sold his family-owned pharmacy to a campaign donor in 2007. The ad cited a news story that was based largely on an independent appraisal of Ross\u2019 pharmacy by Adam Guthrie Jr. The ad quoted Guthrie from a 2009 news story: \u201cYou can buy half the town for $420,000.\u201d But Guthrie\u2019s appraisal of the Ross pharmacy was discredited by state regulators, and Guthrie surrendered his license in 2010 rather than face disciplinary action by the Arkansas Appraiser Licensing & Certification Board for his appraisal of the Ross property. Also, the House ethics committee cleared Ross of any wrongdoing, saying the buyer paid fair market value for the pharmacy. The ad ignored all that.\n\nMisleading Michigan GOP Primary Voters, July 31\n\nScandalous Ad in New Hampshire Race, Aug. 28\n\nStretching the Facts in Pennsylvania, March 28\n\nAnother Arkansas Whopper, Sept. 3\n\nSenior Scare\n\nThis year, we likened claims designed to scare seniors to ghost stories \u2014 both frightening and fanciful. And they were plentiful, too.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2014, $50 million had been spent on TV ads that mentioned Medicare, with Democrats outspending Republicans nearly 2 to 1, according to Kantar Media Intelligence\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. That\u2019s about 112,000 spots, and the numbers don\u2019t even include ads about Social Security, the other major senior-scare topic.\n\nIn many cases, the claims were the same old scare tactics. In several Senate and House races, Democrats claimed Republicans would \u201cend the Medicare guarantee,\u201d a reference to the candidates\u2019 support for Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s Medicare plan and a version of the \u201cend Medicare\u201d whopper that has been around since 2011. Ryan\u2019s plan wouldn\u2019t end the guarantee of Medicare, or Medicare benefits, as some ads claimed. Instead, it proposed phasing in a government-subsidy program in which future beneficiaries pick from traditional Medicare or private insurance plans, which must offer the same benefits as traditional Medicare.\n\nOther Democratic ads, such as one from Alison Lundergan Grimes attacking Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell in the Kentucky Senate race, recycled the outdated claim that Republicans supporting Ryan\u2019s plan would increase Medicare costs by $6,000 per beneficiary. That\u2019s based on a Congressional Budget Office analysis of Ryan\u2019s 2011 plan. Ryan\u2019s subsequent proposals were more generous in terms of the growth of subsidies, and his current proposal is actually modeled on a plan that CBO says would lower seniors\u2019 premiums and costs by 6 percent on average. The CBO also now says its 2011 report was a \u201crough analysis\u201d based on assumptions that have proven invalid. Other Democratic claims exaggerated the impact Ryan\u2019s plan would have on seniors\u2019 prescription drug costs.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, continued to push the old, misleading claim that the Affordable Care Act would cut Medicare by $716 billion. That\u2019s a reduction in the future growth of spending over 10 years, not a slashing of the current budget. The National Republican Congressional Committee led the charge on this talking point, making the claim in ads in several House races. Most of the reduction in Medicare spending is in the growth of future payments to hospitals, a move that extends the life of the Medicare trust fund.\n\nOn Social Security, an ad from Sen. Landrieu in Louisiana claimed that her Republican challenger, Rep. Bill Cassidy, voted to cut Social Security benefits \u201cto pay for a millionaire\u2019s tax cut.\u201d No, he didn\u2019t. That\u2019s a reference to a Republican Study Committee budget resolution that called for using a different method of calculating cost-of-living increases and raising the retirement age. The \u201csavings\u201d from the cost-cutting measures would prolong the life of the Social Security trust funds \u2014 not pay for tax cuts. President Obama proposed the same change in cost-of-living calculations and correctly said it would \u201cimprove Social Security solvency.\u201d\n\nPolitical ads designed to scare seniors to garner their votes usually include images of elderly men and women, even though the claims being made pertain to proposed changes that wouldn\u2019t affect seniors today. In the Arkansas Senate race, for example, an ad from Crossroads GPS attacking Pryor showed an image of a senior man while saying the Democratic incumbent \u201csuggested raising the retirement age\u201d for Social Security. He did \u2014 but for those who are now teenagers, not the man pictured.\n\nMidterm Medicare Mudslinging, Oct. 3\n\nMore Senior Scare in Arkansas, Aug. 22\n\nSocial Security Scare in Louisiana, Aug. 7\n\nMedicare Ghost Stories, July 9\n\nOld Medicare Claims in Arkansas Senate Race, Feb. 21\n\nCoal-Fired Whoppers\n\nThe whoppers in Kentucky and West Virginia were often fueled by America\u2019s No. 1 energy source, coal.\n\nThe House Majority PAC, a super PAC dedicated to returning the Democrats to power in the House, got things started early \u2014 way back in March \u2014 with a TV ad in West Virginia\u2019s 3rd District that falsely claimed Republican Evan Jenkins \u201cvowed to repeal black lung benefits.\u201d Jenkins vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, not end black lung benefits. A repeal of the ACA would make it more difficult for some miners and surviving spouses to prove eligibility for the Federal Black Lung Benefits Program. But that would not repeal the benefits, which were created under a separate law.\n\nSix months later, Rep. Nick Rahall doubled down on the black lung benefits claim. His campaign ran an ad saying Jenkins pledged to \u201ctake away\u201d black lung benefits. \u201cWhen I hear Evan Jenkins say that he\u2019s gonna take away our black lung benefits, it just bothers me to no end,\u201d a coal miner said in the ad. Jenkins said no such thing. To the contrary, Jenkins says he is \u201cfirmly opposed to any cuts to the Federal Black Lung Benefit Program.\u201d Rahall\u2019s campaign was putting words in Jenkins\u2019 mouth.\n\nIn the Kentucky Senate race, Grimes accused McConnell and his wife of \u201cpersonally\u201d taking \u201c$600,000 from anti-coal groups.\u201d Viewers wouldn\u2019t know this from the ad, but Grimes was primarily talking about money from Wells Fargo. Yes, the bank. Elaine Chao, McConnell\u2019s wife and a former secretary of labor, sits on the Wells Fargo board of directors \u2014 for which she has been paid $684,000 over the last three years. It\u2019s true that Wells Fargo \u2014 five years before Chao joined the board \u2014 decided not to extend credit to mountaintop removal projects or to coal companies that receive a majority of their coal production from mountaintop removal. But it\u2019s also true that the bank still lends billions to coal companies. In fact, the environmental Sierra Club gave it a \u201cD\u201d rating this year for its involvement in financing coal-fired power plants in 2013.\n\nNot to be outdone, the McConnell campaign claimed to show \u201cshocking\u201d video evidence from Grimes\u2019 \u201cown staff\u201d that proves \u201cGrimes is lying\u201d about her support for coal. Spoiler alert: There is no smoking gun. None of those featured in the ad is a paid staffer with the Grimes campaign, and all of them are expressing their personal opinions \u2014 not revealing campaign strategy. The Grimes supporters were surreptitiously videotaped by conservative activist James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Project Veritas Action Fund as they were meeting with undercover actors who posed as liberals concerned about Grimes\u2019 coal-friendly statements. The McConnell ad says \u201cGrimes is lying,\u201d but ignores the possibility that the supporters shown in the video are just telling the undercover actors what they think the actors want to hear.\n\nBogus Attack in Coal Mine Country, March 19\n\nDoubling Down in West Virginia, Sept. 16\n\nKentucky Coal Connections, Oct. 7\n\nNo Proof of \u2018Lying,\u2019 Oct. 15\n\nObamacare\n\nWhat list of campaign whoppers would be complete without claims about Obamacare? In this election, we saw efforts to paint Republicans as supporters of the Affordable Care Act, even though they weren\u2019t. And, as in past elections, we saw conservatives offering misleading attacks on the law.\n\nIn the most interesting twist, the Democratic Senate Majority PAC ran an ad that could have been mistaken for a product of the Koch brothers from the way it disparaged Obamacare. The TV spot claimed that Cassidy, the Republican running for the Senate in Louisiana, sponsored a bill while in the state Legislature to create \u201cgovernment-run health care\u201d in Louisiana. Cassidy did nothing of the sort. His 2007 bill, which never made it out of committee, called for setting up a state insurance exchange to serve as a clearinghouse for insurers and potential customers. The ad also claimed Cassidy argued for \u201cautomatic Obamacare registration,\u201d but he actually called for repealing the ACA and enrolling the uninsured in a scaled-back GOP alternative.\n\nIn Georgia\u2019s 1st Congressional District, Bob Johnson and Buddy Carter \u2013 who were rivals for the GOP nomination \u2013 ran deceptive ads in which each portrayed the other as a closet fan of Obamacare. A Johnson TV ad quoted Carter as saying Obamacare is \u201cnot so bad.\u201d Carter said that \u201csome of the things that have happened so far are not so bad,\u201d but he immediately added that \u201cthe worst part is yet to come.\u201d Carter, meanwhile, blasted Johnson for \u201cmembership in and endorsement from groups that support Obamacare.\u201d Dr. Bob Johnson is a member of the American Medical Association, but he disagrees with the AMA on this issue. Needless to say, both have called for repeal of the law.\n\nThe Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity made canceled insurance policies a theme of its ads, with one series of TV spots against Democratic senators claiming, \u201cMillions of people have lost their health insurance.\u201d Insurance companies did discontinue policies that had covered millions who bought the plans directly, rather than through an employer. Those plans didn\u2019t meet the minimum benefit standards of the law. But those policyholders didn\u2019t lose the ability to have insurance. In most cases, insurers offered them an alternative plan, and in other cases, individuals could buy coverage on state or federal marketplaces, many with the help of federal subsidies. In fact, there is evidence that far more have gained coverage than had their policies canceled.\n\nOther Republican ads claimed that premiums or health costs were \u201cskyrocketing\u201d under the ACA. That\u2019s misleading. Employer-sponsored premiums, where most Americans have coverage, have been growing at historically low rates in the past few years, as have overall health care costs. Premiums for those who buy their own private insurance will go up or down, in some cases significantly, depending on individual circumstances: For instance, those with health conditions would likely pay less than they did when their health status was a pricing factor, and the reverse is likely the case for healthy individuals.\n\n\u2018Cassidycare?\u2019 Come On! July 11\n\nWho Supports Obamacare in Georgia Race? July 16\n\nObamacare Ad Onslaught, April 11\n\nDishonoring Veterans\n\nDemocrats and Republicans tried to capitalize on public anger over the VA hospitals scandal by wrongly accusing their opponents of neglecting veterans by voting to cut their benefits or skipping important hearings on veterans-related issues to raise campaign cash.\n\nBack in June, the House Majority PAC accused California Republican Doug Ose of voting \u201cto slash veterans benefits by $15 billion\u201d in 2003, but actually he voted for a nonbinding budget resolution that proposed a 5.4 percent increase in new spending authority for veterans benefits and services for fiscal year 2004. Democrats claimed the bill contained a $15 billion cut because the House Republicans\u2019 budget proposed a smaller increase in spending authority for veterans benefits than President Bush\u2019s budget. Bush had called for a 6.6 percent increase compared with the 5.4 percent contained in the House measure.\n\nAfter that, the Senate Majority PAC and Patriot Majority USA aired an identical TV ad making the inaccurate claim that Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican, \u201cvoted for a plan that would cut veterans benefits.\u201d The ad was referring to a February 2012 vote related to the Baseline Reform Act of 2012, a Republican-sponsored bill that would have changed the budget process in a way that may or may not have resulted in budget cuts. Under the bill, baseline budget projections would not be adjusted for inflation. But the bill alone would not have resulted in automatic cuts to veterans benefits. Congress would still need to decide how much to spend above or below the baseline. As the Congressional Budget Office said in an analysis of the bill: \u201cAny impact on the budget would depend on the extent of future legislative actions.\u201d\n\nThose ads aired before former Republican Rep. Bobby Schilling ran a TV spot featuring four Army and Navy veterans scolding Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos for $6 billion in cuts to \u201cveterans benefits\u201d that never happened. What Bustos initially voted for last December was a bipartisan budget to avert another government shutdown that also reduced future cost-of-living adjustments to the pensions of working-age military retirees by cutting spending by an estimated $6.2 billion over 10 years, beginning in fiscal year 2016. But the pension cut quickly drew fire from military and veterans groups, and members of the Senate and the House, including Bustos, voted weeks later to repeal the cut and restore the old cost-of-living formula for all who had signed up for military service prior to 2014.\n\nAnd Concerned Veterans for America got in on the deception with an ad that falsely claimed Iowa Rep. Bruce Braley \u201cskipped an important VA reform hearing to attend three fundraisers.\u201d In fact, none of the three fundraisers that Braley attended was scheduled at the same time as the House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee hearing that he missed that day. The Braley campaign has said that the congressman missed the VA committee hearing because he was attending a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing that was taking place at roughly the same time. The official transcript shows Braley was present for the oversight hearing. But it is not known for how long, and his campaign wouldn\u2019t say.\n\nMoldy Baloney About Vets\u2019 Benefits, June 5\n\nDemocratic Assault on Cassidy\u2019s Record, Sept. 3\n\nNo Cuts for Military Vets, Sept. 18\n\nBraley\u2019s VA Hearing Attendance Under Attack, Aug. 1\n\nMisleading Ads About Taxes\n\nNothing, the saying goes, is as certain as death and taxes. To that we might add \u201cand misleading political ads about taxes.\u201d As usual, 2014 campaigns have been filled with bloated boasts about tax cuts and off-base accusations that an opponent has raised taxes.\n\nThe bipartisan deal reached on New Year\u2019s Day in 2013 to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff provided plenty of ad fodder for both sides. Known as the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the compromise agreement permanently extended Bush-era income tax cuts for everyone except for individuals making more than $400,000 and couples making more than $450,000 a year.\n\nThat led to a grossly misleading boast by McConnell, the Senate minority leader from Kentucky, who voted for the bipartisan deal. McConnell claimed he \u201c[s]aved 99% of Kentuckians from Obama\u2019s Tax Increases.\u201d But Obama\u2019s plan would have extended the Bush-era tax cuts for those earning up to $250,000 for families ($200,000 for individuals). In other words, McConnell can only credibly claim to have \u201csaved\u201d individuals with taxable income of between $200,000 and $400,000 and couples who earn between $250,000 and $450,000. That\u2019s about 1 percent to 2 percent of Americans.\n\nInterestingly, that same fiscal cliff vote was used as the basis for an ad from McConnell\u2019s opponent, Grimes, who claimed McConnell \u201ceven voted to end the payroll tax credit.\u201d It\u2019s true that a temporary payroll tax holiday was allowed to expire in the fiscal cliff deal. But no one really pushed for extending the payroll tax holiday, not even Democrats who had proposed it two years earlier as a form of temporary recession relief. All but three Senate Democrats voted for the fiscal cliff bill, and the expiration of the payroll tax holiday was even supported by the likes of Obama\u2019s treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, and Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House. The fiscal cliff deal McConnell voted for was praised by Obama, who even thanked McConnell by name for supporting it.\n\nOn more than one occasion, Republicans and their allies labeled vulnerable Democratic senators champions of a carbon tax without evidence. One particularly egregious example: A Crossroads GPS ad said Colorado Sen. Mark Udall \u201cvoted to enact a carbon tax.\u201d He did not. The ad refers to a vote on a failed amendment to a nonbinding budget resolution. The amendment would have required any possible future carbon tax to be revenue neutral, with the tax proceeds being returned to the American people. We saw similar bogus attacks on Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Begich of Alaska.\n\nIn a Republican-on-Republican attack, Paul DeMarco, a candidate in Alabama\u2019s 6th Congressional District Republican runoff, butchered a quote from his opponent, Gary Palmer, on taxes. The ad left the false impression that Palmer supported a $1.2 billion tax hike. It took a quote from an op-ed Palmer wrote opposing the tax increase, but cut it off in mid-sentence. The ad quoted Palmer as saying, \u201cI would be willing to support a tax increase \u2026,\u201d even though the rest of that sentence read \u201c\u2026 but only on the condition that we first set in place some meaningful accountability measures. Unfortunately, the proposal before the people of Alabama falls well short of the mark.\u201d\n\nAnd, in what ended up being the most shocking upset of the political year so far, Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia lost his primary to upstart Republican David Brat, despite Cantor repeatedly portraying Brat as a \u201cliberal college professor\u201d who advised then-Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine on a massive tax hike plan. Cantor distorted Brat\u2019s role on the Joint Advisory Board of Economists, a large board of unpaid technical experts that was narrowly tasked with providing professional economic forecasts. Advice on tax policy was not part of the job description.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s Bloated Tax Boast, April 23\n\nGrimes Ad Misses the Mark on McConnell, Oct. 23\n\nCantor Mislabels Opponent, May 5\n\nCantor Mislabels Opponent, The Sequel, May 28\n\nEditing Out the Facts in Alabama, June 25\n\nMore Carbon Tax Distortions, July 24\n\nAFP Distorts Begich\u2019s Carbon Tax Stance, Feb. 28\n\nWait \u2026 There\u2019s More!\n\nThe liberal Senate Majority PAC claimed in a TV ad to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d on Rep. Tom Cotton\u2019s career. Cotton was \u201cpaid handsomely working for insurance companies\u201d before joining Congress, the ad said, and he has paid them back in Congress by supporting the industry\u2019s agenda. There is one problem with this theory: Cotton didn\u2019t work for any insurance companies. His only established connection to the industry involved consulting work for the Federal Housing Administration.\n\nConversely, Cotton made the curious claim that President Obama \u201chijacked the farm bill, turned it into a food stamp bill.\u201d That was his defense for being the only member of the Arkansas delegation to vote against the bill. But food stamp funding has been part of farm bills going back to 1973.\n\nSen. John Walsh, before quitting the race over plagiarism charges, claimed Republican Rep. Steve Daines \u201cproposed making women criminals for having an abortion.\u201d The ad cites the Life at Conception Act, which Daines co-sponsored. But that bill clearly states that \u201cnothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the prosecution of any woman for the death of her unborn child.\u201d\n\nIn the Georgia Senate race, Republican David Perdue cited a campaign strategy memo from Michelle Nunn\u2019s advisers to make the audacious claim that \u201cher foundation gave money to organizations linked to terrorists.\u201d She \u201cadmits\u201d it! It\u2019s right there in the campaign memo! Except it\u2019s not. The memo doesn\u2019t \u201cadmit\u201d anything. It was meant to prepare \u201cresponses to potential Republican attacks,\u201d as it said. It didn\u2019t say those attacks would be accurate. And there\u2019s no evidence that the foundation \u2014 Points of Light, the volunteer group founded by former Republican President George H.W. Bush \u2014 gave money to any group linked to terrorists.\n\nMost attack ads appear in competitive races, but long-shot Democratic challenger Jim Mowrer in Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District ran a TV ad that claimed Rep. Steve King voted to \u201craise his own pay by $20,000 a year and take perks like free health care for life.\u201d Mowrer is doubly wrong. The $20,000 figure is about how much congressional salaries automatically have increased for cost-of-living adjustments since 2002, when King was first elected. King did not vote to raise his pay \u2014 let alone \u201cby $20,000 a year.\u201d He also didn\u2019t vote for \u201cfree health care for life.\u201d King voted for a House budget resolution that urged the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
