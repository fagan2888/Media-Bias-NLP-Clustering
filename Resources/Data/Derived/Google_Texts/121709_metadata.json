Ostry, Atish R. Ghosh, and Raphael Espinoza -- maintain that if a country is near full employment, can borrow at reasonable (or given today\u2019s climate, historically low) interest rates, and has ample space between its debt limit and its debt-to-GDP ratio, it makes sense not to pay down debt but to let it decline organically as a share of GDP through economic growth.\n\nA country with fiscal space, the authors suggest, is likely to be reasonably well-positioned to take on additional debt in the event of an unexpected crisis. Countries with no room for additional debt, however, could face significant penalties in the event of a crisis requiring more borrowing.\n\nThe thinking, according to the authors, is that a deliberate effort to pay down debt would require increasing taxes, which has a distortive effect on an economy by channeling spending away from other uses, like investment in infrastructure.\n\nRelated: The Federal Debt Is About to Become a Big Issue Again\n\nThe authors concede that what constitutes adequate fiscal space is a judgment call but offer a general categorization of sovereign debtors with an estimate of just how much room they have. At the bottom, unsurprisingly, are economic basket cases, including Greece, Italy and Cyprus. At the top are Norway, South Korea and New Zealand, all of which have relatively low debt-to-GDP ratios.\n\nThe United States comes out with a comfortable cushion, putting it roughly in line with Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse, Germany.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time that the IMF has slapped down the austerity crowd. It has, for instance, made the case for borrowing more to finance public infrastructure,\u201d Wessel notes in the Journal.\n\n\u201cNevertheless,\u201d he adds, \u201cthis is an eyebrow-raising moment.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new working paper from the International Monetary Fund argues that debt hawks, who urge the United State to focus on reducing its debt, have it backwards.
