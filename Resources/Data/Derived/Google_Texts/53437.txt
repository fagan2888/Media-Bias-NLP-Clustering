TUBA CITY, Ariz. (AP) â€” A Navajo Code Talker who was forced out of the home he built 60 years ago when it fell into disrepair has moved back in after volunteers did extensive renovations.

Dan Akee and his wife had been living in a trailer alongside the home in Tuba City for the past few years. Tribal officials took note and reached out to the Red Feather Development Group to fix the home.

Volunteers and donors pitched in to renovate the house for the 94-year-old Akee, considered a hero among Navajos. He was one of hundreds of tribal members who used a World War II code based on their native language to stump the Japanese.

The four-bedroom house has a new roof, flooring and windows, and an updated structural frame, restrooms and kitchen.
