FRANKFURT--German automotive supplier Continental AG (CON.XE) said Tuesday that it plans to boost development of its automated driving systems with the acquisition of Elektrobit Automotive GmbH, a German unit of Finland-based Elektrobit Corp., for 600 million euros ($678.56 million).

Elektrobit said the deal is likely to lift its net cash flow by EUR575 million in 2015.

The move needs regulatory and shareholder approval and was unanimously recommended by Elektrobit. Continental said it already has around 46% of issued share capital committed to the sale and Elektrobit will hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to vote on it on June 11. A simple majority is required for approval and the deal is expected to close in July.

Elektrobit Automotive employs around 1,900 software professionals developing vehicle functions such as advance driver assistance systems.
