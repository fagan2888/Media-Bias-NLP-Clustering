Only one of those 10 firms is a major U.S. law firm (Reed Smith), and only one also ranks among K Street\u2019s 20 biggest lobby firms by revenue (Fierce, Isakowitz & Blalock), according to 2013 publicly disclosed lobbying revenue.\n\nThe analysis examined lobby firms that had at least 20 clients in the first quarter of 2008 that are still active today. A client is considered \u201cretained\u201d if the firm represented them in the first quarter of 2008 and still represented them in the first quarter of 2014. That does not necessarily indicate the firm has represented the client continuously since 2008 \u2014 they may have terminated the relationship with the client at one point and then signed them again later.\n\nMarcus G. Faust, a solo practitioner who founded his firm in 1981, has retained 77 percent of the clients he had in 2008 \u2014 more than any other firm during that period, according to the analysis. Faust works almost exclusively for cities, counties, water districts and regional utilities companies in California, Utah, Colorado and Nevada. The drought in that region has pushed many of those entities to interact more with federal agencies that own or manage land on water conservation projects and other initiatives, Faust said. Most of Faust\u2019s clients pay between $10,000 and $50,000 a quarter, according to lobbying reports. In 2013, Faust\u2019s firm reported about $2 million in lobbying revenue.\n\n\u201cThere are other business models out there among lobbyists trying to maximize revenue on each individual account, but the clients we have are long-term relationships,\u201d Faust said. \u201cThey are getting value for their dollar, particularly as many are public entities who have to justify their expenditures.\u201d\n\nView Graphic Lobby firms with the highest retention rate from the first quarter of 2008 to the same quarter in 2014.\n\nHealth and Medicine Counsel of Washington, a seven-person health lobbying boutique that works primarily for associations and nonprofits in the health care industry, has kept 75 percent of its clients from 2008, according to the analysis.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep our rates modest and moderate because we\u2019re dealing with nonprofit organizations,\u201d said Dale Dirks, the firm\u2019s president. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons they continue to retain us ... The other thing is some organizations come to us and want a Washington presence, but they\u2019re not sure what they should be doing. We spend a lot of time on the front end putting together a plan that includes realistic goals and a time frame, and as we go along, they can see we\u2019re hitting benchmarks. One thing that contributes to high attrition rate in clients is organizations having unrealistic expectations.\u201d\n\nMost of the firm\u2019s clients pay $20,000 or less a quarter, and the firm in 2013 earned $895,000 in revenue, according to lobbying reports.\n\nDirks said his firm aims for long-term business, not \u201cone-off\u201d work. One of its longest-standing clients is the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools, which represents historically black medical, dental and veterinary schools in the United States. The firm has lobbied on the group\u2019s behalf since the early 1980s, on issues including securing appropriations for training physicians and health care professionals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re more in the business of securing work with organizations that have an ongoing need or a long-term need in the appropriations process, or some sort of health-related policy area,\u201d Dirks said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have specific needs immediately, but know they\u2019ll need someone to represent their interest in Washington in the long term.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lobby firms with highest client retention rates have lower fees, nonprofit and government clients", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1216470", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Lobby firms with highest client retention rates have lower fees, nonprofit and government clients", "title": "Client retention on K Street has little correlation to size, name recognition or earning power", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/hanging-onto-business-bigger-is-not-better/2014/06/19/5dbd4be2-f59a-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w//2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/18/CapitalBusiness/Images/webpromo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@WapoCat"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/hanging-onto-business-bigger-is-not-better/2014/06/19/5dbd4be2-f59a-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capbiztopnews, lobbying, K Street, Capitol Metrics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1216470"}, "eomportal-uuid": "5dbd4be2-f59a-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "capbiztopnews, lobbying, K Street, Capitol Metrics"}, "article_summary": "The analysis examined lobby firms that had at least 20 clients in the first quarter of 2008 that are still active today.\nMost of Faust\u2019s clients pay between $10,000 and $50,000 a quarter, according to lobbying reports.\nMost of the 10 lobby firms with the best client retention rates are relatively small, have affordable rates, specialized expertise and lots of clients in the nonprofit or government sectors.\nA client is considered \u201cretained\u201d if the firm represented them in the first quarter of 2008 and still represented them in the first quarter of 2014.\n\u201cWe have to keep our rates modest and moderate because we\u2019re dealing with nonprofit organizations,\u201d said Dale Dirks, the firm\u2019s president."}
