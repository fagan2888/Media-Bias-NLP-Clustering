( Chris McKay/Getty Images for BET )\n\nRapper Phife Dawg, of the iconic group Tribe Called Quest, is continuing to raise awareness around diabetes in his death, as he did in life, throughout his music career.\n\nThe rapper\u2019s family confirmed Wednesday that Phife died at age 45 at his home near Antioch due to complications resulting from diabetes, sparking a wave of disease-related tributes on social media.\n\nRest in peace and poetry, Phife Dawg.

We will continue the fight against Diabetes in your honor,\u201d Youth Speaks posted on Twitter.\n\nPhife, born Malik Taylor, was diagnosed with diabetes when he was 19. It was May 1990, just one month after Tribe released its first album. Phife later talked about his struggle with the disease in interviews, and even rapped about it.\n\n\u201cMr. Energetic, who me sound pathetic?/When\u2019s the last time you heard a funky diabetic?\u201d he rhymed in Tribe\u2019s 1993 song \u201cOh My God.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Phife told the East Bay Express that he was working on a solo album, \u201cSongs in the Key of Phife,\u201d though it was never released. Reporter David MacFadden-Elliott got to hear a few samples in the IHOP parking lot after the interview, including a song about diabetes called \u201cGod Send.\u201d\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] a three-part song that turns from a smooth love joint into a warning from a doctor: \u2018You got to start dialysis.\u2019 The news ushers in a discordant, claustrophobic, pulsing beat that rocks, while voice-mail messages of support play for minutes on end. The song concludes with an emotional verse of thanks: If it wasn\u2019t for y\u2019all/Who knows what would have happened?\u201d\n\nIt was a couple years after Phife\u2019s initial diagnosis before he opened up about it, or even really took care of himself.\n\nHis coming out was in a video interview on dLife, a website devoted to living with diabetes. He described finding out about his diagnosis. He was riding home from a concert in 1990 and kept asking the driver to pull over so he could go to the bathroom. He was really thirsty. When he got home, his grandmother, a nurse, did a test and confirmed he was diabetic.\n\n\u201cI thought it was over,\u201d he told dLife. \u201cI just automatically thought I was done rapping.\u201d\n\nHe went into denial.\n\n\u201cI was just an idiot,\u201d he said. \u201cI still thought I was everybody else \u2014 Twinkies, Suzie Qs, potato chips \u2014 junk food anonymous.\u201d\n\nIn 1992, Tribe was on \u201cThe David Letterman Show\u201d and then immediately had to go to another shoot for \u201cThe Dennis Miller Show.\u201d Pfife\u2019s blood sugar count was almost in the thousands \u2014 normal levels are between 70 and 100.\n\n\u201cEverything was slow motion,\u201d Phife described. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even do the show. I had to get hospitalized.\u201d\n\nEven then, he still struggled to get enough exercise and eat right.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d get on the diet. Wouldn\u2019t stick to the diet. Get back on diet, wouldn\u2019t stick to the diet,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it just got to point where I had to be put on dialysis.\u201d\n\nPhife was eventually put on a waiting list for a kidney transplant, and received one from his wife in 2008. By 2013, he was back on dialysis and back on the transplant list. In an interview with NPR earlier this year, he talked about waiting for another kidney.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI really, really can\u2019t complain. I could. But I won\u2019t because God is really, really a good God.\u201d\n\nBut he also had a message for other young people newly diagnosed with diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a game. You can lose your life because of this,\u201d he said during the dLife interview. \u201cYou need to love yourself, love your life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rapper Phife Dawg, of the iconic group Tribe Called Quest, is continuing to raise awareness around diabetes in his death, as he did in life.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Hip-Hop Pioneer Phife Brought Attention to Diabetes\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/23\\/hip-hop-pioneer-phife-attention-to-diabetes\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-23 16:41:08\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-25 11:13:37\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":163748,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Arts\",\"Diabetes\",\"News\",\"Phife\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/Phife-Dawg-2.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Rapper Phife Dawg, of the iconic group Tribe Called Quest, is continuing to raise awareness around diabetes in his death, as he did in life.", "title": "Hip-Hop Pioneer Phife Brought Attention to Diabetes", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/23/hip-hop-pioneer-phife-attention-to-diabetes/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/Phife-Dawg-2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "arts,diabetes,news,phife", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI really, really can\u2019t complain.\nBut I won\u2019t because God is really, really a good God.\u201dBut he also had a message for other young people newly diagnosed with diabetes.\npic.twitter.com/ofG6ATsq02 \u2014 Youth Speaks (@youthspeaks) March 23, 2016\u201cRest in peace and poetry, Phife Dawg.\nPhife Dawg performs onstage at the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards in Atlanta.\nRest in peace and poetry, Phife Dawg."}
