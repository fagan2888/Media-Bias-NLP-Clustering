The current average wait time for a decision, however, is 489 days, CMA notes.\n\nThe Medicare appeals process has drawn attention on Capitol Hill, although lawmakers have focused on providers.\n\nLawmakers are concerned the current Medicare fraud appeals process treats healthcare providers as \"guilty until proven innocent,\" and may be driving some of them out of business.\n\nThey note Medicare fraud cases have skyrocketed between 2012 and 2013, and could reach a million cases by the end of the fiscal year, with many stalled in the system.\n\nLawmakers say many of the cases brought before ALJs may be due to simple administrative issues but the delays are threatening reimbursements for healthcare providers and their patients.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Advocates say the current wait for a hearing decision is almost 500 days.", "description": "Advocates say the current wait for a hearing decision is almost 500 days.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Ferdous Al-Faruque", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Advocates say the current wait for a hearing decision is almost 500 days.", "title": "Medicare beneficiaries sue over slow appeals", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/216007-medicare-beneficiaries-sue-over-delayed-appeals", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/216007-medicare-beneficiaries-sue-over-delayed-appeals", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-26T15:18-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Kyle Balluck", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Medicare,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-26T15:18:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/216007-medicare-beneficiaries-sue-over-delayed-appeals", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Advocates say the current wait for a hearing decision is almost 500 days.", "card": "summary", "title": "Medicare beneficiaries sue over slow appeals"}, "dcterms.title": "Medicare beneficiaries sue over slow appeals"}, "article_summary": "Five Medicare beneficiaries filed a class-action lawsuit against the Obama administration for delaying their Medicare appeals.\nThe Medicare appeals process has drawn attention on Capitol Hill, although lawmakers have focused on providers.\n\u201cThis lawsuit is necessary because of a broken Medicare appeals system,\u201d said Gill Deford, CMA\u2019s litigation director, in a statement.\nLawmakers are concerned the current Medicare fraud appeals process treats healthcare providers as \"guilty until proven innocent,\" and may be driving some of them out of business.\nThey note Medicare fraud cases have skyrocketed between 2012 and 2013, and could reach a million cases by the end of the fiscal year, with many stalled in the system."}
