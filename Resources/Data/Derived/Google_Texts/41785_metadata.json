Man, is it winter.\n\nThere are many stories in the papers so far this week with opportunities to do nice things for other people because it\u2019s the holidays and that\u2019s something we do. But there\u2019s one that stands out as being not particularly nice at all: In Clinton County, the Plattsburgh Press Republican reports, 14 people are being charged with welfare fraud in what county Assistant District Attorney Jason Marx told the paper he believes is \u201cone of the biggest welfare fraud sweeps in the history of the tri-county area.\u201d The total amount of fraud, the county District Attorney\u2019s office says in a press release, is more then $105,000. All of those being charged were arraigned in the second half of last month and are awaiting trial. All the charges are felonies.\n\nThe instances of fraud are mostly pretty low level \u2014 at or below the $4,000 range. A few cases are much more eye catching. These include a Champlain man who\u2019s charged with first-degree larceny after allegedly receiving about $23,000 in reimbursements for mileage from the county; a Mooers man who received about $28,000 in medical assistance after allegedly misreporting his income; and a Plattsburgh women who allegedly was paid $16,585 in medical and SNAP (food stamps) benefits for which she wasn\u2019t eligible.\n\nAs the DA points out in the press release, welfare fraud is a particularly serious issue when county budgets are stretched as tight as they currently are, and defrauding the government isn\u2019t exactly classy. It\u2019s also somewhat saddening that out of the three major instances of fraud, one is for medical assistance, and the other is for that and food stamps. Interestingly, both are in flux right now. Food stamps funding was effectively cut as of November 1, and the future of the program isn\u2019t clear as Congress continues to wrangle over the Farm Bill. Meanwhile, as the Affordable Care Act takes effect over the next couple years, we\u2019ll know more about how it\u2019s going to impact the high cost of health care in America.\n\nMaybe those being charged with these crimes are terrible, welfare queen-type people who would steal from the government no matter what (my earlier thoughts about welfare fraud and welfare queens); maybe they\u2019re just people with problems who did something, or a number of things, that basically constituted an ongoing theft from the local government. Probably, they\u2019re somewhere in between.\n\nTags: clinton county, crime, plattsburgh, poverty, welfare, welfare fraud", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The In Box", "description": "Happy post-Thanksgiving week to you all, and thanks, weather gods, for reminding us it is, in fact, winter.
