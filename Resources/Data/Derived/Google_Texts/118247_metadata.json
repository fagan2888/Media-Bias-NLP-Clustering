Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) has introduced similar legislation in the House, as Democrats open yet another avenue of attack on the cross-border mergers known as inversions.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows that before you leave a restaurant you have to settle your tab,\u201d Brown said. \u201cCorporations shouldn\u2019t get to play by different rules.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat set-up, many experts say, has led to multinational corporations building up huge stashes of offshore income \u2014 more than $2 trillion according to some estimates.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company AbbVie and the medical device maker Medtronic have about $41.5 billion abroad between them, according to data from Audit Analytics provided by the two senators.\n\nAbbVie and Medtronic are among the companies that announced inversions this year. Burger King\u2019s merger with the Canadian doughnut chain Tim Hortons has been the most prominent of the cross-border mergers.\n\n\u201cWhen individuals decide to renounce their U.S. citizenship, they must pay their tax bill before they leave. Corporations should do the same,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nDemocrats have sought legislation that would essentially make it impossible for U.S. companies that merge with smaller foreign competitors to be counted as anything but American for tax purposes.\n\nBut Republicans have balked at that plan, with most holding out for a broader overhaul of the tax code. That\u2019s left the Treasury Department to examine what administrative actions it can take to limit the appeal of the deals.\n\nRepublicans have also generally proposed moving the tax code in the opposite direction of Brown and Durbin\u2019s proposal by limiting U.S. taxation of offshore income. GOP lawmakers say such an approach, called a territorial system, would give companies more incentive to invest in the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Majority Whip Sen.
