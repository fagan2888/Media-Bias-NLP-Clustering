Two years later, Pope Leo IV oversaw construction of 40-foot walls to protect the restored Basilica of St. Peter from a violent world and to preserve for eternity the safety of his successors as Bishops of Rome and leaders of the worldwide Catholic Church.\n\nFor more than a millennium, the enfortressment of the Holy See served as a vivid metaphor for Church attitudes toward worldly influences, especially the corrosive effects of creeping modernity. Social and intellectual phenomena ranging from the Enlightenment to the sexual revolution were kept at bay by Pope Leo\u2019s battlements. Vatican walls protected the church from invaders, shielded its inner workings from scrutiny, and launched a thousand conspiracy theories: Pope Pius XII was complicit in the Holocaust; Pope Paul VI was drugged, imprisoned, and replaced by an actor; Pope John Paul I was murdered; the Vatican Secret Archives contain historical evidence that Jesus never existed.\n\nRelated: From Bouncer to Pope\u201421 Fascinating Facts About Pope Francis\n\nFacing calls from reformers to craft a more responsive and humanistic Church, Pope John XXIII convened the Second Vatican Council in 1962. \u201cI want to throw open the windows of the Church so that we can see out and the people can see in,\u201d he said. The consequences were immediate and dramatic. In hopes of igniting renewal, the Council produced numerous documents amending key Church teachings, reformed traditional liturgical practices, and, the reformers said, ended hundreds of years of insularity and elitism. With the Council\u2019s 1964 approval of the \u201cDogmatic Constitution on the Church,\u201d the document known as Lumen gentium, the metaphorical walls, at least, came tumbling down.\n\nOver the next ten years, the \u201cspirit of Vatican II\u201d gave the Church in America and elsewhere a radical makeover. Catholicism looked different, sounded different, and acted different. \u201cIt was as though some took the Church to be \u2018dis-incarnate,\u2019 detached from flesh and history\u2014detached, that is, from Rome and the Vatican, and so far as possible from any concrete local authority,\u201d wrote the acclaimed American Catholic writer and former seminarian Michael Novak, who covered the Council as a freelance reporter.\n\n\u201cFor the most extreme, to be a Catholic now meant to believe more or less anything one wished to believe. One could be a Catholic \u2018in spirit.\u2019 One could take Catholic to mean the \u2018culture\u2019 into which one was born rather than a creed making objective and rigorous demands. One could imagine Rome as a distant and irrelevant anachronism, embarrassment, even adversary.\u201d\n\nFifty years on, the American Church is damaged, diminished, and mired in an identity crisis\u2014trapped between orthodox traditionalists with a deep ambivalence about its post-Vatican II direction and progressives seeking greater accommodation with the culture. Add in the bishops\u2019 botched (and worse) response to the sexual-abuse crisis and the desire of powerful secular forces to banish all religious voices from the public square, and a picture emerges of an institution at least as vulnerable as it was during the Muslim conquests. In the 15 years prior to the Second Vatican Council, as Novak sees it, the American Church had never been healthier.\n\nRelated: Pope Francis\u2014Another Outsider Challenges the Status Quo\n\n\u201c[R]eligious orders of priest, brothers, and sisters had been growing more rapidly than they ever had in history,\u201d he wrote in a 2010 reconsideration of Vatican II. By contrast, in the subsequent decades, mass attendance in the United States dropped precipitously. The number of American priests has fallen 34 percent since 1965 and membership in women\u2019s religious orders has dropped off a cliff. There were more than 180,000 religious sisters in the U.S. in the mid-1960s\u2014roughly half of whom taught in Catholic schools. In 2014, there were just 49,883 American nuns, a nosedive of 72 percent.\n\nInto this upended world swoops the enigmatic Pope Francis, a humble South American whose impromptu pronouncements on economics and sexuality have given comfort to Catholicism\u2019s usual critics while vexing its faithful practitioners and their allies. His arrival in Washington on Tuesday marks his first time on American soil since his election in March 2013, and the first apostolic journey to the United States since Benedict XVI\u2019s April 2008 visit to New York and Washington.\n\nPapal visits always generate some hysteria, but usually the excitement is confined to the ranks of the parish councils, youth ministries, and energetic college students who pack buses and stadiums to spend a few hours in the presence of the Holy Father. This time it\u2019s different. It\u2019s the liberal-dominated media and the secular-progressive political establishment that\u2019s gone batty over Francis. \u201cPope Francis\u2019 Popularity Bridges Great Divides,\u201d declared The New York Times on Wednesday.\n\nIn Francis, American liberals see a lefty pope onto whom they can project their dreams of a popular backlash against the stultifying bigotry of right-wing religious conservatives. According to The New Republic\u2019s Brian Beutler, by speaking respectfully of Islam, Francis\u2019s goal is to \u201ctroll the entire American right.\u201d\n\nRelated: Pope Francis Gently Challenges Congress to Do the Right Thing\n\nAs the first Jesuit pope and the first from the Americas, Francis was bound to bring something unique to the papacy. Especially in Europe and the Americas, the Jesuit order has long been viewed as a bastion of left-wing radicalism within the Church. The Catholic writer and editor David Mills called the Jesuits \u201cthe archetype of the priests with PhDs who set themselves in opposition to the Church\u2019s teaching and run institutions notorious for their disregard and abuse of that teaching.\u201d\n\nPope Francis is not your average Jesuit, however. He served as the order\u2019s local leader during the turbulent 1970s, while Argentina\u2019s right-wing military dictatorship fought its \u201cDirty War\u201d against left-wing guerillas. His deft stewardship\u2014one Argentine Jesuit called him \u201ca mixture of Machiavelli and a desert saint\u201d\u2014made him popular with the men he led but not with those in the order who coveted his job. After a power struggle got him stripped of his leadership and sent into a kind of internal exile, a split was inevitable. According to biographer Austen Ivereigh, the period was \u201ca radical purgation that left [Francis] humbler, gentler, and more compassionate. It also brought an end to his time with the Jesuits, although he technically remained a member of the order.\u201d\n\nPope Francis is his own man, and that man is most definitely a liberal Church reformer. But he\u2019s also the Vicar of Christ, the successor of St. Peter, and the leader of the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics. It seems unlikely in the extreme, as some on the right have alleged, that the aim of his papacy is to undermine traditional teachings on morality or in any way do harm to the Church he loves and to which he has dedicated his life. That so many believe otherwise is an indication that we are hopelessly addicted to viewing the world through the binary lens of American politics. One thing\u2019s for sure: Pope Francis is tone-deaf about how his remarks play in American political context. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, and it doesn\u2019t constitute an existential threat to the Church.\n\nPope Francis has nontraditional views on marginal issues not typically thought of as being in the pope\u2019s purview. He\u2019s a Catholic priest, however, not a secular progressive or a free thinker. For example, his stance on gay marriage wouldn\u2019t fly in the Democratic Party of 2015. \u201cThe image of God is the married couple \u2014 not just the man, not just the woman, but both,\u201d he said during a general audience at the Vatican last year. Were he not the Hero Pope of the climate-obsessed liberal media, his views on abortion\u2014and animal rights\u2014would get him thrown off most American college campuses. \u201cAt times more zeal is shown in protecting other species than in defending the equal dignity of human beings,\u201d he said. Exactly right.\n\nRelated: Profiting from Pope Francis\u2019 Visit\u2014Souvenirs from Wacky to Tacky\n\nLost in the hype surrounding Francis\u2019s visit has been the real reason behind it. After his address to Congress, his Madison Square Garden mass, and his rally in Central Park, he will go to Philadelphia to oversee the conclusion of the World Meeting of Families\u2014a celebration of the \u201csacred bonds\u201d of traditional marriage. The event\u2019s host, Philadelphia archbishop Charles Chaput, one of the more eloquent conservative voices in the American Church, made news last year when he remarked on the \u201cconfusion\u201d emerging from the Vatican\u2019s two-week Synod on the Family. Media reports suggested that the participants were debating whether to change Church teaching on marriage.\n\n\u201cI think confusion is of the devil, and I think the public image that came across was of confusion,\u201d said Chaput. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Church has a clear position: on what marriage means and that you don\u2019t receive communion unless you\u2019re in communion with the teachings of Christ, that gay marriage is not a possibility in God\u2019s plan and therefore can\u2019t be a reality in our lives. There\u2019s no doubt about any of that.\u201d\n\nWhile the Left fantasizes about an imaginary \u2018Hero Pope\u2019 come to beat up the American Right for its views on social issues, the real Pope will be on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, endorsing a markedly traditional Catholic view of the family, reflecting the structure of the Holy Family itself and forming a kind of fortress against what he\u2019s called the \u201cideological colonization\u201d of same-sex marriage. The family, he said earlier this year, is \u201cthreatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage, by relativism, by the culture of the ephemeral, by a lack of openness to life.\u201d Does that sound like a pope come to tear the Church down\u2014or a pope come to protect it?\n\nMatthew Hennessey (@matthennessey) is an associate editor at City Journal, where this article was published originally.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In 846\u00a0AD, a Muslim army sacked Rome\u2019s unfortified Vatican Hill, making off with preci", "title": "Sorry, Liberals, the Pope Wants to Strengthen the Traditional Family", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/09/25/Sorry-Liberals-Pope-Wants-Strengthen-Traditional-Family", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12132013_Pope_Francis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/09/25/Sorry-Liberals-Pope-Wants-Strengthen-Traditional-Family", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12132013_Pope_Francis.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In 846\u00a0AD, a Muslim army sacked Rome\u2019s unfortified Vatican Hill, making off with preci", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca179\"", "article_summary": "Pope Francis has nontraditional views on marginal issues not typically thought of as being in the pope\u2019s purview.\nRelated: Profiting from Pope Francis\u2019 Visit\u2014Souvenirs from Wacky to TackyLost in the hype surrounding Francis\u2019s visit has been the real reason behind it.\n\u201cPope Francis\u2019 Popularity Bridges Great Divides,\u201d declared The New York Times on Wednesday.\nOne thing\u2019s for sure: Pope Francis is tone-deaf about how his remarks play in American political context.\nRelated: From Bouncer to Pope\u201421 Fascinating Facts About Pope FrancisFacing calls from reformers to craft a more responsive and humanistic Church, Pope John XXIII convened the Second Vatican Council in 1962."}
