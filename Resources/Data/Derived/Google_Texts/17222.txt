Two phone companies, TerraCom Inc. and YourTel America Inc., are facing a $10 million fine for posting the sensitive personal information of up to 300,000 customers on the Internet.

There’s something else about both companies: they’re both contractors for the Lifeline program, which subsidizes phone service for low-income families.

The phone program has recently become known as the “Obamaphone” with the explosion in wireless technology. From the AP:

To crack down on fraudulent claims, federal regulators ordered carriers to collect identifiable information. TerraCom Inc. and YourTel America, which are jointly owned, complied, but were so careless with the files that a reporter stumbled upon them during a simple Google search, according to the Federal Communications Commission. In a written statement released Friday, Dale Schmick, chief operating officer of TerraCom Inc. and YourTel America Inc., said the company has since increased its data security efforts and completed “multiple security audits to prevent future breaches from taking place.”

Does this sound familiar? It should, because Obamacare has had similiar security breaches. Last year in Minnesota, an employee of Minnesota’s healthcare exchange sent an unencryped file containing the personal data of 2,400 Minnesotans to an insurance agent. In Connecticut, the personal information of 400 enrollees was found in a backpack.

The government, at all levels, clearly has a problem with keeping personal information safe. While they’re handing millions and billions of dollars of subsidies, perhaps they should spend some money on training to teach government employees and contractors to learn how to protect the personal information of Americans.
