Lederman acknowledges that the imposition of a legal duty is not necessary to trigger religious-liberty protections under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and that such protections exist when the federal government has placed \u201csubstantial pressure\u201d on an exercise of religion.

Lederman\u2019s account of the role that federal law plays in pressuring employers to provide health insurance strikes me as one-sided and misleading.\n\nEarly on, Lederman says that the \u201cwidespread employer practice\u201d of providing health insurance \u201chas been primarily attributable to two things\u201d: (a) \u201ca federal government subsidy to employees\u201d (emphasis omitted), and (b) the fact that \u201cthe insurance the employees could obtain on the open market, using their own wages, was not nearly as attractive as employer-provided insurance.\u201d Lederman attributes only the first factor to federal law. He fails to consider that the second factor almost surely flows directly from the first: As health-care expert Jim Capretta (my colleague at the Ethics and Public Policy Center) tells me, the primary reason that the market for individual insurance hasn\u2019t been as attractive is that the subsidy (to the employee) for employer-provided insurance means that the individual market is generally used only by those who don\u2019t have access to an employer plan. In other words, it is a much smaller, remnant market, and thus less stable than the employer market, and the main reason is federal tax policy.\n\nSo once this second factor is correctly understood, Lederman\u2019s own account means that it is federal law that is \u201cprimarily\u201d responsible for the prevalence of employer-provided insurance. Federal law, in other words, clearly places substantial pressure on Hobby Lobby and other employers to provide health insurance in order to stay competitive in attracting employees, and it thus subjects them to the particular burden that the HHS mandate imposes on those employers who do provide such insurance.\n\nI\u2019ll note that, if I\u2019ve digested all the relevant passages, Lederman doesn\u2019t in fact make the opposite claim\u2014that federal law isn\u2019t primarily responsible for the prevalence of employer-provided insurance. Instead, he states only that\n\neven if it were true \u2026 that most employers will retain their employee insurance plans \u2026, that would not necessarily mean that most or all such employers are substantially pressured to do so, let alone that federal law creates such substantial pressure. It might be, instead, that most employers have soft preferences to retain such plans, owing to a vast array of variables and considerations.[Emphases in original.]\n\nSimilarly, when he says that \u201cany pressure on employers to retain their insurance plans \u2026 is based on a complex array of factors, most of which are market-driven rather than compelled by law,\u201d he is contending only that \u201cmost of\u201d the factors are \u201cmarket-driven\u201d\u2014which is not the same as contending that most of the pressure is \u201cmarket-driven.\u201d It\u2019s unfortunate that his phrasing might mislead many readers.\n\n2. If I\u2019m right on point 1, then Lederman\u2019s argument in his post collapses.

It\u2019s somehow necessary as well that federal law place substantial pressure on those employers to provide insurance.\n\nBut why? If Lederman is right, then why isn\u2019t it also necessary to establish that federal law places substantial pressure on those employers to be in business in the first place? Or to do business in the United States? Or to hire enough employees to pass the \u201clarge employer\u201d threshold?\n\nIn the landmark case of Sherbert v. Verner, state law didn\u2019t require that Adell Sherbert seek employment at all; it merely conditioned her receipt of unemployment compensation on her willingness to accept a job that required her to work on Saturdays. If Lederman is right, why didn\u2019t the Supreme Court require her to establish that state laws (rather than what Lederman calls \u201ca wide array of very context-dependent and fact-specific factors\u201d) placed substantial pressure on her to work? Are we really to believe that her Free Exercise claim would have failed if, say, she was from a wealthy family and, by some objective standard, was under no pressure to work (but in fact did want to)? If Lederman is right, why didn\u2019t the Court explore whether state laws, rather than market conditions, were primarily responsible for employers\u2019 insistence that she be available to work on Saturdays?\n\nOr consider this hypothetical: A newly enacted federal law requires that any store that sells beef to the public must also sell comparable pork products.

In determining whether the law imposes a substantial burden on the owner\u2019s exercise of religion, would a court really find it significant that federal law does not require the deli owner to sell beef? If that proposition strikes you as absurd, that would signal that Lederman\u2019s premise (that it matters why an employer is providing health insurance) is also absurd.\n\nWhat I\u2019m suggesting is the modest proposition that people have religious-liberty rights under RFRA in how they carry out all the activities that they freely choose to engage in, not just in how they do the tasks that the federal government places substantial pressure on them to do. The kosher deli is free to sell beef, and Hobby Lobby is free to provide health insurance to its employees\u2014and in both cases the federal government substantially burdens the entity\u2019s exercise of religion when it compels it to carry out that freely chosen activity in a way that violates its religious beliefs.\n\nIn sum, I believe that Lederman\u2019s post invents, and then stumbles over, a hurdle that RFRA does not in fact impose.", "card": "summary", "title": "Substantial Confusion on RFRA\u2019s \u201cSubstantial Burden\u201d Requirement?, by Ed Whelan, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Mon, 2014-01-06 09:56", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Substantial Confusion on RFRA\u2019s \u201cSubstantial Burden\u201d Requirement?", "keywords": "Ed Whelan", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Substantial Confusion on RFRA\u2019s \u201cSubstantial Burden\u201d Requirement?, Ed Whelan, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Ed Whelan, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d98\"", "article_summary": "Lederman\u2019s account of the role that federal law plays in pressuring employers to provide health insurance strikes me as one-sided and misleading.\nIt\u2019s somehow necessary as well that federal law place substantial pressure on those employers to provide insurance.\nIf that proposition strikes you as absurd, that would signal that Lederman\u2019s premise (that it matters why an employer is providing health insurance) is also absurd.\nOr consider this hypothetical: A newly enacted federal law requires that any store that sells beef to the public must also sell comparable pork products.\nSo once this second factor is correctly understood, Lederman\u2019s own account means that it is federal law that is \u201cprimarily\u201d responsible for the prevalence of employer-provided insurance."}
