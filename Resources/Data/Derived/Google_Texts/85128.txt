Who doesn’t love nipples?!

You may remember seeing Miley Cyrus’ Instagram with a nipple recently, and she was doing it in support of an AH-Mayzing movement taking place all over!

Free The Nipple is a film about how topless women are being arrested in NYC for being "obscene" even though it is LEGAL for them to unleash their tatas!

So, like the filmmakers, we want to know, What is more obscene… A murder or a nipple?

Ch-ch-check out the video (below) and tell us your thoughts, but be careful if you're watching at you non-nipple loving work, because the suits might think it's NSFW!
