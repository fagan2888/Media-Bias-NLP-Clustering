Instead, we will cover his campaign as part of our Entertainment section. Our reason is simple: Trump\u2019s campaign is a sideshow. We won\u2019t take the bait. If you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you\u2019ll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette.\n\nThis was posted to Huffington Politics. If they are serious, this should be the last mention we should see there of Donald Trump.\n\nDonald Trump posted his response on Facebook, in the third person of course:\n\nDonald J. Trump Response to Huffington Post Mr. Trump is number one in the unimportant Huffington Post poll, along with all other recently released polls including Reuters, FOX, USA Today/Suffolk University and The Economist. Mr. Trump is in first place in Nevada, where he is also number one, by a wide margin, with Hispanics. He is number one in North Carolina and expects to win Iowa and New Hampshire. Mr. Trump singlehandedly raised the issue of illegal immigration and started a national conversation about what has turned out to be one of the most important topics of this election cycle. Likewise, Mr. Trump is the leader on issues such as the terrible United States trade deals, strengthening our military, taking care of our great Vets and the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. If you read previously written Tweets, Mr. Trump has never been a fan of Arianna Huffington or the money-losing Huffington Post. The only clown show in this scenario is the Huffington Post pretending to be a legitimate news source. Mr. Trump is not focused on being covered by a glorified blog. He is focused on Making America Great Again.\n\nThe Donald is typically full of himself, giving himself credit where it is not due \u2013 he can hardly claim to have begun the immigration debate, the discourse on bad trade deals, or, alternatives to Obamacare \u2013 but this is how the man is. He is not the first politician of either party to be full of himself. He\u2019s just the most obnoxious.\n\nAnd this is how HuffPo responded to Trump\u2019s response:\n\nSo Trump is right up there with a sparkling Britney.\n\nWhile this development is amusing, how is it that Huffington Post can separate Trump\u2019s campaign from those of other Republican candidates who are equally \u201csideshows\u201d? They won\u2019t take the bait where Trump is concerned, but they take Ted Cruz seriously? Or Jeb Bush? Rick Santorum, for all his craziness, has never been relegated to the Entertainment section.\n\nEven Sarah Palin, perhaps the ultimate in Republican clown shows, was never put in the Entertainment section \u2013 not even when she praised Donald Trump in June. That news also appeared in Huffington Politics.\n\nIf Trump is Entertainment, then all Republican politics for years has been Entertainment. After all, his extremism is merely the culmination of years of work by various Republican demagogues. Where do we draw the line?\n\nThere are various other reasons to object to what Huffington Post has done. For one thing, Trump is polling at the top, not the bottom of the polls. It seems to be a very serious campaign indeed. Whatever Trump really believes, the Republican base believes in him, and it is the Republican base who will be voting in the primaries, not news organizations.\n\nFox News rightly cites \u201cRich Noyes, research director at the conservative Media Research Center,\u201d who \u201csaid the decision on a candidate\u2019s legitimacy should be up to voters, not the media.\u201d\n\nAnd however much a joke we might consider him because of his loud, buffoonish behavior, Trump scares the bejeesus out of the Republican Party. And we liberals and independents must avoid the temptation, like Republicans, to dump reality when we don\u2019t find it lining up with our preconceptions.\n\nDavid Corn at Mother Jones has voiced another valid objection. He says that \u201cto exile Trump to the realm of the Kardashians is to let the Republican party off the hook too easily\u201d:\n\nTrump poses a crisis for his party. It may be entertaining for the Democrats to watch. But this crisis is not transpiring in TMZ-land. It\u2019s what the GOP has brought upon itself. Here is the ROI on the GOP\u2019s extreme politics.\n\nThen too, if Trump can be sent to the Entertainment section, how about other candidates a media outlet might not like? The corporate media could as easily decide Democratic candidates are not to be taken seriously.\n\nAs moves go, HuffPo\u2019s is not the most sensible one.\n\nHumans have shaped their reality for thousands of years in various ways, but anyone serious about understanding it has taken the task of cataloguing and defining that reality very seriously. Charles Darwin had to deal with the inconvenient reality of the platypus and we have to deal with Donald Trump. The platypus turned out to be a mammal, once we were able to sequence its genes, and is hardly the terror to evolutionists creationists might claim.\n\nThe creationists pretend the platypus\u2019 genome has not been sequenced to make their argument against evolution. Huffington Post also rejects evolution \u2013 the evolution of Republican politics. It can, but refuses to, sequence Trump\u2019s ideological genes in order to find his evolutionary niche.\n\nHuffington Post says it will not take @realDonaldTrump seriously, but at this point, is there any reason to take Arianna Huffington seriously? Even Fox News, which I think we all agree is not real news, has not relegated candidates it does not approve of to the Entertainment section.\n\nDonald Trump has a point. Is any news source a legitimate news source if it refuses to take reality seriously?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liberals and independents must avoid the temptation, like Republicans, to dump reality when we don't find it lining up with our preconceptions", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Liberals and independents must avoid the temptation, like Republicans, to dump reality when we don't find it lining up with our preconceptions", "title": "Huffington Post Moves Coverage of Donald Trump from Politics to Entertainment", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/07/18/huffington-post-moves-coverage-donald-trump-politics-entertainment.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/trump-phoenix.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-18T07:55:01+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "2016 Elections,Featured News,Donald Trump,Huffington Post,Republican Clown Car,Republican Party,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2015-07-18T07:54:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-18T07:55:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2016 Elections, Donald Trump, Huffington Post, Republican Clown Car, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump posted his response on Facebook, in the third person of course:Donald J.
