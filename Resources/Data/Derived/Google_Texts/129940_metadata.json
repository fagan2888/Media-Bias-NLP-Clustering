So, what would that look like?\n\nIf past is prologue, national parks and the National Zoo would be shuttered; many federal employees would be furloughed; and food inspections would be delayed.\n\nBut if the most recent shutdown \u2014 in 2013 \u2014 is an indication, unemployment-benefit checks will go out, and Americans will keep getting their mail delivered through the U.S. Postal Service. A USPS spokesperson confirmed delivery would not be affected since the postal service relies on income from stamps and other fees to keep running, and doesn\u2019t depend on the congressional appropriations process.\n\nWashington is staring down a Sept. 30 deadline to keep the government open, and right now, there\u2019s no resolution in sight. On Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner said it\u2019s not \u201chis goal\u201d to shut down the government over the issue of funding Planned Parenthood. Some conservatives want to cut off federal dollars for the provider of women\u2019s reproductive health services.\n\nAlso on Thursday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest urged Republicans to start budget negotiations with Democrats. The White House wants Congress to lift spending caps for domestic spending, not just for the military.\n\nEarnest said there is a \u201cregular process\u201d for federal agencies to prepare for a shutdown but added he did not know if those had begun or not. A MarketWatch request for more information from the Office of Management and Budget was not immediately answered.\n\nCongress hasn\u2019t passed a single spending bill for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.\n\nThe last time the government shut down was Oct. 1-16, 2013, after a fight over Obamacare. About 850,000 federal employees were furloughed immediately after funding ran out, according to a White House report. But most civilian employees of the Defense Department went back to work after a week, following passage of the Pay Our Military Act. More than 8,000 workers at the Social Security Administration were recalled as well, to ensure benefits were processed.\n\nBudget expert Stan Collender of Qorvis MSLGroup points out presidents have the authority to determine which activities will continue during a shutdown.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no agreed-upon list of what\u2019s essential and what\u2019s not, and the president can (and typically does) change the list as a shutdown continues,\u201d Collender told MarketWatch in an email.\n\nWhile there\u2019s flexibility in terms of what can stay open and what shuts down, the last two shutdowns have claimed some of the same victims. In both 1996 and 2013, for example, the Smithsonian museums in Washington were closed. Employees were furloughed, though paid later.\n\nAlec Phillips of Goldman Sachs says he doesn\u2019t expect another shutdown to look much different from prior ones \u2014 if it comes to that.\n\n\u201cWith a few weeks to go until the deadline, the outlook is very murky but our best guess is that Congress will narrowly avoid it,\u201d he wrote in a note on Wednesday.\n\nThere could be more clarity early next week on where this issue is going. Politico reports House Republican leadership aides have said they will decide on a strategy to fund the government by the end of this weekend.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "In less than three weeks the federal government could partially shut down if Congress doesn\u2019t act.
