It turns out that one in five millennials lives in poverty, according to a recent report released by the US Census Bureau.\n\nThe generation that has been dismissed as entitled and whiny is struggling with higher levels of poverty than its counterparts did in 1980. Back then, about one in seven 18-to-34-year-olds lived in poverty.\n\nOne possible reason: higher unemployment.\n\n\n\nToday, 65% of young adults are employed, down from 69% in 1980. Members of the prior generation were also more likely to find themselves serving in the army: about 9% of the 18-to-34-year-olds were veterans in the 1980; today that number is just 2%.\n\nDrive on\n\nProbably most surprising among the findings published in the interactive Young Adults: Then and Now is what hasn\u2019t changed: eight in 10 millennials drive to work. The number is \u201clargely\u201d unchanged, found the bureau.\n\n\n\nThis news comes at a time when all other statistics seem to point to the fact that millennials have fallen out of love with cars and driving \u2013 something that has been troubling carmakers. Millennials are buying fewer cars: new car purchases for the age group dropped 30% between 2007 and 2012. Many of those who drive to work may be using older cars \u2013 or, perhaps, car sharing.\n\nThis isn\u2019t what we meant by car sharing, but OK.

The rest are probably stuck on the L train.\n\n\n\nMore school, fewer wedding bells\n\nThe survey also confirmed a few things we already knew about millennials \u2013 like the fact that more of them are going to college. Compared to just 16% of their 1980s counterparts, 22% of young adults today have a college degree.\n\n\n\nTheir expensive degrees \u2013 since 1978 the price of college has rocketed up 1,120% \u2013 unfortunately do not guarantee employment, not even in their chosen fields. The underemployment rate for 2013 college graduates was 18.3%, up from 9.9% in 2007.\n\n\n\nAs millennials struggle with student loans and finding jobs within their preferred professions, they are putting off some of the other milestones of adulthood, such as marriage: only three in 10 millennials have ever been married. In the 1980s, people ages 18 to 34 were getting married at twice that rate.\n\nEarlier this year, a number of younger Guardian US readers said that financial instability brought on by crippling debt, little savings and no job security was the reason they were in no rush to tie the knot.\n\nThe other reason? They haven\u2019t met the right person. Maybe things will turn around on that front in 2015.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "description": "The age cohort continues to surprise economists and defy sweeping generalizations, from how many live in poverty to how many drive cars", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Jana Kasperkevic", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "The age cohort continues to surprise economists and defy sweeping generalizations, from how many live in poverty to how many drive cars", "title": "One in five millennials lives in poverty, report finds", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/dec/26/us-census-bureau-report-one-in-five-millennials-poverty", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418775145623/9dcdcbef-d196-49b6-af40-6a7340bb1339-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=5b3ebc8e73f80dd0b0ac0460b04d1eba", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@guardian", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2014/dec/26/us-census-bureau-report-one-in-five-millennials-poverty?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/dec/26/us-census-bureau-report-one-in-five-millennials-poverty", "iphone": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2014/dec/26/us-census-bureau-report-one-in-five-millennials-poverty?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418775145623/9dcdcbef-d196-49b6-af40-6a7340bb1339-2060x1236.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kasperka"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2014/dec/26/us-census-bureau-report-one-in-five-millennials-poverty?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US personal finance,US income inequality", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2014-12-26T13:00:02.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jana-kasperkevic", "section": "Money", "modified_time": "2014-12-26T18:47:38.000Z", "tag": "US personal finance,US income inequality"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418775145623/9dcdcbef-d196-49b6-af40-6a7340bb1339-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=5749a42840a6ec933ac8fd2167bed9ff", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "US personal finance,US income inequality"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfff8\"", "article_summary": "It turns out that one in five millennials lives in poverty, according to a recent report released by the US Census Bureau.\nToday, 65% of young adults are employed, down from 69% in 1980.\nCompared to just 16% of their 1980s counterparts, 22% of young adults today have a college degree.\nMillennials are buying fewer cars: new car purchases for the age group dropped 30% between 2007 and 2012.\nDrive onProbably most surprising among the findings published in the interactive Young Adults: Then and Now is what hasn\u2019t changed: eight in 10 millennials drive to work."}
