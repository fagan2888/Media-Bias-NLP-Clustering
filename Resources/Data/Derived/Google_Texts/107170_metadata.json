Ted Cruz, R-Texas, argues a point during a Republican presidential primary debate at Fox Theatre, Thursday, March 3, 2016, in Detroit. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\n\n(CNSNews.com) - When asked \"what specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America,\" Sen. Ted Cruz called for less regulation and getting rid of \"all the taxes.\"\n\nFirst he criticized the \"left-wing policy\" that he said has \"utterly decimated\" a city like Detroit.\n\n\"You know, Henry Ford revolutionized automobile manufacturing and brought automobiles to the middle class. During World War II, Detroit provided -- funded the arsenals of democracy to help us win World War II.\n\n\"In the 1960s, Detroit was the Silicon Valley of America. It had a population of 2 million people, had the highest per capita income in the country. And then, for 50 years, left-wing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies, weak crime policies, and have driven the citizens out.\n\n\"This city now has just 700,000 citizens. There are vacant homes, one after the other after the other. Crime has been rampant, and it is an outrage. And let me say to folks in the media: That is a story that the media ought to be telling over and over again, the destruction of left-wing policies and the millions who have hurt because of it.\"\n\nDebate moderator Chris Wallace cut in: \"I'll give you 30 seconds to try to answer my question. What specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to Detroit and to train the residents here to do those jobs?\"\n\n\"The way you bring manufacturing back to America is, number one, you lift the regulations. As president, I will repeal Obamacare, the biggest job-killer in America,\" Cruz said.\n\n\"I will pull back the federal regulators, the EPA and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing.\n\n\"And my tax plan, which is a very, very detailed plan on the website, tedcruz.org, is what's called border adjustable. We get rid of all the taxes. We get rid of the corporate income tax and the death tax and the Obamacare taxes and the payroll tax. And we replace it with a 16 percent business flat tax that is border adjustable, which means all exports are entirely tax-free and all imports pay the 16 percent business flat tax. That's a 32 percent differential.\n\n\"What that will do, Chris, is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country, bring the steel industry back to this country, create an environment where when we compete on a fair and level playing field, American ingenuity can beat anyone. But right now, the federal government isn't giving us a level playing field.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "When asked \"what specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America,\" Sen.
