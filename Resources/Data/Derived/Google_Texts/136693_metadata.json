And considering researchers believe there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish by the year 2050, that's a problem.\n\nThe newly discovered bacteria eats a type of plastic found in many everyday products, such as water bottles. And for low-quality plastic, the strain could consume it in about six weeks.\n\nThere are still some issues that require further research on the topic, like how to adhere the bacteria to large amounts of plastic. Some also worry that possible toxins could be released from decomposition.\n\nWhile the study focused on a new strain of bacteria, it isn't the first time scientists have discovered new ways to degrade plastics. In September, one study found certain types of plastic, like Styrofoam, could be the next meal for some larvae.\n\nAnd researchers have been working for years to develop plastic that's degradable by water.\n\nThis video includes a clip from Arirang and images from Getty images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study found that a certain type of bacteria can break down low-quality plastic in about six weeks.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "A new study found that a certain type of bacteria can break down low-quality plastic in about six weeks.", "title": "This Newly Discovered Strain Of Bacteria Can Eat Plastic", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/this-newly-discovered-strain-of-bacteria-can-eat-plastic/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1457699331.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study found that a certain type of bacteria can break down low-quality plastic in about six weeks.", "title": "This Newly Discovered Strain Of Bacteria Can Eat Plastic", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/this-newly-discovered-strain-of-bacteria-can-eat-plastic/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1457699331.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=k3NGZ4MTE6ca5Pa6P6caDhWM6o7MZw8E&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://57951", "iphone": "newsy://57951", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://57951", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "Plastic eating bacteria, Study finds bacteria can eat plastic, plastic pollution, more plastic in ocean than fish, plastic, plastic garbage, Styrofoam, plastic decomposition, how long does it take plastic to break down, newsy, newsy videos", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1457699331.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The newly discovered bacteria eats a type of plastic found in many everyday products, such as water bottles.\nA new study found that a certain type of bacteria can break down low-quality plastic in about six weeks.\nA new study from Japanese scientists says a new strain of bacteria found outside a recycling facility eats plastic.\nAnd for low-quality plastic, the strain could consume it in about six weeks.\nAnd researchers have been working for years to develop plastic that's degradable by water."}
