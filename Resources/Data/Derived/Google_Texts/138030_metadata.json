Jurors, however, didn't hear who put the bottles there.\n\nBy July 25, 2011, authorities had recovered Ackerson's torso, parts of her legs and her head, which Brian Davis, a diver with the Houston Police Department, testified was so disfigured that he initially thought it was a leg bone.\n\nDr. Nobby Mambo, deputy chief medical examiner of the Galveston County Medical Examiner's Office, said Ackerson's head was in such a bad state that her skin was falling off the skull but that there were no fractures or injuries to the head.\n\nThere was, however, evidence that blood had collected on the back right portion of her scalp, Mambo said. But he couldn't determine if the bleeding occurred before or after her death.\n\nOn cross-examination by the defense, Mambo said the bleeding could have occurred as the result of a fall but said that such a fall would not have been fatal.\n\nThe defense has maintained that Ackerson tripped in the Hayeses' home on July 13, 2011, and that Grant Hayes had his wife leave with their children \u2013 two young boys he shared with Ackerson and a 1-month-old girl \u2013 so they would not see their injured mother.\n\nWhen Amanda Hayes returned, the defense says, Grant Hayes told her that Ackerson was actually OK and had left to go home.\n\nIt wasn't until the Hayeses arrived in Texas that she learned Ackerson had died.\n\nBy that time, defense attorneys say, Grant Hayes needed her help to persuade Berry to help them dispose of the remains, so she admitted to hurting Ackerson \u2013 but only because Grant Hayes had threatened to harm or kill her and their children.\n\nBut prosecutors say she did know and that she was resentful of and angry at Ackerson who was in the middle of a child custody fight.\n\nJurors saw security video of Amanda Hayes and the children at a Raleigh Chick-fil-A on the night of Ackerson's death. They also heard about a July 16, 2011, receipt for two ice coolers that police found in Amanda Hayes' purse.\n\nRaleigh police detective Sgt. Brian Hall also testified to finding several items in the dumpster trash from the couple's apartment, such as a black shower curtain and mats that had been missing from a hallway bathroom that had been empty and \"practically sterile\" when police searched the home.\n\n\n\nOther items recovered from the trash included several ice bags, two respirator masks, packaging for medium yellow household gloves, a discolored towel, blue rubber gloves and packaging for a pre-paid cellphone.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-02-04 09:14:00", "description": "A forensic dentist testified Tuesday that acid etching on a tooth recovered from Laura Ackerson's remains three years ago was consistent with a type of acid commonly used in construction.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-02-05 21:36:21", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13357710|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "A forensic dentist testified Tuesday that acid etching on a tooth recovered from Laura Ackerson's remains three years ago was consistent with a type of acid commonly used in construction.", "title": "Evidence of acid found in Ackerson murder cover-up :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/evidence-of-acid-found-in-ackerson-murder-cover-up/13357710/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2011/07/28/9925456/193629-ackerson-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "keywords": "Amanda Hayes, Grant Hayes, Laura Ackerson", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-04T09:14:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "A forensic dentist testified Tuesday that acid etching on a tooth recovered from Laura Ackerson's remains three years ago was consistent with a type of acid commonly used in construction.", "title": "Evidence of acid found in Ackerson murder cover-up :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/evidence-of-acid-found-in-ackerson-murder-cover-up/13357710/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2011/07/28/9925456/193629-ackerson-400x300.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "When Amanda Hayes returned, the defense says, Grant Hayes told her that Ackerson was actually OK and had left to go home.\nThey also heard about a July 16, 2011, receipt for two ice coolers that police found in Amanda Hayes' purse.\nJurors saw security video of Amanda Hayes and the children at a Raleigh Chick-fil-A on the night of Ackerson's death.\nThe state contends Hayes, 41, and Grant Hayes killed the 27-year-old Ackerson at their Raleigh apartment, cut up her body, and, four days later, drove it to Karen Berry's home to cover up the crime.\nFull video: Amanda Hayes murder trialBut Dr. Paul Stimson said he couldn't be sure that the slight dental erosion on the tooth's surface was from muriatic acid, and it was possible it could have come from a number of other types of acid."}
