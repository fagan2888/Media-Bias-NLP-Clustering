Pean was kept in a room overnight without ever seeing a psychiatrist as he became increasingly delusional.\n\nA scuffle with nurses ended with two armed security guards--both of whom were off-duty Houston Police moonlighting as hospital security--shocking Pean with a Taser and firing a bullet into his chest. Pean survived, but was deeply traumatized by the event. The bullet missed his heart by mere millimeters, according to the article.\n\n\"I thought of the hospital as a beacon, a safe haven,\" he told the Times. \"I can't quite believe that I ended up shot.\"\n\nPatients struggling with bipolar disorder and other mental health issues have been gunned down by security guards in Ohio and Virginia, according to the article, while patients were shocked to death with Tasers in Utah and Ohio.\n\nHospitals are not required to report all incidents of violence, so statistics are somewhat murky on the issue, but a survey published in 2015 by the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety found that between 2012 and 2014, hospitals and healthcare institutions reported a 40 percent increase in violent incidents, more than 10,000 of which were directed at healthcare employees.\n\nHospital administrators are divided on how to handle the issue, however. Not only do Tasers and guns set exactly the wrong tone in healthcare settings, uniforms, too, could make patients anxious, Antonio D. Martin, executive vice president of security in New York City's public hospital system told the Times.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospital violence: Providers respond as incidents spike [Special Report]\n\nWorkplace violence is on the rise and nursing staff are in particular danger\n\nNurses combat hospital violence with de-escalation tactics\n\nHospitals must encourage ER nurses to report violent incidents\n\nVisitors to Texas psych hospitals can bring guns; New list of hospital-owned physician practices", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spurred by a recent spike in the number of violent incidents against hospital staff and a rise in the number of hospital shootings, more and more U.S. hospitals are issuing weapons to security guards.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Spurred by a recent spike in the number of violent incidents against hospital staff and a rise in the number of hospital shootings, more and more U.S. hospitals are issuing weapons to security guards.", "title": "Armed hospital guards may hurt, not help violence prevention", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/armed-hospital-guards-may-hurt-not-help-violence-prevention/2016-02-12", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Hospital Security,Hospital Shootings,hospital violence,HR & Workforce Management,St. Joseph Medical Center", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management"}, "article_summary": "Spurred by a recent spike in the number of violent incidents against hospital staff and a rise in the number of hospital shootings, more and more U.S. hospitals are issuing weapons to security guards.\nA scuffle with nurses ended with two armed security guards--both of whom were off-duty Houston Police moonlighting as hospital security--shocking Pean with a Taser and firing a bullet into his chest.\n\"I thought of the hospital as a beacon, a safe haven,\" he told the Times.\nPean was kept in a room overnight without ever seeing a psychiatrist as he became increasingly delusional.\nThe Times cites the case of Alan Pean, who was admitted to Houston's St. Joseph Medical Center last August during a possible bipolar episode."}
