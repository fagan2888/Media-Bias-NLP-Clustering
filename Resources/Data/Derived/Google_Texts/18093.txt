NEW YORK (MainStreet) — When Mark Greutman along with his wife, Lauren, borrowed $10,000 from his parents ten years ago, they felt guilty, because the newlyweds were unsure if they could pay the money back.

“It was for a down payment on our first home,” Lauren Greutman told MainStreet. “We were straight out of college.”

In fact, Northwestern Mutual's 2014 Planning and Progress Study found that 48% of Americans experienced difficulty when asking to borrow money from parents, 42% when asking to be repaid for a loan and 37% about asking for a raise. That's compared to 21% who experienced difficulty discussing sex.

“Talking about money makes people very uncomfortable, and it appears to make people cringe the most,” said Greg Oberland, president with Northwestern Mutual. “These feelings can be tied to lack of knowledge and comfort level with the subject matter.”

“Asking for money is often seen as a sign of weakness,” said Kelley Long, a CPA and financial planner member with the National CPA Financial Literacy Commission. “Americans may have a hard time asking for that raise or that money back out of fear that they’ll be accused of being greedy or unable to provide adequately for themselves.”
