Ted Cruz, the Tea Party hero and likely future presidential candidate, which doesn\u2019t reveal much we didn\u2019t know before but does make at least one truth about Cruz abundantly clear: When it comes to the hardcore libertarian-inflected conservatism Cruz defends in the Senate and on the stump, he\u2019s not cynically playing to the GOP base with an eye to 2016. On the contrary, he means every word.\n\nAnyone interested in knowing everything they can about the GOP\u2019s biggest Dr. Seuss fan is advised to read the piece in its entirety. But for those of you who are less interested in devoting such a significant chunk of your all-too-finite life to the story of Ted Cruz, here are some of the most revealing tidbits.\n\nHe thinks Republican presidential candidates lose because they\u2019re insufficiently right-wing:\n\n\u201cIt is amazing that the wisdom of the chattering class to the Republicans is always, always, always \u2018Surrender your principles and agree with the Democrats,'\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s been true for my entire lifetime. The chattering classes have consistently said, \u2018You crazy Republicans have to give up on what you believe and become more like Democrats.\u2019 And, I would note, every time Republicans do that we lose.\u201d Cruz then offered a short history of recent Presidential politics. Richard Nixon ran as a conservative, twice a winner; Gerald Ford, moderate, loser; Ronald Reagan, also twice a winner. \u201cPresident George Herbert Walker Bush ran as a strong conservative, ran to continue the third term of Ronald Reagan, continue the Ronald Reagan revolution,\u201d Cruz went on. \u201cThen he raised taxes and in \u201992 ran as an establishment moderate\u2014same candidate, two very different campaigns. First one won, second one lost. In 1996, you got Bob Dole; 2000 and 2004, you have George W. Bush; 2008, John McCain; 2012, Mitt Romney. And what does the entire D.C. Republican consulting class say? \u2018In 2016, we need another establishment moderate!\u2019 Hasn\u2019t worked in four decades. \u2018But next time will be the time!\u2019\u201d\n\nHe thinks last year\u2019s government shutdown went just swell:\n\nCruz takes a different view of his role in the shutdown [than most]. While the government was closed, the Obamacare Web site, healthcare.gov, made its disastrous d\u00e9but, and the polls turned against the Democrats. Cruz felt that his political argument, not the failure of the Web site, produced the political turnaround. \u201cMany voices in Washington say the fight that we had last fall was not successful,\u201d Cruz told me. \u201cLike any good litigator, at times you think of a battle as a long-term battle. You don\u2019t always accomplish everything in the first skirmish. As a consequence of millions of people last summer and fall getting engaged in that battle, I believe we dramatically elevated the national debate over the harms of Obamacare. And today Democrats are running scared, and the prevailing wisdom is Republicans are quite likely to win control of the Senate because of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHe was nurtured by the conservative movement from a young age:\n\nWhen Cruz was in his early teens, in Houston, his parents enrolled him in an after-school program run by Rolland Storey, a retired energy executive who wanted to instill the values of the free market in young people. At the Free Enterprise Institute, Storey had his young charges read Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, and other authors revered by conservatives, and then give speeches at Rotary Clubs and similar venues around the state. \u201cThey created a spinoff group called the Constitutional Corroborators,\u201d Cruz told me. \u201cAnd they took five of the students, all of whom had been involved on the free-market side, and we focussed on studying the Constitution. So we\u2019d meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, for a couple of hours each night, and study the Constitution, read the Federalist Papers, read the Anti-Federalist Papers, read the debates on ratification. And we memorized a shortened mnemonic version of the Constitution.\u201d \u2026 \u201cTed was just an amazing speaker at fourteen, by far the most impressive student we ever had,\u201d Winston Elliott III, who became affiliated with Storey\u2019s organization when Cruz was a student and now serves as its president, told me. \u201cOur program is very much committed to private property, free markets, and constitutionally limited government. When it came to the Constitution, Rolland was a great believer in original intent, and so the focus was very much on what the Constitution says. We brought in a memorization expert. We wanted them to focus on the words. Ted was just an ideal student, because he just absorbed everything, and he came from a conservative family in the first place.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The clear takeaway: All that red meat he throws to the GOP base?
