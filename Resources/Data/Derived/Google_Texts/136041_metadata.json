What brought about the sale and spinoff?\n\nWe merged Lijit into Federated Media back in October 2010. The intent there was to put those companies together and take that combined entity public and that didn't work out for a host of reasons. But the Lijit business continued to take off and grow and the Federated Media business sort of stalled.\n\nAbout last year we started to notice a real discrepancy in the growth patterns of both businesses. The company formerly known as Lijit continued to grow, it was growing well over 100 percent year over year. What we decided to do is invest more into that business.\n\nWe found a buyer for the Federated Media business and put the cash into (the publisher platform).\n\nWe found that when we were building Lijit that online publishers \u2014 this could be local newspapers ... it could be niche magazines ... maybe digital-only publisher or even a blogger \u2014 they all share the same motivation. They want to engage their readership (base) and they want more readers.\n\nWhat we realized was those publishers lack any real advocate for them. Our business is about advocating for publishers and to help them make money.\n\nBy doing that and having a very publisher-centric or very advocacy-centric culture, we've amassed a network of more than 20,000 publishers representing well over 1 million websites.\n\n2.) A study released March 31 by the Association of National Advertising showed that 33 percent of advertisers understood the concept of programmatic buying. How do you overcome that challenge?\n\nI think (programmatic buying is) still early in its evolution. I think that the industry does itself a disservice, to a degree, by using too many acronyms.\n\n(Programmatic media) is simply using information and data to drive marketing decisions. That's all it is. If you understand that a webpage is about food and, in part, about Mexican food and you understand the person visiting the site is on a particular type of computer in a particular geographic location that might have certain demographic characteristics ... once you start to understand those things \u2014 which the Internet was purpose-built for \u2014 you can use that information to place a message, a coupon.\n\nProgrammatic advertising is simply using that information or that data to make a decision.\n\n3.) What growth are you seeing from real-time bidding?\n\nOnce you understand where you want to place (the ad), why not let other marketers bid on that? The publisher gets to have multiple people competing in an auction format.\n\nTwo years ago, I would say 30 percent of our revenue came from our real-time bidding infrastructure and today it's closer to 70 percent.\n\n4.) How do you intend to grow sovrn's operations?\n\nWe re-headquartered the company to Boulder from San Francisco. There are 98 employees total in the company, about 85 of them are in Boulder. We've got another dozen in San Francisco and a small presence in New York.\n\nA month ago, we had 20 open positions. We filled eight of them here in Boulder.\n\n5.) What does sovrn's future entail?\n\nThe business is growing really quickly and we have very large venture capitalists that have invested in us. (Boulder-based) Foundry Group is a lead investor. Oak Investment Partners is the largest investor.\n\nThey're in the business of getting multiples on their money. They're pushing us to grow as absolutely quickly as possible. Who knows what the outcome will be.\n\nThe asset is very attractive to a larger company or companies or (sovrn) can grow as a stand-alone firm that can go public.\n\nMy goal is to build a very fast-growing company and that will take care of itself.\n\n\u2014Alicia Wallace", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_25495549/5-questions-walter-knapp-ceo-sovrn", "sailthru.author": "By Alicia Wallace,  Camera Business Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:25495549:view"}, "startDate": "2014-04-06T16:32:28-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Earlier this year, Federated Media Publishing sold its content marketing business to LIN Digital Medial LLC for $22.4 million.", "title": "5 Questions with Walter Knapp, CEO of sovrn", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_25495549/5-questions-walter-knapp-ceo-sovrn", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0404/20140404__07DCBQNAw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County Business", "modificationDate": "2014-04-06T16:32:46-0600", "endDate": "2024-04-04T13:53:10-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder business news, Boulder Colorado, technology news, real estate, Boulder real estate, boulder business people, breaking business news, boulder, colorado, business, news,", "byline": "By Alicia Wallace,", "pubDate": "2014-04-06T16:34:08-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-04-06T16:32:28-0600", "sailthru.title": "5 Questions with Walter Knapp, CEO of sovrn", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0404/20140404__07DCBQNAw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Earlier this year, Federated Media Publishing sold its content marketing business to LIN Digital Medial LLC for $22.4 million.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_25495549/5-questions-walter-knapp-ceo-sovrn", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Earlier this year, Federated Media Publishing sold its content marketing business to LIN Digital Medial LLC for $22.4 million.", "title": "5 Questions with Walter Knapp, CEO of sovrn"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0404/20140404__07DCBQNAw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Walter Knapp, formerly chief operating officer for Federated Media, relocated the headquarters of sovrn to Boulder from San Francisco and since has reinvested the millions from the asset sale into the growing sovrn.\nBut the Lijit business continued to take off and grow and the Federated Media business sort of stalled.\nWe found a buyer for the Federated Media business and put the cash into (the publisher platform).\nAs a result of the purchase, Federated Media spun out its programmatic media business \u2014 created when the company acquired Boulder-based Lijit \u2014 into a stand-alone firm called sovrn.\nEarlier this year, Federated Media Publishing sold its content marketing business to LIN Digital Medial LLC for $22.4 million."}
