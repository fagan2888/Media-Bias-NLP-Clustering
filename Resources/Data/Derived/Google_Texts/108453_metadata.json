We have to speak truth to power,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a president that isn\u2019t willing to listen, that isn\u2019t going to sign lots of our bills into law; we have a Senate that has a very difficult process when it comes to actually getting bills voted on, so knowing that we have those constraints, we have to operate within those constraints.\u201d\n\nRyan, R-Wis., called the House\u2019s newly formed select panel an \u201cimportant\u201d aspect of the investigation into Planned Parenthood, which is under fire after a series of undercover videos depicted the organization\u2019s business practices.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Planned Parenthood should get a red cent from the taxpayer. I\u2019ve always believed that, even before these disgusting videos came out,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nThe undercover videos, released by the Center for Medical Progress, depict several of Planned Parenthood\u2019s senior executives negotiating the price \u201cper specimen\u201d of aborted babies\u2019 body parts. The videos spurred state and congressional investigations into Planned Parenthood.\n\nProfiting from the sale of human organs\u2014including those of the unborn\u2014is a violation of federal law in the United States.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has denied making a profit from illegal transactions, and the organization recently announced that it will no longer accept \u201creimbursement\u201d for donations of body parts to researchers.\n\nCecile Richards, Planned Parenthood\u2019s chief executive, recently wrote in a letter to Ryan that she hopes, as the new House speaker, he will ensure that investigations into her organization are \u201cfair and impartial.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is increasingly difficult to understand the basis for the ongoing investigations into Planned Parenthood. We have fully cooperated with the committees that have contacted us,\u201d Richards wrote.\n\nDan Holler, communications director of Heritage Action for America, told The Daily Signal that \u201cCongress will continue investigating Planned Parenthood, but pro-life lawmakers do not need another investigation to know that the organization is morally corrupt and undeserving of taxpayer funds.\u201d\n\nIn a statement following Ryan\u2019s election, Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, said that \u201cPaul Ryan is one of the best communicators we have in the fight to defend life.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis clarity, compassion and thoughtfulness on this issue will serve him well as he takes on the challenge of speakership,\u201d Dannenfelser said.\n\nDannenfelser added that both Ryan and his policy team are committed \u201cto protecting women and unborn children from the horrors of abortion as well as defending conscience rights.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Newly elected House Speaker Paul Ryan cast doubt on Congress's ability to end taxpayer funding for the nation's largest abortion provider.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Newly elected House Speaker Paul Ryan cast doubt on Congress's ability to end taxpayer funding for the nation's largest abortion provider.", "title": "Paul Ryan Says Defunding Planned Parenthood Is Unlikely", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151102_PaulRyanPP_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-03T06:38:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Hn7Rv3"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Newly elected House Speaker Paul Ryan cast doubt on Congress's ability to end taxpayer funding for the nation's largest abortion provider.", "title": "Paul Ryan Says Defunding Planned Parenthood Is Unlikely", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151102_PaulRyanPP_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published_time": "2015-11-02T14:47:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-03T06:38:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood videos, Planned Parenthood investigations, Center for Medical Progress"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25ac\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t think Planned Parenthood should get a red cent from the taxpayer.\nNewly elected House Speaker Paul Ryan vowed to move forward with an investigation of Planned Parenthood but also cast doubt on Congress\u2019 ability to end taxpayer funding for the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider.\nThe videos spurred state and congressional investigations into Planned Parenthood.\nPlanned Parenthood has denied making a profit from illegal transactions, and the organization recently announced that it will no longer accept \u201creimbursement\u201d for donations of body parts to researchers.\nThe undercover videos, released by the Center for Medical Progress, depict several of Planned Parenthood\u2019s senior executives negotiating the price \u201cper specimen\u201d of aborted babies\u2019 body parts."}
