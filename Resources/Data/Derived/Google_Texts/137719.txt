Lawler has said this restructuring process will be complete by, the latest, November 1.

In a letter sent to Chesapeake employees on Tuesday, Lawler stated,

"The organizational restructuring targeted to be complete by November 1 has concluded, and the initial transformation work is finished. By scaling E&P support services, reducing management layers, and aligning resources with a sharpened focus on accountability and efficiency, we have created a business built to deliver a sustainable and profitable future. As a result of the restructuring, approximately 800 employees – in various groups including Land, Operations, IT, HR, Legal, Facilities, A&D, Finance and Accounting – were informed today that they will be leaving the company."

Officials say currently, they have 6,000 employees in Oklahoma, including 3,500 in Oklahoma City. And they still have 11,000 employees nationwide.
