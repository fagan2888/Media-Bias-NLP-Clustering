I\u2019d say that your nose was just a little too short, your mouth just a little too wide. But yours was a face that a man could see in his dreams for the whole of his life. I\u2019d say that you were vain, selfish, cruel, deceitful. I\u2019d say that you were adorable. I\u2019d say that you were\u2026 Sibella.\n\nHis seduction isn\u2019t an ideal metaphor for America, whose imperfections don\u2019t serve to make our nation more adorable. Our imperfections are just that: blemishes and stains and deep bruises on our national psyche, on a truth many people hold to be self-evident, that we are the greatest nation in the world.\n\nBut ranking nations is a silly practice.\n\nThere is plenty wrong with America. Deep lingering racism that explodes into horrific violence. Stomach-churning economic inequality. Partisan rancor so entrenched that the two sides deal in mutually exclusive sets of facts. (Ours are right.)\n\nWe have our fair share of ugliness. In the past few weeks we\u2019ve watched Americans defend the most enduring symbol of our worst crime against humanity. We\u2019ve seen people express genuine pain at the thought of same-sex couples finally gaining a long-denied measure of dignity.\n\nPeople making the below-poverty-level minimum wage can\u2019t get a raise to something a little closer to the poverty level. Effective action on a crisis that threatens the homes and lives of millions of Americans is a nonstarter because a lot of people believe scientists make up science for fun. Those same people treat the government helping folks get health care coverage as an impeachable offense.\n\nToday is America\u2019s 239th birthday. And yes, there are serious problems in this country that need hard work and long struggle to fix. But I love this country, and here\u2019s why.\n\nAmerica isn\u2019t a set of borders on a map or the land stretched from sea to shining sea; it\u2019s not even the people who live here. America is that struggle. America is that hard work. I don\u2019t love America because it\u2019s imperfect, and I don\u2019t love America in spite of its imperfections. I love America for our constant pursuit of perfection.\n\nMillionaires and billionaires and giant corporations are far too powerful in this country. But when the Supreme Court handed down the Obergefell decision, company after company took to social media to celebrate with rainbow graphics. Did they do it because they\u2019re inherently good? Of course not \u2013 corporations are not people, my friends, and they sure as heck aren\u2019t moral.\n\nBehind every freshly rainbowed brand\u2019s avatar on Twitter or Facebook was years of hard work by LGBT activists who struggled tirelessly to force our country to recognize that they are human beings deserving of the full dignity and rights of citizenship. They\u2019re the ones who get credit for that day. They\u2019re the ones making America more perfect.\n\nSlavery ended not just because of the bloodshed of war but because of the hard work of people \u2013 slaves themselves and many others \u2013 who knew America could be better. Civil rights happened thanks to hard work. Suffrage happened thanks to hard work. The social safety net from Social Security to Obamacare happened thanks to hard work.\n\nAmerica isn\u2019t perfect; America will never be perfect. But America is trying, and that\u2019s honestly a beautiful thing to watch.\n\nThe conservatives who dissented in Obergefell claimed the decision was creating a new right to marriage out of whole cloth. But maybe it was time for a new right to emerge. What we know for certain is that decision made America a little more perfect.\n\nEvery protest where people stand up for justice, every campaign run on a shoestring to put a good person into public office, every meeting to kick off an effort that just might finally change things around here once and for all makes America a little more perfect.\n\nCelebrate America today. Don\u2019t celebrate our imperfections; celebrate the ongoing work to fulfill the promise our founders wrote into the document that turned us from a loose confederation of allied states into the United States of America: the promise to form a more perfect union.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America isn't perfect; America will never be perfect.
