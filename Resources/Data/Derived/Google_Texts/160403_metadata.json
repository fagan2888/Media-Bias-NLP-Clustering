Chris Christie, a Republican presidential candidate, on Thursday called the shooting deaths of two Virginia television journalists during a live broadcast \"an awful tragedy\" \u2014 but stressed that the U.S. needs to enforce current gun control laws, not create new ones.\n\nReporter Alison Parker, 24, and cameraman Adam Ward, 27, were shot to death Wednesday morning while conducting an on-air interview for WDBJ, a CBS affiliate in Roanoke. The shooter, Vester Lee Flanagan, a former newsman at the station, later committed suicide by shooting himself.\n\n\"It's just an awful tragedy,\" Christie said during an interview Thursday on \"CBS This Morning. \"My heart goes out to those folks who suffered that loss. It's a terrible thing. Most Americans are tired \u2014 tired of violence, tired of lawlessness. They want someone to do something about it.\"\n\nChristie was asked if New Jersey's low gun death rate was the result of the fact that his state has the second-toughest gun control laws in the U.S. A 2014 study by the Violence Policy Center that found New Jersey had the fifth-lowest gun death rate of any state.\n\n\"That's because (New Jersey has) a governor who enforces the law and also supports community policing,\" Christie said.\n\nMORE: N.J. fiancee of slain Va. cameraman witnessed shooting from control room, report says\n\nThe governor cited how Camden was once the most dangerous city in America, but that his administration replaced the local police force with a county force. Now, he said, the murder rate has gone down 62 percent.\n\n\"That's the kind of leadership we need in the country, and we don't have it right now,\" Christie said.\n\nStill, studies showing New Jersey's status as having among the lowest rate of gun violence in the nation pre-date Christie's governorship. New Jersey was fourth lowest in a Violence Policy Center report that used statistics from 2008, two years before Christie took office.\n\nAddressing the fact that Flanagan bought his gun legally despite having a history of complaints and fears from co-workers, Christie said the county needs to be \"doing more about mental health.\"\n\n\"We need to have more information about people's mental health background,\" he said. \"But we don't need new laws in this country to do that.\"\n\n\"All you hear now is: Let's have new laws. New laws,\" Christie continued. \"But we don't enforce the laws we have.\"\n\nGun control advocates and Democrats have taken the opposite approached in the wake of Wednesday's shooting.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest renewed President Obama's call for \"common sense\" gun legislation.\n\nDuring an interview Wednesday, Obama said the shooting \"breaks my heart.\"\n\n\"Sadly, these kinds of events happen too often,\" the president said. \"It's a testimony in this case to the fact that local journalists, they go into tough places. This isn't one of those situations. They should have been safe. I think it's one more argument for why we need to look at how we can reduce gun violence in this country.\"\n\n\"What we know is that the number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism,\" Obama added.\n\nDemocratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton tweeted Wednesday that \"we are smart enough \u2014 compassionate enough \u2014 to figure out how to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights with preventive measures.\"\n\nDuring a separate interview on \"Fox & Friends\" on Thursday morning, Christie said Obama, a Democrat, \"is sending a message that you only enforce the laws that you like or you agree with.\"\n\n\"He says this is worse than terrorism,\" the governor said. \"I don't know that anybody in America believes that they feel more threatened by this than they feel a threat by ISIS or by other terrorists around the world.\"\n\nChristie has frequently juxtaposed himself against Obama when it comes to the law recently. He released a campaign ad Monday saying Obama has allowed \"lawlessness\" to spread throughout the U.S. and the world, while Christie \u2014 former U.S. attorney in New Jersey \u2014 has a history of enforcing the law.\n\nThat message continued Thursday when Christie appeared before an on-air focus group during his \"Fox & Friends\" spot.\n\nAsked about how he would curb unauthorized immigration, Christie told the audience: \"You enforce the law.\"\n\n\"It's the same thing as guns,\" the governor said to the focus group, run by pollster Frank Luntz. \"There's laws on the books. The government is inept at doing their jobs.\"\n\nStill, Christie did say he would abolish one law tied to Obama: the Affordable Care Act \u2014 also known as Obamacare.\n\nHe told the focus group that Obamacare \"is a mess\" and that he would push to repeal it as president.\n\n\"Replace it and let the states fix it,\" Christie said. \"Why do we think one thing from Washington D.C. can fix those problems? Let the governors and the legislatures fix those problems.\"\n\nChristie was scheduled to appear on four early-morning talk shows Thursday.\n\nThe interviews came on the same day a new Quinnipiac University poll showed him in 9th place out of 17 candidates vying for the Republican presidential nod.\n\nChristie drew support from 4 percent of GOP voters across the nation. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump was in first place at 28 percent, followed by retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 12 percent.\n\nIn light of the poll, Christie was asked during the CBS interview what is going to keep him in the race.\n\n\"The people of the country,\" he said. \"That's what's going to keep me in this race. To continue to care about issues that bother them.\n\n\"Let's get serious,\" Christie added. \"These polls don't mean anything right now. What matters is what matters to the American people.\"\n\nChristie also dismissed the idea that the fact Trump and Carson sit atop the poll shows that America prefers political outsiders to career politicians.\n\n\"You talk about outsiders?\" the governor said. \"I'm a Republican in New Jersey. I wake up every morning an outsider. I know what it's like to fight against a Democratic legislature, against the powerful teachers union and special interests groups.\"\n\nBrent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com.
