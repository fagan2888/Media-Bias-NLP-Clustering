There are a number of studies, and it\u2019s well accepted that if you\u2019re going to lose your subsidized rent somewhere if you get a job, you\u2019re less likely to go out and get a job,\u201d Mr. Calabira said.\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d said Leslie Paige, vice president for policy and communications at the non-partisan Citizens Against Government Waste, \u201cbut there has to be a system that moves them in the direction of self sufficiency. The whole idea is to stabilize people financially so they can have their own home and pay their own rent out of their own income. \u201c\n\nHUD officials claimed that evicting over-income families would increase the amount of money needed to subsidize the dwellings for needy families.\n\n\u201cSuch changes could result in increased subsidy needs for the program because rents paid by overincome families reduce operating subsidies requested by public housing authorities,\u201d investigators wrote. \u201cHUD claimed that if all overincome families were removed from the public housing program, it would need to request nearly $116.5 million more in public housing operating subsidies.\u201d\n\nMr. Calabria explained that HUD has a financial incentive to keep higher income earning tenants in public housing.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say the person has made more income, and we know that. That means that they will pay more and more of their rent, and the housing authority will be able to use more of the subsidized dollars elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Calabria explained. Mr. Calabria added that HUD would have to use more resources in order to verify income on a regular basis, and to root out fraud entirely would cost more than the department would save in tax dollars.\n\n\u201cThe optimal amount of fraud is not zero, you\u2019ve got to spend resources finding it. You don\u2019t want to spend more resources then you\u2019re going to save,\u201d Mr. Calabria said.\n\nHUD has very little incentive to verify income levels for public housing tenants, a fact that Ms. Paige says has led the department to regard federal rules as mere suggestions.\n\n\u201cBased on our experience, if there\u2019s an opportunity to turn a blind eye to oversight, they\u2019re going to do it,\u201d Ms. Paige said. \u201cThere\u2019s no penalty on the housing authority for not following the rules. There are thousands of families on waiting lists and there\u2019s no penalty for doing this.\u201dIn its response to the report HUD questioned the inspector general\u2019s method for calculating taxpayer costs and argued that investigators over-emphasized the problem because over-income households only represent 2.6 percent of all public housing.\n\nBut investigators argued that HUD had done nothing to address even the most egregious examples of millionaires living in public housing.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not over-emphasized to as many as 25,226 families in need of housing that continue to wait for assistance because overincome families chose to remain in public housing rather than find housing in the unassisted market,\u201d auditors wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development gave low-income, taxpayer funded housing to millionaires, according to a new audit.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development gave low-income, taxpayer funded housing to millionaires, according to a new audit.", "title": "Feds gave public housing to millionaires: Audit", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/28/feds-gave-public-housing-to-millionaires-audit/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/04/998bc97cf54e7b13750f6a706700a1cb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/04/998bc97cf54e7b13750f6a706700a1cb.jpg", "description": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development gave low-income, taxpayer funded housing to millionaires, according to a new audit.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds gave public housing to millionaires: Audit"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Mark Calabria"}, "article_summary": "But investigators argued that HUD had done nothing to address even the most egregious examples of millionaires living in public housing.\nAuditors sampled housing authorities in 13 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and found 12,425 over-income families living in public housing while 579,890 families were on waiting lists.\n\u201cHUD claimed that if all overincome families were removed from the public housing program, it would need to request nearly $116.5 million more in public housing operating subsidies.\u201dMr. Calabria explained that HUD has a financial incentive to keep higher income earning tenants in public housing.\n\u201cThe problem is not over-emphasized to as many as 25,226 families in need of housing that continue to wait for assistance because overincome families chose to remain in public housing rather than find housing in the unassisted market,\u201d auditors wrote.\n\u201cSuch changes could result in increased subsidy needs for the program because rents paid by overincome families reduce operating subsidies requested by public housing authorities,\u201d investigators wrote."}
