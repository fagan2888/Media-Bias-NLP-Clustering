So Nolan Arenado made a phone call.\n\n\u201cI called Old Hickory, the bat company I use, and said: \u2018Hey, I play Wiffle Ball with my boys. Can we make some bats?\u2019 \u201d Arenado said. \u201cBecause every other bat we get is terrible. And I actually got my model in a Wiffle Ball bat. It has my name on it.\u201d\n\nModel 28NA-Wiffle. Nolan Arenado.\n\nThe bat is just like the 34-ounce, blond-and-black, maple tree trunk he used last season to hit 42 home runs. It is just like the one he\u2019ll use Monday night when the Rockies open their season against the Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix. But in miniature.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d he said.\n\nArenado plays Wiffle Ball at the end of every summer for 2\u00bd months. This major-leaguer, he\u2019s still a kid.\n\nFor 16 years, the Rockies\u2019 star third baseman, with his brothers and cousins and friends, wage a never-ending, always-rambunctious game of Wiffle Ball in Lake Forest, Calif. The game is always the same, now and forever. They just have to wait until after the 162-game major-league season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we do. We go play Wiffle Ball,\u201d Arenado said.\n\nHe is 24 now and about to start a fourth big-league season. He was 8 when the Wiffle Ball game started.\n\nWhen each regular season ends, Arenado said he is usually angry that it\u2019s done \u201cbecause we didn\u2019t go to the playoffs and baseball is over,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the only thing I look forward to is Wiffle Ball.\u201d\n\nThe rules of this Wiffle Ball game are simple.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t throw your hardest. Other than that, most anything goes,\u201d Arenado said.\n\nStandard ghost-runner rules apply if the bases are loaded. And they use the dotted Wiffle Ball rather than the slotted kind, to avoid wild, darting pitches. Also, they can throw the ball at a runner to force him out, but not at first base \u2014 fielders have to throw across the diamond. And there\u2019s a basketball-style possession arrow to help resolve arguments. If they can\u2019t agree on a call, it\u2019s settled by alternating sides.\n\n\u201cIf you saw our fights back in the day, you\u2019d understand why we changed that rule,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cNow there are less arguments. More talking trash, but less fistfights. Games actually finish now. Back then, there would be fights happening and games would be done before they finish. We\u2019d argue everything \u2014 someone\u2019s cheating, a safe or out call, whatever.\u201d\n\nThere are two teams. The first team, made up of professionals, is required to hit left-handed. The other three don\u2019t play pro ball.\n\nThe Pros \u2014 Nolan Arenado, Rockies third baseman; Jonah Arenado, brother, San Francisco Giants third-base prospect; Josh Fuentes, cousin, Rockies third-base prospect.\n\nVs. The Bros \u2014 Justin Fuentes, cousin; Alex Luaces, cousin; Gerardo Arenado, cousin.\n\nAnd occasional call-ups \u2014 Cousy Arenado, Nolan\u2019s brother, who now lives in Los Angeles, so he doesn\u2019t play all the time; Carlos Rodriguez, everybody\u2019s friend.\n\nSometimes they play in the backyard of Arenado\u2019s parents\u2019 house or in the outfield at El Toro High School so they can use the fences. Usually the game is at a greenbelt nearby.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a park that\u2019s good and the lights turn off at 9, so we usually like to start at 7,\u201d Arenado said.\n\nPeople walk by and don\u2019t notice the three-time Gold Glove winner. They\u2019re just kids.\n\nWhen Arenado was a 19-year-old Rockies minor-league prospect playing for Single-A Modesto, the team swung through on a road trip about an hour north of Lake Forest.\n\n\u201cI was playing in Rancho Cucamonga, and I drove home with my cousins. We were like, \u2018Dude, let\u2019s just go play,\u2019 \u201d Arenado said.\n\n\u201cWe played Wiffle Ball until like 3 in the morning. We drove behind an L.A. Fitness, because that was the only place we could find and there were little lights. But we turned the car lights on to play.\n\n\u201cI had a game the next day too, and I went like 0-for-4. It was a bad game. But I raked in Wiffle Ball, so it was cool.\u201d\n\nAwards are issued at the end of every Wiffle season. Justin was the Cy Young winner last season and Josh won a Gold Glove. Alex finished second in MVP voting.\n\n\u201cHe rakes in the beginning, but then he blows it,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cHe gets cold every year. He gets figured out.\u201d\n\nLast season\u2019s MVP?\n\n\u201cOh, me,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cThey know it. Write it down. Every year. MVP: Wiffle Ball, Nolan.\u201d\n\nSince Arenado\u2019s rookie year in 2013, the Rockies have yet to play meaningful games in September. He has never played in the playoffs. If one day the Rockies and their star third baseman reach the postseason, it will only delay the Wiffle Ball game.\n\nThat\u2019s why a plastic yellow bat will never work. The game will survive as long as the Old Hickory model 28NA-Wiffle will allow.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine ever stopping that game,\u201d Arenado said.\n\n\u201cWe love doing it. We talk about it all the time. The guys who don\u2019t play can\u2019t wait for us to get home to play. We all love baseball. We love watching the game and talking about the game, arguing about different players.\n\n\u201cOh, and make sure you put this in the article,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cI win the Triple Crown every year.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: @nickgroke or ngroke@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 Nolan Arenado always rakes in a never-ending Wiffle Ball game", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Nolan Arenado always rakes in a never-ending Wiffle Ball game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/03/rockies-nolan-arenado-always-rakes-in-a-never-ending-wiffle-ball-game/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160304__BN20160305_Z00_BNSP05BBNROCKIESp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160304__BN20160305_Z00_BNSP05BBNROCKIESp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-03T19:08:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T23:54:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5ae2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSo the only thing I look forward to is Wiffle Ball.\u201dThe rules of this Wiffle Ball game are simple.\nThe Pros \u2014 Nolan Arenado, Rockies third baseman; Jonah Arenado, brother, San Francisco Giants third-base prospect; Josh Fuentes, cousin, Rockies third-base prospect.\nBut I raked in Wiffle Ball, so it was cool.\u201dAwards are issued at the end of every Wiffle season.\nWe go play Wiffle Ball,\u201d Arenado said.\nIf one day the Rockies and their star third baseman reach the postseason, it will only delay the Wiffle Ball game."}
