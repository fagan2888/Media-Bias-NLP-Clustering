Republican Liz Cheney has made it official, she is running to become Wyoming’s next U.S. Representative.

Cheney is running on a platform of overturning policies put in place by the Obama administration. Cheney said that includes what she calls the “war on coal”

“As a state we have to end the war on coal. Our economy relies on it and our economy depends upon us being able to roll that back. And that means you’ve gotta be able to stand up on a national stage to get others to understand that the issue of Wyoming coal is not just a Wyoming issue. It’s an issue that effects anybody that likes electricity.”

Cheney also wants to repeal and replace the affordable care act.

“We gotta be concerned about health care in this country, we’ve gotta be concerned about making sure that people have access to insurance. I’d like to see things like competition across state lines. I think that when you give power to the consumer and you force the insurance companies to compete, you’re are clearly gonna get a better value for your dollar. And you are going to put individuals in charge and not insurance companies and certainly not the government.”

Cheney said that although Congress is dysfunctional, she said that she is a proven conservative leader with a national voice, and that could make a difference. Current U.S. Representative Cynthia Lummis says she will not seek re-election.
