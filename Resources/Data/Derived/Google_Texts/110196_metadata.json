Paul Ryan\u2019s Ways and Means Committee, \u201cThe measure would repeal ObamaCare\u2019s individual and employer mandates for obtaining and providing insurance, along with two major taxes used to pay for the health care law: A 40 percent tax on high-cost health plans, called the \u201cCadillac Tax,\u201d and a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices.\u201d\n\nAccording to Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee here are a few of the achievements that Republicans are looking to roll back by repealing Obamacare:\n\n\u2013 17.6 million uninsured Americans have gained health insurance coverage since enactment of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u2013 The rate of uninsured has dropped to historic lows \u2013 currently just 11.4%.\n\n\u2013 As of March 31, 2015, 10.2 million consumers had coverage in Health Insurance Marketplace plans.\n\n\u2013 50,000 lives have been saved due to a reduction in hospital-acquired conditions, such as infections\n\n\u2013 The private sector has added 13 million jobs.\n\n\u2013 Americans have saved $9 billion since 2011, because of the new requirement that insurers have to spend at least 80% of every premium dollar they receive on quality health care.\n\n\u2013 $19.2 billion has been recovered for taxpayers from stepped-up anti-fraud efforts in Medicare and other health programs under the ACA.\n\nHouse Republicans are returning to repealing Obamacare because they can\u2019t agree with each other on passing anything. The 61st attempt to repeal the ACA will end up the same way that the other 60 attempts did.\n\nSince Republicans are using the reconciliation process to pass the repeal, the bill will get to President Obama\u2019s desk. However, the President will promptly veto the bill, and Republicans will have once again accomplished nothing.\n\nThe American people should get used to this sort of behavior because it is going to happen even more in the post-Boehner House. Mitch McConnell is already using the tactic of bringing up defeated bills for votes repeatedly, and the extremist Republicans in the House believe that if they keep passing Obamacare repeal bills eventually the President will sign one of them.\n\nOf course, this is never going to happen, but their belief that it might is one of the reasons why Republicans have turned Congress into a joke.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans are foolishly about to try to repeal Obamacare for the 61st time.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "House Republicans are foolishly about to try to repeal Obamacare for the 61st time.", "title": "Laughingstock House Republicans Set To Try To Repeal Obamacare For The 61st Time", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/09/29/house-republicans-set-repeal-obamacare-61st-time.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/paul-ryan.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-29T16:14:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,61 votes to repeal obamacare,number of times Republicans tried to repeal obamacare,republicans repeal obamacare,republicans vote to repeal obamacare,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-09-29T16:14:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-29T16:14:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "61 votes to repeal obamacare, number of times Republicans tried to repeal obamacare, republicans repeal obamacare, republicans vote to repeal obamacare"}, "article_summary": "House Republicans are foolishly about to try to repeal Obamacare for the 61st time.\nHouse Republicans are returning to repealing Obamacare because they can\u2019t agree with each other on passing anything.\n\u2013 As of March 31, 2015, 10.2 million consumers had coverage in Health Insurance Marketplace plans.\nSince Republicans are using the reconciliation process to pass the repeal, the bill will get to President Obama\u2019s desk.\n\u2013 Americans have saved $9 billion since 2011, because of the new requirement that insurers have to spend at least 80% of every premium dollar they receive on quality health care."}
