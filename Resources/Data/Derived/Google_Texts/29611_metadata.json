IntelliRide took the wheel on May 1, but clearly wasn\u2019t road ready.\n\nRuth Firley, a 68-year-old Lincoln woman who has diabetes and spinal problems and uses a wheelchair, says she was unable to get through to schedule rides for almost two weeks. When she finally got through, she was put on hold for about 7 minutes.\n\nHer troubles didn\u2019t end there. Though she was able to schedule rides, nobody showed up for one appointment, the driver arrived a day early for another ride, she was taken to the wrong address once and was left at the Nebraska Heart Institute without a ride home. She says she knows other people who\u2019ve been left at the wrong address and abandoned at doctor\u2019s offices. An Omaha man missed several dialysis appointments. Some doctors have given patients rides home, she said.\n\n\u201cIntelliRide was not equipped to handle the contract,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond a mess.\u201d\n\nFirley says she never waited for more than a half hour when trips were handled by the previous transportation broker, AMR.\n\n\u201cI never feared riding with them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey took the safety of their clients to heart \u2013 a whole different atmosphere than what we\u2019re getting now.\u201d\n\nShe also suspects the drivers are taking more circuitous routes to make more money; when she has questioned the long drives, drivers have told her once they hit the eight-mile mark, they\u2019re paid a flat rate of $45.\n\nKathie Osterman, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Human Services, said by the end of May, 21,291 rides had been given and 81 percent were completed on time. The average hold time for calls was 6 minutes, 22 seconds.\n\nAs of July 2, 99 percent of clients were picked up within an hour of the requested time and 83 percent were dropped off at or before the requested time.\n\n\u201cIntelliRide continues to work with transportation providers to improve on this,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever a complaint is received it is reviewed and there is a followup.\u201d\n\nKirby Young, president of Servant Cab, one of 1,300 transportation providers, said since IntelliRide took over as the broker, he doesn\u2019t get half as many calls for rides.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the Intelliride system is a major problem,\u201d he said.\n\nIntelliRide\u2019s call center was understaffed and didn\u2019t have enough phone lines to handle the crush of clients, he said.\n\n\u201cI answer calls every day, all day long, from people who are frustrated,\u201d Young said. IntelliRide is \u201cstill trying to dig out.\u201d\n\nIntelliRide has changed the system by having providers pick up several patients headed in the same direction, he said, which will be more efficient in the long run. But it takes some getting used to.\n\n\u201cPeople are used to being taken from A to B,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Firley, it\u2019s literally a pain in the spine. On June 11, a long, bumpy trip sent both her and her caretaker to the emergency room, they said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be transported all over town,\u201d she said.\n\nWith AMR, clients had to call three days in advance, Young said, but IntelliRide is more computerized and eventually clients will be able to schedule same-day trips.\n\n\u201cOnce it\u2019s working right\u2026 it will get a lot better,\u201d he said.\n\nIntelliRide did not respond to a request for comment, but has said it hired additional employees and temporarily expanded its call center hours to try to meet demand.\n\nOsterman said the average hold time for callers is down to 3 minutes, 17 seconds as of July 2, but Firley said she always waits longer than that. She recently waited 22 minutes and over 8 minutes on hold.\n\nShe\u2019s been emailing the governor\u2019s office and calling reporters to try to advocate for others who\u2019ve been left on curbsides with no way to get home.\n\n\u201cI have a lot wrong with me; I\u2019m probably not long for this Earth, but I just feel that somebody needs to be a spokesperson,\u201d she said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t welfare babies, we are Medicaid recipients.\u201d\n\nFollow Deena on Twitter at @DeenaNEWatchdog\n\nEditor\u2019s note: to subscribe to News Updates from Nebraska Watchdog at no cost, click here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A new broker hired by the state of Nebraska to coordinate rides for Medicaid recipients to doctor appointments has left disabled people waiting at doctor\u2019s offices for hours as its phone lines jammed up with people trying to schedule rides.", "title": "Left behind: Nebraska ride program strands the disabled - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/07/DSCN0029.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-09T08:33:44+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/157801/nebraska-ride/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "National", "tag": "AMR,DHHS Nebraska,disabled rides Medicaid Nebraska,IntelliRide,Kathie Osterman,Kirby Young,medicaid,Ruth Firley,Servant Cab", "published_time": "2014-07-07T04:00:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T08:33:44+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A new broker hired by the state of Nebraska to coordinate rides for Medicaid recipients to doctor appointments has left disabled people waiting at doctor\u2019s offices for hours as its phone lines jammed up with people trying to schedule rides.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/07/DSCN0029.jpg"}, "title": "Left behind: Nebraska ride program strands the disabled - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "A new broker hired by the state of Nebraska to coordinate rides for Medicaid recipients to doctor appointments has left disabled people waiting at doctor\u2019s offices for hours as its phone lines jammed up with people trying to schedule rides."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda041\"", "article_summary": "Ruth Firley, a 68-year-old Lincoln woman who has diabetes and spinal problems and uses a wheelchair, says she was unable to get through to schedule rides for almost two weeks.\nShe says she knows other people who\u2019ve been left at the wrong address and abandoned at doctor\u2019s offices.\n\u2013 A new broker hired by the state of Nebraska to coordinate rides for Medicaid recipients to doctor appointments has left disabled people waiting at doctor\u2019s offices for hours as its phone lines jammed with callers trying to schedule rides.\nThough she was able to schedule rides, nobody showed up for one appointment, the driver arrived a day early for another ride, she was taken to the wrong address once and was left at the Nebraska Heart Institute without a ride home.\nShe\u2019s been emailing the governor\u2019s office and calling reporters to try to advocate for others who\u2019ve been left on curbsides with no way to get home."}
