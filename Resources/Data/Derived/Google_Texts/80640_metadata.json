Who knows how they were able to book such a notorious camera-shy recluse \u2014 hypnotism/witchcraft, presumably. It was during this appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that McCain lent his support to a burgeoning front of side-criticism over the President\u2019s \u201chandling of Ebola,\u201d so to speak: That Obama needs to appoint a \u201cczar\u201d to coordinate the government\u2019s response. \u201cI\u2019d like to know who\u2019s in charge,\u201d McCain said, noting that the people of Arizona are \u201cnot comforted\u201d and \u201cneed more reassurance\u201d that they will not all die from a virus that has infected two people in Texas.\n\nMcCain\u2019s call for a showy bureaucratic shuffling to allay the fears of the American public is bringing more attention to the \u201cEbola Czar\u201d cause that his fellow Republicans have been championing for weeks. Rep. Jack Kingston said earlier this month that \u201cwhile he hate[s] to invoke the term \u2018czar,'\u201d we need a lil\u2019 czar action on the Ebola front. And last week, Sen. Jerry Moran and Rep. Frank Wolf sent a letter to the White House calling for an Ebola czar to serve as point person for the administration\u2019s response to the virus.\n\nSo. We\u2019re into administration \u201cczars\u201d now, are we?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way. Back in the old days (2009), the White House suffered constant criticism for appointing \u201cczars,\u201d a terrifyingly monarchical, Russian word that critics and the media applied to various policy point-people in the administration. The administration was appointing policy \u201cczars,\u201d the criticism went, to sidestep the vetting and oversight of a Senate confirmation process. Nevermind that many of the so-called \u201cczars\u201d were, in fact, confirmed by the Senate \u2014 assistant secretaries or whatever \u2014 and that any administration has the fairly obvious right to employ policy advisors. Nevermind that. Obama was doing a run-around on Congress and the Constitution.\n\nAmong those complaining about czars in 2009? John McCain\u2026\n\nObama has more czars than the Romanovs - who ruled Russia for 3 centuries. Romanovs 18, cyberczar makes 20. \u2014 John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) May 30, 2009\n\n\u2026Jack Kingston\u2026\n\nPence\u2019s call came after Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) introduced legislation in July that would effectively end the president\u2019s power to appoint special advisers. Kingston, who has compiled a list of 34 Obama czars, said transparency is the issue. \u201cThese guys don\u2019t get vetted,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey have staff and offices and immense responsibility. All that needs to come before Congress.\u201d\n\n\u2026Frank Wolf\u2026\n\n\u201cThe American people have a right to know who is advising the president and whether they have been thoroughly vetted,\u201d Wolf wrote.In addition to writing the president, Wolf is cosponsoring legislation that would prohibit the president from appointing high-ranking officials without going through the Senate\u2019s confirmation process. The Czar Accountability and Reform Act (H.R. 3226) also would eliminate funding for czars who hold senior policy-making positions who carry out the same functions as officials who have been confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\u2026 and Jerry Moran.\n\nCongressman Jerry Moran recently introduced H. Res. 778 \u2013 a resolution to formally express Congress\u2019 opposition to the \u201cczar\u201d appointment process while calling for the President to cease all \u201cczar\u201d appointments. Moran also sponsored H.R. 3226, the Czar Accountability and Reform Act of 2009, to prohibit paying the salary of a \u201cczar\u201d that has not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. \u201cThe Obama Administration\u2019s excessive \u0091czar\u2019 appointments exemplify the ever-expanding federal bureaucracy and big government that Kansans and Americans have grown tired of,\u201d Moran said. \u201cThe increasing use of unconfirmed government officials is irresponsible \u2013 it is time Congress stops the executive branch from abusing this flawed appointment process. I have introduced this resolution to condemn the increased use of unconfirmed government officials and heads of agencies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "McCain and others want Obama to appoint a flashy \"Ebola Czar\" to allay the public panic... that they're creating", "title": "John McCain\u2019s new humiliation: Why his \u201cEbola Czar\u201d idea is particularly ludicrous", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "McCain and others want Obama to appoint a flashy \"Ebola Czar\" to allay the public panic... that they're creating", "title": "John McCain\u2019s new humiliation: Why his \u201cEbola Czar\u201d idea is particularly ludicrous", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/13/john_mccains_new_humiliation_why_his_ebola_czar_idea_is_particularly_ludicrous/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/john_mccain.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "McCain and others want Obama to appoint a flashy \"Ebola Czar\" to allay the public panic... that they're creating", "title": "John McCain\u2019s new humiliation: Why his \u201cEbola Czar\u201d idea is particularly ludicrous", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/john_mccain.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Newell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, Colin Powell, Czars, ebola, Editor's Picks, GOP, Health, Jack Kingston, Jerry Moran, John McCain, President Obama, White House", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "McCain\u2019s call for a showy bureaucratic shuffling to allay the fears of the American public is bringing more attention to the \u201cEbola Czar\u201d cause that his fellow Republicans have been championing for weeks.\nTopics: 2014 elections, Colin Powell, Czars, ebola, Editor's Picks, GOP, Health, Jack Kingston, Jerry Moran, John McCain, President Obama, White House, Politics NewsYou will never believe this, but U.S.\nKingston, who has compiled a list of 34 Obama czars, said transparency is the issue.\n778 \u2013 a resolution to formally express Congress\u2019 opposition to the \u201cczar\u201d appointment process while calling for the President to cease all \u201cczar\u201d appointments.\nRep.
