Not to worry: Cranston's portrayal of Lyndon B. Johnson in \"All the Way\" will be preserved in the adapted HBO movie that's slotted to air next spring.\n\nThe Tony Award-winning play, written by Robert Schenkkan, tells the story of LBJ's first hundred-or-so days in office. Assuming the Presidency in the wake of John F. Kennedy's assassination, Johnson sought both to heal the nation's trauma and to capitalize on it by aggressively forwarding legislation that Kennedy had proposed \u2014 most notably the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nJay Roach is the director of the \"All the Way\" adaptation. He's a veteran director of political movies, having dramatized John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate in \"Game Change\" (2012), and the story of the 2000 Florida vote epsiode in \"Recount\" (2008).\n\nJohn Horn recently met with Jay Roach on the set of \"All the Way.\" Roach was in the midst of shooting the scene of the newly inaugurated President Johnson addressing Congress days after Kennedy's assassination.\n\nWhat does it feel like to walk in as a director and see what your production design and extras are able to do in this space?\n\nIt\u2019s inspiring and humbling as a \u2013 though this sounds cheesy \u2013 student of history. I\u2019m really fascinated with those moments where things were very fragile and could have completely unraveled with a different path taken by someone. That Johnson chose this path at this moment enabled us to overcome an incredible tragedy at a fragile time. I\u2019m moved by people who still believe in democracy and government as a force for good . . . That we can pull together in any form, much less on such a grand scale with so many interests. Clearly, one would wish that more constructive work could be done. But that an institution like this even exists, and that democracy works as well as it does, is moving to me.\n\nIn political films that may not always be factually accurate, is there an overriding idea that you have about what you want to tell people?\n\nThe complexity of [LBJ's] psychological choices \u2014 the dysfunction in the man, coupled with the unbelievable capability to actually get something done as important as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2014 I have to get that right.\n\nIs there a movie you think about as \u201cgetting it right\u201d in terms of the way of dramatizing politics, but also revealing some other truth?\n\nI always go back to \"All The President\u2019s Men.\"\n\nOne of the interesting things about that story is that Hal Holbrook\u2019s character [Deep Throat] \u2014 who is Mark Felt, as we now know \u2014 never said, Follow the money. He never said that! He gave out a series of details that implied there there might be a paper trail, but the film was so much better because he said, Follow the money. We could understand it. We could see what they were up to . . . So that to me is a prime example of, they got that right, but they took some license.\n\nThis movie will probably come out in the spring. We\u2019ll be in the heat of the Presidential elections.\n\nWhat I think is relevant today in LBJ\u2019s story \u2014 particularly in these 11 months from November \u201963 to when he\u2019s reelected in November \u201964 \u2014 [is] that it\u2019s a story about how true statesmen get together and figure out how to get something really important accomplished, even when they could not be more diametrically opposed . . . [LBJ] found a way to use all the forces that were part of his own dysfunction and function, and turn his own drive into accomplishment. He was able to actually fight for something through all of his political contradictions and his ego and all of the other psychological flaws that he had. He knew what mattered. And he fought for it and he didn\u2019t let anybody step so far out of line that he couldn\u2019t pull it off.\n\nAs someone who clearly cares about politics, what is it like to step inside the world of this film \u2014 in which politics actually worked \u2014 and then walk into the real world, where politics doesn\u2019t work as we would define?", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "The director has taken on politics in films such as \"Game Change\" and \"Recount,\" and now he's adapting the Tony Award-winning play about a key year in Lyndon Johnson's presidency.", "title": "Jay Roach looks to LBJ in 'All the Way' for hope in democracy", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2015/11/10/45179/jay-roach-looks-to-lbj-in-all-the-way-for-hope-in/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/03b510039810020d48d40a3f42cf50a0/127738-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 683}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
