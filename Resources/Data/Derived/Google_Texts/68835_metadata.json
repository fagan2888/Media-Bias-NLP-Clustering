Russell Bernice, CC-BY-2.0\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio of New York City has decided to walk a mile in the well-worn shoes of former mayor Michael Bloomberg in the name of community health. On Wednesday, the city\u2019s Board of Health asked the court of appeals in Albany to reinstate Bloomberg\u2019s Portion Cap Rule (the so-called soda ban), which prohibits restaurants and other businesses from selling sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces.\n\nThe question on everyone\u2019s mind is: Can de Blasio succeed where Bloomberg failed?\n\nIn a new twist on an old law, the city is now arguing that the Board of Health \u201chas legislative authority in the area of public health\u201d and so any previous ruling under the Bloomberg administration does not apply. In support of its argument, the board said its authority has been previously exercised \u2014 and repeatedly upheld by the courts \u2014 in such instances as \u201crequiring fluoridation of the water supply and posting of calorie counts on menus, and by restricting the use of lead paint in residences and trans fats in restaurants.\u201d A summary of the city\u2019s argument further notes that the board\u2019s \u201cspecial structure\u201d allows serious issues of public health to be addressed \u201cwithout being subjected to the vagaries of the political process.\" (Do you mean those vagaries that protect citizen\u2019s constitutional rights?)\n\nHistory of the Big Ban\n\nIn 2012, then-mayor Bloomberg presumably feeling victorious after successfully banishing public smoking, declared war on the popular, oversized sugary beverages. In his attempt to combat obesity, Bloomberg proposed a regulation prohibiting restaurants, fast-food chains, delis, movie theaters, sports stadiums, food carts, and similar businesses from selling soda or any sugar-sweetened drink in a cup 16 ounces or larger.\n\nJust one day before the new law was to take effect in March 2013, a court declared the law unconstitutional, a decision that was next upheld in July by a state appeals court. In its decision, Reuters reported at the time, the state supreme court's appellate division stated any regulation prohibiting businesses from selling the large drinks \"violated the state principle of separation of powers.\"\n\nIn trying to impose the ban, then, Bloomberg was seen as overstepping his authority. Will the courts view de Blasio in the same light?\n\n\u201cThe link between sugary drinks and obesity is no longer in question,\u201d stated Dr. Mary T. Bassett, the city\u2019s health commissioner, in a press release announcing the decision to revive Bloomberg\u2019s failed regulation. \u201cWhat we do need to question is the beverage industry's continued promotion of these unhealthy products in communities most burdened by obesity and diabetes.\u201d\n\nThe decision on the case, New York Statewide Coalition of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce v. New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, New York State Court of Appeals No. 134, is forthcoming.\n\n\u201cWe are confident the rule will be upheld and that New York City will continue to innovate and work to protect all New Yorkers from the illnesses that threaten the health of our population,\u201d Bassett said, further noting the regulation to be \u201ca necessary and important step toward improving the health of New Yorkers regardless of their zip code.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "new york city, de blasio, bloomberg, soda ban, big gulp, big apple, public health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "New York City\u2019s Board of Health asked the state's court of appeals to reinstate Bloomberg\u2019s soda ban, which prohibits businesses from selling sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces.", "title": "Big Gulp Again Under Fire In The Big Apple", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-york-city-big-soda-ban-revived-mayor-de-blasio-will-law-be-ruled-unconstitutional-again-286608", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/big-gulp.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New York City\u2019s Board of Health asked the state's court of appeals to reinstate Bloomberg\u2019s soda ban, which prohibits businesses from selling sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces.", "title": "Big Gulp Again Under Fire In The Big Apple", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-york-city-big-soda-ban-revived-mayor-de-blasio-will-law-be-ruled-unconstitutional-again-286608", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/big-gulp.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/big-gulp.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-05T12:54:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-05T12:54:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "New York City\u2019s Board of Health asked the state's court of appeals to reinstate Bloomberg\u2019s soda ban, which prohibits businesses from selling sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee3d\"", "article_summary": "New York City\u2019s Board of Health asked the state's court of appeals to reinstate Bloomberg\u2019s soda ban, which prohibits businesses from selling sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces.\nRussell Bernice, CC-BY-2.0Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City has decided to walk a mile in the well-worn shoes of former mayor Michael Bloomberg in the name of community health.\n\u201cThe link between sugary drinks and obesity is no longer in question,\u201d stated Dr. Mary T.
