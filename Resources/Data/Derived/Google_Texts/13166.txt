Health Care: Where do Canadians go on vacation? The usual places. But many of them might also be found in unusual spots. And they’re not there for fun. They’re there to get medical treatment they can’t get at home.

According to data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information, as many as 41,838 Canadians — out of a population of about 35 million — left the country last year for health care treatment. More than 42,000 left in 2012, while more than 46,000 sought treatment elsewhere the year before.

Destinations, according to a University of Minnesota study that looked at Canadian companies that arrange medical tourism, include Costa Rica, India, Thailand and the U.S. Some companies even send clients to Mexico, Turkey, Poland and the Dominican Republic.

The Fraser Institute of Canada calls the 2013 figure a conservative estimate and, though some will argue otherwise, believes it is a sizable number, one that says something deeply damning about Canadian care.

“Understanding how many Canadians receive their health care in another country each year gives some insight into the state of health care in Canada,” Nadeem Esmail wrote in the May/June 2013 Fraser Forum.

“One of the unfortunate realities of Canada’s monopolistic health care system is that some people feel they have no choice but to seek the care they need outside the country,” Esmail and Bacchus Barua wrote in an op-ed published last month in a couple of Canadian newspapers. “And who can blame them?”

Those who leave Canada for treatment do so for a number of reasons, but they are all related to the country’s government-run health care system.

Some leave due to Canada’s long and sometimes deadly waiting periods. Others are treated outside the country because there is “a lack of available resources or the fact that some procedures or equipment are not provided in their home jurisdiction,” Esmail and Barua wrote.

Further reasons for leaving, says Fraser, include:

 Concerns about the quality of medicine in a country’s whose system destroys the incentives needed to build more advanced facilities and develop higher tech medicine.

 Better treatment outcomes in other countries.

 Avoidance of the consequences of waiting for care, which include deteriorating health and poorer post-treatment outcomes that can result in disability or even death.

 Bypassing the inevitable delays in care so patients can be treated and return to their lives sooner.

The citizens of a developed nation shouldn’t have to travel to less-developed nations to get their health care. Unfortunately, that’s the inevitable product of a state-run system such as the one in Canada.
