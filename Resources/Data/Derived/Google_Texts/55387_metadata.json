In broad terms, risk is the possibility of harm, injury, loss or destruction.\n\nTo manage risk you need to: identify the risks to which you are exposed; identify the potential losses associated with each risk; map out a strategy for dealing with the risks you\u2019ve identified; and implement and periodically review the strategy.\n\nSome people choose to avoid certain types of risk altogether. For example, you might avoid hang gliding. You might opt to retain part of other risks. For example, you might choose a higher deductible on your medical insurance. Some risks cannot be reasonably retained such as the risks of a major health care crisis, loss of income or premature death.\n\nPerhaps the best way to manage your risks is to purchase insurance. By weighing the price of protection against the potential benefits, most people conclude that insurance offers the most effective, cost-efficient way to cope with risk.\n\nSome insurance policies are mandated by laws or lenders. Homeowners and automobile insurance, for examples. But don\u2019t overlook the need to protect value of jewelry, computers and antiques.\n\nProtecting your finances from the ravages of illnesses and accidents is a primary risk management need. Fortunately, the Affordable Care Act has made health care available to many more individuals. Of course, there are limits on coverage and costs, but you get what you pay for. Still, something is better than nothing in this vital area.\n\nWhat is your greatest asset? It has to be your human capital, the ability to earn income. Have you protected it? Disability insurance coverage might be one of the most needed but underappreciated types of protection.\n\nThe specter of premature death frightens us the most, though it might be statistically a lower risk. Life insurance, in one of its various forms, can protect your survivors and fulfill your family\u2019s dreams to own a home, afford college and secure a regular income after a tragedy.\n\nFolks ask me if the risk of a stock market crash keeps me up at night. I respond, \u201cNo, but I do worry about people\u2019s long-term care planning.\u201d As we age we need to think about impairment, consider our options, and make a plan that might include some form and amount of long-term care insurance.\n\nFinally, but critically, one of the best protection tools is to build up a cash reserve. So many financial crises occur when people have to go into debt to deal with short-term emergencies.\n\nSo manage life\u2019s risk wisely with insurance. Make a place in your budget for insurance premiums. They are not \u201cthrowing away money,\u201d on the contrary, purchasing insurance is an expression of preparation, love and caring.\n\nPaul Fain, a certified financial planner and president of Asset Planning Corp., may be reached at pkf@assetplanningcorp.com.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Paul Fain: Hedge risk with insurance", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/business/columnists/paul-fain/paul-fain-hedge-risk-with-insurance-ep-1095011661-361937941.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/fain_18684541_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 456}, "type": "article", "description": "Next to budgeting, probably the least titillating topic in personal financial planning is protection planning \u2014 insurance.", "title": "Paul Fain: Hedge risk with insurance"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/fain_18684541_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Next to budgeting, probably the least titillating topic in personal financial planning is protection planning \u2014 insurance.", "site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Paul Fain: Hedge risk with insurance"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "free", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6c1\"", "article_summary": "<p>Paul Fain</p>Next to budgeting, probably the least titillating topic in personal financial planning is protection planning \u2014 insurance.\nSo manage life\u2019s risk wisely with insurance.\nBy weighing the price of protection against the potential benefits, most people conclude that insurance offers the most effective, cost-efficient way to cope with risk.\nTo manage risk you need to: identify the risks to which you are exposed; identify the potential losses associated with each risk; map out a strategy for dealing with the risks you\u2019ve identified; and implement and periodically review the strategy.\nYou work hard to build wealth, and you don\u2019t want to put your financial security at unnecessary risk."}
