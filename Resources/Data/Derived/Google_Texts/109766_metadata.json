The page was established two days ago, and at last check has 156 followers.\n\n\"In this day and age, with social media, it doesn't surprise me at all,\" said John George, President of the Oklahoma City Fraternal Order of Police.\n\nEven though the notion of defiance toward authorities has been around for decades, George insisted no show of disrespect will discourage officers from doing their job.\n\n\"Our officers are disrespected on a daily basis out here. Just because of the nature of what we do and the environment we have to put ourselves in,\" George said.\n\nThe new site pushes for even more demonstration, though. The site points to a federal court ruling from last year that affirms giving the middle finger to a police officer is not grounds for an arrest.\n\nBut several Oklahomans think it\u2019s a bad idea, even if it is legal.\n\n\"Even if they can\u2019t arrest you, I've known that there is a lot of things that they can do and will do, so I just as soon not do it ,\" said Chris Hammons, as he left the Oklahoma City Municipal Court House on Thursday.\n\nIn fact, not one person at the courthouse to pay a ticket agreed with the anti-police sentiment.\n\n\"I think you are asking for trouble when dealing with the police and you are flipping them off. You shouldn\u2019t be doing that,\" said Sharon Taylor.\n\nMost called such a display disrespectful.\n\n\"Why would you flip off someone that is trying to protect us in our daily way?\" asked Anabel Montalvan.\n\nInstead of joining in the movement, the majority of Oklahomans interviewed by News9 vowed to give police a more supportive salute -- a friendly wave.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A new movement on social media outlets is aimed at police officers.", "author": "Lisa Monahan", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25990527/okc-police-respond-to-flip-off-cops-social-media-movement", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4178060_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A new movement on social media outlets is aimed at police officers.", "title": "OKC Police Respond To 'Flip Off Cops' Social Media Movement"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4178060_G.jpg", "description": "A new movement on social media outlets is aimed at police officers.", "card": "summary", "title": "OKC Police Respond To 'Flip Off Cops' Social Media Movement"}, "wnreadableurl": "okc-police-respond-to-flip-off-cops-social-media-movement", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2014/07/10", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,flip off cops,disrespect,social media,facebook,movement,respond,lisa monahan,kwtv,cbs,news9", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS25", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,flip off cops,disrespect,social media,facebook,movement,respond,lisa monahan,kwtv,cbs,news9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27e5\"", "article_summary": "A new movement on social media outlets is aimed at police officers.\n\"In this day and age, with social media, it doesn't surprise me at all,\" said John George, President of the Oklahoma City Fraternal Order of Police.\nBut several Oklahomans think it\u2019s a bad idea, even if it is legal.\nThe 'Flipping Off Cops' Facebook Page is calling on people to exercise their first amendment right by showing the bird to the authorities.\nInstead of joining in the movement, the majority of Oklahomans interviewed by News9 vowed to give police a more supportive salute -- a friendly wave."}
