The form is supposed to reconcile 2014 income and subsidies. But HealthCare.gov used the wrong benchmark to make the calculation.\n\nLast year, the penalty was $95 or 1 percent of annual income, whichever is greater. That increases in 2015 to $325 or 2 percent of annual income. Some people first learning of the penalty may end up owing penalties for both years, but the special enrollment period gives them more time to avoid that costly scenario.\n\nRelated: How Obamacare Rates with Consumers One Year Later\n\nSome 11.5 million people signed up for coverage during Obamacare\u2019s second official open enrollment period from Nov 15 to Feb 15. Now, officials expect sign-ups to climb even higher after the special enrollment period closes in April. This figure represents people who selected health care plans on the exchanges; it does not account for how many have paid their premiums, nor does it account for people who may not be eligible for Obamacare.\n\nConsumer advocates praised the administration for creating the special enrollment period.\n\n\u201cEven though the second enrollment period was a big success, there remain millions of people who are unaware of the premium subsidies that make insurance affordable and who didn\u2019t know about the tax penalty for failing to buy insurance,\u201d Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA said in a statement. \u201cThis special enrollment period will therefore be a helpful, teachable moment and will enable many people to obtain health coverage and avoid future penalties.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone is a fan of the announcement. To Republicans who opposed the mandate from the beginning, it\u2019s a political ploy on the part of the administration to avoid even worse approval ratings of the president\u2019s health care law. Public approval for Obamacare has risen slightly from its all-time low of 36.4 percent to 39.7 percent according to the Real Clear Politics average.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The White House is giving some uninsured people six more weeks to sign up for coverage", "title": "Obamacare Tax Mandate Forces Deadline Extension", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/20/Obamacare-Tax-Mandate-Forces-Deadline-Extension", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/08112014_Obamacare_Website_Laptop.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/20/Obamacare-Tax-Mandate-Forces-Deadline-Extension", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/08112014_Obamacare_Website_Laptop.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The White House is giving some uninsured people six more weeks to sign up for coverage", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Now, officials expect sign-ups to climb even higher after the special enrollment period closes in April.\nConsumer advocates praised the administration for creating the special enrollment period.\nThe White House is giving some uninsured people six more weeks to sign up for coverage in order to avoid Obamacare\u2019s tax penalty for not having health insurance.\nAdding to the administration\u2019s problem is a tax-form mistake that could delay tax rebates for as many as 800,000 taxpayers.\nRelated: How Obamacare Rates with Consumers One Year LaterSome 11.5 million people signed up for coverage during Obamacare\u2019s second official open enrollment period from Nov 15 to Feb 15."}
