UPDATED: The American Conservative Union, a longtime political lobbying group, went on the hunt for a hot-blooded liberal willing to face off against firebrand conservative pundit Ann Coulter at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington next month.

"The CPAC stage … stands ready for a serious liberal willing to defend the creeping socialism of Obama's America," the group said in a statement Monday. "We're confident in Ann. Is there a champion of the left that is unapologetically supportive of their world view?"

And in less than 24 hours, the group found a taker. Self-identified neo-liberal and Daily Caller contributor Mickey Kaus accepted Coulter's challenge, the ACU announced Tuesday afternoon. Kaus and Coulter will go head-to-head at the conference on March 7.

Kaus will no doubt face some tough and even inflammatory talk.

A serial rabble-rouser, Coulter once accused Sept. 11 widows of "reveling in their status as celebrities … [and] enjoying their husband's death," and suggested, "if only we could get Muslims to boycott all airlines, we could dispense with airport security altogether."

She even joked that "we need somebody to put rat poisoning in [liberal Supreme Court] Justice [Paul] Stevens' crème brulee" and said that former Democratic Sen. John Edwards, whose 16-year-old son died in a car accident, must have a bumper sticker that reads, "Ask me about my dead son."

The American Conservative Union invited would-be challengers for the March 6-8 conference to contact it by phone, e-mail or social media, using the hashtag #CPAC2014.

"Ann and Mickey are both dynamic political observers and we look forward to continuing the Novak and Donaldson tradition at CPAC," said Dan Schneider, Executive Director of the American Conservative Union.
