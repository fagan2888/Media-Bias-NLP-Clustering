Following the powerful personality of Old Hickory in office also makes it easy to overlook Van Buren.\n\nBut Van Buren was called the Little Magician for a reason. He was a masterful political strategist.\n\nHe was the one who looked at the United States in the mid-1820s and envisioned a nation with a competitive two-party political system, one that substituted, as he told Richmond, Va., newspaper editor Thomas Ritchie, \u201cparty principle for personal preference.\u201d\n\nDuring a time when sectionalism threatened to tear apart the country, he wanted voters to have to choose whether they would allow that threat to continue by favoring their region or if they would embrace \u201cthe fairly expressed will of the party\u201d as a way to maintain national unity.\n\nCumberland University Professor Mark Cheathem (Photo: Submitted)\n\nThe solution, in his mind, was to force voters to pick a political party and allow the parties to constrain the emotions and violence that otherwise might destroy the United States. Of course, for Van Buren, the only party that mattered was the Democratic party. It was the party that captured the true essence of what the Founding Fathers intended.\n\nLooking at the current Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns, we can question the wisdom of Van Buren\u2019s vision as it has developed.\n\nWere he alive today, with social media and 24/7 news cycles, even he might wonder if he charted the correct political course for the nation.\n\nOr, maybe he would see that it is working just as he intended.\n\nInstead of revolutions, coups d\u2019etat, or putsches, our presidential candidates fight it out verbally in debate venues, town halls and public meetings across the United States.\n\nIt is an imperfect system, but its longevity suggests that maybe the Little Magician was right.\n\nMark R.
