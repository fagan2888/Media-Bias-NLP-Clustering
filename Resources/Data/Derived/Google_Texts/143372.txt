Lt. Governor Anthony Brown has won the Democratic primary to become that party’s nominee for Governor of Maryland.

just so we're all clear, Maryland Democrats chose the guy who failed to build their Obamacare website to be governor http://t.co/DQDG4gdFyc — Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) June 25, 2014

Yes, that Anthony Brown. He had one job as Lt. Governor which was meant to cement his credentials for becoming Martin O’Malley’s successor. In the end Maryland spent at least $125 million to build a non-working web site only to abandon it and start over using software Connecticut used to build theirs. He “explained” his role in the project during one of the primary debates.

He wasn’t very cooperative with the press though.

.@JGreenDC @conncarroll I hope Hogan can rip Brown for ObamaCare but we are talking MD voters here. Smh. — Spencer Irvine (@SpencerIrvine) June 25, 2014

Voted today in Maryland Primary. It is disheartening to see low voter turnout in a state that so desperately needs to vote out Liberals:-( — Pat White Foster (@patfo49) June 24, 2014

@JGreenDC it's so ridiculous. No wonder there's a mass exodus to NoVa. — Spencer Irvine (@SpencerIrvine) June 25, 2014

Sad.
