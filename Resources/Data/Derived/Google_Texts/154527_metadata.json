In both cases, police have claimed that these individuals have killed themselves right after arrest.\n\nIn this latest case, the Jefferson County Coroner\u2019s Office in Alabama has identified the deceased as Kindra Darnell Chapman.\n\nShe had been booked into the jail at 6:22 p.m., on a first-degree robbery charge, but only slightly over an hour later, she was found dead.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThis robbery, it should be noted, was not the sort you might be assuming. She took a cell phone from another youth, in the 1600 block of Lakeshore Court. That\u2019s what the police are calling \u201crobbery,\u201d which may or may not have been true. She was still supposed to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nThere may well have been a defense for her actions \u2013 like a teenage spat, over someone breaking her phone and her taking theirs.\n\nWhile illegal, these are the sorts of every-day actions and conflicts that happen in suburbs across America, which are not charged as \u201crobbery\u201d \u2026unless of course you live in an impoverished area.\n\nJail deputies say that they last saw Chapman alive at 6:30 p.m. By 7:50 p.m. police say she was unresponsive. They claim that she \u201cused a bed sheet to hang herself.\u201d\n\nChapman was driven to Brookwood Medical Center, but she was immediately pronounced dead.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kindra Darnell Chapman was booked into the jail at 6:22 p.m., on a first-degree robbery charge, but only slightly over an hour later, she was found dead., #BlackLivesMatter, Alabama, Kindra Darnell Chapman, Police, police brutality,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "M.
