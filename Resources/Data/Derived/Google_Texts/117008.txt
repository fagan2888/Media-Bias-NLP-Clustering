Sioux Falls, SD

There are a lot of people taking pictures in Falls Park today, but one of those photographers is doing it for a different reason.

Kittie Heimdal is taking pictures on a free will donation basis to raise money for her close friend, Natasha Adams, who recently died in a car bicycle crash.

The money that she raises will go toward the Adams' family funeral costs, and she's taking pictures from 8 a.m. until 9 p.m. of groups, families or individuals.

We'll hear more from this photographer Sunday on KELOLAND Weekend News.
