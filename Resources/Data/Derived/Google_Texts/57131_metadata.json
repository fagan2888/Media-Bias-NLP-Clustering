In turn, the exchange said, Onpoint will \"develop various types of reports to inform consumers, policymakers, researchers, and insurers about different aspects of health care utilization, including cost, quality, and other metrics.\"\n\nUnder the contract, Onponit will also develop a public website to pass along the information to consumers and others. To protect consumer privacy, the exchange said, the information will be \"de-identified\" and aggregated.\n\nJim Wadleigh, acting CEO of the exchange, said in a written release: \"To have all of the carrier and claim data in one place will be extremely helpful to see trends in enrollment and provider analytics and increase cost transparency. This information can be used to drive improvements for all Connecticut residents, not just those who enroll through [the exchange].\"\n\nOnpoint, an independent non-profit company based in Portland, Maine, was chosen through a competitive bid process on the basis of \"cost, experience, and solutions,\" the exchange said.\n\nAccess Health CT begins enrollment for 2015 coverage Nov. 15.\n\nThis is the second year people have been able to buy health insurance on Connecticut's public exchange. During its first year of operation, Access Health CT enrolled about 195,000 people during a six-month enrollment period.\n\nAccess Health CT is a state-based marketplace as opposed to Healthcare.gov, which serves as the exchange for a number of states implementing the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Maine Company Wins $6.9 Million Job To Collect, Analyze Data For Access Health CT", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Hartford Courant", "author": "Hartford Courant", "og": {"site_name": "courant.com", "description": "Access Health CT, the state's public health exchange, will pay a Maine company $6.88 million over five years to analyze claims data with the hope of lowering costs and improving care, the exchange said Tuesday.", "title": "Maine Company Wins $6.9 Million Job To Collect, Analyze Data For Access Health CT", "url": "http://www.courant.com/health/hc-access-health-ct-onpoint-health-data-20141111-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-546257f4/turbine/hc-access-health-ct-onpoint-health-data-20141111", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp07.14", "twitter": {"site": "@hartfordcourant", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "health exchange, Access Health CT, Onpoint", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=391113483, app-argument=http://www.courant.com/deeplinkid/81941501", "fb": {"admins": 14500562, "page_id": 49693986601, "app_id": 152391743139}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-11-11", "Description": "Access Health CT, the state's public health exchange, will pay a Maine company $6.88 million over five years to analyze claims data with the goals of lowering costs and improving care, the exchange said Tuesday.
