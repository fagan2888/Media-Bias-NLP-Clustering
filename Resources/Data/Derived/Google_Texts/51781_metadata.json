A small business owner can no longer provide health insurance to those who work for him. A Michigan hospital is forced to lay off employees who have worked there for years. And a woman with lupus takes on a second job because ObamaCare doesn\u2019t cover the cost of the medications that keep her alive.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that nearly six months after the tumultuous launch of ObamaCare, approval for the law stands at a record 38-percent low. The opposition to the president\u2019s health care law is growing, with 48 percent \u2013 nearly half of all Americans \u2013 who think ObamaCare will make their lives worse. In fact, even the president himself has issued another delay to those whose plans initially failed to meet the law\u2019s requirements \u2013 an admission of both the unpopularity and unsustainability of his own signature law.\n\nBut ObamaCare is not just an unpopular policy. It\u2019s a detrimental one \u2013 especially to seniors. With nearly $22 billion in cuts to Medicare\u2019s home health services, the most vulnerable seniors \u2013 nearly 3.5 million of them \u2013 will be hit the hardest. These cuts, coupled with the impending limitations imposed on the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, reveal the president\u2019s failure to keep his promise to America\u2019s seniors. ObamaCare is hitting where it hurts. And it is doing so with irreparable damage.\n\nThe debate over ObamaCare is no longer political. It\u2019s not about the partisan divide between Republicans and Democrats, or about the ideological battle between the president and his Congress. It\u2019s about real people and the life-and-death decisions they face every single day. It\u2019s about being able to see a doctor who will take Medicare once you turn 65. It\u2019s about keeping the doctors and plans and hospitals that are best for you and your family. And it\u2019s about finding health insurance that will cover your chemotherapy treatments if you\u2019re diagnosed with cancer.\n\nHouse Republicans and a growing number of Americans are fundamentally opposed to ObamaCare because it\u2019s hurting people \u2013 old and young, sick and healthy, businesses and individuals. When you can\u2019t find coverage or a doctor who will treat you, it\u2019s not a political problem; it\u2019s a personal one. Your health isn\u2019t political.\n\nSo it is disappointing, albeit unsurprising, that the White House has announced it would veto bipartisan legislation that would help the people who need it. Our bill, the SIMPLE Fairness Act, which passed the House this week with support from both Republicans and Democrats, would eliminate the individual mandate tax penalty for the remainder of the year \u2013 just as the president has already unilaterally done multiple times for businesses with big checkbooks. Moreover, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that this legislation would save the federal government $9.4 billion over the next ten years \u2013 and $2.1 billion in 2014 alone. But the president still refuses to sign the bill into law.\n\nEvery day, Americans are waking up to higher premiums, unexpected out-of-pocket costs, new restrictions, and limited choices. ObamaCare is hitting their pocketbooks. It\u2019s limiting their ability to find doctors. And, in some cases, it\u2019s impeding their ability to get the medicines that keep them alive.\n\nWe need to replace this failed law with real solutions \u2013 solutions that put the patient\u2014not the federal government\u2014at the center of his or her health care choices.\n\nSolutions that actually lower costs\u2014not increase them\u2014such as enabling Americans to buy insurance across state lines; bringing an end to frivolous lawsuits; and expanding the role of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).\n\nThe president has already tried ObamaCare as a solution and it isn\u2019t working. So it\u2019s time for a new approach.\n\nThe American people are paying the price for the president\u2019s fundamentally flawed policy. And they are doing so with the most valuable currency of all: their health.\n\nCathy McMorris Rodgers serves as Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.
