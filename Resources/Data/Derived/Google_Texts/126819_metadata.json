It has issues with gangs, poverty and income inequality. It needs to do about $2 billion worth of infrastructure repairs. It has suffered through an epic drought.\n\nYet lately, these looming problems have been put aside because the city has had a far graver issue to deal with. The Spanos family, which owns the San Diego Chargers, is threatening to move the team to Los Angeles. Sacr\u00e9 bleu!\n\nThe Chargers are hardly the first National Football League team to threaten to move to L.A., which, despite being the country\u2019s second-largest media market, hasn\u2019t had a professional football team of its own since the Raiders and the Rams skipped town, to Oakland and St. Louis, respectively, in the mid-1990s.\n\nTake, for instance, the Minnesota Vikings, which \u201cdid a fantastic job of threatening to move to Los Angeles,\u201d says Neil deMause, who runs a website called Field of Schemes. (He also is a co-author of a book by that name.) Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, even parachuted into St. Paul to imply that a move to Los Angeles might be in the offing. As a result of those threats, the Vikings got a brand new stadium, filled with revenue-enhancing details like state-of-the-art corporate suites. The public \u2014 that is, the taxpayer \u2014 is picking up the tab for about half of it.\n\nWhich of course is precisely why N.F.L. owners threaten to move to Los Angeles. With Los Angeles just sitting there, un-footballed, it gives the 32 owners of N.F.L. franchises enormous leverage over the cities in which they play to extract goodies that few other capitalists would dare ask for \u2014 not just run-of-the-mill tax abatements, but egregious benefits like free rent, which of course means bigger profits for the wealthy men and women who own the teams. \u201cThe way to really make money is to privatize the revenues, and socialize the costs,\u201d deMause says.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe basic story is that all professional leagues try to have fewer teams than the number of locations that would like to have them,\u201d says Roger Noll, a sports economist at Stanford University. \u201cThat is what monopolists do \u2014 contrive scarcity to drive up the price.\u201d Los Angeles, he adds, \u201cis perfect for this purpose, because the threat is so credible.\u201d Indeed, during the first decade of this century, according to figures compiled by Judith Grant Long, an associate professor of sport management at the University of Michigan, states and counties spent at least $10.1 billion subsidizing sports facilities. A new football stadium with all the modern amenities costs around $1 billion.\n\nIt is easy enough to understand why N.F.L. owners would want to use the threat of moving to extract public subsidies \u2014 why pay for something yourself when you can get taxpayers to pick up the tab? Besides, $1 billion is a lot of money, even for billionaires. But why do cities go along with it? It can\u2019t be because they expect some economic benefit to come from a new sports stadium; according to Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College, \u201cThe academic literature says that there should be no expectation that a new arena will boost the local economy.\u201d\n\nIt has much more to do with civic pride \u2014 the sense that your town is truly big-time. Plus no city wants to feel abandoned, the way Baltimore was in 1984 when the owner of the Colts, Bob Irsay, moved the team to Indianapolis in the middle of the night. This is especially true for cities like San Diego, which live in the shadows of bigger cities like Los Angeles. \u201cIt would be a shame if the Chargers left,\u201d says my friend Herb Greenberg, a former CNBC reporter who lives in San Diego. \u201cWhat would we be left with? A losing baseball team and great weather? That\u2019s it?\u201d\n\nFor years, the Chargers had a sweet deal with the city, which, among other things, guaranteed sellouts for 10 years \u2014 that is, if a game didn\u2019t sell out, the city would pick up the difference. But since 2002, the Spanos family has been pressing the city to come up with a plan for a new arena.\n\nRecently, the Chargers have upped the pressure. In January, San Diego\u2019s mayor, Kevin Faulconer, announced that he was putting together a task force to find a solution for the Chargers. But the Chargers, unhappy at waiting any further, announced on Thursday that the team was considering moving just outside Los Angeles along with the Oakland Raiders; both teams would play in a yet-to-be-constructed $1.7 billion stadium. They even posted a short video with an architect\u2019s rendering of the arena.\n\nAt a hastily assembled news conference on Friday morning, a blindsided Mayor Faulconer sounded not just angry but anguished. He promised to do everything he could to hold onto the Chargers.\n\nThe L.A. gambit wins again.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150220213441, "twitter": {"description": "Why the N.F.L.\u2019s savvy capitalists threaten to move to Los Angeles.", "title": "The San Diego Chargers\u2019 Well-Worn Strategy", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/opinion/joe-nocera-footballs-la-trick-play.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003526398"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/nocera-circular/nocera-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/opinion/joe-nocera-footballs-la-trick-play.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003526398", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/opinion/joe-nocera-footballs-la-trick-play.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Football\u2019s L.A.
