On tape, he found this easy: \u201cIf CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies,\u201d he had said. \u201cSo it\u2019s written to do that.\u201d He had also said that the bill was drafted in a \u201ctortured\u201d manner in order to get favorable CBO treatment.\n\nIn his testimony Tuesday, Gruber tried to dismiss his own earlier statements as having been \u201cmade in a tone of [political] expertise that I don't have.\u201d But Gruber had previously told the New York Times, \u201cI know more about this law than any other economist.\u201d If he knew more than anyone about the law, and he knew how and why he had to game the CBO scoring, this new explanation doesn't wash.\n\nGruber had also made comments relevant to a Supreme Court case that will decide whether Obamacare allows subsidies for insurance customers in states that did not set up their own exchanges. Gruber had suggested many times that it does not.\n\nBut he claimed on Tuesday that he had only been speaking conditionally, in the event that the federal government failed to set up healthcare.gov. The thing is, no one who has heard his comments could possibly accept this explanation. For example, in a Jan. 10, 2012 lecture, Gruber criticized state governments that had not yet set up exchanges, and mused about consequences \u201cwhen the voters in states see that by not setting up an exchange the politicians in their state are costing state residents hundreds of millions and billions of dollars.\u201d He then added, \u201cThat is really the ultimate threat \u2014 will people understand that, gee, if your governor doesn't set up an exchange, you're losing hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits to be delivered to your citizens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tuesday was a difficult day on Capitol Hill for the Aristotelian principle of non-contradiction \u2014 the simple idea in logic that the same thing cannot be both true and untrue at the same time.\nThe occasion of this philosophical crisis was testimony to the House Oversight Committee by Obamacare architect and MIT economist Jonathan Gruber.
