Bill Haslam\u2019s \u201cInsure Tennessee\u201d proposal.\n\n\u201cI called Senator (Janice) Bowling\u2019s office several times and emailed her and asked others to do the same, urging her to support the plan,\u201d Fox said, \u201cbut she still voted against it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the TN.gov website, Haslam unveiled the plan in early December, which was designed to expand Medicaid coverage in Tennessee to nearly 300,000 uninsured residents. It was unveiled after nearly two years of extensive effort and a special session of the Health and Welfare Committee in January to focus on the proposal.\n\n\u201cWe made the decision in Tennessee nearly two years ago not to expand traditional Medicaid,\u201d Haslam said at the time.\n\n\u201cThis is an alternative approach that forges a different path and is a unique Tennessee solution.\n\n\u201cThis plan leverages federal dollars to provide health care coverage to more Tennesseans, to give people a choice in their coverage, and to address the cost of health care, better health outcomes and personal responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe 11-member senate committee, however, voted 7-4 to defeat it in the session\u2019s third day.\n\nSupporters of the plan say it was designed as an alternative to Medicaid expansion that would bring billions of federal dollars back into the state each year, not only to cover Tennessee\u2019s uninsured, but also to protect many hospitals on the brink of collapse due to declining reimbursements.\n\nOpponents, including Sen. Bowling (R-Tullahoma), who was one of the seven members who voted against it, say the plan is not clearly worked out and is still part of a larger problem, namely Medicaid Expansion under Obamacare that is fiscally \u201cunsustainable.\u201d\n\nFox was born legally blind due to toxoplasmosis, an infection she said her mother contracted while pregnant with her.\n\n\u201cI was on federal disability and TennCare for most of my life, from the time I was four or five years old,\u201d she said, \u201cbut when I got married, I lost my disability income.\n\n\u201cThen in 2005, I also lost my TennCare coverage, because the rules were changed. My husband gets $1,172 per month for his disability, but that\u2019s considered $72 too much for me to qualify for TennCare, under the current rules.\n\n\u201cIf I had dependent children, or had certain types of cancer or if I went into a nursing home, I could qualify for TennCare, but I don\u2019t fit into any of the right categories any more.\u201d\n\nMrs. Fox said she finished high school through special education classes and has taken some college courses, but only with great difficulty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to work due to my blindness, even after several retina surgeries and other eye procedures,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to be a teacher and I tried substitute teaching, but once the teachers realized I couldn\u2019t see the students very well to watch them, they never called me back.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband, Billy Ray Fox, now get by on $1,325 per month, including about $153 per month in food stamps.\n\nMr. Fox said he broke his back after 30 years of working in automotive repair and metal fabrication, but he now receives disability and TennCare coverage after paying into the system for many years. But since Mrs. Fox has always been disabled and never worked, her situation is different, he said.\n\nOtherwise the couple gets by as best they can with help from churches and other charity programs.\n\nIn addition to her eye conditions, which she said include glaucoma, macular degeneration and retina problems, Mrs. Fox suffers from high blood pressure, spinal problems and complications from a sleep apnea surgery that she said resulted in serious infections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m able to see the computer with a 42-inch monitor, and I\u2019ve tried to take some online courses recently, but the government said my financial aid for college has run out.\n\n\u201cBut right now, I need health coverage before I can even think about taking courses or working on the computer.\u201d\n\nAlso disappointed by the decision was Donna Seely of Tullahoma, a family nurse practitioner and Certified Application Counselor with Pathways to Health, who has been a tireless advocate for the uninsured in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe they killed this plan when it was going to be 100 percent funded by Medicaid funds for the first three years and 90 percent after that,\u201d Seely said.\n\n\u201cThe Tennessee Hospital Association agreed to cover the remaining 10 percent after that.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Tennessee Justice Center, a Nashville law firm that advocates for Tennessee families in need, the committee\u2019s decision to kill Haslam\u2019s plan is costing the state $2.7 million per day in Medicaid expansion funds from the federal government.\n\nThese funds, the Center states, include federal taxes already paid in by Tennesseans.\n\n\u201cInstead of staying in our state,\u201d the Center\u2019s website reads, \u201cour tax dollars are going to other states to fund health care coverage for their citizens.\n\n\u201cInsure Tennessee will keep our federal tax dollars here in Tennessee, helping our friends, families and neighbors, and creating jobs.\u201d\n\nSen. Bowling said she is not unsympathetic to Mrs. Fox\u2019s plight and would like to help her obtain TennCare coverage if possible, but that Haslam\u2019s proposal is not the right answer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been contacted by the Tennessee Justice Center and unfortunately, what they\u2019re saying is not true,\u201d Bowling said.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, their numbers are a moving target.\n\n\u201cFirst they said there were 180,000 uninsured, then they go up to 400,000, and I\u2019m not sure what the right number is, but I have researched this subject diligently and I\u2019m also on the Judicial Committee that had a hearing on the matter the week before.\n\n\u201cI relied on the advice of Dr. David Blumenthal, who is recognized by Vanderbilt as the highest expert on Medicaid,\u201d Bowling said.\n\nAccording to online research, David Blumenthal is president of The Commonwealth Fund, a national philanthropy engaged in independent research on health and social policy issues.\n\n\u201cThere were several reasons I voted \u2018no\u2019 on this plan, one being that it was supposed to help the rural hospitals, but in reality, 85 percent of the funding was going to go to the teaching hospitals in Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga, and only 15 percent would go to hospitals in rural areas.\n\n\u201cIn addition, Dr. Blumenthal said the governor\u2019s plan is in conflict with the federal Medicaid rules, so those rules would need to be changed in Washington before Tennessee could accept the funds.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the work that went into Haslam\u2019s plan, but it was all verbal and there was nothing definite that was really worked out in writing, and it\u2019s contrary to the federal code in many ways.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that (the governor\u2019s plan) was expanding Medicaid, so it\u2019s a decision of whether to expand Medicaid or not to expand it.\n\n\u201cForty percent of Tennessee\u2019s budget already comes from the federal government as it is, and that\u2019s a dangerous situation for Tennessee to be in. Expanding Medicaid would only make it worse.\u201d\n\nBowling said one of her main concerns right now regarding TennCare is to dismantle Tennessee\u2019s Intractable Pain Treatment Act, which she said \u201crequires\u201d doctors to prescribe certain pain medications, often for the wrong reasons.\n\n\u201cRight now, 22 million of our TennCare dollars are going to opiates for pain because of this act,\u201d she said, \u201cand it was constructed by the manufacturers of Oxycontin and other highly addictive pain medications that are ravaging our society right now, with neonatal problems in children, addictions and many other problems.\n\n\u201cThey promised that these drugs had \u2018no street value\u2019 and were not addictive, but we all know that\u2019s turned out to be wrong.\u201d\n\nAsked what she believes to be the next step in terms of getting low-income Tennesseans insured, Bowling said it is out of her hands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an expert on health care,\u201d she said, \u201cand I think Haslam has made a valiant attempt at correcting the problem of our uninsured, but the next step is probably with the Supreme Court, where there is currently a case that will determine a lot of things about the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nBowling said she thinks the ACA has been bad for Tennessee businesses and is not sustainable for Tennesseeans, while Medicaid, which is a big part of the ACA, \u201calso needs to be changed because it is no longer working.\u201d\n\nSupporters of Insure Tennessee, however, are hopeful that the plan will be brought up again this year, possibly through other committees.\n\nAccording to Seely, the plan includes two components.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Volunteer Plan,\u2019\u201d she said, \u201cprovides vouchers for working Tennesseeans to use toward their employer-sponsored plan, if their employer offers it, while the \u2018Healthy Incentives Plan\u2019 covers people who work for companies that don\u2019t offer insurance, or who are otherwise below the income threshold to qualify for assistance under the ACA.\u201d\n\nThe ACA, she said, assumed that anyone below that threshold would be covered by each state\u2019s Medicaid plan, assuming they accepted expanded Medicaid funding. Tennessee, however, was one of many states that did not.\n\n\u201cThe Healthy Incentives plan provides a health savings plan with credits for healthy behaviors, such as annual physical exams, smoking cessation, and weight loss and things like that. It will have premiums and copays based on an individual\u2019s income.\n\n\u201cThe Medicaid expansion money would be used to fund these plans at 100 percent for the first three years and then 90 percent after that, and the Tennessee Hospital Association agreed to pick up the state\u2019s 10 percent share after that point.\u201d\n\nSeely also explained that due to changes in the last 10 years, TennCare is only available to low-income individuals who fall into certain narrow categories, such as children and pregnant women, mothers with dependent children, women with cervical and breast cancer, and certain elderly individuals.\n\nThese changes left many low-income adults under 65 in an \u201cinsurance gap,\u201d she said, who do not qualify for TennCare, yet who make too little income to afford insurance under the ACA, or even qualify for its subsidies.\n\nSen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville, was one of the four members of the committee who voted \u201cyes\u201d on Haslam\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cWhile it wasn\u2019t a perfect plan,\u201d Yarbro said, \u201cI voted for Insure Tennessee because it would have made health insurance a possibility for 280,000 Tennesseans who can\u2019t otherwise afford it. More than half of these people are working but still can\u2019t get coverage.\n\n\u201cThe plan had the support of the business community and was a lifeline for the southeast Tennessee hospitals in danger of closing.\n\n\u201cThis conversation isn\u2019t over. I and other lawmakers will continue to make the case for expanding access to affordable health insurance in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the governor and with common-sense members of both parties to move past politics and do what\u2019s right for Tennesseans.\u201d\n\nFor more information visit http://www.tn.gov/tenncare/insureTennessee.shtml.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "DSuZnC9hJQAMvp9aACU2GR1smwoMgHv-RH5LWmQ0SkM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4625\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThen in 2005, I also lost my TennCare coverage, because the rules were changed.\nI and other lawmakers will continue to make the case for expanding access to affordable health insurance in Tennessee.\n\u201cInsure Tennessee will keep our federal tax dollars here in Tennessee, helping our friends, families and neighbors, and creating jobs.\u201dSen.\n\u201cWe made the decision in Tennessee nearly two years ago not to expand traditional Medicaid,\u201d Haslam said at the time.\nBowling said she is not unsympathetic to Mrs. Fox\u2019s plight and would like to help her obtain TennCare coverage if possible, but that Haslam\u2019s proposal is not the right answer."}
