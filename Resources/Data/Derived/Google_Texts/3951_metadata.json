Aaron Regunberg \u201912, D-Providence, introduced a bill with several other representatives in the Rhode Island House of Representatives that, if passed, would establish a single-payer health system in Rhode Island.\n\nRepresentatives Regunberg, Gregg Amore, D-East Providence, Teresa Tanzi, D-Narragansett and South Kingstown, Arthur Handy, D-Cranston, and Joseph Almeida, D-Providence, also introduced the bill last February, but it was held for further study. It will be heard before the House Finance Committee.\n\nThe comprehensive healthcare system would place the state \u2014 rather than insurers \u2014 in charge of allocating healthcare for Rhode Islanders and controlling costs. A tax based on ability to pay would replace premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe single-payer system would decrease healthcare costs, as the state would be able to buy in bulk, control costs and eliminate the cost of administration, multiple sources said.\n\nWithin the healthcare system \u201c30 to 35 percent of money in individual private health insurance companies is lost in administrative waste,\u201d said Mark Ryan, president of the Rhode Island chapter of Physicians for a National Health Program.\n\nBut with a single-payer system, the government \u201cdoesn\u2019t have big salaries to pay, (and) it doesn\u2019t have to waste money on advertising,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nAccording to a PNHP study, healthcare spending per person rose by 250 percent in Rhode Island between 1991 and 2014.\n\nThe study also reported that \u201cmedical-related bankruptcies are 62 percent of personal bankruptcies, and of these, 69 percent had insurance at the time of their bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nWith a single-payer system, \u201cincome after health costs and taxes will increase by 32 percent for middle-income families, and even households with (an annual) income of over $100,000 will save,\u201d stated a study conducted by Gerald Friedman, a professor of economics at University of Massachusetts, Amherst.\n\nThe bill does not indicate how ability to pay would be determined, but Friedman\u2019s study suggested that single-payer health insurance in Rhode Island would \u201cshift the burden of illness and healthcare from the sick and from the broad middle class onto the fortunate and the affluent.\u201d\n\nFriedman\u2019s study also showed that employers would save nearly $80 million from the \u201cadministrative expense of operating employer-provided health insurance plans.\u201d\n\nThe study added that the savings from the single-payer system would improve the economy, as Rhode Islanders would spend cash elsewhere, and businesses would be drawn to the state due to the appealing healthcare savings.\n\n\u201cI believe that healthcare is a basic human right rather than a privilege for those who can pay for it,\u201d Rugenberg said. Others think that \u201cyou have to earn it. That\u2019s the American free market system,\u201d he said.\n\nOther single-payer detractors associate the single-payer system with socialism, several sources said.\n\nInsurance company executives forced President Barack Obama to pass the Affordable Care Act, which Ryan calls a \u201cvery imperfect bill,\u201d effectively blocking the passage of a single-payer system, Ryan added.\n\nThe implementation of single-payer health insurance will be a challenge, Regunberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any illusions (of) this being an easy fight,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cReally, really big shakeups like this rarely pass in the first couple years. It generally takes a while for the arguments to take hold.\u201d\n\nRegunberg noted that recent months have seen significantly more attention paid to single-payer health care, attributing this change to the increased coverage of single-payer healthcare in the presidential debates, particularly as a result of Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-VT.\n\nThe primary publicity has been helpful, Regunberg said, noting that he got hundreds of shares on a Facebook post about his introduction of the bill.\n\nWhile there are two national bills up for implementing single-payer health insurance, proponents of the change are focusing on state-by-state implementation. This is due to the gridlock in Washington, D.C., Regunberg and Ryan said.\n\nRyan maintained hope in the political system, saying that if there were a national debate about the plan, a larger number of people would support it, and it would be approved.\n\n\u201cWhen the people finally demand an equitable universal health insurance program, the Congress will finally enact it.\u201d\n\nRep. Nicholas Mattiello, D-Cranston, speaker of the house, did not respond to request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Brown Daily Herald", "description": "Rep.
