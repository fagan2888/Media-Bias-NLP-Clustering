A blood drive was held to show support for Julie Dombo, who was shot during an armed robbery of a Derby AT&T store on August 11th and is still recovering at a Wichita hospital.

It was at the Haysville Community Library that the blood drive was held.

A good friend of Dombo donated blood.

"She is still in intensive care and hopefully she is getting stronger each day. I know she has a lot of complications, but she is a strong woman and she is getting excellent medical care," Karen Wallace said.

Another blood drive will happen on September 7, 2015 at the Haysville Middle School Gymnasium from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
