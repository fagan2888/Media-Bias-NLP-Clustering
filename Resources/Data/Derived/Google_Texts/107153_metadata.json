According to Facebook research, not much. Times change. We grow older. Wiser. Facebook decided to look at the evolution of laughing online after The New Yorker\u2019s Sarah Larson prompted engineers to start digging.\n\nHow do we communicate laughter? How people communicate rage is easy. Just look at Facebook comments. We are either all smart asses, or most of us should be medicated.\n\nBack to the laughing. It is Monday, so let\u2019s keep it light. How\u2019s the ole standby of lol doing? Life support. We\u2019re talking it could be time to pull the plug, discuss it with the Obamacare death panels, DNR or go straight Kevorkian on it.\n\nFacebook analyzed comments and posts for the last week of May to identify just how we laugh online. Lol stands at just 1.9 percent. The mighty has fallen.\n\nWhat\u2019s leading the pack? Ever use \u2018haha\u2019 or some version of you having a mini stroke while typing it out? You\u2019re in the majority with 51.4 percent. Right on, that\u2019s what I use the majority of the time.\n\nDon\u2019t judge when I start slapping the computer, and it comes out as hhahahhaaa. My iPhone\u2019s predictive type is a pain in the ass and likes that version better.\n\nNumber two on the list? The emoji clocking in with 33.7 percent. If my parents had Facebook, I\u2019d think the company was spying on them. My dad will throw a sunglasses smiling emoji on you. My mom? Tears of laughter. At least, I hope they are tears of laughter\u2026\n\nThree belongs to hehe at 13.1 percent. According to Larson\u2019s piece, hehe is being thrust upon us by the nation\u2019s youth. The data says no. Hehe goes from ages 13 to 70.\n\nHow about gender? Women tend to rely on the emoji more, but the difference isn\u2019t substantial. Men go for the hahas more than women, but it\u2019s the same case with emojis. Nothing that screams outlier.\n\nAlabama Laughs Online\n\nWhat about states? Going from Facebook\u2019s data, I\u2019m the odd one out. Haha barely registers here, with emojis taking the lead.\n\nCalifornia, Texas and Colorado remain the final stand for lol. It\u2019s dwindling but have hope for the three letters.\n\nA more broad look at the states show haha and hehe are popular in the west. Emojis? Well, something has to cheer you up in when the blizzards hit. The South remains the overall bastion of lols though the concentrations give way to emojis in Alabama and Mississippi.\n\nFacebook ends their research with a message to the presidential candidates: the battleground states of Ohio and Virginia are haha states, while the candidates\u2019 emoji games will surely be key in determining who emerges victorious in Florida.\n\nI\u2019ve never been prouder to live in a non-battleground state. Residents of those three? I\u2019d pray for you, but it\u2019s not going to work. The true social media campaign has been unleashed. Blame Facebook when The Donald rages out to an emoji-laden campaign ad.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What\u2019s in an LOL? According to Facebook research, not much. Times change.
