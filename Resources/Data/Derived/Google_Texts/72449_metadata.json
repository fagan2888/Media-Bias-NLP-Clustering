Bush, or his father, former President George H.W. Bush.\n\nAmong GOP newcomers expected to seek the nomination: U.S. senators Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, all of whom recently appeared at a forum hosted by Charles and David Koch, perhaps the most influential fundraisers for conservative candidates and ideas. While Rubio and Cruz used the event to criticize Obama\u2019s outreach to Cuba and his handling of Iran nuclear talks, Paul had a different view on both issues, expressing opposition to additional Iranian sanctions and calling 50 years of Cuba isolation a failure.\n\nPaul, whose Libertarian views are likely to contrast with the Republican field, also told the conservative forum that its next presidential nominee must treat war as \"the last resort, not the first.\u201d\n\nRejecting the label of foreign policy \u201cisolationism,\u201d as some fellow Republicans have recently charged, Paul may launch his presidential bid at a time when security concerns have returned to the forefront of the American electorate. A recent Bloomberg survey found that nearly half of Republican voters identify \u201cmore aggressively pursuing terrorists\u201d as a top issue, likely due to events unfolding in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nWhile Paul could fare well in Republican debates focused on the issue of big government \u2014 he enjoys strong support among Republicans who identify as libertarians concerned with bloated government \u2014 he may have a tougher time explaining his foreign policy stance to conservatives seeking a more hawkish nominee.\n\nSome of the different approaches among the likely Republican White House hopefuls will be on display when Congress moves to debate President Obama authority to conduct a wider military campaign against the Islamic State.\n\nTargeting Clinton\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Obama's top diplomat has become a centerpiece of the Republican critique of Obama\u2019s foreign policy record \u2014 and a staple of Senator Ted Cruz's speeches to conservative groups.\n\n\u201cThe failures of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy are manifest,\u201d Cruz recently said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the whole world is on fire right now. It seems there is not a portion of the world where security, where our relationship with our allies, where our ability to contain our enemies, to defeat our enemies ... hasn\u2019t gotten worse.\u201d\n\nOther likely Republican contenders are staking out strong positions on confronting the Islamic State (IS) group. Both Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham recently said they were open to sending U.S. troops to battle IS, despite national polls that show Americans remain wary of foreign military involvements in the wake of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBut regardless of how large foreign policy issues may loom over the upcoming race for the White House, mainstay conservative voters will want to hear specifics about how contenders would plan to repeal Obamacare, cut the size of government, and make U.S. borders secure from illegal immigrants.\n\nSome Republican analysts also believe the party\u2019s presidential contenders must do more than simply criticize the Obama record; commentator Scot Faulkner said voters will be looking to Republicans to offer sensible approaches to domestic and foreign policy challenges of the coming administration.\n\n\u201cOne questions is, can Obama, two years from now, be wildly popular, have peace and have prosperity? If that becomes true, the Democrats could win,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the Republicans have to do more than just tear down Obama because we could be at peace and we could have prosperity, so you have to have an alternative. And if you don\u2019t have that alternative vision, what do you have?\u201d\n\nRepublican strategist Phillip Stutts said it will also be important for Republican congressional leaders to show the country they can govern to set the stage for a presidential victory in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe have to show leadership,\u201d Stutts said. \u201cWe have to show that we have ideas otherwise we are not going to win in 2016. And this is our chance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "USA, Republicans, Obama foreign policy", "Author": "Jim Malone", "og": {"site_name": "VOA", "description": "Handling of foreign policy is likely to be a major focus of attack by Republican presidential contenders", "title": "Column: Republican Presidential Contenders Target Obama\u2019s Foreign Policy", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/content/republican-presidential-contenders-target-obama-foreign-policy/2632014.html", "image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/6FA9D865-0D5C-48DC-AB9D-83BCA668BC0E_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/6FA9D865-0D5C-48DC-AB9D-83BCA668BC0E_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "site": "@voanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Column: Republican Presidential Contenders Target Obama\u2019s Foreign Policy", "google-site-verification": "xhlpWO2mj7cS-CLSz4sliKEzNLqoRguHlaJnb1PFuBs", "keywords": "voa, voice of america, voanews, voanews,voianews, english news, voa special english, special english, voa\u5b98\u7f51, voanews.com, china, iran the voice of america, syria, \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voiceofamerica"}, "abstract": "The Voice of America is one of the world's most trusted sources for news and information from the United States and around the world.
