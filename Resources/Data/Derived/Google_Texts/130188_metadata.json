But there are all these warnings about avoiding some fish because they contain mercury! What\u2019s the solution? \u2014 Sally P., Carbondale, Illinois\n\nA: You must be referring to the new Food and Drug Administration/Environmental Protection Agency guidelines about safely getting enough omega-3 fatty acids while you\u2019re pregnant and breastfeeding, since they\u2019re essential for fetal brain development, a newborn\u2019s vision and continued neurodevelopment. Omega-3s also help Mom by reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm labor and delivery and postpartum depression. The guidelines recommend eating 8-12 ounces of low-mercury fish a week so you get enough omega-3s. This includes salmon, trout, light tuna, herring, blue mussels, Pacific oysters, whitefish, shrimp, pollock, tilapia, catfish and cod. (If you take in low levels of methyl mercury from fish, they\u2019re eventually processed and excreted from your body.) Fish with higher mercury content (and the ones to avoid) are the bigger fish: marlin, albacore tuna, tilefish, shark, swordfish and king mackerel.\n\nFYI: Atlantic salmon has 2 micrograms of mercury per 4-ounce serving and delivers 1,200-2,400 milligrams of omega-3s!\n\nAlbacore tuna has 54-58 mcg of mercury and 1,700 mg of omega-3s in a 4-ounce serving.\n\nAs for supplements: There\u2019s no definitive recommendation for daily intake of omega-3s for pregnant women or anyone else, but eating 12 ounces of fish a week could deliver 4-6.5 grams; that\u2019s an average of up to 900 mg a day. If you\u2019re taking omega-3 fish-oil supplements, you want to make sure they\u2019re free of toxins. They should be tested for particles per trillion by a third-party lab. We favor algal-oil DHA (fish get their omega-3s from algae), and DHA omega-3 from algae is free of mercury. We take 900 mg a day.\n\nSo talk with your doctor about all your nutritional needs during pregnancy to make sure you\u2019re getting enough omega- 3s, plus folic acid and other nutrients essential for a healthy pregnancy. And congratulations!\n\nQ: I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll end up with memory problems, like my mom. I\u2019m 47, and she\u2019s 79. What can I do to dodge that bullet? \u2014 Francine T., Chicago\n\nA: We\u2019re sorry your mom has memory problems, but that doesn\u2019t mean you will.\n\nA new Mayo Clinic study shows that even if you have a genetic predisposition for late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease, making specific lifestyle choices can postpone symptoms for a significant number of years (nine in the study) and reduce non-Alzheimer\u2019s cognitive decline, too.\n\nFirst and foremost, you want to protect your cardiovascular system so it delivers the nutrients and oxygen that your brain needs to stay healthy. That calls for smart nutrition and plenty of physical activity (which also will help you manage stress and control your blood pressure \u2014 important steps for heart and brain health).\n\nWhat you eat, or don\u2019t eat, can help your arteries stay clear of plaque. So dump the Five Food Felons \u2014 added sugar and syrup, trans and saturated fats, and any grain that isn\u2019t 100 percent whole \u2014 and eat lots of omega-3-rich fish, like salmon and sea trout, while aiming for nine daily servings of fruits and veggies. (Ask your doctor about taking 162 mg of aspirin daily; research shows that it may help protect brain function.) Walking 10,000 steps, or the equivalent, at least five days a week also can protect or even boost brain power. One minute of aerobic activity equals 100 steps, so a 90-minute aerobics class is really good!\n\nCombining walking with strength-building exercise does the most to encourage growth and survival of new neurons in the brain.\n\nBut physical exercise is just one workout you need to give your brain. Flexing your brain\u2019s mental muscle by taking up group activities, crafts or arts, reading or playing games can postpone or prevent cognitive problems, even if you don\u2019t start until middle age or older.\n\nSo today, resolve to enjoy the great food and the fun and games that will help you stay sharp!\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz is host of \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d and Dr. Mike Roizen is chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute.
