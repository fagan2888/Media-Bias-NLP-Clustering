The Thousand Oaks High and Moorpark College product returned an interception 63 yards for the game-winning touchdown last week.</p>\n\nEverything seemed to point to a running play.\n\nArkansas Tech was facing second down and short with a little more than five minutes to play. The Wonder Boys led Southwestern Oklahoma State University 23-20.\n\nSWOSU senior safety Steven Townsley (Thousand Oaks, Moorpark College) figured Arkansas Tech would want to drain a few more seconds off the clock.\n\nBut then Townsley noticed an Arkansas Tech wide receiver coming hard off the line. He started backpedaling and saw the quarterback throw in that direction.\n\nTownsley picked off the pass and raced 63 yards for the game-winning touchdown as SWOSU rallied for a 27-23 victory last week.\n\nTownsley\u2019s interception capped an impressive comeback as SWOSU trailed 23-7 entering the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cIt was probably the best play I\u2019ve had in college,\u201d Townsley said. \u201cAs soon as I caught it, I started running and saw I had a lineman with a good angle on me. But once I got by him, I saw it open up and was pretty much gone from there.\u201d\n\nIn his second season at SWOSU, the 6-foot, 205-pound Townsley has taken a more prominent role on defense. He made 12 tackles in the season opener and was named the school\u2019s athlete of the week.\n\n\u201cI am pretty much the leader in the secondary and I have to put guys in the right position to do their job to make us successful,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting everyone lined up and having everyone believe in what I tell them to do is very important.\u201d\n\nAlthough he attended Moorpark College, Townsley was recruited to SWOSU with the help of an assistant coach from L.A. Pierce.\n\nA friend playing for Pierce suggested Townsley send him an email. The Pierce coach sent Townsley\u2019s film to the coaches at SWOSU.\n\nOnce SWOSU offered Townsley a scholarship, he was sold on the Division II school.\n\n\u201cI just felt like this was home. It felt natural,\u201d Townsley said. \u201cI am really comfortable here and I really like the small-town feel. Everyone pretty much knows everyone and everyone at the school rallies around you. The teachers and the professors all want you to be successful.\u201d\n\nTownsley is majoring in parks and recreational management with a minor in wildland fire. His career aspiration once football ends is to become a firefighter.\n\n\u201cMy cousin is a firefighter and he pretty much said it is one of the best jobs out there,\u201d Townsley said. \u201cYou get to help people who need help and that is something I really like to do.\u201d\n\nFor the next few months, Townsley\u2019s primary focus is helping his teammates achieve the ultimate prize.\n\n\u201cWe want to win a national championship,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the goal, and I think we can do it. We have a close team and everyone wants to get better. Every day in practice, I can see our guys want it more than anything.\u201d\n\nNEWS AND NOTES\n\nPepperdine sophomore forward Taylor Alvarado (Santa Paula) scored a second-half goal in a 2-0 victory over Xavier. ...
