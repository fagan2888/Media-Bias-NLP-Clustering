We can drive, we can vote, we can work. What more do these broads want?\u201d This was Phoebe\u2019s response to Joey\u2019s invitation to see the play \u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Like Me? A Bitter Woman\u2019s Journey Through Life\u201d in the \u201cFriends\u201d episode \u201cThe One with the Soap Opera Party.\u201d Fortunately, \u201cFriends\u201d has once again re-entered the American television spotlight with the recent news that Netflix is going to make all 236 episodes available online. The quote itself is also timely, given the recent stirrings of women\u2019s rights across the country.\n\nIn late September, Northwestern received a grant of $300,000 from the U.S. Department of Justice to expand its sexual assault prevention efforts. On Sept. 22, I heard Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., speak about women in Washington, D.C., specifically about her book titled \u201cOff the Sidelines.\u201d During her speech, she discussed attempting to pass the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act through Congress, an act that would provide a national paid-leave program for parents who must take time off for maternity, childcare or health reasons. Although the bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in May 2013, it has yet to progress. From Emma Watson\u2019s highly publicized speech to the UN regarding gender relations to the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily reversing Texas legislation that would have closed all but eight of the state\u2019s women\u2019s health clinics, it seems women\u2019s rights are making a comeback. Various politicians, most conspicuously Hillary Clinton, have placed women\u2019s rights firmly on their political agendas. And with the ongoing debate about the Affordable Care Act come the inevitable discussions involving abortion and birth control coverage.\n\nAs a child, my father gave me a Susan B. Anthony coin and told me I should never let my gender stand in the way of what I wanted to do. A spry, young feminist of 8, I dreamt of becoming the first woman president and fighting for women\u2019s rights. However, as I got older, I found myself thinking more along the lines of Phoebe. \u201cWhat more do these broads want?\u201d Now I\u2019m beginning to think the 21st century has ushered in a new wave of feminism and more importantly, a new type of feminist.\n\nFor a long time, feminism has been synonymous with hairy legs, burning bras and a declaration of superiority of men. The new feminist can enjoy wearing a red dress and high heels. The new feminist doesn\u2019t necessarily believe women are superior to men. She recognizes gender differences but believes these differences should be respected. The new feminism revolves around reproductive rights, equal pay, security for families with single mothers and, for those like Gillibrand, having women\u2019s voices heard in the government. Maybe the reason I never noticed the flurry of women\u2019s activism around me was because I didn\u2019t recognize it as women\u2019s activism. I recognized it as common sense. Shouldn\u2019t companies provide paid maternity leave when the majority of other countries do? Shouldn\u2019t people receive the same salary for the same work? And shouldn\u2019t half the population have half the representation in the government?\n\nFor me, the new feminism isn\u2019t about men versus women. It\u2019s about people. Women aren\u2019t a unique, separate entity. If the government safeguards the interest of its people, shouldn\u2019t that include all people? Although an obvious statement, women are people too, but somehow it seems this was forgotten. Now it\u2019s time to remember what Susan B. Anthony pointed out back in 1872: \u201cIt was we, the people; not we, the white male citizens; nor we, the male citizens; but we, the whole people, who formed the Union.\u201d\n\nBlair Dunbar is a Weinberg senior.
