Houston St.; (212) 727-8110\n\nFriday-March 27\n\nENLARGE Ivor Novello in Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Lodger.' BFI/Park Circus Films\n\nAlfred Hitchcock died in 1980, yet his films still feel as elemental and profuse as the weather. Even someone who thinks he or she has seen all of them will come across something new in \"The Complete Hitchcock,\" a 57-film retrospective that reaches back to 1925 and \"The Pleasure Garden,\" the Master of Suspense's first feature, and includes lesser-known English films such as \"Waltzes from Vienna\" along with the silent-era classic \"The Lodger.\" If you've never seen \"Dial M for Murder\" in 3-D, or both versions of \"The Man Who Knew Too Much,\" here's your chance.\n\nHyper-Reality\n\nUnionDocs\n\n322 Union Ave., Brooklyn; www.uniondocs.org\n\nSaturday\n\nScotland-based filmmaker Duncan Campbell presents three works that illustrate his highly subjective approach to making documentaries, which he calls \"a peculiar form of fiction.\" The films include \"Make It New John,\" which looks at automobile designer John DeLorean, and \"Bernadette,\" whose subject is the Northern Irish activist Bernadette Devlin. Mr. Campbell also will discuss his methods, which take creative liberties with reported history and archival materials.\n\nFilm Comment Selects\n\nFilm Society of Lincoln Center\n\n165 W. 65th St.; (212) 875-5601\n\nThrough Feb. 27\n\nENLARGE Antonio de la Torre in 'Cannibal.' Film Movement\n\nThis annual program is the friskier flip side of the New York Film Festival, with a taste for freaky genre films, overlooked efforts by established directors and new work that challenges audiences in unexpected ways. Horror fans haven't one but two movies about cannibalism (one is even called \"Cannibal\"), guided by artful perspectives. Viewers can also catch up with two early films from leading German director Christian Petzold (\"Wolfsburg\" and \"Ghosts\"), take in a marathon screening of Jane Campion's miniseries \"Top of the Lake\" and sample the new wave of Iranian film, represented by the bizarre father-son drama \"Fat Shaker.\"\n\nKino Polska: New Polish Cinema\n\nBAMcinematek\n\n30 Lafayette Ave., Brooklyn; (718) 636-4100\n\nThrough Sunday\n\nENLARGE Jakub Gierszal in 'Lasting.' Jacek Borcuch\n\nNine new films argue for the vitality of contemporary Polish cinema in this showcase, selected from the popular Gdynia Film Festival. Some personalize the history of postwar Poland, looking at the early 1960s and the ghosts of the Holocaust ( Pawel Pawlikowski's black-and-white character study \" Ida \") or the last decade ( Ryszard Bugajski's \"Closed Circuit,\" based on news reports of government corruption). Others take on more intimate themes, focused on couples whose love may not sustain them, as in Jacek Borcuch's \"Lasting\" and Slawomir Fabicki's \"Loving.\"\n\nRuss Meyer & Roger Ebert\n\nAnthology Film Archives\n\n32 Second Ave.; (212) 508-5181\n\nFriday-Sunday\n\nENLARGE A group shot from 'Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,' written by Russ Meyer and Roger Ebert. 20th Century Fox\n\nWhile widely remembered as a film critic, the late Roger Ebert also penned a pair of screenplays that earned notoriety in their day\u2014collaborations with friend Russ Meyer, \"The King of the Nudies.\" The satirical, sexploitation romps are revived this weekend on 35mm, including \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\" (1970) and its sequel \"Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens\" (1979). Also showing is \"Up!\" (1976), an erotic murder mystery to which Ebert contributed dialogue.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-02-20T04:42:00.000Z", "article.section": "New York", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "A roundup of screenings showing in New York City.", "title": "Listing of Repertory Films On Screen in the Coming Week", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NY-CV923_MOVIES_G_20140219172750.jpg", "alt": "All 57 of Hitchcock's movies are showing at NYC's Film Forum.
