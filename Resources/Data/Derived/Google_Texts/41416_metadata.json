(AP Photo/Jon Elswick)\n\nRepublicans have always had a problem where rhetoric meets reality on the Affordable Care Act. In the abstract, the law has never been overwhelmingly popular, but many of the things the law actually does \u2014 like preventing insurance companies from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions \u2014 are extremely popular.\n\nAnd so, if Republicans actually succeed in reversing the law\u2019s progress in a meaningful way \u2014 as they might with the King v. Burwell lawsuit that could take coverage from millions of people \u2014 they may realize, like the dog that caught the car, that this wasn\u2019t such a hot idea after all, and they might not know what to do about it.\n\nThere\u2019s a new poll out from the Kaiser Family Foundation that not only highlights this problem; it also suggests where GOP efforts are going to be concentrated if the Supreme Court does them a favor and rules against them in King.\n\nThe survey looks at people who are in the non-group market, meaning the health insurance they have isn\u2019t through their employer or through a government program like Medicare or Medicaid. Most of them got insurance through an ACA exchange.\n\nGuess what? They\u2019re pretty happy.\n\nThis is yet another conservative prediction about the ACA that failed to come true. Conservatives said that, like everything else about Obamacare, the exchanges would be a failure. But according to the KFF poll, a majority of people said they had the right amount of choices among different plans and shopping was easy. A full 74 percent rate their coverage as good or excellent. And most are satisfied with just about everything about their coverage:\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say people don\u2019t have concerns. In particular, those with high-deductible plans aren\u2019t thrilled about what they have to pay out of pocket, though it\u2019s worth noting that high-deductible plans are precisely what conservatives have been advocating for years (they call it \u201cskin in the game,\u201d meaning that if people were spending more of their own money, they\u2019d shop around more for medical services and the magic of the market would bring down costs). And there are quite a few people in this poll who say they disapprove of \u201cObamacare,\u201d which is much like the way most Americans say their kids\u2019 school is great but the American education system is a mess. A politician can rail against the thing people say they dislike, but he\u2019d better not take away their benefits.\n\nThe political implications of these results are clear: We can now add people who got their insurance through the exchanges as another constituency, in addition to those on Medicare and those who have employer-based coverage, whose coverage you cannot mess with unless you want to reap a huge backlash.\n\nThis is the problem of King v. Burwell, which is why every smart Republican is now probably praying the Supreme Court comes to their rescue and shoots the lawsuit down. Let\u2019s assume for the moment that happens. Where does it leave Republicans? They can\u2019t do anything that would seriously change or threaten coverage for people who get insurance through an employer (43 percent of American adults, according to Gallup). They can\u2019t touch Medicare, much as they\u2019d like to. And now they\u2019ll realize they have to be very careful about those who get their coverage through the exchanges, because those people like what they have. So who\u2019s left? Why poor people, of course.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is facing another challenge at the Supreme Court in King v. Burwell, which deals with subsidies for health insurance. The case could cut out a major provision of Obamacare, causing the law to unravel. Here's what you need to know about the case. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nIt isn\u2019t that Medicaid patients aren\u2019t happy with their coverage, because they are: Surveys show high levels of satisfaction with the program. But the people who are on it are poor, which means they have little political power. So Republicans may feel quite free not only to try to prevent them from getting coverage in the first place (by continuing to fight against the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid), but even by trying to curtail, modify, or cut off coverage for those who already have it \u2014 something they don\u2019t dare when it comes to those other groups.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering where Republicans are going to focus their efforts on health care in the future \u2014 their real efforts, not just abstract rhetoric or bills offered to show they have a \u201cplan\u201d but which everyone knows will never become law \u2014 that\u2019s where you should look.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new poll finds that people who get coverage on the exchanges are pretty happy.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A new poll finds that people who get coverage on the exchanges are pretty happy.", "title": "Sorry, Republicans: Obamacare is getting more and more entrenched", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/21/sorry-republicans-obamacare-is-getting-more-and-more-entrenched/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/plum-line/Images/Health_Overhaul_Security-0dab8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/21/sorry-republicans-obamacare-is-getting-more-and-more-entrenched/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, obamacare exchanges, king v. burwell, kaiser family foundation, obamacare tax credits, obamacare subsidies, medicaid expansion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, obamacare exchanges, king v. burwell, kaiser family foundation, obamacare tax credits, obamacare subsidies, medicaid expansion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4377\"", "article_summary": "The case could cut out a major provision of Obamacare, causing the law to unravel.\nConservatives said that, like everything else about Obamacare, the exchanges would be a failure.\n(AP Photo/Jon Elswick)Republicans have always had a problem where rhetoric meets reality on the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Affordable Care Act is facing another challenge at the Supreme Court in King v.
