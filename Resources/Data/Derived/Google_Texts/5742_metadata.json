Its members are also exempt from the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act, which requires individuals to purchase insurance plans. The law allows health care sharing groups created before 1999 to continue operating as insurance alternatives. Samaritan Ministrires was founded in 1991.\n\nUnder the health care sharing ministry, monthly share payments are made directly to those in need. Members are responsible for three of their own annual health care costs under $300, which includes preventative care and routine check-ups.\n\nWhen an individual or family encounters a more expensive health care costs, other members are notified and invited to make a payment directly to them.\n\nThe share payment may come with a personal note and prayers from the community, a Christian touch the speakers said helps distinguish the ministry from the private insurance market.\n\nIn addition, if costs exceed $250,000, members can draw from the SMI Save to Share program, where enrollees can pay extra into a pool for high-cost needs.\n\nGenerally speaking, however, the costs of health sharing are lower than normal health insurance, CMF CURO co-founder David Wilson said. \u201cThe truth is that 80 percent of the cost in health care is driven by lifestyle,\u201d he said, claiming that churchgoing Christians are seen as more responsible about their personal health than others because they take stewardship of their bodies and their health.\n\nNon-Catholics are also eligible to participate in the ministry. Among the requirements for eligibility are regular church attendance \u2013 which is confirmed by a prospective member\u2019s pastor \u2013 and a promise to \u201cabstain from sinful practices such as drug abuse and sexual immorality.\u201d\n\nWilson said that among those most interested in the ministry may be the uninsured, individual contractors, small business owners, and those wishing to opt out of the health care law\u2019s state exchanges.\n\nWhen asked how the ministry will deal with the rising costs of health care, Samaritan Ministries membership director Anthony Hopp acknowledged the ministry is \u201cnot immune\u201d to the rising costs, but the increases \u201cthat we\u2019ve seen have been modest and fewer compared to what happens with insurance.\u201d\n\nAll members vote on whether or not to raise the monthly share amounts after three consecutive months in which there are \u201cmore medical needs presented than shares available.\u201d In addition, the amount shared may be lessened if necessary, to the point a member in need receives 80 percent of the coverage instead of the normal 100 percent.\n\nThe health sharing ministry is part of the \u201cnew evangelization\u201d because members are caring for each other\u2019s needs in addition to their own, leaders said, explaining that prayer and Christian community makes up a fundamental part of the ministry.\n\n\u201cCURO empowers Catholic Christian charity. It is a witness to the New Evangelization. It fosters authentic Christian community, and it is not insurance, but is rather Christian caring, Christian charity, Christian sharing with your brothers and sisters in Christ,\u201d said Brown.\n\nWilson called it \u201cthe \u2018yes\u2019 of Mary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a reality that allows the Christians in the Catholic community, Catholics, to say I want to participate in an authentically Catholic-sharing ministry for my health care expenses and the needs of my family.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Catholic News Agency", "description": "The first Catholic health care sharing ministry in the U.S. will promote the \u201cGospel of Life\u201d in health care, leaders announced at the ministry\u2019s Oct. 2 launch in Washington, D.C.", "title": "Catholic health sharing touted as evangelizing alternative to insurance", "url": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/catholic-health-sharing-touted-as-evangelizing-alternative-to-insurance-96166/", "image": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Doctor_Physician_Office_Health_File_Photo_Credit_CDC_James_Gathany_CNA_2_12_14.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The first Catholic health care sharing ministry in the U.S. will promote the \u201cGospel of Life\u201d in health care, leaders announced at the ministry\u2019s Oct. 2 launch in Washington, D.C.", "title": "Catholic health sharing touted as evangelizing alternative to insurance", "image": {"src": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Doctor_Physician_Office_Health_File_Photo_Credit_CDC_James_Gathany_CNA_2_12_14.jpg"}, "creator": "@cnalive", "site": "@cnalive", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 32422915}, "fb": {"app_id": 1502824986641800}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1193\"", "article_summary": "Generally speaking, however, the costs of health sharing are lower than normal health insurance, CMF CURO co-founder David Wilson said.\nThe law allows health care sharing groups created before 1999 to continue operating as insurance alternatives.\nUnder the health care sharing ministry, monthly share payments are made directly to those in need.\nThe health sharing ministry also abides by Catholic social teaching, which means that no payments will cover practices that violate Church teaching, such as contraception or abortion.\nUnlike the standard procedure for a health insurance policy, members of the health care sharing ministry do not pay monthly premiums and deductibles for their health care, Instead, they cover each other\u2019s health care costs through monthly share payments made directly to those in need."}
