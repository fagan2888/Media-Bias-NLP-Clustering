from new DC correspondent Aubree Abril:

WASHINGTON — Sen. John Cornyn has cosponsored legislation that would make state and local sales tax deductions on federal income tax returns permanent.

The deduction is especially important to taxpayers in Texas and a half-dozen other states without a state income tax.

“This is a matter of fundamental fairness for Texas taxpayers and one that puts them on a level playing field with taxpayers who can deduct their state income tax,” Cornyn said in a statement. “As Texans continue to face higher health care costs under Obamacare, now more than ever they need relief from burdensome taxation so they can keep more of their hard-earned money.”

A Pew analysis of IRS statistics shows that almost 20 percent of federal tax filings by Texans claim the deduction. The average savings is $376.

The deduction has previously been authorized for one or two years at a time

The bill, introduced last week by Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., would make the deduction permanent.
