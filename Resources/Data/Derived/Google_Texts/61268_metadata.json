They are also investigating what they say were inaccurate financial filings by the company.\n\nThe closure \u2014 part of a wave of failures of the new co-ops nationwide \u2014 has been a big hassle for Health Republic policyholders, who have had to shop around quickly for alternative coverage.\n\nThe situation may be worse, though, for doctors, hospitals and other clinicians. They are legally obligated to continue treating Health Republic patients through the end of the month but have been given no assurances they will ever be paid for that care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of at least two physicians who have gotten checks from Health Republic, and those checks have bounced,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Maldonado, president of the Medical Society of the State of New York.\n\nTwo groups that represent hospitals, the Health Care Association of New York State and the Greater New York Hospital Association, said their member facilities are already owed at least $150 million, not including care provided in much of November.\n\nMedical practices are likely owed millions of dollars more. A survey of 800 doctors by the medical society found that 43 percent were owed money by the company. Nearly 8 percent reported being owed $25,000 or more. One practice of 22 physicians reported being owed more than $5 million, the society said.\n\nHealth Republic Insurance of New York was one of 23 nonprofit health cooperatives created nationwide by the Affordable Care Act and was, by far, the largest of those to fail. The companies, backed with $2.4 billion in taxpayer-financed loans, were supposed to be lower-cost, consumer-friendly alternative to the private, for-profit insurers that dominate the marketplace.\n\nMost, though, have struggled mightily. At least half will have shut down by the end of this year, just two years after they began operating. (Health Republic of New Jersey, a separate co-op run independently of Health Republic of New York, is still in business.)\n\nExperts give a variety of reasons for the failures, including poor management, low premiums and not enough startup funds. Republicans in Congress have criticized the initiative as a giant waste of money. The federal health overhaul was initially supposed to provide up to $6 billion in startup loans, but Congress ended funding in 2013.\n\nHealth Republic received $241 million in federal loans. The company\u2019s ability to repay that money is unknown.\n\nMagnaCare, the company that had provided Health Republic with its large network of medical providers, tried to stem losses by ending its agreement with the insurer on Oct. 19, but the state intervened Nov. 5 and ordered the network to keep seeing patients through the end of the month, saying a shutdown would be too disruptive.\n\nThat was good for patients like Penny Glaser, a breast cancer survivor from Nesconset, New York. She persuaded her doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to move a scheduled follow-up exam from December to November so she could be assured of getting the test before her insurance expired.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t aware the shift could mean that the hospital may go uncompensated, or at least be paid pennies on the dollar.\n\n\u201cI think the state of New York should bail out everybody,\u201d Glaser said.\n\nHealth Republic officials didn\u2019t return phone or email messages. Messages left with executives at Alvarez and Marsal, a company brought in by the state to take over management of Health Republic during the wind-down, also weren\u2019t returned.\n\nDr. Maldonado, of the medical society, said that if state officials want to count on the continued support of physicians for the health care overhaul, the government should step up and \u201cmake the providers whole.\u201d\n\nThe Greater New York Hospital Association has proposed the creation of a guarantee fund, financed by the insurance industry, that would ensure that providers get paid. The state has similar guarantee funds for some other lines of insurance.\n\n\u201cThis is the responsibility, in my opinion, of all insurers in this state,\u201d said the association\u2019s president, Kenneth Raske.\n\nLeslie Moran, spokeswoman for the New York Health Plan Association, said insurers strongly oppose that idea.\n\n\u201cOther plans in the state should not be asked to bear the burden of fixing a problem they didn\u2019t create,\u201d she said.\n\nOfficials in New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services and the state\u2019s health plan marketplace have said that for now they are focusing their energy on making sure Health Republic\u2019s policyholders switch to another plan without a disruption in their care.\n\nIn their Nov. 5 letter to MagnaCare, state officials that Health Republic\u2019s financial consultants \u201care hopeful that modest payments on outstanding claims may be made at some point in the future.\u201d\n\nRelated:\n\nCopyright 2016 Associated Press.
