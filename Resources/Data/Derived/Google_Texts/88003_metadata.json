Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., said today in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\nLuetkemeyer, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, was comparing the Department of Justice\u2019s Operation Choke Point to the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s much-reviled targeting of tea party and other conservative groups.\n\n>>> Update: Luetkemeyer introduced his bill, announcing that it would \u201crestore the balance between financial institutions and regulators and protect private industry from the [administration\u2019s] organized bureaucratic intimidation and regulation.\u201d\n\nOperation Choke Point seeks to cut off the financial lifeblood of payday lenders and other industries the Obama administration doesn\u2019t like by pressuring banks to close their accounts with such businesses.\n\nThe government contends that Operation Choke Point combats unlawful, mass-market consumer fraud. However, a congressional report revealed that the initiative\u2019s targets include legal businesses such as short-term lenders, firearms and ammunition merchants, coin dealers, tobacco sellers and home-based charities.\n\nAs a leader in the probe of Choke Point, Luetkemeyer within days intends to introduce a bill to guarantee a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for banks to do business with enterprises targeted by the Obama administration. He told The Daily Signal:\n\nWe want to provide a safe harbor for the banks to be able to continue to have a longstanding relationship with a business that\u2019s doing legal business. Those folks have the right to continue to exist, and the bank has the right to continue that relationship.\n\n>>> Related: Meet Four Business Owners Squeezed by Operation Choke Point\n\nThe bill is an updated version of legislation submitted by Luetkemeyer in June.\n\n\u201cThis one will be more effective and garner more support,\u201d he said. \u201cIt solves problems that are there with the present bill.\u201d\n\nHaving worked in the banking industry for more than 30 years, and as a bank regulator in Missouri, Luetkemeyer counts himself familiar with the issues at hand:\n\nI understand the banking mentality and the activities that go on. This issue was brought to me by the payday lending industry and the banks that service them. But looking into Operation Choke Point, I eventually found that it was more than just the payday lending industry. There was actually a whole list [of businesses] that was on the FDIC\u2019s website.\n\nLuetkemeyer was referring to a list of 30 examples of \u201chigh risk\u201d activities posted on the website of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation. After coming under congressional scrutiny, the FDIC, the agency responsible for regulating and auditing more than 4,500 banks, removed the list.\n\nA House report May 29 found that by categorizing coin dealers, gun sellers and short-term lenders as \u201chigh risk\u201d\u2014and equating them with explicitly illegal or offensive activities such as Ponzi schemes, pornography and racist materials\u2014the FDIC, as part of Operation Choke Point, \u201ceffectively transformed this guidance [to banks] into an implicit threat of federal investigation.\u201d\n\nLuetkemeyer and other Choke Point critics argue that although the FDIC removed its \u201cguidance\u201d list of high-risk enterprises, banks still lack necessary protections from such guidelines\u2014and so continue to terminate relationships with those industries.\n\n>>> Related: FDIC Blames \u2018Confusion\u2019 for Choking Business Owners\u2019 Access to Banks\n\n\u201cThe examiners and the DOJ believe that there\u2019s something unethical or immoral about these industries in the way that they view the world\u2014there\u2019s an ideological bent against them,\u201d Luetkemeyer said, adding of those government officials:\n\nThey\u2019re allowed to have their personal opinion. The problem is, that\u2019s not the legal law. Their job is to enforce the law the way it\u2019s written. They don\u2019t have the right to go out and make moral judgments on these businesses\u2014that\u2019s up to culture in our society.\n\nWith his bill, Luetkemeyer said he hopes to provide banks with the legal protections necessary to push back against Operation Choke Point.\n\nSpecifically, the Missouri Republican said his bill would:\n\n1. Require bank examiners to provide a legal or material basis for suggesting or requesting that banks terminate financial relationships with certain customers. This would prevent banks from closing accounts on the grounds of a \u201creputational risk\u201d alone, one result of Operation Choke Point.\n\n2. Require bank examiners to go on the record and state reasons when they determine banks need to end relationships with certain customers.\n\n3. Clarify regulatory guidelines by requiring examiners and regulators such as the FDIC to define \u201creputational risk\u201d so that the term can\u2019t be applied as a blanket rationale for closing accounts with certain enterprises.\n\n4. Amend a 1989 law regulating banks, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, to restrict bank examiners\u2019 ability to look at certain issues unless they could harm banking as opposed to merely affect banking.\n\n5. Require the U.S. attorney general or deputy attorney general sign off on every subpoena sent to banks, so that it is clear who did what, when and where.\n\n>>> Commentary: Wrongdoers at IRS Get Away Scot-Free", "article_metadata": {"description": "Calling the government's Operation Choke Point \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than the IRS scandal, a congressman prepares legislation to kill the secretive initiative.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Calling the government's Operation Choke Point \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than the IRS scandal, a congressman prepares legislation to kill the secretive initiative.", "title": "Congressman Seeks to End Program He Calls \u2018More Dangerous\u2019 Than IRS Scandal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rollcallpix066641.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-20T15:14:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xqFgmr"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Calling the government's Operation Choke Point \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than the IRS scandal, a congressman prepares legislation to kill the secretive initiative.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rollcallpix066641.jpg"}, "title": "Congressman Seeks to End Program He Calls \u2018More Dangerous\u2019 Than IRS Scandal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "executive overreach,executive power,firearms", "published_time": "2014-11-19T21:00:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-20T15:14:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "operation choke point, choke point, Rep.
