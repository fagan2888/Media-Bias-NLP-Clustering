Signed into law in March 2010, the act is meant to provide affordable quality insurance to people who don't have it through work, Medicare or Medicaid, the state-federal welfare program.\n\nMcKenzie said he's hoping to find a reasonably priced, high-deductible policy that will cover him until July 12, when he turns 65 and will become eligible for Medicare.\n\nPreparing for the worst\n\nCheryl McEvoy, 55, a self-employed nail technician who leases a storefront in northwest Oklahoma City, also plans to shop the new health insurance marketplace.\n\nShe currently has medical insurance through Insure Oklahoma, but new, stricter income requirements, which were recently imposed by the Obama administration on individual participants in the state-federal premium assistance program, will force her to leave the program Dec. 31.\n\n\u201cI'm fairly healthy, but that could change at any time,\u201d McEvoy said. \u201cI want something in case I have an emergency and need to go to the hospital.\u201d\n\nShe currently pays $50 a month for insurance, and about all she can afford is $300 a month, she said.\n\nParticipating companies\n\nAccording to a report by Oklahoma Watch, published in The OklahomanSept. 14, most monthly premiums on the marketplace will range from $200 a month to $700 a month, based on consumers' ages, tobacco use and where they live in the state. In addition to monthly premiums, the most any individual consumer in the exchange would pay per year is $6,350, including doctor\u2019s office and hospital co-pays and prescription co-pays, the news agency reported.\n\nAny Oklahoma resident is welcome to shop in the marketplaces, and individuals who have incomes between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level ($11,490 to $23,550, or $31,322 to $94,200 for families of four) will be eligible for variable subsidies, depending on income and family size. For example, a resident who qualifies for discounts, starting in January, might pay monthly insurance premiums of $200 versus $400, and the federal government would pay the insurance carrier the remainder.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation has posted a calculator at kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/ for people to estimate costs and learn if they qualify for subsidies.\n\nBut Larry Gundlach of Oklahoma Business Insurors cautions premium estimates are based on \u201csilver\u201d plans designed to cover 70 percent of all medical costs incurred by an average policy holder, when he suspects most people will want \u201cgold\u201d plans that cover 80 percent of costs or, if they're offered, \u201cplatinum\u201d plans that cover 90 percent.\n\n\u201cIf they pick the plans with more benefits, they'll have to pay for that difference,\u201d he said.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma, Aetna, Coventry, Community Care and Global Health will participate in the state's individual health insurance marketplace, Oklahoma Watch reported. Federal officials won't speculate which carriers will participate in the business marketplace for employers shopping for group plans; only that they'll have more information on Oct. 1.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield spokeswoman Ashley Hudgeons confirmed her company's participation, and at least one observer believes only three other carriers will join them.\n\nMandates prompt work changes\n\nThe Affordable Care Act not only makes it a law that individuals have health insurance but also that employers with 50 or more full-time-equivalent workers offer quality, affordable insurance to those who work 30 or more hours a week. If they don't, they face annual penalties of $2,000 per employee.\n\nThe employer mandate was set to take effect, alongside the individual mandate, on Jan. 1, but President Barack Obama on July 3 announced a one-year extension to the employer mandate. That was one week after Rose State College President Jeanie Webb issued a staff memorandum on a new policy that, as of July 1, limits the hours of many employees, effectively disqualifying them for the university's health plan next year.\n\n\u201cPart-time hourly employees will be restricted to working no more than 20 hours per week & Human Resources will only approve Appointment Requests listing up to 20 hours per week,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cAdjunct professors may work up to 12 credit hours per semester or a total of 24 credit hours per calendar year,\u201d it continues.\n\nFor at least one professor, the policy means a cut in salary.\n\n\u201cIt results in me teaching less hours, even though I have health care through my husband's organization,\u201d she wrote in an email to The Oklahoman.\n\nEven before the health care act, Oklahoma City Community College had a similar policy that part-time employees aren't allowed to work more than 25 hours per week, officials there said. Some local restaurants, retailers and other employers apparently are joining universities in officially capping staff hours.\n\nMeanwhile, one retiree of Tinker Air Force Base, who asked that his last name not be used, suspects that, even with the new marketplaces, he'll continue to pay the $207.27 monthly premiums on an individual health insurance policy he carries on his stepson, who's 36 and single, and works as a clerk for an area convenience store.\n\n\u201cHis company offers health insurance, but it's too expensive for the money he makes \u2014 $21,310 a year,\u201d said Kenneth, of Moore. \u201cEven if he qualifies for a subsidy (in the new marketplace), I doubt they can beat $207 a month.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Enrollment opens Oct. 1 for Oklahoma's federally run online health insurance marketplace.
