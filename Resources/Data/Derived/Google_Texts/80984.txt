DENVER—More spills are emerging from a Colorado oil patch ravaged by flooding as soggy conditions continue to hamper attempts to inspect the damage.

Three new spills were reported Tuesday: 5,100 gallons of oil from a Noble Energy facility east of Kersey, 2,500 gallons from a PDC Energy location east of Greeley and an unknown volume from a Mineral Resources operation west of LaSalle.

State officials are now tracking 11 “notable” releases from the Wattenberg oil patch along the South Platte River in Weld County.

The amount of crude spilled totals at least 34,524 gallons, or about 822 barrels. The volumes of two releases are still unknown.

Industry representatives have said 1,900 oil and gas wells were shut down across northern Colorado because of flooding. About 600 wells have since re-opened.
