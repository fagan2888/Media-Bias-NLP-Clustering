After waking up from the coma that his family was unsure he would ever come out of, McMahon\u2019s English-speaking abilities took time to recover, but he was able to comprehend an entirely different language. When he woke up to a nurse who appeared to be Chinese, he immediately began speaking fluent Mandarin, a skill he never possessed before his coma.\n\nDoctors believe the English circuits in McMahon\u2019s brain were damaged as a result of the car accident, while his \u201cMandarin circuits\u201d instead became engaged. Although his parents were grateful when their son finally woke up, they were understandably confused that he could not speak a word of English but was able to read, write, and speak perfect Mandarin. McMahon admitted that he had spent time in Shanghai prior to the accident and had also taken Mandarin classes in high school. However, he was nowhere near able to speak the language fluently.\n\nMcMahon decided to harness his newfound speaking ability by starting Mandarin classes at Melbourne University. Since then, he has been able to make use of his new ability to speak fluent Mandarin by entering a Chinese international language competition, heading up Mandarin walking tours, and even hosting a Chinese television show at one point. McMahon currently resides in Shanghai, where Chinese natives are impressed by how well this man from Australia can speak Mandarin.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "australian, man, fluent, mandarin", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Doctors say an Australian man's ability to speak Mandarin following a coma is a result of damage to his brain's \"English circuits\" and the engagement of his \"Mandarin circuits.\"", "title": "Man Wakes From Coma, Begins Speaking Another Language Fluently [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/australian-man-comes-out-coma-able-speak-mandarin-fluently-not-english-302046", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/09/ben-mcmahon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors say an Australian man's ability to speak Mandarin following a coma is a result of damage to his brain's \"English circuits\" and the engagement of his \"Mandarin circuits.\"", "title": "Man Wakes From Coma, Begins Speaking Another Language Fluently [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/australian-man-comes-out-coma-able-speak-mandarin-fluently-not-english-302046", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/09/ben-mcmahon.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/09/ben-mcmahon.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-09T12:13:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-09T12:13:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Doctors say an Australian man's ability to speak Mandarin following a coma is a result of damage to his brain's \"English circuits\" and the engagement of his \"Mandarin circuits.\""}, "article_summary": "McMahon currently resides in Shanghai, where Chinese natives are impressed by how well this man from Australia can speak Mandarin.\nHowever, he was nowhere near able to speak the language fluently.\nAlthough his parents were grateful when their son finally woke up, they were understandably confused that he could not speak a word of English but was able to read, write, and speak perfect Mandarin.\nWhen he woke up to a nurse who appeared to be Chinese, he immediately began speaking fluent Mandarin, a skill he never possessed before his coma.\nBack in 2012, Melbourne native Ben McMahon entered a weeklong coma following a horrific car crash."}
