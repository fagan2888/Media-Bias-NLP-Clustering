WASHINGTON – The Leadership Conference Education Fund today released the 2016 edition of The Civil Rights Monitor, a narrative and journalistic review of the year’s civil and human rights developments.

This edition of the Civil Rights Monitor chronicles the historic progress for the civil and human rights community with Supreme Court decisions affirming marriage equality and the Affordable Care Act, the passage of a long-overdue surface transportation bill, and the first reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 14 years. This year’s Monitor also brings substantive commentary on voting rights, judicial and executive nominations, economic security, and criminal justice reform.

“To have the year we had in 2015 is an important reminder of what is achievable against even the worst of odds,” said Wade Henderson, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference Education Fund, in the publication’s introduction. However, Henderson noted, the work on issues of utmost urgency to the civil and human rights community—like voting rights and immigration—remains unfinished. “In particular, this year will be an important year for voting rights. Unless Congress acts, 2016 will see the first presidential election in 50 years without the full protection of the Voting Rights Act.”
