(Living History comes in at two stars.)\n\nThe reviews overall are not good. And that's putting it mildly.\n\nUseful Book for the Summer - I borrowed this book from a friend and I read the first hundred or so pages before I had to go throw up ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just more propaganda, spin, and lies... It made me want to jab myself in the eyes with a plastic spork. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- this book gave me cancer - no, I couldn't finish, but I was able to return it and get my money back. I tore out some of the pages and told them that it was defaced before I bought it. I used the torn pages for toilet paper and I got symptoms of poison ivy. sheesh, ill never buy one of her books again! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Emergency Banana! - Hard Choices should come with an emergency banana and an instructional placard that warns: \"Warning! Eat the emergency banana before reading.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI Loved Her at One Time - She will run because power is addictive. She's begged, borrowed, and desecrated the dead for that golden ring. All the while keeping that smug smile frozen on her face.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBoring and way out of line - The only hard choices this woman has faced is how to spend her millions and then tell us how hard she has it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTasteless, uncompassionate, narcissistic, unempathic, humourless, uninformed on geography, geopolitics, geopolitical history in this chapter. I will check out the others when I have time.\n\nIf nothing else, an incredibly valuable document about war crimes.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGarbage! - A nonstop roller coaster ride of lies, deceptions, and twisted nonsense.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Democrats passed Obamacare without reading the law. So, I feel justified in rating this book without first reading it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nwell I myself have some hard choices to make. Should I re-read this drivel or replace my existing Charmin with 40 grit sandpaper.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe stories were clearly designed to portray the Senator is a certain light. Whenever something went wrong, it was someone else's fault.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShould be required reading for Psych 101 intro to narcissistic sociopaths.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is one Democrat who will vote Republican in 2016 if HC is the Democratic candidate.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "\"A nonstop roller coaster ride of lies, deceptions, and twisted nonsense. \"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "\"A nonstop roller coaster ride of lies, deceptions, and twisted nonsense. \"", "title": "The Amazon Reviews for Hillary Clinton's Hard Choices are in... and They are Really Bad", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/235246/amazon-reviews-hillary-clintons-hard-choices-are-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:44:55-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/235246/amazon-reviews-hillary-clintons-hard-choices-are-daniel-greenfield", "description": "\"A nonstop roller coaster ride of lies, deceptions, and twisted nonsense. \"", "card": "summary", "title": "The Amazon Reviews for Hillary Clinton's Hard Choices are in... and They are Really Bad"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-27T07:28:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:44:55-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As a sample, here is the most positive and most negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's Hard Choices side by side.\n- Hard Choices should come with an emergency banana and an instructional placard that warns: \"Warning!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Boring and way out of line - The only hard choices this woman has faced is how to spend her millions and then tell us how hard she has it.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Emergency Banana!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------well I myself have some hard choices to make."}
