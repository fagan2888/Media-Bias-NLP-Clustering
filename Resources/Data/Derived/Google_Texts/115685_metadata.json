The Times of Israel provided an English translation:\n\nBarack Obama: I demand that Israel agrees to an immediate, unilateral ceasefire and halt all offensive activities, in particular airstrikes.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu: And what will Israel receive in exchange for a ceasefire?\n\nBO: I believe that Hamas will cease its rocket fire \u2014 silence will be met with silence.\n\nBN: Hamas broke all five previous ceasefires. It\u2019s a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of Israel.\n\nBO: I repeat and expect Israel to stop all its military activities unilaterally. The pictures of destruction in Gaza distance the world from Israel\u2019s position.\n\nBN: Kerry\u2019s proposal was completely unrealistic and gives Hamas military and diplomatic advantages.\n\nBO: Within a week of the end of Israel\u2019s military activities, Qatar and Turkey will begin negotiations with Hamas based on the 2012 understandings, including Israel\u2019s commitment to removing the siege and restrictions on Gaza.\n\nBN: Qatar and Turkey are the biggest supporters of Hamas. It\u2019s impossible to rely on them to be fair mediators.\n\nBO: I trust Qatar and Turkey. Israel is not in the position that it can choose its mediators.\n\nBN: I protest because Hamas can continue to launch rockets and use tunnels for terror attacks \u2013\n\nBO: (interrupting Netanyahu) The ball\u2019s in Israel\u2019s court, and it must end all its military activities.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Channel 1 in Israel released a transcript in Hebrew it claimed was of a tense phone call between President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.", "title": "Israeli Newspaper Publishes Alleged Transcript of Tense Phone Call Between Obama and Netanyahu; Doesn\u2019t Resemble Reality, NSC Tweets", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/07/29/israeli-newspaper-publishes-alleged-tran", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14066626796418.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Channel 1 in Israel released a\ntranscript in Hebrew it claimed was of a tense phone call between\nPresident Barack Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
