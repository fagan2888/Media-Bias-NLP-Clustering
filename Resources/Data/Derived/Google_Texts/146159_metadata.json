It is due a 7.2 billion euro trance from the EU/IMF bailout, which it says it does not want because of the austerity strings attached.\n\nInstead, Athens wants authority from the euro zone to issue more short-term debt to tide it over until a new deal is agreed, and to receive already-agreed profits that the European Central Bank and other central banks have gained from holding Greek bonds.\n\nGreece faces interest rate payments of around 2 billion euros over February and should repay a 1.5 billion euro loan to the IMF in March.\n\nThat has raised concerns the country may suffer a cash crunch, but this was dismissed on Saturday by the Greek official in charge of the government's accounts.\n\n\"During the time span of the negotiations there is no problem (of liquidity). This does not mean that there will be a problem afterwards,\" Deputy Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas said on Mega TV.\n\nAsked whether the state may suffer a cash crunch if talks drag on until May, the minister said he did not expect the negotiations over a new deal to last that long.\n\n\"Even if they did, we can find money,\" he said.
