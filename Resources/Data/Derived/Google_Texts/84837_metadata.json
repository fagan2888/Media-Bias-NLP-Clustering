(Bridge photo by Pat Shellenbarger)\n\nFrom a corner of her dining room, Joan Fabiano directs a Tea Party group she founded called Grassroots in Michigan.\n\n\u201cThis is command central,\u201d she said, pointing to a desktop computer on a small table.\n\nShe has no budget, no bylaws, no regular meetings and no members. Yet, without leaving her Lansing-area home, she is able to influence politicians and create the impression that she speaks for a large organization.\n\nA letter she released calling on conservatives to sit out the next gubernatorial election if Gov. Rick Snyder continued pushing for Medicaid expansion under Obamacare drew statewide publicity.\n\nShe claims to have 650 followers on Facebook and an email list that she says is in the thousands. Her website is a collection of right-wing articles and links. Aside from its occasional physical meetings, Grassroots in Michigan is a virtual Tea Party.\n\n\u201cI wanted to show that an ordinary person doesn\u2019t need to have an organization in order to change public policy,\u201d Fabiano said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have an office. You don\u2019t have to have a lot of money. You don\u2019t have to have all of those things to be effective. All you have to have is a desire and a way to network with all of these people. Whatever reputation or standing I\u2019ve gotten, it\u2019s all been done very minimally. This is what social media has done.\u201d\n\nThe Tea Party movement owes much of its success to email and social media. Those tools are what allowed the Tea Party to spring to life within weeks of President Obama taking his first oath of office, and they are essential to what\u2019s kept it going. Within minutes, it can generate a flood of emails and phone calls to lawmakers. Given a day or two, it can organize a rally on the state capitol lawn.\n\nFabiano doesn\u2019t have the conventional background of a political powerbroker. Retired after 30 years with General Motors \u2013 first on the line, then in an administrative job \u2013 she runs a part-time home-staging business. She is a Republican precinct delegate who began connecting with other conservatives through Twitter in early 2009.\n\n\u201cWe were having this conversation about the massive debt, the bailout and the general direction of our country,\u201d she said, \u201cand then the conversation turned to what can we do about it?\u201d\n\nShe and \u201ctwo other gals got together and put up a website, and in three days we got over 300 people at the capitol,\u201d she said. \u201cThat had a domino effect.\u201d She helped organize another rally on April 15, 2009 \u2013 tax day \u2013 which, according to the Associated Press, drew 4,000 in Lansing.\n\nInitially, Fabiano called her group the Lansing Tea Party. It later morphed into Grassroots in Michigan.\n\n\u201cTwitter was the conduit to meet so many other people,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I transitioned more over into Facebook.\u201d\n\nSuch tools are essential, said another Tea Party organizer, Wes Nakagiri, but are no substitutes for face-to-face contact. After attending a Tea Party rally in Washington in September 2009, he began reading books on community organizing, written by liberals, including Saul Alinsky, often cited by Newt Gingrich in the last presidential campaign as a left-wing bogeyman.\n\n\u201cI figured what works for them should work for me,\u201d Nakagiri said. \u201cThey\u2019d been at it longer, in my view, than the right. Nowadays, I would say the Tea Party does it better than the left, in terms of getting people organized.\u201d\n\nWhile he knew many potential supporters would have a wide range of concerns, he took the liberals\u2019 advice to keep a narrow focus, in his case on fiscal issues. He drew up a petition expressing concern to his congressman and began going door-to-door near his Livingston County home. Days later, he circled back.\n\n\u201cOnce you knew someone would sign one of these petitions, I figured they might want to get more involved,\u201d said Nakagiri, who works in marketing for an auto parts manufacturer.\n\nHe founded a Hartland-based Tea Party called RetakeOurGov, set up a Web site, and then created a political action committee to raise money and support conservative candidates. He later created a second PAC and then a Super PAC to solicit corporate donations.\n\nCombined, the three PACs raised about $45,000, Nakagiri estimated, and made campaign donations to Mitt Romney, U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, R-Cascade Township, and U.S. Rep. Kerry Bentivolio, R-Milford, a Tea Party favorite who recently said impeaching President Obama \u201cwould be a dream come true.\u201d\n\nIn late August, Nakagiri took the next step, saying he is running to unseat Republican Lt. Gov. Brian Calley. He made that announcement on Facebook and by email.\n\nFor Gene Clem, a 70-year-old retired information technology officer for a bank, inspiration came on Feb. 19, 2009, when he saw CNBC commentator Rick Santelli\u2019s on-air meltdown, accusing the government of promoting \u201cbad behavior\u201d and calling for a \u201cChicago Tea Party,\u201d a rant many credit with sparking the Tea Party movement.\n\nClem met two other like-minded conservatives through a website. They scheduled a meeting, and 20 people showed up to plan a rally in front of the Kalamazoo County courthouse in March 2009. If they were lucky, Clem figured they might draw a couple of hundred. A little more than 1,000 showed up, he said, and he collected 800 email addresses.\n\n\u201cWe were just amazed,\u201d Clem said. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d have a rally and be done, but people kept asking questions, so it was obvious we weren\u2019t done.\u201d\n\nHe since has helped set up several Southwest Michigan tea parties and moderates meetings of the Tea Party Alliance, 20 or 30 groups that meet monthly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019d have done it without the Internet,\u201d he said.\n\nHe knows the Tea Party has a bit of an image problem, created in its early days when screaming members disrupted several Congressional town hall meetings.\n\n\u201cThat the downside of Facebook and Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can be really loud, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re effective.\u201d\n\nWhen some who attended his first meetings were disruptive, \u201cI said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do that, or I\u2019m out,\u2019\u201d Clem recalled. \u201cI don\u2019t like people shouting at me, and I don\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nJoan Fabiano agreed the Internet has allowed some extremists to don the Tea Party mantle.\n\n\u201cAnybody can say they\u2019re Tea Party, just as anybody can say they\u2019re Christian,\u201d she said. \u201cAny time you have something this big, you\u2019re going to have some kookiness. This idea to paint the Tea Party as a bunch of kooks, I think, is a creation of the liberal media.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like your crazy uncle. You don\u2019t approve, but he is your uncle.\u201d\n\n\n\nPat Shellenbarger is a freelance writer based in West Michigan.
