An online database of country-specific clinical research regulatory information is now available at clinregs.niaid.nih.gov. Developed by NIHâ€™s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the ClinRegs website is designed to help the research community plan international clinical trials more efficiently by consolidating regulatory requirements in one place and enabling comparisons across countries.

By providing up-to-date, well-organized regulatory information for multiple countries, ClinRegs serves as a central resource and a potential time-saver for people involved in planning and implementing international clinical research.

Topic areas covered on the website include clinical trial lifecycle, competent authority oversight, ethics committee review, informed consent, investigational products, specimens, and sponsorship. The search countries currently include Brazil, China, India, Kenya, Malawi, Peru, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The ClinRegs team plans to further expand its country list in alignment with NIAID research priorities, including incorporating regulations from Liberia and Sierra Leone in 2014.

NIAID is striving to make ClinRegs a useful resource for the research community and welcomes comments, insights, and suggestions via its Feedback survey on the website. To access the ClinRegs site, go to clinregs.niaid.nih.gov.
