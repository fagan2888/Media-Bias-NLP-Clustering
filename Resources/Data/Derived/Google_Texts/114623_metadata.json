Restoring the 40-hour work week would benefit retail employees with more income, encourage more full-time employment and overcome a principle concern with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate. The association has fought efforts by the National Labor Relations Board to tilt the balance of union organizing efforts against retailers and our employees. Recent NLRB decisions, such as \u201cambush\u201d organizing elections or \u201cmicro-unions,\u201d have placed the interests of union organizers ahead of everyone else. Opportunities for retail are also at risk in the debate over a federal minimum wage hike that will slow the creation of starting jobs for younger workers and make it harder for small retailers to expand. Meanwhile, proposed changes in federal overtime rules will keep retail managers doing more paperwork and prevent them from ensuring that customers are served better.

Labor Relations \u2013 The National Labor Relations Board should be returned to its intended role as an objective arbiter of labor issues and should rescind rulings, and regulations on issues such as \u201cambush\u201d elections and \u201cmicro-unions\u201d that are intended to make it easier to organize traditionally non-union industries like retail.\n\n\u2013 The National Labor Relations Board should be returned to its intended role as an objective arbiter of labor issues and should rescind rulings, and regulations on issues such as \u201cambush\u201d elections and \u201cmicro-unions\u201d that are intended to make it easier to organize traditionally non-union industries like retail.

Right to Work \u2013 Workers should be free to decide whether to join a union, but should not be rushed with \u201cambush\u201d elections that allow only the union to present its side or have their right to a secret ballot taken away through \u201ccard check\u201d elections that require only that a union card be signed.\n\n\u2013 Workers should be free to decide whether to join a union, but should not be rushed with \u201cambush\u201d elections that allow only the union to present its side or have their right to a secret ballot taken away through \u201ccard check\u201d elections that require only that a union card be signed.
