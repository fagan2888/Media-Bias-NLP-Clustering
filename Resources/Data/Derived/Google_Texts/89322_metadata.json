In the next phase, officials plan to pave 3.35 miles of the Greenway, from Stinson Drive to Croghan Landing, and replace a wooden bridge with an aluminum bridge near Parkdale Drive.\n\nThe West Ashley Greenway will remain a little greener for a little longer, as the city\u2019s plans to pave its next section have fallen behind schedule.\n\nCharleston project manager Matt Compton said earlier last year that the 3.35-mile-long paving work would be done by December.\n\nBut Compton said recently that the work was delayed because it took longer than expected for the city to get approval and funding from the state Department of Transportation. Also, a few other city projects needed to be done first, he added.\n\nCurrently, the easternmost three miles of the 8-mile Greenway have been paved. Compton said the next section, from Stinson Drive to Croghan Landing, could be paved by early 2017.\n\nKurt Cavanaugh, executive director of the advocacy group Charleston Moves, said his group supports the Greenway paving project, so he\u2019s disappointed it has fallen behind schedule.\n\nThe linear path, created on an old railroad right of way parallel to Savannah Highway, is used for both recreation and transportation.\n\n\u201cAnything bike- or pedestrian-related gets pushed to the back burner,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we keep doing this, we\u2019re not going to have a bikeable and walkable city any time soon.\u201d\n\nHoward Herbert, who lives near Parkdale Drive in West Ashley, said he\u2019s going to wait to buy a new bike until the paving is done.\n\nWhen he first learned the Greenway would be paved, he didn\u2019t like the idea. He has traveled on the unpaved portion on an old beachcomber bike, and he enjoys that. But he said he also would like to bike the trail to run errands, such as going to the Harris Teeter grocery store. Such trips would be a lot easier if the entire Greenway were paved.\n\n\u201cWith a speedy bike, I could start a Starbucks habit at South Windermere,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city plans to pave the next 3.35 miles in two phases, Compton said.\n\nWork on the first 1.1-mile section, from Stinson to Parkdale Drive, will begin in the fall and should be done in early 2017, he said. That work is expected to cost about $235,000, with $188,000 coming from the state DOT and the rest coming from the city.\n\nThat portion includes a wooden bridge over a creek near Parkdale Drive. The city plans to replace that with an aluminum bridge that will be built off site, then transported to the Greenway. Installing the bridge likely will take only about a day, Compton said.\n\nMeanwhile, the city will begin paving the 2.3 miles from Parkdale Drive to Croghan Landing around the same time, Compton said. That section could be finished in late 2016, a bit ahead of the Stinson to Parkdale section.\n\nThe Parkdale to Croghan section is expected to cost about $670,000, about $500,000 of which will come from the city and about $170,000 of which will come from Charleston County\u2019s share of the state gas tax.\n\nThe city has not made plans to pave the final 1.5 miles, from Croghan Landing to Main Road.\n\nAll of the paved portions of the trail will be 8 feet wide, he said, which is the minimum for a bicycle trail.\n\nCity leaders said they have received mostly positive feedback from residents regarding the paving. Many people have said a paved trail is safer and easier to use.\n\nBut West Ashley resident Jock Stender, who regularly rides his bike on the Greenway, said he prefers the unpaved portion, and he was glad to learn he\u2019ll have several more months to enjoy it.\n\nHe said paving the last few miles of the trail is a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money because they simply aren\u2019t used as much.\n\n\u201cWhy pave everything?\u201d he asked.\n\nReach Diane Knich at 843-937-5491 or on Twitter @dianeknich.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "West Ashley Greenway paving a year behind schedule, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, biking,Charleston Moves,Kurt Cavanaugh,Matt Compton,SCDOT,West Ashley Greenway", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The West Ashley Greenway will remain a little greener for a little longer, as the city\u2019s plans to pave its next section have fallen behind schedule.", "title": "West Ashley Greenway paving a year behind schedule", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20160327/160329734/west-ashley-greenway-paving-a-year-behind-schedule", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160327/PC16/160329734/AR/0/AR-160329734.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160327/PC16/160329734/AR/0/AR-160329734.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The West Ashley Greenway will remain a little greener for a little longer, as the city\u2019s plans to pave its next section have fallen behind schedule.", "title": "West Ashley Greenway paving a year behind schedule", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160327/PC16/160329734/AR/0/AR-160329734.jpg?201603271551", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 160329734}}, "keywords": "West Ashley Greenway paving a year behind schedule , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, biking,Charleston Moves,Kurt Cavanaugh,Matt Compton,SCDOT,West Ashley Greenway", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-27T00:01:00Z", "modified_time": "2016-03-27T15:51:00Z", "author": "Diane Knich"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The West Ashley Greenway will remain a little greener for a little longer, as the city\u2019s plans to pave its next section have fallen behind schedule."}, "article_summary": "Kurt Cavanaugh, executive director of the advocacy group Charleston Moves, said his group supports the Greenway paving project, so he\u2019s disappointed it has fallen behind schedule.\nThe West Ashley Greenway will remain a little greener for a little longer, as the city\u2019s plans to pave its next section have fallen behind schedule.\nMeanwhile, the city will begin paving the 2.3 miles from Parkdale Drive to Croghan Landing around the same time, Compton said.\nTwo bicyclists ride along an unpaved section of the West Ashley Greenway.\nWork on the first 1.1-mile section, from Stinson to Parkdale Drive, will begin in the fall and should be done in early 2017, he said."}
