That would tie him with UCLA men\u2019s basketball coach John Wooden for the most championships in college basketball.\n\nAuriemma has a perfect record with the national championship on the line, winning all nine of UConn\u2019s trips to the title game.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that\u2019s going to last forever,\u201d Auriemma said. \u201c[We\u2019re] not going to win every single championship game that we\u2019re in if we\u2019re in some more, but up to this point, it\u2019s something that\u2019s really hard to explain. And I\u2019m just incredibly grateful.\u201d\n\nUConn junior Breanna Stewart has been the key two the last two titles.\n\nThe Associated Press player of the year the last two seasons saves her best games for the brightest lights. She was the Final Four\u2019s most outstanding player as a freshman and sophomore and had another great game in the semifinal win over Maryland.\n\nShe said when she arrived at UConn that her goal was to win four championships. Only the Huskies, from 2002 through 2004, and Tennessee, from 1996 to 1998, have won three consecutive titles.\n\nUConn beat Tennessee in 2003 and 2004 \u2014 the only other time in the history of the NCAA tournament that the same teams played in the title game in consecutive seasons.\n\nMcGraw has the Fighting Irish back in the title game for the fourth time in five seasons. She\u2019s won only one title at Notre Dame, beating Purdue in 2001.\n\n\u201cI think being here is a great achievement for us,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cI think probably because we [won] one that maybe I don\u2019t feel that sort of pressure [to win another]. But I want to win this for this team. I want to win for this team so that they can have that feeling looking up in the rafters and seeing another banner.\u201d\n\nThe Fighting Irish lost two All-Americans from last season\u2019s team and weren\u2019t expected to make it to the title game when the season began.\n\n\u201cI think when we started the season and looked at what we lost last year and were wondering where all the offense is going to come from, to say that we\u2019ve come a long way, I think it\u2019s a little bit of an understatement,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cI\u2019m just proud of where we\u2019ve gotten to and how this team has just been resilient and continued to pursue their goals this year.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame needed a putback by unlikely star Madison Cable with less than 16 seconds left, and then a defensive stand, to defeat South Carolina and advance to the championship game.\n\nThe two teams met in December at Notre Dame, where the Huskies left with an 18-point victory.\n\nNotre Dame was missing freshman Brianna Turner, who was nursing a shoulder injury. She\u2019s made a major impact since missing those three games.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s our leading rebounder and one of our top three scorers,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cSo I think she makes a difference in our team at the defensive end, with her rebounding her presence of shot blocking and the way she can run the floor. I think that we are a much better team with her on the floor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unlike last season's game, when much of the conversation was about the frosty relationship between Geno Auriemma and Muffet McGraw, there is friendlier attitude between the coaches and their teams.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Unlike last season\u2019s game, when much of the conversation was about the frosty relationship between Geno Auriemma and Muffet McGraw, there is friendlier attitude between the coaches and their teams.", "title": "UConn, Notre Dame set for rematch in national championship game", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/6/uconn-notre-dame-set-rematch-national-championship/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/06/9a8d473b73afda0f720f6a7067007da4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/06/9a8d473b73afda0f720f6a7067007da4.jpg", "description": "Unlike last season's game, when much of the conversation was about the frosty relationship between Geno Auriemma and Muffet McGraw, there is friendlier attitude between the coaches and their teams.", "card": "summary", "title": "UConn, Notre Dame set for rematch in national championship game"}, "Author": "Doug Feinberg", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Muffet Mcgraw, Geno Auriemma, Breanna Stewart"}, "article_summary": "Auriemma has a perfect record with the national championship on the line, winning all nine of UConn\u2019s trips to the title game.\nA win for the Huskies on Tuesday night would be a third consecutive title for UConn and 10th overall for Auriemma.\nTAMPA, Fla. \u2014 The women\u2019s basketball championship game will have a familiar feel to it with UConn and Notre Dame playing for a title for the second consecutive year.\nMcGraw has the Fighting Irish back in the title game for the fourth time in five seasons.\nUConn beat Tennessee in 2003 and 2004 \u2014 the only other time in the history of the NCAA tournament that the same teams played in the title game in consecutive seasons."}
