(AP) - Minot parks officials early next month will open bids for a proposed third sheet of ice in Maysa Arena.\n\nParks Director Ron Merritt tells the Minot Daily News (http://bit.ly/1J480E0 ) that if bids are reasonable, the expansion project could begin this fall. That would mean the third rink would be available for hockey in the fall of 2016.\n\nThe third rink would have seating for about 2,000 people and standing room for another 300. There also would be a walking area, locker rooms and concessions.\n\nFundraising has been ongoing the past few years for the project. The cost is estimated at $11.2 million, with the park district paying about $2.75 million.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Minot Daily News, http://www.minotdailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Minot parks officials early next month will open bids for a proposed third sheet of ice in Maysa Arena.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/19/bids-to-be-opened-soon-for-expansion-of-maysa-aren/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Minot parks officials early next month will open bids for a proposed third sheet of ice in Maysa Arena.", "title": "Bids to be opened soon for expansion of Maysa Arena in Minot"}, "twitter": {"description": "Minot parks officials early next month will open bids for a proposed third sheet of ice in Maysa Arena.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Bids to be opened soon for expansion of Maysa Arena in Minot"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8bc8\"", "article_summary": "MINOT, N.D.
