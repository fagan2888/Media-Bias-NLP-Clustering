Both health systems operate medical centers outside of California, in mostly Western states.\n\n\u201cTogether, we can invest more in the needs of everyone we serve, especially the most vulnerable,\u201d said Dr. Rod Hochman, president and CEO, Providence Health & Services in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur commitment is to improve affordability, enhance clinical care and improve access to much-needed services,\u201d Hochman added.\n\n\u201cWe are two mission-focused organizations that have the potential of being better together, delivering outstanding clinical care and providing a compassionate presence in all the communities we serve,\u201d said Deborah Proctor, president and CEO, St. Joseph Health, also in a statement.\n\nBoth organizations say they share a common heritage. The Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange began in Northern California 103 years ago and branched out across the state toward Texas and New Mexico. Almost 160 years ago, the Sisters of Providence built a health care system in the Northwest, eventually growing to serve Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon and Washington.\n\nHealth system mergers have increased both state and nationwide in the past few years because of changes to the payment and delivery models introduced by the Affordable Care Act, those who watch the health care industry have said. If approved, this merger would create one of the largest Catholic health systems in the nation.\n\nBut at least one organization is calling on the attorney general to hold public hearings to review the proposed merger.\n\nThe California Nurses Association/National Nurses United said in a statement last week they want Harris to assure \u201cpatient protections and nurses\u2019 rights are not infringed,\u201d with the merger.\n\n\u201cWe are opposed to any and all mergers that don\u2019t guarantee our patients and the community we serve a higher standard of care,\u201d CNA Co-President Zenei Cortez said in the statement. \u201cThis merger must ensure that all the hospitals remain open, that all jobs and services are maintained and that the new organization is held accountable for providing charity care and community benefits to the communities it serves.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf approved, the new parent organization would be called Providence St. Joseph Health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two Catholic health systems with hospitals across Southern California are closer to creating a single organization that would stretch from Alaska to Texas.Providence Health & Services", "title": "Southern California hospitals with Catholic roots closer to merging", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/business/20151129/southern-california-hospitals-with-catholic-roots-closer-to-merging", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Southern California hospitals with Catholic roots closer to merging"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Two Catholic health systems with hospitals across Southern California are closer to creating a single organization that would stretch from Alaska to Texas.Providence Health & Services", "title": "Southern California hospitals with Catholic roots closer to merging", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/business/20151129/southern-california-hospitals-with-catholic-roots-closer-to-merging", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews.png?052016"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,merger,nuns,Providence Health and Services,Providence Holy Cross Medical Center,Providence Little Company of Mary,Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center,Providence Tarzana Medical Center,St. Joseph Health, Hospital and clinic services", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act,merger,nuns,Providence Health and Services,Providence Holy Cross Medical Center,Providence Little Company of Mary,Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center,Providence Tarzana Medical Center,St. Joseph Health, Hospital and clinic services"}, "article_summary": "Two Catholic health systems with hospitals across Southern California are closer to creating a single organization that would stretch from Alaska to Texas.\nIf approved, this merger would create one of the largest Catholic health systems in the nation.\nThe two health systems announced interest in merging in July.\nBoth health systems operate medical centers outside of California, in mostly Western states.\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange began in Northern California 103 years ago and branched out across the state toward Texas and New Mexico."}
