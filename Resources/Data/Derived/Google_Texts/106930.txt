Hy-Vee is working with Iowa State University to design new nutrition labels.

The new labels are needed to meet new requirements under the federal Affordable Care Act. It calls for more information about nutrition to be posted with products.

"You have to put in the nutrient profile of every ingredient, even if it is a carrot," said Rose Martin, a senior lecturer in food science and human nutrition.

Hy-Vee said it approached the College of Human Sciences in January for help in creating approximately 10,000 nutrition labels for the more than 235 stores. An effort expected to continue through January 2017.



You will eventually see the new labels in the Italian, Chinese and salad bar areas of the stores.

The new labels are already appearing in Hy-Vee convenience stores and will be in some grocery stores by later this month.

ISU students and interns at Hy-Vee are analyzing recipe nutritional content and standardizing Hy-Vee's recipe guidelines.
