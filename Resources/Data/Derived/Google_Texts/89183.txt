The largest solar energy project in New York City will be built on Staten Island’s Freshkills Parks, once the site of a major landfill, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Monday.

The project, scheduled to break ground in the second half of 2015, will increase the city’s renewable energy capacity by 50%, enough to fuel 2,000 private homes, according to the Bloomberg administration.

“It is only fitting that Freshkills, once a daily dumping ground, will become a showcase of urban renewal and sustainability,” Mr. Bloomberg said Monday.

The mayor said solar energy is becoming an increasingly realistic way for cities to sustainably strengthen their power grids, thanks in part to the decreasing cost of solar panels.

“I don’t think there’s any question,” he said. “Solar, actually, because of a dramatic reduction in the cost of panels, has become competitive without subsidies with other forms of energy.”

Between 30,000 to 35,000 solar panels will be installed on 47 acres at Freshkills Park. The land will then be leased to SunEdison Inc., a solar energy company that won the bid for the project.
