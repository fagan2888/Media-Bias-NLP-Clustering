You\u2019ll also need to provide verification if you re-enroll a spouse/partner who had previously been covered. If You Don\u2019t Enroll If you don\u2019t make changes during Open Enrollment, you\u2019ll receive the same coverage you had last year. It is important to remember that under the Affordable Care Act, if you waive your University coverage, you are still responsible for obtaining coverage through some other source. For example, you can obtain coverage through a spouse\u2019s or domestic partner\u2019s plan, your parent\u2019s plan (if you are under age 26) or via the Health Insurance Marketplace. Making Changes After Enrollment The choices you make during Benefits Open Enrollment will remain in effect through June 30, 2016, unless you experience a qualifying event. Qualifying events include the birth or adoption of a child, marriage or domestic partnership, divorce or separation, death of a dependent or change in your dependent\u2019s eligibility for benefits. Keep in mind that the IRS limits the types of changes you can make for qualifying events. If you experience a qualifying event, please contact the Penn Benefits Center within 30 days at 1-888-PENN-BEN (1-888-736-6236), Monday through Friday, between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. EST. When Are Changes Effective? Changes made during Open Enrollment will be effective as of July 1, 2015. New rates for all plans will be reflected in your July 2015 paycheck. Your pay must support your contributions for the benefits elected. If that is not the case, then your enrollment cannot be processed.
