(Not to mention the six-day creation story and the stuffing of all land animals on a single boat.)\n\nHow important could camels really be?\n\nFor those who believe the Bible to be fundamentally true, this is hardly going to change any minds. For those who believe it to be entirely false, this is surely not the most damning piece of evidence.\n\nWhat the camels in Genesis reveal, in fact, has nothing to do with the \u201ctruth\u201d of the biblical story at all.\n\nInstead, the presence of these camels in the story highlights, in a very clear way, the essential humanity of the biblical writers: like the best authors, they simply wrote about what they knew.\n\nThe patriarchs are depicted as nomadic, never settling for long in one place, but moving constantly from location to location throughout Israel (and beyond).\n\nAn ancient Israelite, wanting to tell the story of the wandering of his ethnic and national ancestors, would have naturally looked to the nomadic peoples around him as models. And indeed, throughout the Bible camels are commonly associated with those tribes who lived in the desert: Midianites, Ishmaelites, Amalekites, Kedemites.\n\nThe biblical authors simply transplanted the nomadic standards of their time into the distant past.\n\nThere is nothing deceptive about this. They weren\u2019t trying to trick anyone. They imagined, quite reasonably, that the past was, fundamentally, like their present.\n\nThey had no real alternative. In ancient Israel, in the period when the Bible was written (which ranges, conservatively, from the 10th to the third century BCE), no one had any way of knowing that camels had not always been domesticated pack animals. After all, we didn\u2019t know that for sure until this past week.\n\nWithout any evidence to the contrary, it is perfectly natural to assume that things have always been the way that they are now. Today we have more information about the past than any other moment in history. In ancient Israel, they had virtually none.\n\nAnd yet we still fall victim to this basic, very human, historical fallacy.\n\nIt has been suggested that this anachronism in the biblical text is akin to importing semitrailers into the medieval period. But this is a level of ridiculousness too far.\n\nI would suggest that it is more similar to describing a medieval Italian as enjoying pasta with tomato sauce. How many people, even today, know that tomatoes only came to Italy from South America in the 16th century?\n\nThe camels in Genesis may be \u201cwrong,\u201d but they are not a \u201cmistake.\u201d We all imagine the past to the best of our knowledge, the biblical authors included.\n\nThe lasting lesson of the camel controversy, such as it is, is a simple one: no writing, not even the Bible, is timeless or without context. Views of the past are contingent on both what we know and how we know it.\n\nThe Bible is a historical record, but it tells us just as much, if not more, about the people who wrote it as it does about the people they wrote about.\n\nSince the stories of the Bible remain so central to who we are as a culture, even today (and even for those who dismiss it), it seems entirely fitting that we should be equally interested in the ancient people who composed them.\n\nDespite their lack of historical knowledge \u2014 and, equally, because of it \u2014 they, more than the characters in the Bible, are our true cultural ancestors.\n\nJoel S.
