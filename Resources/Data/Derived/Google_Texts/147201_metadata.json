I think we can do a little better.\u201d\n\nTodd then pressed Sanders, \u201cSo it\u2019s fair to say, yeah, you want to replace Obamacare?\u201d\n\nSanders claimed, \u201cI want to move from. It\u2019s not my\u2013 the Republicans want to throw millions of people off their health insurance. I want to cover everybody.\u201d\n\nChuck Todd: Let\u2019s go to\u2013 now you pushed back hard on \u201cThe Wall Street Journal\u201d when they tallied up all your proposals. And it was mostly the Medicare For All proposal on that one. By the way, on Medicare For All, why should we interpret your call for Medicare For All as basically you\u2019re saying, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019d repeal and replace Obamacare too\u201d? You\u2019re calling for the repeal and replace of Obamacare with Medicare For All. Why is that not a unfair characterization? Bernie Sanders: My Republican friends want to throw millions of more people off of health insurance. And what I want to do is have the United States of America join the rest of the industrialized world, every other country in guaranteeing health care to all people. We spend far more per capita on health care as do the people of other countries. And yet, in many cases, they have better healthcare outcomes than we do. So what do I want to do? I want to build on the Obamacare, which I supported, as you know. But I do believe that when 29 million people still have zero health insurance, and when many more are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments, and when we pay much more per capita, and when we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, you know what, Chuck? I think we can do a little better. Chuck Todd: So it\u2019s fair to say, yeah, you want to replace Obamacare? Bernie Sanders: I want to move from. It\u2019s not my\u2013 the Republicans want to throw millions of people off their health insurance. I want to cover everybody.\n\nFollow Steve on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Steve Guest", "description": "Bernie Sanders said, \u201cI want to move from\u201d Obamacare Sunday on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Bernie Sanders said, \u201cI want to move from\u201d Obamacare Sunday on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d    Sanders told host Chuck Todd, \u201cI want to build on the Obamacare\u2026 But I do believe that when 29 million p", "title": "Sanders Can\u2019t Bring Himself To Say He Hates Obamacare: \u2018I Want To Move From\u2019 It", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/11/sanders-cant-bring-himself-to-say-he-hates-obamacare-i-want-to-move-from-it/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GettyImages-490442828-e1445034777685.jpg", "height": 515}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Under Obamacare '29 million people still have zero health insurance'", "title": "Sanders Can\u2019t Bring Himself To Say He Hates Obamacare: \u2018I Want To Move From\u2019 It Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/11/sanders-cant-bring-himself-to-say-he-hates-obamacare-i-want-to-move-from-it/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GettyImages-490442828-e1445034777685.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SteveGuest", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-11 13:01:58", "sailthru.title": "Sanders Can't Bring Himself To Say He Hates Obamacare: 'I Want To Move From' It", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "bernie-sanders,elections-2016,obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "bernie sanders,elections 2016,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Bernie Sanders said, \u201cI want to move from\u201d Obamacare Sunday on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d    Sanders told host Chuck Todd, \u201cI want to build on the Obamacare\u2026 But I do believe that when 29 million p", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GettyImages-490442828-e1445034777685.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6755\"", "article_summary": "Chuck Todd: So it\u2019s fair to say, yeah, you want to replace Obamacare?\nIt\u2019s not my\u2013 the Republicans want to throw millions of people off their health insurance.\nI\u2019d repeal and replace Obamacare too\u201d?\nBernie Sanders: My Republican friends want to throw millions of more people off of health insurance.\nYou\u2019re calling for the repeal and replace of Obamacare with Medicare For All."}
