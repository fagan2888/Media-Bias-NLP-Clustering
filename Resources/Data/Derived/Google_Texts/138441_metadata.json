The first hour was spent on work-related activities and recognition, and the next two hours were spent bowling.\n\nNebraska State Auditor Mike Foley was tipped off about the bowling trip, and said the employees immediately owned up to it after his office inquired. Foley said the employees are high paid, earning $34 to $115 an hour. A listing of the employees\u2019 titles and pay shows most of the contractors from Covendis were IT business systems analysts and the dozen folks were earning an average of $69 an hour. HHS is frequently the target of critical audits by the state auditor.\n\nPrior to working for the state, the HHS supervisor responsible for the bowling outing had worked in the private sector, where this kind of event is common, HHS said. He did make sure all transportation, food, drinks and bowling costs were paid for by the people attending and attendance was voluntary. No alcohol was consumed, HHS said.\n\nHowever, the HHS staffer told the employees and contractors they could count the outing as work time.\n\n\u201cThis is also common in the private sector but is unacceptable in the public sector,\u201d HHS said in a statement.\n\nThe HHS Information Systems and Technology administrator did not have prior knowledge of the event or approve it, HHS said. The administrator has spoken with the supervisor, who was unaware the event was not chargeable and is \u201cvery apologetic for his error in judgment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe administrator has informed the supervisor this is against state practice and is not to be repeated,\u201d HHS said.\n\nFoley said after inquiring about the outing, HHS vowed to make sure the money is restored and hours docked.\n\nThe contractors will be asked to change the hours to vacation or unpaid time, HHS said, and HHS is reviewing labor contract and personnel rules to determine how to deal with the hours for the two state employees. HHS spokeswoman Kathie Osterman said since the bowling outing just happened on Friday, nobody has been paid yet for that time period.\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
