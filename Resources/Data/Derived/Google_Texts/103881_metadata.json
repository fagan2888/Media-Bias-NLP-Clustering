The focus is on serving the community, not consolidation, Fojtasek said. This is about growth. Henry Ford would make investments related to care in Jackson. It would look for efficiencies in areas such as purchasing and information technology, Chief Operating Officer Bob Riney said.\n\nHow will patients be affected? \"We want to keep care local and expand ability to keep care local,\" Fojtasek said.\n\nWhy is this necessary?\n\nThere have been enormous changes in health care as the federal Affordable Care Act has been implemented. There are moves in the way services are funded and health care is delivered, and Allegiance will be better able to survive and weather these changes as part of a larger system, Fojtasek said. There are advantages to size. The systems can share resources. Throughout the United States, health systems are seeking affiliations and alignments with other health systems and physician groups to reduce the cost of care while advancing community health.\n\nHow is this different that Allegiance's failed plan to merge with the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor?\n\nThe reasons the merger did not come to fruition have never been made clear and Fojtasek would not discuss them on Tuesday. \"The discussions we've had going forward from that with other health systems, we were really focused on what our priorities were, community, community health, being able to keep care local and our commitment to our people.\" Those goals, Allegiance believes, can be met with this plan.\n\nWill Allegiance maintain its identity and brand?\n\nThat is to be determined.\n\nWas this a money-focused decision?\n\nIf it was, Fojtasek said, Allegaince would have selected the highest bidder. \"That is not what we looked at.\" It is true, Allegiance authorities have to be \"good business people,\" but they have to do that while being exceptional at care and investment in health.\n\nWhat about leadership?\n\nAllegiance will retain its leadership together with leaders from Henry Ford.\n\nWhat is in this for Henry Ford?\n\nRiney said Henry Ford believes it is in its strategic interest to diversify its portfolio and have greater influence in other parts of the state beyond southeastern Michigan, where they have a wide array of services, medical centers and hospitals.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Allegiance Health, Henry Ford, Henry Ford Health System, CEO Georgia Fojtasek, allegiance-henry-ford, news", "title": "What you need to know about Allegiance Health's intent to join Henry Ford Health System", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"What you need to know about Allegiance Health\\u0027s intent to join Henry Ford Health System\", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/2015/11/answers_to_questions_about_all.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/citizenpatriot/photo/2015/11/10/19162816-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17408921\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-11-11T14:15:27Z\", \"author\": \"Danielle Salisbury | Danielle_Salisbury@mlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@dt-river\",\"@jx-river\",\"@mlive-news. @mlive-river\",\"allegiance-henry-ford\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://imgick.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/citizenpatriot/photo/2015/11/10/19162816-large.jpg", "description": "Allegiance Health announced Tuesday it has signed a letter of intent to join Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@mlive"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, November 11, 2015, 10:23 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.mlive.com/citizenpatriot/photo/2015/11/10/19162816-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dquisenb\", \"author_nickname\": \"Danielle Salisbury | Danielle_Salisbury@mlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"2442\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jackson News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "Allegiance Health announced Tuesday it has signed a letter of intent to join Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System.", "title": "What you need to know about Allegiance Health's intent to join Henry Ford Health System", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/2015/11/answers_to_questions_about_all.html", "image": "http://imgick.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/citizenpatriot/photo/2015/11/10/19162816-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, November 11, 2015,  9:15 AM", "article_author": "Danielle Salisbury | Danielle_Salisbury@mlive.com", "Description": "Allegiance Health announced Tuesday it has signed a letter of intent to join Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System."}, "article_summary": "JACKSON, MI \u2013 Allegiance Health announced Tuesday it has signed a letter of intent to join Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System.\n\"We want to keep care local and expand ability to keep care local,\" Fojtasek said.\nThroughout the United States, health systems are seeking affiliations and alignments with other health systems and physician groups to reduce the cost of care while advancing community health.\nThere have been enormous changes in health care as the federal Affordable Care Act has been implemented.\nUnder the plan, Henry Ford would become Allegiance's parent organization."}
