They put part of the cost on credit cards and bought the drugs through an online pharmacy with lower prices. Their first two cycles were unsuccessful, so they took a break to pay off more than $40,000 in debt they had accumulated from the treatment, and began saving for a third cycle.\n\nMs. Martin became pregnant in May 2013, and the couple expect their child shortly.\n\nThey are living in a one-bedroom apartment, with the nursery in the dining room. She and her husband most likely would have tried again if the third cycle had not been successful, she said, but she advises others to think carefully about how much debt they take on in their quest for a baby. \u201cEven though we went through all the treatment to get our family,\u201d she said, \u201cat the end of the day you\u2019re right back with the rest of the world and have to provide for that family.\u201d\n\nThirty-five years after the first \u201ctest tube\u201d baby was born, in vitro fertilization is the most common assisted reproductive technology used to treat infertility. More than 61,000 babies were born as a result of I.V.F. and related techniques performed in 2011, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nYet just a small proportion of women who suffer from infertility use the procedure. Its cost remains daunting for many who need it to conceive, and despite the hopes of some, President Obama\u2019s health care law, the Affordable Care Act, will have little if any effect on the price tag.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI.V.F. involves the removal of eggs, which are fertilized with sperm in a lab and then transferred back to the woman\u2019s uterus. The overall cost of a single cycle using a woman\u2019s own eggs often ranges from $14,000 to $16,000, said G. David Adamson, a fertility specialist and a past president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. The basic cost of a cycle is typically $9,000 to $10,000, and drugs commonly add another $5,000; another option, the injection of sperm into an egg, adds another $1,000 to $2,000.\n\n\u201cCost is a problem,\u201d Dr. Adamson acknowledged \u2014 not because I.V.F. itself is necessarily more expensive than other highly technical medical procedures, he said, but because most insurance policies don\u2019t cover it. That means most couples must pay out of pocket. A woman may require more than one cycle to become pregnant, so the bill can quickly mushroom.\n\nBarbara Collura, president of Resolve, a consumer advocacy group, said concerns about financing treatment compounded the stress couples were already experiencing when confronting infertility. While you might save for several years to buy a house, waiting that long isn\u2019t always an option with I.V.F. because fertility decreases with age. Forty percent of I.V.F. cycles in women under 35 who use their own eggs result in live births, but that percentage drops to 12 percent for women aged 41 to 42, according to 2011 data from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d Ms. Collura said.\n\nSince long-term saving may be out, that leaves other options typically used for covering unplanned expenses, like dipping into savings, cutting back on other spending or borrowing the money \u2014 whether from relatives or by maxing out credit cards or taking out a home equity loan. Diverting funds temporarily from your 401(k) account may help raise your current cash flow for treatments, but that may ultimately mean you\u2019ll have to work longer before retiring.\n\nMost reproductive clinics now offer special financing packages, like discounts for multiple I.V.F. cycles paid upfront, or options to have part of the fee refunded if you don\u2019t become pregnant. But making sense of the options can be confusing.\n\nUnivfy, a company that sells I.V.F. prediction tests, has recently introduced a free online \u201cI.V.F. cost calculator\u201d that uses your probability of becoming pregnant to help you compare the cost of different financing options. (A woman\u2019s personal chances of having a baby using I.V.F. depend on a number of factors, including her age, diagnosis and levels of certain reproductive hormones.) The tool allows you to enter key details along with pricing offered by your clinic \u2014 or multiple clinics \u2014 and creates a chart so you can compare options. \u201cIt helps the patient be a more savvy health consumer,\u201d said Mylene Yao, Univfy\u2019s chief executive. (The site does not retain your personal information, she said.)\n\nDr. Adamson said that because so many variables affected an individual\u2019s prognosis, the tool was \u201cnot, by itself, sufficient to make that decision.\u201d He recommends that patients who use the tool print out their results and discuss them with their physician.\n\nHere are some additional questions to consider:\n\n\u25a0 How much money should I spend on I.V.F.?\n\nOften, Ms. Collura said, couples determine an amount they are willing or able to spend initially, and then pause treatment to reassess if they should continue. They may choose to pursue adoption if they can\u2019t conceive, so they may not want to spend all their funds on I.V.F. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal decision,\u201d she said. After their early 40s, few women can conceive using their own eggs so they may have to consider using donor eggs, which significantly increases the cost.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u25a0 Do some states require insurance coverage of infertility treatment?\n\nFifteen states have laws requiring some level of infertility coverage, but details vary widely; just eight require coverage of I.V.F., while some explicitly exclude it. (A list of the states and their respective laws is available on Resolve\u2019s website.)\n\nMs. Collura said Resolve was monitoring any potential impact the Affordable Care Act might have on existing state mandates.\n\n\u25a0 What if my insurance doesn\u2019t cover I.V.F.?\n\nParticularly if you work for a large employer, Dr. Adamson said, it\u2019s worth checking with your human resources department to see if an alternative health plan might offer better infertility coverage at a higher premium. Also, Resolve\u2019s website lists nonprofit groups that may offer financial assistance or grants.\n\nYet, just a small proportion of women who suffer from infertility use the procedure.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140128194046, "twitter": {"description": "Debt can pile up quickly for couples trying in-vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technologies.", "title": "Meeting the Cost of Conceiving", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/your-money/meeting-the-cost-of-conceiving.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002675453"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/29/your-money/29adviser/29adviser-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/your-money/meeting-the-cost-of-conceiving.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002675453", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/your-money/meeting-the-cost-of-conceiving.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "yourmoney", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/your-money/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 28, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "In Vitro Fertilization,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Personal Finances", "CN": "your-money", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Ann Carrns", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/29/your-money/29adviser/29adviser-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ANN CARRNS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Debt can pile up quickly for couples trying in-vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technologies.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/29/your-money/29adviser/29adviser-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Debt can pile up quickly for couples trying in-vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technologies.", "CG": "your-money", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 28, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/ann_carrns/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/your-money/index.html", "section": "Your Money", "modified": "2014-12-30", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/your-money/index.jsonp", "tag": "Personal Finances", "published": "2014-01-28", "section-taxonomy-id": "ED7B8594-44CE-4D37-A58B-1CDAA19774E4"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "29adviser", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141230021918, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/your-money/meeting-the-cost-of-conceiving.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/29/your-money/29adviser/29adviser-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Debt can pile up quickly for couples trying in-vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technologies.", "title": "Meeting the Cost of Conceiving"}, "pdate": 20140128, "des": "Personal Finances", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "feature", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/your-money", "tagline": "A column on anything and everything that hits you in the wallet.", "uri": "/column/your-money", "display-name": "Your Money", "identifier": "your-money", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000002675453, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Meeting the Cost of Conceiving", "col": "Your Money", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0589\"", "article_summary": "cost calculator\u201d that uses your probability of becoming pregnant to help you compare the cost of different financing options.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u25a0 Do some states require insurance coverage of infertility treatment?\nThey put part of the cost on credit cards and bought the drugs through an online pharmacy with lower prices.\nAfter their early 40s, few women can conceive using their own eggs so they may have to consider using donor eggs, which significantly increases the cost.\n(A woman\u2019s personal chances of having a baby using I.V.F."}
