In this photo, the descendants of Henrietta Lacks, and others, unveil a bust in honor of the donor of the immortal HeLa cells at the Morehouse School of Medicine. (AP)\n\nHenrietta Lacks has been dead since 1951 from the cancer that transformed medical research. She is about to transform research yet again.\n\nIn many ways Lacks is the guiding light in a rewriting of the Common Rule, the federal regulations governing research involving human subjects. In the works since 2011, the new regulations are anticipated in 2016 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, although the only deadline is the election of a new president.\n\nBut are authors of the new Common Rule following the wrong light \u2014 that is, giving too much weight to just one moral of the Henrietta Lacks story? Is devotion to consent and privacy devaluing equity among governing principles for research?\n\nThe answers will emerge from a necessary tension between protecting human subjects and society\u2019s craving for new and faster treatments and cures.\n\nthe Henrietta Lacks story is as much about justice as individual choice, and as much about trust as privacy.\n\nLacks never consented for her cancerous tissues to be shared widely among researchers. For decades, her own family was unaware of the so-called HeLa cells, their enduring value to medical science and the profound violation of their privacy. So it is right that her story, as told in Rebecca Skloot\u2019s 2010 book \u201cThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,\u201d will inform the new Common Rule. (Editor\u2019s note: See Rebecca Skloot\u2019s priorities for the new Common Rule here, how bioethicist Michelle Meyer disagrees here.)\n\nAbuses of vulnerable individuals and populations led to the field of bioethics itself, and to the original Common Rule in 1991. The regulations are being changed now to account for the vast and growing stores of genetic and other data, as well as blood, tissues and other human specimens crucial to discovery.\n\nBut another tragedy of the Lacks story concerns fairness. For a half-century, while the HeLa cells helped scientists improve understanding and treatment of numerous diseases \u2014 a profound gift to patients worldwide \u2014 the Lacks family couldn\u2019t afford and had little access to decent health care.\n\nAnd so the Henrietta Lacks story is as much about justice as individual choice, and as much about trust as privacy.\n\nMany Americans have little or no access to medical care at the resource-rich, often university-affiliated institutions where research flourishes, biospecimens are collected and new cures and treatments are developed.\n\nWill the new Common Rule correct this? Or will the attendant burdens of a revamped consent process, inordinately protecting individual choice, make specimen and data collection beyond the means of community health providers and further widen the health equity gap?\n\n\u201cHow might broad consent be implemented in a community health center that has no resources, that is just getting their electronic health records up, that\u2019s just now figuring out how they can do research in their center altogether?\u201d said Aaron Goldenberg, a specialist in research law and ethics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.\n\nGoldenberg\u2019s concern, repeatedly expressed by others at the recent \u201cSpecimenScience\u201d conference at Harvard Law School\u2019s Petrie-Flom Center, is that the clinics and community health centers where many under-served populations receive their care don\u2019t have the staff or infrastructure to take on the added demands of a broad consent process. Specimen collection will suffer. In this era of precision medicine and a cancer \u201cmoonshot,\u201d research specific to those communities will lag further behind more privileged populations served by hospitals with deeper pockets.\n\nAnd the new Common Rule will worsen one injustice in the attempt to address another.\n\n\u201cWe work with a couple community health centers,\u201d Goldenberg said, \u201cand they have no basis to do this any time soon. \u2026 This is going to be a national problem. The new regulations may make it harder for under-served populations to participate in research studies.\u201d\n\nAt the center of this quandary over how to get the Common Rule right are institutional review boards (IRBs), which are responsible for protecting humans in research but can frustrate researchers with inconsistency and lack of accountability.\n\nWith real transparency and respect for equity, it\u2019s possible the new Common Rule could align with the common good and make justice part of the Henrietta Lacks legacy.\n\nFor patient protection, some would rely instead on the courts and professional self-regulation. Others argue for an opt-out system for research participants that assumes altruism among patients. More likely: IRBs fewer in number but greater in reach, and a new process for broad consent that only resource-rich institutions can afford.\n\nPolicy-makers face a daunting task: expedite development of new cures and treatments while staying vigilant against research abuses of human subjects. Addressing systemic inequity only adds to this challenge.\n\nThe public comment period meant to inform the new Common Rule, extended once, closed in early January. The new Common Rule is expected later in 2016.\n\n\u201cMy prediction,\u201d Jeffrey Botkin, pediatrician/ethicist at the University of Utah, wrote in the Hastings Center Report, \u201cis that this consent process will become perfunctory \u2014 another form to sign during admission \u2014 and fall far short of our goal of respect for persons: add a large, complex, and expensive burden to institutions; and create new barriers to the conduct of research.\u201d\n\nWith real transparency and respect for equity, it\u2019s possible the new Common Rule could align with the common good and make justice part of the Henrietta Lacks legacy. That would be a worthwhile transformation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is devotion to consent and privacy devaluing equity among governing principles for medical research?", "og": {"site_name": "cognoscenti", "description": "Is devotion to consent and privacy devaluing equity among governing principles for medical research?", "title": "Henrietta Lacks, And The 'Immortal' Tension Between The New Common Rule And The Common Good", "url": "http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2016/01/20/tissue-research-paul-c-mclean", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/16/files/2016/01/0108_henrietta_lacks_cog-592x324.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2016/01/20/tissue-research-paul-c-mclean", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/16/files/2016/01/0108_henrietta_lacks_cog-592x324.jpg", "site": "@cogwbur", "card": "summary", "title": "Immortal Tension: Henrietta Lacks, And The Rift Between The New Common Rule And The Common Good"}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-20", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "article_summary": "So it is right that her story, as told in Rebecca Skloot\u2019s 2010 book \u201cThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,\u201d will inform the new Common Rule.\nBut are authors of the new Common Rule following the wrong light \u2014 that is, giving too much weight to just one moral of the Henrietta Lacks story?\nthe Henrietta Lacks story is as much about justice as individual choice, and as much about trust as privacy.\nWith real transparency and respect for equity, it\u2019s possible the new Common Rule could align with the common good and make justice part of the Henrietta Lacks legacy.\nAbuses of vulnerable individuals and populations led to the field of bioethics itself, and to the original Common Rule in 1991."}
