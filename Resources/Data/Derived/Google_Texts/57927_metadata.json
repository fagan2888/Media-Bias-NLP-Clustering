Supercom\u2019s CEO, Arie Trabelsi, says the acquisition will help his company by bringing in new technology, security experts and customers, strengthening SuperCom\u2019s cyber and data protection capabilities, particularly with its government clients, Internet-of-things business and secure payments services. Both companies are based in Israel\u2014SuperCom in Herzliya and Safend in Tel Aviv.\n\nSafend, founded in 2003, has more than 3,000 customers in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and more than 3 million software licenses sold to clients, including government agencies and businesses. As part of SuperCom, Safend will continue to provide support, services and upgrades for its data protection brands.\n\nSuperCom\u2019s businesses include digital ID solutions for governments and organizations, secure mobile payments and radio-frequency ID, tagging and tracking solutions, including monitoring devices for livestock and parolees. Wave Systems acquired Safend in 2011 for $12.8 million. According to SuperCom, Safend's average annual revenue in recent years was about $5 million.\n\nCybersecurity has been a ripe sector for middle-market M&A. In January, cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc.
