It marks the latest in a series of legal challenges \u2014 and a win for GOP House members. Administration officials said they are confident the ruling will be overturned on appeal.\n\nIn Florida, 15 companies also asked for an average 9.6 percent increase for small group plans, said Amy Bogner, spokeswoman for the state\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation.\n\nThe companies were not identified individually because they claimed trade secrecy, she said.\n\nFlorida Blue, also known as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, appeared to request increases ranging from 5.22 percent to 11.6 percent in rates for four plans posted on HealthCare.gov and spotted by The Palm Beach Post shortly before they were taken down.\n\n+ The HealthCare.gov website, where people can buy health insurance, is displayed on a laptop screen in Washington. A federal judge has ... read more \u00d7\n\nCompany officials said the rates were not supposed to be posted and did not represent \u201cthe correct, final rates for Florida Blue.\u201d\n\nIn August, Florida regulators said they approved a 9.5 percent average increase for health insurers in 2016, down from 13 percent a year earlier. The approved rates applied to 19 companies on and off Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nAt the time, federal officials hailed it as progress.\n\n\u201cFlorida\u2019s proposed rates for the 2016 plan year demonstrate that the Affordable Care Act is working to spur competition and transparency in the marketplaces, keeping premium increases to single digits and leading to affordable new choices for consumers,\u201d Ben Wakana, press secretary for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said then.\n\nU.S. officials said last week that Floridians really pay an average of $84 a month after tax credits for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans. That\u2019s up only 2 percent from $82 last year.\n\nAdministration critics, however, say the system obscures big rate increases from insurers that others must cover.\n\n\u201cPremiums continue to skyrocket and are only being masked by higher costs on other consumers and taxpayers,\u201d said Andres Malave, Florida communications director for the Obamacare-opposing group Americans for Prosperity.\n\nRequested rates are not necessarily the increases that will be approved by regulators in coming months, though the numbers released Thursday point to industry aspirations above single digits for individual plans.\n\nThursday\u2019s ruling from U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer will be put on hold while it is appealed, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAt stake is $175 billion the government is paying to reimburse health insurers over a decade to reduce deductibles and co-payments for people with lower incomes. House Speaker Paul Ryan said \u201cthe administration overreached by spending taxpayer money without approval from the people\u2019s representatives.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said: \u201cThey have been losing this fight for six years. And they\u2019ll lose it again.\u201d\n\nAbout 12.7 million people are covered through insurance markets created by the federal health law.\n\nMost Floridians still get coverage from employer plans or government programs such as Medicare, but approximately 1. 7 million state residents selected Obamacare marketplace plans in 2016.\n\nOf those, about 91 percent got tax credits to make premiums less expensive.\n\nFor them, the average monthly premium was $386 before credits, and $84 after, according to federal officials.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fifteen health insurers want an average 17.", "author": "By Charles Elmore - Palm Beach Post Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/obamacare-fla-insurers-seek-average-177-hike-amid-/nrMC3/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2016/05/12/ca/75/obamacare.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Fifteen health insurers want an average 17.", "title": "Fla insurers seek average 17.7% Obamacare hike amid court ruling"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2016/05/12/ca/75/obamacare.jpg", "description": "Fifteen health insurers want an average 17.7 percent increase in premiums for Affordable Care Act individual plans, Florida officials said Thursday \u2014 higher than last year\u2019s approved average of less than 10 percent.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare: Fla. insurers seek average 17.7% hike amid court ruling"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "mypbp", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/obamacare-fla-insurers-seek-average-177-hike-amid-/nrMC3/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3342304/news/news/obamacare-fla-insurers-seek-average-177-hike-amid-/nrMC3/", "keywords": "allpbc,health care,mobile breaking business,mytopless,newsfeed", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And they\u2019ll lose it again.\u201dAbout 12.7 million people are covered through insurance markets created by the federal health law.\nFifteen health insurers want an average 17.7 percent increase in premiums for Affordable Care Act individual plans, Florida officials said Thursday \u2014 higher than last year\u2019s approved average of less than 10 percent.\nFor them, the average monthly premium was $386 before credits, and $84 after, according to federal officials.\nAt stake is $175 billion the government is paying to reimburse health insurers over a decade to reduce deductibles and co-payments for people with lower incomes.\nAt the time, federal officials hailed it as progress."}
