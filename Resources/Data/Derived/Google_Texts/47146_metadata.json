Andrew Cuomo\u2019s candidate for lieutenant governor, straining to show voters and the press that Ms. Hochul belongs to the same brand of progressivism that is now ascendant in the city.\n\n\u201cKathy has been claimed to be an underdog many, many times, something I can personally relate to,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cShe\u2019s been in a lot of tough political circumstances. She\u2019s taken on a lot of tough fights. She\u2019s not ever been afraid to challenge powerful forces.\u201d\n\nMr. de Blasio praised the \u201ccourage\u201d and \u201cdamn the torpedoes\u201d verve she showed during her one term of Congress representing a heavily Republican district, pointing to how she supported Obamacare and opposed the rising Tea Party. \u201cIn her campaign, she campaigned overtly and openly against the Tea Party, against the Paul Ryan budget. That was not necessarily popular with everyone in her district. That was something that was gonna draw a lot of fire.\u201d\n\nMs. Hochul fell to a Republican in 2012 and Democratic surrogates have used her defeat as a piece of her campaign pitch, depicting her as an unwavering liberal who paid the price for her honesty. \u201cShe did pay the price electorally but I think something we all know is that we don\u2019t come here to win elections if the price of winning the election is giving away our values and our soul,\u201d the mayor declared.\n\nThe press conference, drawing a throng of reporters the week before the Democratic primary, comes as the editorial boards of publications like the New York Times and New York Observer, along with several labor unions, buck Ms. Hochul in favor of Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu, a law professor running on a ticket with Zephyr Teachout, has a greater chance of defeating Ms. Hochul\u2013who must run on her own apart from Mr. Cuomo\u2013than Ms. Teachout does of knocking off Mr. Cuomo, an incumbent with a war chest north of $30 million.\n\nThough Ms. Hochul carries a significant fund-raising advantage over Mr. Wu, state Democrats are worried that the law professor\u2013well-known in certain tech and collegiate circles\u2013can pull off an upset. Mr. Cuomo has avoided the campaign trail while Ms. Hochul has campaigned furiously, stumping with Democratic elected officials\u2013and even Mr. de Blasio\u2019s wife\u2014 in New York City where voters do not know her.\n\nShe and her allies wanted voters to know that the National Rife Association-approved lawmaker who once opposed drivers licences for undocumented immigrants is now palatable to New York\u2019s progressives.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need anymore gridlock. I\u2019ve seen gridlock, I\u2019ve seen gridlock on steroids in Washington D.C. We don\u2019t need that in the State of New York\u2013we need people working together, our lieutenant governor, our governor, our speaker and our mayor who know how to get the job done,\u201d Ms. Hochul said.\n\n\u201cTogether we can lead the way \u2026 out of poverty for millions of people by simply raising the minimum wage,\u201d she continued, also underscoring her support for the Dream Act and the Women\u2019s Equality Act as proof that she is in line with the likes of Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Mark-Viverito.\n\nStill, she defended her record on guns in Buffalo, arguing she could support the needs of hunters in her own district with tamping down gun violence in urban areas. And she would not commit to repudiating the position she took on drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants last decade.\n\nMr. Wu\u2019s name was only mentioned once throughout the event.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Tim Wu at all to be honest with you,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cBut I know Kathy Hochul.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Ross Barkan", "sailthru.author": "Ross Barkan", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": "http://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/dscn1558.jpg?w=240", "site": "@observer", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.tags": "Andrew Cuomo, Bill De Blasio, kathy hochul, obsPolitics", "keywords": "bill de blasio, kathy hochul, governors race, tim wu, city hall, melissa mark-viverito", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "bill de blasio, kathy hochul, governors race, tim wu, city hall, melissa mark-viverito", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Bill de Blasio Urges Liberals to Support \u2018Courageous\u2019 Kathy Hochul", "sailthru.byline_email": "rbarkan@observer.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "ross", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio backed Kathy Hochul for lieutenant governor on the steps of City Hall this afternoon.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ross-barkan-headshot-e1402611381985.jpg?quality=80&w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "@rossbarkan", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2014-09-03T18:21:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-03T18:21:25+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/ross"}, "sailthru.description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio backed Kathy Hochul for lieutenant governor on the steps of City Hall this afternoon.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio backed Kathy Hochul for lieutenant governor on the steps of City Hall this afternoon.", "title": "Bill de Blasio Urges Liberals to Support \u2018Courageous\u2019 Kathy Hochul", "url": "http://observer.com/2014/09/bill-de-blasio-urges-liberals-to-support-courageous-kathy-hochul/", "image": "http://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/dscn1558.jpg?w=635", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Ross Barkan is a national political reporter for The New York Observer.
