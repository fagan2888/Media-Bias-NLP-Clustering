And even with the slim pickings available, one of the ones I rarely seem to wind up watching is State of the Union on CNN with Candy Crowley. Generally it\u2019s only on my television if I\u2019m watching CNN for the overnight highlights and am too busy or lazy to change the channel at 9 o\u2019clock. But that\u2019s what happened today and I\u2019m rather glad I did. The subject at hand was the never ending War on Wimminz being perpetrated by the evil Republican Party, but the guest was Carly Fiorina, former CEO of HP.\n\nMost of this should be common sense for the majority of you, but I\u2019ve rarely seen anyone deconstruct nonsense so quickly and efficiently. Transcript follows the video, courtesy of Tim Cavanaugh at The Corner.\n\n\u201cA lot of women, me included, are sick of the \u2018war on women,\u2019\u201d the former Hewlett-Packard CEO and California Republican candidate for U.S. Senate. \u201cAnd we saw it in spades on Monday after the Hobby Lobby case. The women of Hobby Lobby had access to contraception through their company insurance plan before Obamacare; they have access to contraception \u2014 16 forms of it \u2014 after the ruling. But somehow, you know, this is the long arm of business and the Republican Party reaching into the body of women. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Fiorina then pulled out a fortune she said she\u2019d received recently in a fortune cookie. \u201c\u2018Strong and bitter words indicate a weak cause,\u2019\u201d Fiorina read. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly right. The War On Women is shameless, baseless propaganda. There\u2019s no fact to it. But it\u2019s worked because it\u2019s scared women to death. Enough.\u201d\n\nI particularly liked the fortune cookie schtick. It fit in well with the signal to noise ratio of the discussion and certainly made for at least as reliable a source as Fiorina\u2019s liberal debate partners. Enjoy.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Fortune Cookie 500", "title": "Video: Carly Fiorina ends the War on Women", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/07/06/video-carly-fiorina-ends-the-war-on-women/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-06T21:01:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-06T20:02:52+00:00"}, "keywords": "Candy Crowley, Carly Fiorina, CNN,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda8b4\"", "article_summary": "The subject at hand was the never ending War on Wimminz being perpetrated by the evil Republican Party, but the guest was Carly Fiorina, former CEO of HP.\nBut somehow, you know, this is the long arm of business and the Republican Party reaching into the body of women.\n\u201cA lot of women, me included, are sick of the \u2018war on women,\u2019\u201d the former Hewlett-Packard CEO and California Republican candidate for U.S. Senate.\nVideo: Carly Fiorina ends the War on Womenposted at 5:01 pm on July 6, 2014 by Jazz ShawWhen it comes to the Sunday morning talking heads festivals, I tend to jump around a bit these days.\nThe War On Women is shameless, baseless propaganda."}
