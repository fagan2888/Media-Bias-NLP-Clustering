I suppose it\u2019s tough when those are a lot of the questions you\u2019re fielding as the law you aggressively helped pass is unfolding (and your minimum-wage and war-on-women memes can only do so much to distract from it), but as Larry Sabato put it this afternoon, it\u2019s easy for Nancy Pelosi to embrace President Obama\u2019s crowning legislative achievement and go on the offense considering that she\u2019s from a deep-blue district. Some of her fellow Democrats probably aren\u2019t so appreciative of the strategy.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nLook, Nancy Pelosi is from a deep-blue district. I have no doubt in her district, in the San Francisco area, you can be for ObamaCare and not have any electoral problems. The difficulty for Pelosi and the Democrats is, in every single reliable survey for a year, a plurality or majority of Americans have been opposed for a variety of reasons.

The problem with that is, when you are on the offense, using your time in the public arena to discuss a subject people have more or less made up their minds about, and they don\u2019t like it, you\u2019re wasting your time in the arena. Second point, Neil, which I think is even more important for the midterm elections: The people who favor ObamaCare, which is a minority, aren\u2019t really that enthusiastic about it even if they favor it. But the majority who oppose ObamaCare are much more charged up, and they\u2019re the people who tend to turn up in a low-turnout midterm election.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cThe people who favor ObamaCare, which is a minority, aren\u2019t really that enthusiastic about it even if they favor it.\u201d", "title": "Sabato: Pelosi might want to rethink that whole \u201cembrace ObamaCare\u201d thing", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/20/sabato-pelosi-might-want-to-rethink-that-whole-embrace-obamacare-thing/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-21T00:51:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-21T00:51:41+00:00"}, "keywords": "Democrats, larry sabato, midterms, Nancy Pelosi, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Sabato: Pelosi might want to rethink that whole \u201cembrace ObamaCare\u201d thingposted at 8:51 pm on March 20, 2014 by Erika JohnsenOr at least lay off it a little bit.\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.comLook, Nancy Pelosi is from a deep-blue district.\nBut the majority who oppose ObamaCare are much more charged up, and they\u2019re the people who tend to turn up in a low-turnout midterm election.\nI have no doubt in her district, in the San Francisco area, you can be for ObamaCare and not have any electoral problems.\nThe difficulty for Pelosi and the Democrats is, in every single reliable survey for a year, a plurality or majority of Americans have been opposed for a variety of reasons."}
