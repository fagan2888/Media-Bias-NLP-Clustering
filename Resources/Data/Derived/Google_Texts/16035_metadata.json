But tea party leaders, both nationally and in Florida, tell The Daily Caller that Bush would have trouble getting their support because of his strong backing of Common Core.\n\nThe Common Core State Standards Initiative defines itself as \u201ca state-led effort that established a single set of clear educational standards for kindergarten through 12th grade in English language arts and mathematics that states voluntarily adopt,\u201d according to its website. So far, 45 states and the District of Columbia have adopted Common Core\u2019s standards in full, while Minnesota has adopted its English language arts standards.\n\nConservative critics of Common Core, however, fear it will become a federal takeover of education, complete with a national curriculum. While the National Governors Association was the driving force behind developing the Common Core standards, President Barack Obama\u2019s Department of Education has since become a major advocate.\n\nLaurie Newsom, president of Gainesville Tea Party, told TheDC that Bush\u2019s support for Common Core \u201cwill be impossible for him to overcome\u201d if he runs for president.\n\n\u201c[H]e enthusiastically supports the federal educational platform Common Core which seriously taints his political platform,\u201d she said.\n\nKeith Wilson, head of Deland, Florida\u2019s 912 tea party group, echoed Newsom\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cWe have done extensive research into Common Core and Jeb Bush has been and still is too involved in it,\u201d he said. \u201cJeb has been great other than that. It will be as big a failure as Obamacare and Jeb will be blamed for it in Florida by our local groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis Common Core involvement is going to be a total deal breaker for most in Volusia County,\u201d he added.\n\nRandy McLendon, founder of the Englewood, Florida tea party group Taking Our Country Back, voiced a similar concern.\n\n\u201cThe main criticism at this point is his very vocal support of Common Core and his harsh words of criticism for its opponents,\u201d McLendon explained, while noting Bush was \u201cwell liked as a [g]overnor.\u201d\n\nNational tea party groups also point to Bush\u2019s support for Common Core as problematic.\n\n\u201cIn the years after his governorship, Jeb has supported greater government control of school curriculum, rather than allow parents to make the best choice for their children,\u201d Tea Party Patriots head Jenny Beth Martin told TheDC, explaining why she believes tea partiers couldn\u2019t support a Bush campaign for president.\n\n\u201cOn Common Core, which is an issue that many tea party folks really care about, he is not only on the wrong side, but he is leading the charge in the wrong direction,\u201d Mark Meckler, president of Citizens for Self-Governance, said. \u201cThe Common Core issue will probably be a deal killer for the tea party at large.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jamie Weinstein", "description": "If Jeb Bush runs for the Republican presidential nomination, he may face pushback from the tea party -- and not just for the reasons you might expect.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "If Jeb Bush runs for the Republican presidential nomination, he may face pushback from the tea party -- and not just for the reasons you might expect.
