But I do think it\u2019s important for Congress to understand what the plan is, to have buy in, to debate it.\u201d\n\nDeparting from his usual insistence that Washington \u2014 and Congress in particular \u2014 isn\u2019t working, Obama admitted that he has been \u201cconsulting with Congress throughout\u201d to understand and make decisions about the terrorist presence in Iraq and Syria.\n\nObama also made clear that he is not considering \u201csending in 100,000 American troops\u201d to the Middle East.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "In an exclusive interview with Chuck Todd on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday, President Obama admitted that ISIS is not in fact, as he intimated in an interview with the New Yorker in January, a JV team.", "title": "President Obama admits that ISIS is not a JV team - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/09/obama-chuck-todd-600x359.jpg", "height": 359}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/09/07/president-obama-admits-isis-jv-team/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "obama-meet-the-press", "published_time": "2014-09-07T11:34:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-07T11:34:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbeef\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWell, they\u2019re not a JV team,\u201d said Obama.\nIn an exclusive interview with Chuck Todd on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday, President Obama admitted that ISIS is not in fact, as he intimated in an interview with the New Yorker in January, a JV team.\n\u201cThe analogy we use here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn\u2019t make them Kobe Bryant,\u201d Obama had told the magazine.\nWhen Todd asked if that description was evidence of \u201cbad intelligence or [Obama\u2019s] misjudgment,\u201d the president said that he wasn\u2019t \u201cspecifically\u201d talking about ISIS.\nObama also made clear that he is not considering \u201csending in 100,000 American troops\u201d to the Middle East."}
