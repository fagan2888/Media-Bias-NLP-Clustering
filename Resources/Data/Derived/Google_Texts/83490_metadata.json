Gov. Jennifer Carroll. Carroll\u2019s resignation followed the state\u2019s investigation into an Internet gambling ring that posed as a veterans' charity. Carroll had worked to promote Allied Veterans of the World, though she was never charged with a crime.\n\nSascha Cordner and Jessica Palombo took home the first-place award for Best Continuing Coverage for their series of stories on the ongoing investigation into a now-closed state-run North Florida reform school. The \u201cWhite House Boys\u201d have claimed for years that boys who attended the Dozier School were abused and killed. The University of South Florida later won permission to explore Dozier and found hundreds of unmarked graves on the property. Cordner has been following the story for years and continues to do so as families search for loved ones who never returned from the school.\n\nAnd Lynn Hatter took home the state\u2019s Best Investigative Reporting prize for her NPR story \u201cAdding To Insurance Confusion, Outside Groups Try To Cash In.\u201d It all started when she attended a Tallahassee meeting put on by the \u201cObamacare Enrollment Team.\u201d Through public records requests she determined the group represented a private insurance agency trying to sell plans that did not comply with the Affordable Care Act. She also uncovered complaints filed against the company in Florida and Illinois. After this story aired, the state of Florida began investigating the Fiorella Insurance Agency. The company has since removed all references to \u201cObamacare\u201d from its advertising materials and website.\n\nFinally, WFSU News intern Nick Evans was the finalist for Best Use of Sound among the state\u2019s college students. His story, \u201cNew Cultivation Technique Offers Hope For Florida Oyster Industry,\u201d followed one fishing family as they struggle through the oyster crisis in Apalachicola Bay.", "article_metadata": {"category": "WFSU Program Feed", "description": "The Florida Associated Press Broadcasters have awarded WFSU News four statewide radio reporting awards.
