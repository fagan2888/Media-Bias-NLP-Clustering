(AP) - Virginia Tech police officer Larry Wooddell has collected more than a few stories over the past eight years, as he\u2019s carried the leash for one of the region\u2019s most recognizable bomb-sniffing dogs around.\n\nHe talks about leading Boomer - a 9-year-old yellow labrador retriever - through Lane Stadium before every football game, and the time the duo found a handgun that had been lost in the woods for eight months.\n\nBoomer has sniffed out stages for President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney. They\u2019ve worked NASCAR races in Bristol, Tennessee, and bomb threats in Floyd County.\n\nThe duo has clocked in for every shift together for nearly a decade, and now they\u2019re planning to retire together at the beginning of April.\n\nWooddell has spent 30 years in law enforcement. Boomer has worked for eight - or 56 if you\u2019re counting in dog years.\n\nLike any other patrol team, the pair has the kind of rapport where they seem to know what the other is thinking.\n\nWooddell said he knows when Boomer is about to go to the bathroom and which kind of toy will really get him excited. When Boomer interrupts one of Wooddell\u2019s favorite stories from their early days in uniform, the handler snaps his finger and points to the ground. Boomer - like always - lies down to oblige.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d Wooddell said. \u201cWe certify as a team; train as a team; do everything as a team.\u201d\n\nWooddell says the pair started bonding on their very first call together.\n\nIt was a drug-related shooting where a suspect ran off into the woods. Wooddell and Boomer had just returned from their training in Richmond, and the pair happened to be standing by when the call came in.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d Wooddell said. \u201cI cut him off leash and just let him go.\u201d\n\nWooddell remembers struggling to keep up as Boomer weaved his way up a sharp embankment, found the spot where the suspect had buried a weapon and sat down - the dog\u2019s sign for when he finds something.\n\n\u201cThat was the most interesting because it was his very first call,\u201d Wooddell said. \u201cWe got what we call in the K-9 world \u2018street cred.\u2019 They said, \u2018Hey, he found that thing. Let\u2019s call Boomer.\u2019 Giles County started calling, State Police.\u201d\n\nWooddell said Boomer is trained to sniff out \u201canything that goes boom.\u201d\n\nThe dog can identify 25 different chemical compounds, which are used in thousands of different types of explosives.\n\nWhenever the Federal Bureau of Investigations identifies a new compound being used in bombs, it brings a sample over for Boomer to learn.\n\n\u201cNot only is Boomer the best explosives-detection K-9 in the New River Valley, but he and Larry have been excellent ambassadors for the Virginia Tech Police Department,\u201d Police Chief Kevin Foust said.\n\nVirginia Tech has a total of three dogs: two that find explosives and a third for narcotics.\n\nAccording to Maj. Mac Babb, the department plans to train another K-9 and handler team after Boomer and Wooddell\u2019s last day.\n\nBy then, Wooddell said Boomer will be getting his first taste of nonworking life.\n\nRight now, he said Boomer isn\u2019t allowed to go to the park or play with other dogs when he\u2019s off duty. That\u2019s because he\u2019s an officer - not a pet.\n\nBut after his retirement in April, Boomer will live on Wooddell\u2019s five-acre property and get to live a typical dog\u2019s life complete with car rides and walks on the greenway, Wooddell said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great moment when someone gets to the end of their career and gets to step away,\u201d Babb said. \u201cBut at the time, you\u2019ve very aware of how much people will miss them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Roanoke Times, http://www.roanoke.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Virginia Tech police officer Larry Wooddell has collected more than a few stories over the past eight years, as he's carried the leash for one of the region's most recognizable bomb-sniffing dogs around.", "Author": "JACOB DEMMITT", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Virginia Tech police officer Larry Wooddell has collected more than a few stories over the past eight years, as he\u2019s carried the leash for one of the region\u2019s most recognizable bomb-sniffing dogs around.", "title": "Virginia Tech police officer, K9 to retire together", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/20/virginia-tech-police-officer-k9-to-retire-together/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/18/exchange_police_dog_partnership.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/18/exchange_police_dog_partnership.jpeg", "title": "Virginia Tech police officer, K9 to retire together", "description": "Virginia Tech police officer Larry Wooddell has collected more than a few stories over the past eight years, as he's carried the leash for one of the region's most recognizable bomb-sniffing dogs arou", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "According to Maj.
