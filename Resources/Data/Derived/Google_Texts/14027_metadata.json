The perennial deficits at H+H aren\u2019t just unsustainable, they\u2019re a ticking fiscal bomb threatening to blow a massive hole in the administration\u2019s agenda, swallowing billions of dollars that would be better spent on schools, transportation, job creation, affordable housing and the like.\n\nWe need firm, forceful and politically unpopular action to stem the losses at H+H, and that starts with straight talk from both sides of City Hall about just how dire the situation has become.\n\nDE BLASIO'S $82B BUDGET TO ADD MANY NEW INITIATIVES\n\nThe origins of the crisis are complex, but come back to a few simple truths. Health care is evolving away from a focus on hospital-based emergency care toward preventive care and getting patients home as soon as possible.\n\nInsurance companies and the medical professions have realigned financial incentives away from blindly paying for tests and procedures (whether needed or not) and toward actually keeping patients healthy.\n\nThe result is that hospitals are shrinking in size and don\u2019t need so many of wards full of recuperating patients, and they are competing with smaller, leaner clinics and health care organizations.\n\nTo make things even tougher for Health + Hospitals, New York has a staggering 375,000 undocumented non-citizens who lack health insurance, according to the Mayor\u2019s Task Force on Immigrant Health Care Access. Under the federal Affordable Care Act, they are specifically barred from getting government-subsidized private health insurance \u2014 so they end up using public hospital facilities for even routine health needs, putting more strain on the system.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re our fellow New Yorkers. We believe in supporting them,\u201d de Blasio said at his budget briefing of the undocumented who don\u2019t have insurance. That\u2019s in keeping with the liberal New York assumption that any and all city services, no matter the cost, should be provided to undocumented immigrants.\n\nA 2014 report by the Citizens Budget Commission flagged the problem with h-aving so many people use hospitals for normal health needs, noting that nearly a quarter of admissions to H+H facilities are \u201cpreventable\u201d \u2014 not medically necessary.\n\nIt\u2019s an expensive proposition. Another budget-buster is the administration\u2019s position, announced in its new report on H+H, that \u201cunlike what has happened in other cities, Health & Hospitals will remain a vibrant public system \u2014 it is not for sale and the city will not abandon it.\u201d\n\nThat translates into a half-hearted effort to streamline. De Blasio has promised that no hospitals will be closed and no personnel will be laid off (although some jobs will be left vacant by attrition). One wonders when and how any real savings will ever happen if the administration refuses to bit the bullet on major expenses.\n\nWhat we need is a new conversation about the true cost of public health care in New York \u2014 one that acknowledges that spending billions on health care means less money for summer youth jobs, subsides for affordable housing, adult literacy programs and other important needs.\n\nGiven what $2 billion could do to shrink classroom sizes or expand afterschool recreation and senior citizen programs, it\u2019s time to talk about doing radical surgery on our hospital system, and soon.\n\nLouis is political anchor at NY1 News.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Errol Louis", "twitter": {"description": "New York can no longer afford our expensive habit of ignoring or deferring the fiscal crisis brewing at Health + Hospitals.", "title": "Errol Louis: What price rescue for public hospitals?", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/errol-louis-price-rescue-public-hospitals-article-1.2622198", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2622197.1462229124!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/louis3e-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "new york hospitals, new york healthcare, nyc budget, de blasio hospitals,", "parsely-author": "Errol Louis", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "new york hospitals, new york healthcare, nyc budget, de blasio hospitals,", "nydn_tags": "nyc budget, bill de blasio", "news_keywords": "new york hospitals, new york healthcare, nyc budget, de blasio hospitals,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/errol-louis-price-rescue-public-hospitals-article-1.2622198", "parsely-title": "Errol Louis: What price rescue for public hospitals?", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-03T05:00:00-0400", "sailthru.title": "Errol Louis: What price rescue for public hospitals?", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-05-03T09:00:00", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2622197.1462229124!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/louis3e-1-web.jpg", "description": "New York can no longer afford our expensive habit of ignoring or deferring the fiscal crisis brewing at Health + Hospitals.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "New York can no longer afford our expensive habit of ignoring or deferring the fiscal crisis brewing at Health + Hospitals.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "New York can no longer afford our expensive habit of ignoring or deferring the fiscal crisis brewing at Health + Hospitals.", "title": "Errol Louis: What price rescue for public hospitals?", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/errol-louis-price-rescue-public-hospitals-article-1.2622198", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2622197.1462229124!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/louis3e-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "nyc budget, bill de blasio", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2622197.1462229124!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/louis3e-1-web.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Errol Louis", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "Health care is evolving away from a focus on hospital-based emergency care toward preventive care and getting patients home as soon as possible.\nTo make things even tougher for Health + Hospitals, New York has a staggering 375,000 undocumented non-citizens who lack health insurance, according to the Mayor\u2019s Task Force on Immigrant Health Care Access.\nWhat we need is a new conversation about the true cost of public health care in New York \u2014 one that acknowledges that spending billions on health care means less money for summer youth jobs, subsides for affordable housing, adult literacy programs and other important needs.\nThe result is that hospitals are shrinking in size and don\u2019t need so many of wards full of recuperating patients, and they are competing with smaller, leaner clinics and health care organizations.\nWe believe in supporting them,\u201d de Blasio said at his budget briefing of the undocumented who don\u2019t have insurance."}
