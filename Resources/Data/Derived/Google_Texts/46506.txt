LINDEN A Piscataway woman has been arrested in connection with allegedly scamming a Linden senior citizen out of $9,000 by claiming his home was in foreclosure.

According to police, the scam began in May, when the 76-year-old man received a phone call from a woman, who was later identified as Mahwish N. Chaudry, 31, of Piscataway.

The woman told the man that she worked for a financial company and his home was in foreclosure. She told the man she could drive him to the bank to make a cash withdrawal and give the money to her to save his home. The man complied and gave Chaudry $4,000 cash.

A few days later, the woman again contacted the man and said more money was needed to avoid having the home go into foreclosure. The woman, who was accompanied by a second woman, drove the man to a local bank, where he withdrew $5,000 and gave it to the women.

The man's family eventually reported the incident to police. Detective Kenneth Mikolajczyk conducted an investigation and an arrest warrant was issued for Chaudry, who was arrested on Sept. 25 and later released on a summons.

Police said this scam may be occurring in the Asian Indian community and advised other victims to come forward and report any similar incidents to their local police department.
