Ryan\u2019s comments come as House Republicans plan to unveil a replacement bill that will reportedly allow young adults to remain on their parents\u2019 health care plans and provide some level of protection for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cIf you look at these kinds of reforms, where they\u2019ve been tried before \u2014 say the state of Kentucky, for example \u2014 you basically make it impossible to underwrite insurance,\u201d Ryan told Bloomberg\u2019s Al Hunt when asked if Republicans would maintain the pre-existing conditions regulations, dependent coverage extension, and other rate requirements. \u201cYou dramatically crank up the cost. And you make it hard for people to get affordable health care,\u201d Ryan insisted.\n\nThe former GOP vice presidential candidate also said that Republicans could offer other alternatives that would expand coverage to people without insurance and lower health care costs. \u201cYes, and I think there are better ways of dealing with those very serious and legitimate issues without doing it this way, because I think this is the wrong approach.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Ryan offered a joint alternative with Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), which would have taxed the full value of employer health benefits and provided refundable tax credits to help families and individuals purchase employer or nongroup coverage. Economists had predicted that equalizing the tax treatment of health care benefits could discourage businesses from offering insurance and lead at least 20 million Americans to lose their employer coverage .\n\nThe plan also encouraged states to \u201cestablish rational and reasonable consumer protections\u201d by forming State Health Insurance Exchanges. The bill even included \u201cnon-profit, independent board\u201d to penalize insurance companies \u201cthat cherry pick health patients and reward insurers that cover patients with pre-existing conditions.\u201d It described the board as \u201ca model that works in several European countries.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The most popular Obamacare provisions will have to go, Ryan admitted.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The most popular Obamacare provisions will have to go, Ryan admitted.", "title": "Paul Ryan Accidentally Reveals The Truth About The GOP\u2019s Obamacare Replacement", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/04/04/3423235/paul-ryan-admits-republicans-wont-reinstate-popular-parts-of-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Paul_ryan_thumbs_up-e1381676569504.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The most popular Obamacare provisions will have to go, Ryan admitted.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Paul_ryan_thumbs_up-e1381676569504-321x214.jpg", "title": "Paul Ryan Accidentally Reveals The Truth About The GOP\u2019s Obamacare Replacement", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Paul_ryan_thumbs_up-e1381676569504.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Paul_ryan_thumbs_up-e1381676569504.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-04T14:33:26+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f91\"", "article_summary": "Health Paul Ryan Accidentally Reveals The Truth About The GOP\u2019s Obamacare Replacement CREDIT:House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) admitted on Friday that Republicans would not be able to preserve the most popular elements of Obamacare if they repeal the law as a whole.\nAnd you make it hard for people to get affordable health care,\u201d Ryan insisted.\nThe plan also encouraged states to \u201cestablish rational and reasonable consumer protections\u201d by forming State Health Insurance Exchanges.\nThe former GOP vice presidential candidate also said that Republicans could offer other alternatives that would expand coverage to people without insurance and lower health care costs.\nEconomists had predicted that equalizing the tax treatment of health care benefits could discourage businesses from offering insurance and lead at least 20 million Americans to lose their employer coverage ."}
