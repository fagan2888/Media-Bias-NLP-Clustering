The way Crosby sees it, Pittsburgh\u2019s failings lie with the guys who pull the sweaters over their heads.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day we feel responsible,\u201d Crosby said Thursday. \u201cWe are the guys that go out there and want to perform and want to win and we have that expectation.\u201d\n\nOnes that weren\u2019t met for a fifth straight spring after the Penguins frittered a 3-1 series lead in an eventual seven-game loss to the New York Rangers in the Eastern Conference semifinals. A half-decade after hoisting the Stanley Cup in Detroit at age 21, Crosby and the franchise he represents are still searching for a bookend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to win and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any lack of effort from players, coaches, anybody in the conversation,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s been a lack of trying.\u201d\n\nThere has, however, been a lack of doing.\n\nThe Penguins have been a marvel during the regular season under Bylsma, who is 252-117-32 since taking over for Michel Therrien in the late stages of the 2008-09 season. Yet all those regular-season triumphs haven\u2019t prevented Pittsburgh from being knocked out of the playoffs by a lower-seeded team five straight times.\n\nPressed on what needs to change, Crosby didn\u2019t point to the coaching staff but instead a shift in mindset, particularly when the postseason begins.\n\n\u201cMaybe we need to adjust the way we play a little bit better and play more physical,\u201d Crosby said.\n\nIt\u2019s a challenge the Penguins have faced relentlessly during the Crosby era. The league\u2019s leading scorer and likely MVP scored just once in 13 playoff games \u2014 a career low \u2014 and spent plenty a month on the receiving end of punishment from Columbus center Brandon Dubinsky and New York defenseman Marc Staal.\n\nCrosby insists he wasn\u2019t rattled, even if at one point in Game 6 against the Rangers he found himself on the bottom of a dog pile with New York goaltender Henrik Lundqvist squirting him with a water bottle. Not exactly the best position to ward off a comeback.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I can\u2019t be better,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cI don\u2019t think my focus was lost. \u2026 You can go back to the years we won and you\u2019re not going to see anything different but we won and that\u2019s a big thing.\u201d\n\nAnd it will be the focus going forward regardless of who is in the front office or behind the bench.\n\nWhile Crosby and Evgeni Malkin will have their numbers hanging in the dressing room when the club reconvenes in September, there could be plenty of new ones hanging alongside them.\n\nForward Jussi Jokinen \u2014 whose seven playoff goals led the Penguins \u2014 is an unrestricted free agent. So is Lee Stempniak, who never quite meshed with Crosby after being brought in near the trading deadline. Defenseman Brooks Orpik, the team\u2019s longest tenured player, may be done in Pittsburgh after 11 seasons. Matt Niskanen, arguably the team\u2019s best defenseman all season, will hit the open market and may command too high a price to stick around.\n\nThen there\u2019s goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, who played steadily throughout the playoffs but knows he could be expendable with one year left on his current deal.\n\n\u201cI really hope I stay,\u201d Fleury said. \u201cIt\u2019s my team here. It\u2019s where I want to play.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment echoed throughout the locker room. For all the misery that accompanied the stunning fall against New York, Pittsburgh\u2019s talented core remains in the midst of their primes. Crosby is 26. Malkin is 27. So is defenseman Kris Letang. Fleury is still months away from turning 30 and bounced back from a miserable 2013 postseason by holding the Rangers to just 15 goals in seven games.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s many problems,\u201d forward Brandon Sutter said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more little things that aren\u2019t really huge. Maybe fresh ideas can change that. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much that needs to be fixed, maybe a few things shaken up. There\u2019s a few different ways. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anyone has to leave.\u201d\n\nIn theory, perhaps. The Penguins know they are constructed to raise championship banners, not flame out in the postseason. Yet it keeps happening.\n\n\u201cExpectations are high,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t deliver you have to own up to that as players and as an organization. We all understand that. We\u2019ll see what happens from here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A half-decade after hoisting the Stanley Cup in Detroit at age 21, Crosby and the franchise he represents are still searching for a bookend.", "Author": "Will Graves", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A half-decade after hoisting the Stanley Cup in Detroit at age 21, Crosby and the franchise he represents are still searching for a bookend.", "title": "Sidney Crosby: Penguins\u2019 players responsible for collapse", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/15/sidney-crosby-penguins-players-responsible-collaps/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/15/penguins-future-hockeyjpeg-0a9b9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/15/penguins-future-hockeyjpeg-0a9b9.jpg", "title": "Sidney Crosby: Penguins\u2019 players responsible for collapse", "description": "A half-decade after hoisting the Stanley Cup in Detroit at age 21, Crosby and the franchise he represents are still searching for a bookend.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sidney Crosby, Pittsburgh Penguins, Pittsburgh, New York Rangers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c82\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to win and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any lack of effort from players, coaches, anybody in the conversation,\u201d Crosby said.\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much that needs to be fixed, maybe a few things shaken up.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s been a lack of trying.\u201dThere has, however, been a lack of doing.\nAnd while others \u2014 namely Pittsburgh Penguins coach Dan Bylsma \u2014 will likely face the consequences following another early playoff exit, the NHL\u2019s brightest star isn\u2019t shirking his share of the blame.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my focus was lost."}
