Previously, and like the vast majority of states, Tennessee\u2019s statute required disclosure of a breach to be made in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay. Florida, like the Volunteer State, previously amended its breach notification statute to also require notification within a set time period.\n\nPerhaps even more important than the specific timing requirement for notice, S.B. 2005 also amends Tennessee\u2019s statute to remove the provision in the existing statute requiring notice only in the event of a breach of unencrypted personal information. Accordingly, by expanding this provision, it appears Tennessee will be the first state in the country to require breach notification regardless of whether or not the information subject to the breach was encrypted.\n\nLastly, the bill also amends the statute to specify an \u201cunauthorized person\u201d includes an employee of the information holder who is discovered to have obtained personal information and intentionally used it for an unlawful purpose. This amendment is likely focused on entities which failed to provide notification of data incidents which were the result of improper access by employees.\n\nThe law takes effect July 1, 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On March 24, 2016, Tennessee\u2019s breach notification statute was amended when Governor, Bill Hallam, signed into law S.B. 2005", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "On March 24, 2016, Tennessee&amp;rsquo;s breach notification statute was amended when Governor, Bill Hallam, signed into law S.B. 2005.\r\n\r\nUnder the amendment,&amp;nbsp;notification of a data breach must now", "title": "Tennessee Amends Breach Notification Statute", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/tennessee-amends-breach-notification-statute", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1141/Chalkboard%20Legislation_24.jpg?itok=lCXzZEd9", "type": "article"}, "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "keywords": "Nation, Legislation, Tennessee, Technology, Cybersecurity, Privacy, Breach Notification, Requirement, Statute, Bill Hallam, S.
