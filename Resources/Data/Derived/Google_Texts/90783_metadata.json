If instead those possible effects of surgery are presented vividly via personal stories, men may be swayed away from the surgery option.\n\nThe Powell Center report gives examples of advance care planning materials in widespread use that, it argues, violate the principle of informed consent by selectively presenting facts in a distorted and unbalanced manner to \u201cnudge\u201d unwary patients to reject cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), IV fluids, and medically assisted feeding. Other advance care planning materials, it charges, describe disabilities and illnesses in an inaccurately repugnant way so as to induce people to agree that a low \u201cquality of life\u201d is not worth living.\n\nThe Powell report notes that providers of advance care planning materials to health insurers frequently tout the money it saves them. For example, to implement an advance care planning program, Aetna hired the \u201cCenter to Advance Palliative Care,\u201d which proudly reported that the result of its efforts was an average reduction of more than $12,000 annually in benefits for senior citizens covered by the insurance company.\n\nTax funding for Medicare advance care planning was a part of the original House bill for Obamacare that was dropped amidst controversy over critics\u2019 charges that it was designed to save money by pushing senior citizens to agree to forego costly treatment. Recently, however, the Obama Administration has announced it will initiate notice and comment rule-making on an AMA proposal to revive such a measure.\n\nThe Powell Center report concludes, \u201cSignificant safeguards would need to be incorporated in any governmental program promoting . . . advance care planning in order for [it] to be truly protective of the values and intent of patients, and to ensure they are not pressured into rejecting treatment against their wishes\u2026all in the name of cost-savings.\u201d\n\nThe report is available here: www.nrlc.org/communications/advancecareplanningbias", "article_metadata": {"description": "Death Panels: Scathing Report Shows Advanced Care Planning Favors Rationing Care", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "In advance of a Friday Institute of Medicine conference in Washington, DC involving policymakers in implementation of its September 2014 report that urged promo", "title": "Death Panels: Scathing Report Shows Advanced Care Planning Favors Rationing Care", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/03/19/death-panels-scathing-report-shows-advanced-care-planning-favors-rationing-care/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/picassistedsuicide17.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "death panels: scathing report shows advanced care planning favors rationing care", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08f5\"", "article_summary": "The Powell report notes that providers of advance care planning materials to health insurers frequently tout the money it saves them.\nThe Powell Center report concludes, \u201cSignificant safeguards would need to be incorporated in any governmental program promoting .\nOther advance care planning materials, it charges, describe disabilities and illnesses in an inaccurately repugnant way so as to induce people to agree that a low \u201cquality of life\u201d is not worth living.\nFor example, to implement an advance care planning program, Aetna hired the \u201cCenter to Advance Palliative Care,\u201d which proudly reported that the result of its efforts was an average reduction of more than $12,000 annually in benefits for senior citizens covered by the insurance company.\nIf instead those possible effects of surgery are presented vividly via personal stories, men may be swayed away from the surgery option."}
