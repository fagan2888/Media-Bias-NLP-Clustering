Tom Corbett urged action.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too many personalities \u2014 too many personalities and too many special interest groups that want this and want that,\u201d state Sen. Scott Wagner, R-York, said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Mexican standoff.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a slog for sure, even after the state House last year passed a historic privatization bill that would phase out the more than 600 state-run liquor stores.\n\nThe state Senate hasn\u2019t been nearly as giddy about relinquishing the state\u2019s grip on wine and liquor. Instead, the chamber has looked at convenience options, such as allowing consumers to buy up to three six-packs at grocery stores, allowing limited direct wine shipments and having Sunday and holiday hours at state stores.\n\nThat proposal, though, has yet to emerge from the state Senate. It was scheduled to be discussed at a Senate Appropriations Committee on June 9, but was not considered.\n\nThere\u2019s no vote planned, either, as the Senate searches for 26 votes, said Erik Arneson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi, R-Chester.\n\nCorbett used his February budget address to say that 2014 should be the \u201clast call\u201d for state-run liquor sales. He looks ready to fight for that, even if it means a shorter summer break for lawmakers.\n\nAfter three years of on-time budgets, Corbett said Tuesday he\u2019s willing to miss the June 30 deadline this year. While saying he won\u2019t consider new revenue without pension reform, Corbett also listed liquor reform as one of his interests as lawmakers consider revenue generators to balance Pennsylvania\u2019s flagging budget and perhaps save his election-year plans to funnel more money into education and human service programs.\n\nThe governor praised House Majority Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, for his \u201cleadership\u201d on the liquor issue, and said he was \u201cconfident\u201d that the Senate could return a bill to the House.\n\n\u201cI will say the time for that debate is over,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cNow is the time to get that bill passed and we can move it over.\u201d\n\nIt might not happen so simply. It\u2019s a dogged issue largely because reforming the system has far-ranging effects, said Amy Christie, executive director of the Pennsylvania Tavern Association.\n\nWhile Christie\u2019s organization wants to preserve its members\u2019 business investments, privatization also would impact the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, wine and spirit brokers and the labor union representing state store employees.\n\nAnd throw the already privatized beer industry into the mix when talking about overhauling alcohol sales and that pulls in everything from the behemoth brewing companies such as MillerCoors to small craft brewers, Christie said.\n\n\u201cThere are so many parts to the industry and the PLCB that many do not realize,\u201d she said.\n\nMark Tanczos, president of the Malt Beverage Distributors Association of Pennsylvania, said there\u2019s concern that a plan that started as liquor and wine privatization has morphed into a proposal that could pick winners and losers in the beer industry, which already is privatized.\n\n\u201cThe beer distributors for 80 years have followed the rules that are currently there. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s so hard to make changes in the beer industry,\u201d Tanczos said.\n\nWhile Tanczos said distributors have been asking for the ability to sell six-packs of beer, for now they\u2019re just looking for a level of predictability that has disappeared as lawmakers consider what to do.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Allegheny, acknowledged last week that the issue of liquor reform has been complicated by the diversity of opinions and interests in Pennsylvania. There\u2019s also the question of how much control the state should sacrifice in the name of consumer convenience, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so many moving parts that it really is a complex issue, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult to nail down 26 votes for something along those lines,\u201d Costa said.\n\nBut until that happens, the standoff continues.\n\nContact Andrew Staub at Andrew@PAIndependent.com.
