The Colorado Rockies open their 2015 season against the Brewers in Milwaukee on Monday at 12:10 p.m. MT — when, you know, most people are working or in school or generally unavailable to attend a baseball game.

The Brewers have their fans’ backs, though. Many players wrote “excuse” notes for fans to give to their bosses or teachers so they could attend the big game. (Come on, Rockies. Step up.)
