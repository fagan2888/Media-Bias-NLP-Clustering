That\u2019s a big problem: When the young and healthy don\u2019t enroll, premiums have to be hiked to cover the costs of older, sicker people, discouraging even more young people from signing up.\n\nLast Thursday, the administration predicted enrollment for 2016 will be less than half what the Congressional Budget Office predicted in March.\n\nDespite subsidies to help with premiums and out-of-pocket costs, most of the uninsured who are eligible for ObamaCare are saying \u201cno thanks.\u201d Only one in seven is expected to sign up. That\u2019s despite a hefty increase in the financial penalty next year for not having insurance.\n\nThe president sees the writing on the wall. You won\u2019t be seeing the customary nationwide TV campaign to encourage sign-ups, as there were in previous years. Remember the young guy in plaid pajamas \u2014 \u201cPajama Boy,\u201d to conservatives \u2014 well, he won\u2019t be back this winter.\n\nBad enough that healthy people aren\u2019t buying. Worse is that the administration is spending billions of your tax dollars covering up the problem, paying insurers to keep offering the plans, even though they\u2019re losing their shirts. But facts are facts \u2014 and there\u2019s no hiding these.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell predicts ObamaCare enrollment will inch up by 1 million or so, to 10 million people \u2014 half what the CBO forecasted. Open enrollment for the coming year, which begins Nov. 1, \u201cis going to be a challenge,\u201d she said.\n\nDavid Wichmann, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s president, announced higher premiums last week because enrollees will \u201crequire more medical services than original expectations.\u201d\n\nMany states (though not New York) are looking at premium hikes of 30 percent or more, according to a new Robert Wood Johnson/Urban Institute analysis. The Heritage Foundation estimates that insurers lost 12 percent selling ACA plans in 2014, with more losses this year.\n\nDon\u2019t shed any tears for the insurance companies. Though they\u2019re losing money on exchange plans, overall they\u2019re profitable and their stocks are doing well. It\u2019s John Q. Public who\u2019s bearing the brunt. Just as ObamaCare intended.\n\nIf you get insurance at work, you\u2019re paying an extra tax to fund \u201creinsurance\u201d for ObamaCare plans. It\u2019s a fund to defray the cost of their most expensive enrollees.\n\nSo far, insurers have collected about $7.9 billion. Recent congressional testimony shows the payments kept ObamaCare sticker prices about 11 percent lower than they otherwise would have been. In short, you pay a tax to make ObamaCare look more affordable than it is.\n\nBut even with these hidden subsidies, ObamaCare isn\u2019t working because the design is fatally flawed. The 5 percent of the population with serious medical conditions consume nearly 50 percent of the health care. When you try to sell insurance to sick and healthy people for the same price, the healthy don\u2019t sign up. It\u2019s too expensive.\n\nNew York state learned that in the 1990s, when one-price-for-all insurance laws pushed premiums to the highest in the nation, crushing the individual insurance market here.\n\nObamaCare repeats that mistake. Despite slapping the uninsured with penalties \u2014 which will jump to 2.5 percent of household income in 2016 \u2014 they\u2019re not signing up. The need to coerce enrollment with penalties is proof the plans are a bad deal.\n\nHow long will big insurers play along? There are political considerations, and for most, ObamaCare losses are still just a dent in their overall business. Not so for the 23 co-op insurers set up under the health law. Eight state plans have already failed, including New York\u2019s Health Republic, and most of the rest are bleeding money.\n\nWith ObamaCare enrollment floundering and losses mounting, the nation needs alternatives. The Republicans are coalescing around a reform plan, but Democrats are doubling down. Hillary Rodham Clinton wants to burden the existing, unpopular plans with more \u201cfree\u201d goodies, and make it harder to dodge the mandate. That won\u2019t work.\n\nA real reform would cover the seriously ill \u2014 people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 in separate plans with separate pricing and subsidies to make them affordable.\n\nJust like the high-risk pools many states used to maintain. That\u2019s the lesson of the failing ObamaCare scheme.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is the author of \u201cBeating ObamaCare\u201d and a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "ObamaCare is heading toward a death spiral.\nThe Obama administration is having trouble selling insurance plans to healthy people.
