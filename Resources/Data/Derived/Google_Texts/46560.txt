In the days leading up to the Martin Luther King Day of Service, Get Covered America will provide Affordable Care Act information and enrollment assistance in order for residents of Chicago’s South Side to Get Covered and Stay Covered

CHICAGO, IL — This weekend, and on Martin Luther King Day of Service, Get Covered America will help uninsured Chicago residents get covered and stay covered by providing educational support and enrollment assistance at an array of events on Chicago’s South Side. Attendees will have the opportunity to meet with a trained professional and receive free one-on-one enrollment assistance to help them understand their options and enroll in a plan that fits their needs and budget.

“Having access to quality, affordable healthcare is a fundamental human right, and with Martin Luther King Day of Service on the horizon, the subject of healthcare as a human right is all the more relevant,” said David Elin, Illinois State Director for Enroll America and the Get Covered America campaign. “As we do our work in communities across Illinois, we’re seeing is that people are hungry for information on how they can sign up in the Health Insurance Marketplace, and we’re doing everything we can to connect them to coverage. Time is of the essence, though, and consumers have just a little over a month to enroll.”

The event takes place just under a month before the February 15 deadline to enroll in coverage in the current open enrollment period. To help Illinois residents get covered before this upcoming deadline, other Get Covered America enrollment events will be taking place in Illinois throughout the rest of the open enrollment period. This year, those who don’t have insurance may face a fine of $325 or 2% of their household income, whichever is higher.

Since the current open enrollment period began on November 15, 2014, over 272,000 Illinoisans have obtained coverage through the health insurance marketplace. More than 80% of Illinoisans who enrolled received financial help paying for their plan.

Consumers seeking to get enrolled at the event are asked to bring either their 2014 W-4 or pay stubs from the last two months, as well as a driver’s license, U.S. Passport, or state identification card. Anyone seeking to renew their current Marketplace coverage, or who would like to see what new options they have should bring their Healthcare.gov account information. Consumers who can’t attend Saturday’s enrollment event can schedule an appointment with a trained navigator or assister by using Get Covered America’s online connector tool, available at www.GetCoveredAmerica.org/connector.
