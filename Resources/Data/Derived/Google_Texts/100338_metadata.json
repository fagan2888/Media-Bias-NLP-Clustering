Or did it?\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has hinted it might reopen enrollment on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance exchanges in 37 states around the tax filing deadline April 15, with the aim of enrolling people who learn for the first time they owe a fine under the law\u2019s individual mandate to have health coverage. Already, Minnesota, Vermont and Washington have done so, and states including California may do the same.\n\nSince Obamacare\u2019s exchange marketplaces first opened in October 2013, federal and state authorities have simultaneously emphasized the importance of the deadlines to sign up for coverage and then fudged them to accommodate their own errors and a public that remains uninformed about the 5-year-old health care law\u2019s requirements and benefits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got millions of people who are still qualified who have a chance to sign up, but you\u2019ve got to do it by Feb. 15,\u201d Obama said at the White House earlier this month.\n\nMaybe not, it turns out just a few days after that supposed deadline.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell will announce plans for the federal health insurance exchanges using HealthCare.gov within two weeks, she said at a press conference Wednesday. \u201cWhat we try and do -- as we have throughout this open enrollment -- is focus deeply on the issue of the consumer,\u201d she said. A group of congressional Democrats has urged the administration to permit more people to sign up, as have tax-preparation companies and groups that support Obamacare.\n\nAllowing more people to enroll in health insurance has obvious benefits for the Obama administration and states like Vermont that operate their own exchanges. It would also help at least some of the consumers who might sign up. More uninsured people would gain coverage, fewer people would owe tax penalties next year and the backlash about the fine would be mitigated.\n\n\u201cIt would be awful for a Vermont family to have to pay a fee of several hundred dollars or more, and then have to pay 100 percent of their medical care on top of that, just because they didn\u2019t know the penalty existed,\u201d Lawrence Miller, chief of health care reform for Gov. Peter Shumlin (D), said in a press release Thursday.\n\nBut the approach also carries risks.\n\nReopening enrollment after hyping the previous deadlines could contribute to confusion about when people are supposed to act in future years. It could also lead consumers to conclude upcoming deadlines aren\u2019t real, especially considering the many other parts of the Affordable Care Act that have been delayed or even canceled since the law passed in 2010. And there\u2019s a small chance it could encourage people to postpone getting coverage until they have medical needs, which would increase costs.\n\nIf a special enrollment period is going to succeed without causing problems for consumers and insurers this year, authorities will have to communicate that it\u2019s a unique event for a specific population, said Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for the trade group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans.\n\n\u201cSpecial enrollment periods need to be clearly defined in terms of who qualifies and the start and end date to make sure that consumers understand and health plans can help those folks navigate that process,\u201d Krusing said.\n\nOne reason a special enrollment period may be deemed necessary is that outreach campaigns have downplayed the mandate and the penalty. The individual mandate is the least popular part of an unpopular law, and enrollment efforts instead have focused on positive messages, like the availability of subsidies and access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"There's been such a reluctance to talk about the mandate, and so, shockingly, people don't realize that they have to buy coverage,\" said Caroline Pearson, who leads the health reform practice at Avalere Health, a consulting firm.\n\nThe Treasury Department estimates as many as 6 million people will owe the penalty for not having health coverage last year, despite a slew of exemptions from the mandate. Signing up for coverage during one of these special enrollment periods wouldn\u2019t eliminate the penalty for last year, and taxpayers who sign up for insurance would still owe a partial penalty for this year because the law allows only a three-month grace period.\n\nThis tax season is the first time Americans have to factor health insurance into their returns. The Obamacare mandate fine starts at $95 per person, but will be based on a percentage of income -- and thus be higher -- for most households subject to it for the 2014 tax year. And it gets a lot bigger for 2015: at least $325 or a percentage of income. The minimum fine goes up to $695 for 2016.\n\n\u201cThere still remain millions upon millions of people who are unaware about these penalties,\u201d said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy organization supportive of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cAnd there are still millions of people who are not even aware of the subsidies they may be eligible for,\u201d he said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday.\n\nObamacare uses fixed time periods for enrollment to dissuade consumers from putting off getting coverage until they get sick and need costly medical care. That\u2019s the same way most employers handle job-based health benefits, and how Medicare handles sign-ups for prescription drug and Medicare Advantage insurance plans.\n\n\u201cIt really goes to the core reason that the Affordable Care Act has an open enrollment period instead of enrollment periods throughout the year,\u201d Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, that state\u2019s exchange, said on the Families USA call. \u201cThe right question is, does having a special period for one time cause injury to that and affect the risk pool?\u201d\n\nSo far, the dates for regular enrollment have varied every year: Oct. 1, 2013, to March 31, 2014, for last year; Nov. 15, 2014, to Feb. 15 for this year; and tentatively Oct. 1, 2015, to Dec. 15, 2015, for next year. And that doesn\u2019t count prior deadline extensions, or the practice of allowing people who didn\u2019t complete their applications on time to finish them after deadlines passed, which has been happening since Sunday.\n\nSince all of this is so new, now may be a good time to be flexible, but the exchanges must have deadlines that matter at some point, said Sydney Smith Zvara, executive director of the Association of Washington Healthcare Plans in the Evergreen State. \u201cDown the line, some people could end up after it\u2019s tightened up being disappointed that they are held to a deadline, because it looked like they were so elastic,\u201d she said.\n\nOverall, the health insurance industry doesn\u2019t appear concerned so far.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP Health Care each endorsed Vermont\u2019s decision, according a press release from the exchange. Insurers in Minnesota also aren\u2019t worried about the special enrollment period disrupting their operations, Jim Schowalter, president and CEO of the Minnesota Council of Health Plans, wrote in an email. Washington state insurers support getting more people covered, but some companies are wary of creating incentives for people to postpone buying insurance, Zvara said.\n\nCalifornia will reveal its decision early next week, and the exchanges in Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky and New York are weighing more enrollment this year, officials from those states said. By contrast, states including Colorado and Maryland currently are not eying reopening their exchanges, representatives told The Huffington Post. Early moves by Minnesota, Vermont and Washington states could put pressure on authorities elsewhere to follow suit.\n\nAllowing uninsured people who owe the mandate fine to sign up late actually could benefit insurers, Pearson of Avalere Health said. Individuals who remain without health coverage may be healthier than those already enrolled, because sick people are more driven to get insurance, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly upside. I think you have the potential to actually get a reasonable enrollment bump, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really significant risk,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cAs long as it stays limited.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Distinguishable Members Of Congress Distinguishable Members Of Congress\n\n1 of 14 Rep.
