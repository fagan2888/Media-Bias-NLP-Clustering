Brian Sandoval, a Republican, has taken his name out of contention in President Obama\u2019s search for a nominee to fill the current Supreme Court vacancy.\n\nIn a statement Sandoval provided Thursday to Nevada political reporter and commentator Jon Ralston, the governor said:\n\nEarlier today, I notified the White House that I do not wish to be considered at this time for possible nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. \u2026 The notion of being considered for a seat on the highest court in the land is beyond humbling and I am incredibly grateful to have been mentioned.\n\nSandoval, 53, said he had spoken with three key senators\u2014Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.; and Dean Heller, R-Nev.\u2014and \u201cexpressed the same desire\u201d not to be considered.\n\nObama is pondering a nominee to succeed Antonin Scalia, the 29-year conservative standard-bearer on the Supreme Court, who died Feb. 13.\n\nPolitical observers speculated the White House was using Sandoval to pressure Senate Republicans who don\u2019t want to move to fill the Scalia seat while Obama remains president.\n\nAmong Ralston\u2019s initial tweets on his scoop:\n\nBreaking: Sandoval takes himself out of consideration for SCOTUS. \u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) February 25, 2016\n\nBottom line: Once Sandoval saw strategic leak to Post of only his name, he got the game that was going on, got out before he got bludgeoned. \u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) February 25, 2016\n\nNews of Sandoval\u2019s withdrawal from consideration came one day after NARAL Pro-Choice America issued a statement opposing Obama\u2019s potential nomination of Sandoval, a centrist who advocates a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion, citing what it considers his shaky record on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe find it hard to believe that President Obama, who shares the value of reproductive freedom for all Americans, would put forward Governor Sandoval as a serious contender for the Supreme Court nomination,\u201d NARAL President Ilyse Hogue said in the statement.\n\n\u201cBut if he were, Sandoval\u2019s checkered history on reproductive freedom should raise some serious flags\u2014it certainly has for us.\u201d\n\nHogue and her organization cited no specifics to explain the \u201ccheckered history\u201d charge.\n\n>>> Democrats Predict Republicans Will Back Down on Scalia Seat\n\nThe Washington Post was the first of many news outlets reporting Wednesday that the Obama administration was vetting Sandoval as a potential nominee to succeed Scalia, who died at age 79. The Daily Signal reported Monday that Sandoval\u2019s name was prominent in speculation about Obama\u2019s potential choices.\n\nMore Senate Republicans on Tuesday backed their leader, McConnell, in saying they would not consider any nominee to the Supreme Court this year, but Obama indicated Wednesday he would try to convince GOP members to change course.\n\n\u201cI think it will be very difficult for Mr. McConnell to explain, if the public concludes that this person is very well qualified, that the Senate should stand in the way simply for political reasons,\u201d Obama told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nSandoval was never a serious consideration but WaPo and others did Admin's bidding anyway knowing that full well \u2014 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) February 25, 2016\n\nI am shocked SHOCKED that Brian Sandoval isn't going to be Obama's SCOTUS nominee. \u2014 Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) February 25, 2016\n\nAlthough Sandoval is a Republican, the former federal judge has broken with the national party leadership on some issues, leaving in question the possibility of his confirmation even among GOP senators.\n\nSandoval was elected Nevada governor in 2010. He has supported pro-choice policies and last year affirmed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on same-sex marriage as settled law.\n\n\u201cThe mere rumors of his nomination brought swift pushback from a GOP so committed to obstructing the process and letting President Obama do his job that they don\u2019t even want to let one of their own get a hearing,\u201d NARAL\u2019s Hogue said.\n\nBrian Sandoval takes himself out of running for job he was never going to be offered. #notshocking \u2014 John Bresnahan (@BresPolitico) February 25, 2016\n\nthat was a fast 15 minutes #sandoval https://t.co/soKKZ0iO0Q \u2014 Kate Bennett (@KateBennett_DC) February 25, 2016\n\nA Sandoval spokesman earlier told The Washington Post and other news outlets that the White House has not yet contacted the governor regarding a potential appointment to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Nevada, Sandoval had the backing of Reid and also had met with Heller regarding the open seat.\n\nWhile in Washington, D.C., last weekend for the annual National Governors Association meeting, Sandoval spoke with the two senators and told reporters he was \u201chonored\u201d his name had been mentioned as a potential successor to Scalia.\n\nI gather Sandoval realized he was was a pawn and wanted no part of it. He wants a judicial or Cabinet post someday. pic.twitter.com/e5ySKReaut \u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) February 25, 2016\n\n[Insert clever, Internet-melting take on #Sandoval #SCOTUS withdrawal here] \u2014 John T.
