Sean Flynn\u2019s no dummy \u2026 but he did write Economics for Dummies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Flynn plan? Streamline and balance the budget, replace Obamacare, cut regulations to create more high paying jobs \u2026 now that's smart. Republican Sean Flynn -- because we can't afford more dummies in D.C.\u201d\n\nThe Flynn camp sent out a press release about the 30-second ad. Minutes later, Chabot fired back with his own press release accusing Flynn of mud-slinging and donating to \u201cDemocrat politicians who bankroll President Obama and his liberal policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cDesperate times call for desperate measures,\u201d said Chabot campaign strategist John Thomas. \u201cSean Flynn must think voters are dummies if he expects them to buy what he's selling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is Flynn has zero experience fighting crime and terrorism. While Sean was sharpening pencils in the safety of an ivory tower classroom, Paul served in Iraq as a counter-terrorism military officer fighting terrorists, and returned home to fight criminals here in our communities.\u201d\n\nBaca, Chabot and Flynn are trying to unseat Aguilar, a former Redlands mayor, in the 31st, which includes Redlands, Rancho Cucamonga, Rialto, Loma Linda and Grand Terrace. The top two vote-getters in the June 7 primary, regardless of party, advance to the November general election.\n\nBesides sparring over TV ads, Chabot and Flynn are fighting over endorsements. Flynn\u2019s supporters include the Inland Empire Taxpayers Association, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher and Orange County Supervisor Michelle Steel.\n\nChabot is trumpeting his endorsement of the San Bernardino County GOP, as well as the backing of former UN ambassador John Bolton and Inland Reps. Ken Calvert and Duncan Hunter, among others.\n\nWhile Flynn has been touting his background in economics, Chabot has been selling himself as a man with a plan to defeat the Islamic State. Chabot has been handing out terrorist \u201chunting permits\u201d to supporters.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "sailthru.author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "content_author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "ICBM": "33.948100, -117.396100", "sailthru.tags": "blogs, congressional, don, candidates, voters, flynn, chabot, paul, republican, decision, 31st", "content_section": "blogs", "content_title": "DECISION 2016: Republican congressional candidates Sean Flynn, Paul Chabot trade attacks", "geo.position": "33.948100;-117.396100", "author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "section": "blogs", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-03 12:09:13", "sailthru.title": "DECISION 2016: Republican congressional candidates Sean Flynn, Paul Chabot trade attacks", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/o6m7ua-chabot.jpg", "geo.placename": "Riverside", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/o6m7ua-chabot.jpg", "content_type": "article", "publication_date": "2016-05-03", "Description": "DECISION 2016: Republican congressional candidates Sean Flynn, Paul Chabot trade attacks  | congressional, don, candidates, voters, flynn, chabot, paul, republican, decision, 31st", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "DECISION 2016: Republican congressional candidates Sean Flynn, Paul Chabot trade attacks  | congressional, don, candidates, voters, flynn, chabot, paul, republican, decision, 31st", "title": "DECISION 2016: Republican congressional candidates Sean Flynn, Paul Chabot trade attacks", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/o6m7ua-chabot.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/congressional-801834-don-candidates.html", "type": "article"}, "Keywords": "congressional, don, candidates, voters, flynn, chabot, paul, republican, decision, 31st", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/o6m7ua-chabot.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34f7\"", "article_summary": "Republican Sean Flynn -- because we can't afford more dummies in D.C.\u201dThe Flynn camp sent out a press release about the 30-second ad.\n\u201cTime for an outsider who can fix it, Republican Sean Flynn.\nFlynn\u2019s supporters include the Inland Empire Taxpayers Association, Rep.
