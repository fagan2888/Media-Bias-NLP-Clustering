Rand Paul Rand PaulOvernight Energy: Trump outlines 'America First' energy plan in North Dakota Overnight Regulation: GOP slams new Obama education rules Paul blocks chemical safety bill in Senate MORE (R-Ky.) said it was time for a doctor, such as himself, to fix the broken healthcare law known as ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cThe old system before ObamaCare was not perfect, but I fear the new system with more government intervention will be worse,\u201d Paul said to a group of ophthalmologists on Monday. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for a doctor to fix the problem.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPaul said that the healthcare debate in Washington has less to do medicine and more to do with economics. He blasted the U.S. government for setting healthcare prices, saying the failure of the Soviet Union proves capitalism is better.\n\n\u201cEvery time a Washington bureaucrat sets a price, the consumer suffers,\u201d Paul said. \u201cGet government out of the business of setting prices.\u201d\n\nPaul called for the abolishment of the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR), which is used to control doctor fees.\n\n\u201cEnd the SGR, the government system that sets fees. It was wrongheaded policy from the beginning,\u201d Paul said. \u201cLet's not temporarily fix SGR, let's abolish it once and for all.\u201d\n\nThe SGR helps control federal spending on Medicare, which is one of the largest entitlement programs. Congress regularly passes a \u201cdoc fix\u201d to ensure physician fees are covered.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
