The board suggested that the staff try again, but until then the 2013 guidelines remain in place.\n\nEducation reform groups criticized the proposed changes as watering down the state\u2019s first common set of graduation standards, which will go into effect for the class of 2021.\n\nThe revised plan would have removed competency in science and social studies a requirement, to line up with college admissions requirements that include only math and English.\n\nMinimum scores in Advanced Placement courses and International Baccalaureate programs also would have been lowered.\n\nThe menu of options for districts includes ACT and SAT scores, military entrance tests, industry certificates and \u201ccapstone projects,\u201d college thesis-like assignments that typically involve a presentation.\n\nThe revised list roughly doubled the options, including the addition of locally developed assessments that would first need state approval.\n\nUnder either scenario, Colorado is positioned to make a significant change, shifting from making high school graduation about racking up course credits to requiring students to prove their competency.\n\nAt one point Thursday, Republican board member Steve Durham made a motion to revoke the board\u2019s approval of the 2013 guidelines.\n\nHe withdrew that after the assistant attorney general advising the board pointed out that the board was required by statute to have them in place by 2013.\n\nResponding to criticism about lowering the bar, Democratic board member Angelika Schroeder emphasized districts can set higher standards.\n\nShe said it\u2019s the community\u2019s job to set \u201caspirational goals.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Board of Education leaves graduation standards alone for now", "title": "Colorado Board of Education leaves graduation standards alone for now", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/14/colorado-board-of-education-leaves-graduation-standards-alone-for-now/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-14T18:16:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-14T18:16:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "higher education, K-12 education"}, "article_summary": "Responding to criticism about lowering the bar, Democratic board member Angelika Schroeder emphasized districts can set higher standards.\nEducation reform groups criticized the proposed changes as watering down the state\u2019s first common set of graduation standards, which will go into effect for the class of 2021.\nIn May 2013, the state board signed off on a \u201cmenu\u201d of tests, tasks and other options districts can give to students to demonstrate competency in English, math, science and social studies to graduate.\nThe revised list roughly doubled the options, including the addition of locally developed assessments that would first need state approval.\nAt one point Thursday, Republican board member Steve Durham made a motion to revoke the board\u2019s approval of the 2013 guidelines."}
