But until now, students interested in the intellectual underpinnings of Beer Pong had to do their investigations off school hours. Now a professor has remedied that oversight by teaching her students an ancient Greek drinking game, with 3D printing in place of the illustrations she once used.\n\nHeather Sharpe, an associate professor of art history at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, uses a 3D printed drinking cup to teach her students about a Beer Pong-like game the ancients played called kottabos.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be really great if we could actually try to do it ourselves,\u201d Sharpe says.\n\nThe Greeks used the game, much as college students do today, to spice up their drinking binges. At what were referred to as symposia, men got hammered on wine and competed by tossing the the dregs of their beverages at a target to win prizes.\n\nSharpe says historical texts and artworks show that the two ways to play kottabos \u2014 one an attempt to knock down a disc balanced on a metal stand, and one aimed at hitting small dishes floating in a large bowl of water \u2014 used leftover wine. Paintings on kylixes, the boozing cups of the day, included scenes of partygoers playing kottabos.\n\nSo Sharpe called on Andrew Snyder, a professor of ceramics at West Chester University, to lend her a hand in making the game pieces playable. Snyder built three replica kylixes out of clay, but he ultimately used a MakerBot Replicator 2 to print lighter, more durable versions of the cups.\n\nAnd it seems the game was every bit as tough as the modern equivalent.\n\n\u201cIt took a fair amount of control to actually direct the wine dregs, and interestingly enough, some of the women were the first to get it,\u201d Sharpe told Megan Gannon of Live Science. \u201cIn some respects, they relied a little bit more on finesse, whereas some of the guys were trying to throw it too hard.\u201d\n\nWhile Sharpe and her students used diluted grape juice, the professor says she\u2019d ultimately like to play kottabos with real adult beverages, you know, to understand how the increasing levels of drunkenness would have affected the outcome of the game.\n\nScience.\n\n\u201cIt would be fun to actually experiment with wine drinking,\u201d Sharpe says. \u201cOf course, this was a university event, so we couldn\u2019t exactly do it on campus. But really, to get the full experiment, it would be interesting to try it after having a kylix of wine \u2014 or after having two kylixes of wine.\u201d\n\nDo you know about any other instances where professors have used 3D printing to help their students understand history in a more \u2018hands on\u2019 way?
