The mistake was what would happen when that Wal-Mart's manager approached him because of it.\n\n\"He asked me for my boss' phone number,\" said Josephus. \"All I was doing was sitting there ringing a bell and I was wondering why he wanted my boss' phone number.\"\n\n\"He was drawing huge crowd on the sidewalk,\" said Cobb. \"So we thought it would be great if we could have him year round, so we offered him a job as a people greeter.\"\n\n\"So I lost my best bell ringer,\" said the Major. \"And Wal-Mart gained a wonderful guy.\"\n\nWhen Josephus isn't taking care of his mother, or in church blessing his peers with his voice, he sings his way into the hearts of Wal-Mart customers.\n\nIn style of course.\n\n\"We get some raised eyebrows,\" said Cobb. \"From people who don't know whats going on, but he quickly wins them over.\"\n\n\"When I get through they always clap and they say, 'Wow, wow, wow,'\" said Williams. \"And some of them come and hug me and everything. It just makes your day, that's why I love working at Wal-Mart.\"\n\nWal-Mart employees say Josephus has a way of making everyone feel like someone, whether he is remembering their name, or going the extra mile to help customers with their shopping experience.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When we think of Wal-Mart, we tend to think of a superstore that has pretty much everything you need.
