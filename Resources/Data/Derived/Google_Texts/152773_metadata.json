For instance, some observation patients owed over $12,000 for post-hospital SNF care, more than 5 times the amount owed by patients who met Medicare\u2019s 3-day prior hospital inpatient stay requirement for coverage.\n\n\u201cThese findings demonstrate the disproportionate financial impact on some patients who are unwittingly caught by Medicare\u2019s arbitrary rules for coverage of hospital outpatient services and skilled nursing facility care,\u201d said Keith Lind, JD, MS, Sr. Strategic Policy Advisor, AARP Public Policy Institute, and co-author of the report. \u201cThe Medicare rules should change so patients get the care they need without the unnecessarily high costs.\u201d\n\nObservation Status vs Inpatient Status\n\nDoctors may place emergency room patients under observation instead of formally admitting them as hospital inpatients while determining their diagnosis. Patients often do not know their patient status. Under Medicare rules, observation patients are considered outpatients.\n\nFor Medicare beneficiaries, observation status can result in unexpectedly high out-of-pocket hospital bills, as well as thousands of dollars for SNF care. Medicare inpatients typically only pay a one-time deductible. Under observation, however, Medicare beneficiaries pay a deductible plus part of the cost of each individual hospital service provided, with no limit on what they may owe, plus the cost of non-covered drugs.\n\nMedicare covers 100% of the first 20 days for approved SNF care, but only for those with a minimum of 3 full \u2018inpatient\u2019 days in the hospital. Medicare does not cover follow-up SNF care for observation patients because they are considered outpatients, not inpatients.\n\nReport Highlights\n\nNearly 2 out of 3 of Medicare observation patients that needed post-hospitalization SNF care did not meet the 3-day inpatient requirement for Medicare coverage.\n\n1 in 10 Medicare observation patients paid more out-of-pocket for hospital services than if they had been admitted as inpatients.\n\nSome observation patients owed more than $12,000 for post-hospital SNF care, more than 5 times the amount owed by patients who met Medicare\u2019s 3-day prior inpatient stay requirement for coverage.\n\nPolicy Solutions\n\nTo help protect Medicare beneficiaries from getting stuck paying disproportionately high out-of-pocket costs, AARP supports:\n\nPlacing a cap on total beneficiary out-of-pocket costs for observation services and other outpatient services to match the one-time Medicare Part A deductible for inpatients.\n\nCrediting time spent in observation toward the 3-day hospital inpatient stay required to qualify for SNF coverage.\n\nWorking to replace the 3-day prior hospital inpatient stay requirement with appropriate clinical criteria related to the need for SNF care.\n\nAARP has endorsed the bipartisan Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act (S. 843/H.R. 1571) that would count a patient\u2019s time in observation toward the 3-day hospital inpatient stay requirement for Medicare coverage of SNF care.\n\n\u201cObservation Status: Financial Implications for Medicare Beneficiaries\u201d Methodology\n\nAARP\u2019s Public Policy Institute examined a random 5% sample of hospital and skilled nursing facility claims from 2009 representing more than 2.1 million Medicare beneficiaries. In addition to being enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B, beneficiaries had also been placed under hospital observation sometime during 2009. Medicare Advantage subscribers were excluded from the sample.AARP\u2019s Public Policy Institute examined a random 5% sample of hospital and skilled nursing facility claims from 2009 representing more than 2.1 million Medicare beneficiaries.
