The racially-mixed congressional district, which includes the auto manufacturing center of Dearborn outside of Detroit, voted overwhelmingly for Obama in his successful 2012 re-election.\n\nDingell is the latest in a string of senior Democrats to leave Congress this year, including Senator John Rockefeller of West Virginia and Representative Henry Waxman of California.\n\n\"I find serving in the House to be obnoxious,\" he told the Detroit News. \"It's become very hard because of the acrimony and bitterness, both in Congress and in the streets.\"\n\nThat sour note caps a nearly life-long career that began in 1938, at age 12, when Dingell became a House page running errands for lawmakers.\n\n(Editing by Susan Heavey, Will Dunham and Andrew Hay)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author":
