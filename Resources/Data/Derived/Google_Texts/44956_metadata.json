And now he\u2019s do\u00ading it again.\n\nHe\u2019s prais\u00ading Obama for the fed\u00ader\u00adal aid in 2009 that helped Flor\u00adida bal\u00adance its budget and for spear\u00adhead\u00ading the BP oil-spill cleanup in 2010. He says that \u201cit\u2019s hard\u201d to think of policy dif\u00adfer\u00adences between him and Obama. He be\u00adlieves Obama has done \u201ca tre\u00admend\u00adous job\u201d as pres\u00adid\u00adent.\n\nAnd he\u2019ll even ex\u00adcuse the calam\u00aditious rol\u00adlout of the Obama\u00adcare web\u00adsite. \u201cYou can\u2019t con\u00adtrol everything,\u201d he said in an in\u00adter\u00adview with Na\u00adtion\u00adal Journ\u00adal last week. \u201cI un\u00adder\u00adstand that hav\u00ading been the chief ex\u00adec\u00adut\u00adive of a big state.\u201d\n\nThings are dif\u00adfer\u00adent now for Crist. When he hugged Obama in 2009, Crist was a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan gov\u00adernor about to be run over by the tea-party re\u00advolu\u00adtion. Now he\u2019s a Demo\u00adcrat, try\u00ading to win back the gov\u00adernor\u2019s of\u00adfice after a failed run for the Sen\u00adate.\n\nBut things are dif\u00adfer\u00adent for Obama, too. Demo\u00adcrats ran to\u00adward the new pres\u00adid\u00adent in 2009. Now some of them are run\u00adning away. While Crist is em\u00adbra\u00adcing Obama all over again, two oth\u00ader lead\u00ading Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic can\u00addid\u00adates for gov\u00adernor in big swing states won by Obama \u2014 Mary Burke of Wis\u00adcon\u00adsin and Allyson Schwartz of Pennsylvania \u2014 both de\u00adclined to join the pres\u00adid\u00adent when he vis\u00adited as part of a post-State of the Uni\u00adon swing late last month. Two Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic sen\u00adat\u00adors fa\u00adcing tough reelec\u00adtions, Mary Landrieu of Louisi\u00adana and Kay Hagan of North Car\u00ado\u00adlina, also skipped re\u00adcent ap\u00adpear\u00adances by Obama in their states, al\u00adthough Landrieu rode on Air Force One with the pres\u00adid\u00adent. Alaska Demo\u00adcrat Mark Be\u00adgich really spelled out his de\u00adsire for dis\u00adtance. \u201cI don\u2019t need him cam\u00adpaign\u00ading for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI need him to change some of his policies.\u201d\n\nNot Crist. \u201cI\u2019d be de\u00adlighted to\u201d cam\u00adpaign with him, he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of him. I\u2019m proud he\u2019s my friend.\u201d\n\nThere are few reas\u00adons why Crist may want to stay close to Obama. Flor\u00adida Demo\u00adcrats are eager to un\u00adseat Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Gov. Rick Scott, but some re\u00admain skep\u00adtic\u00adal of Crist, a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan-turned-in\u00adde\u00adpend\u00adent-turned-Demo\u00adcrat. Crist\u2019s loy\u00adalty to Obama tells Demo\u00adcrats he\u2019s one of them \u2014 a stamp of ap\u00adprov\u00adal that a lifelong Demo\u00adcrat wouldn\u2019t need. What\u2019s more, Crist is fre\u00adquently cri\u00adti\u00adcized for chan\u00adging his po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtions on is\u00adsues, in\u00adclud\u00ading abor\u00adtion, guns, and gay mar\u00adriage, and run\u00adning away from Obama would look like just an\u00adoth\u00ader flip-flop.\n\nRe\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are de\u00adterm\u00adined to make the midterm a ref\u00ader\u00aden\u00addum on the pres\u00adid\u00adent, so wheth\u00ader can\u00addid\u00adates ap\u00adpear with Obama or not, they\u2019re go\u00ading to be tagged as Obama Demo\u00adcrats. Crist fig\u00adures he might as well own it.\n\nThe oth\u00ader pos\u00adsib\u00adil\u00adity is that Crist\u2019s polit\u00adic\u00adal weath\u00ader vane is out of whack.\n\nBack in 2006, on the eve of his elec\u00adtion as gov\u00adernor, he de\u00adclined to ap\u00adpear at a North Flor\u00adida rally with an\u00adoth\u00ader un\u00adpop\u00adu\u00adlar pres\u00adid\u00adent, George W. Bush. \u201cYou chick\u00aden\u00adshit!\u201d Bush ad\u00adviser Karl Rove bel\u00adlowed at him, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to Crist\u2019s new mem\u00adoir. At that time, Bush\u2019s na\u00adtion\u00adal ap\u00adprov\u00adal was at 38 per\u00adcent. But Obama\u2019s num\u00adbers in Flor\u00adida are only slightly bet\u00adter, pegged at 42 per\u00adcent ap\u00adprov\u00adal and 53 per\u00adcent dis\u00adap\u00adprov\u00adal in the latest Quin\u00adnipi\u00adac Uni\u00adversity poll. He\u2019s un\u00adder\u00adwa\u00adter with wo\u00admen, men, in\u00adde\u00adpend\u00adents, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans, and white voters.\n\nNo won\u00adder Flor\u00adida Demo\u00adcrat Alex Sink, who\u2019s run\u00adning for Con\u00adgress in a spe\u00adcial elec\u00adtion, spent more time in her latest cam\u00adpaign ad talk\u00ading about fix\u00ading Obama\u00adcare than singing its praises. \u201cWe need to keep what\u2019s right and fix what\u2019s wrong,\u201d she says in the tele\u00advi\u00adsion spot. \u201cI\u2019ll work with Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans and Demo\u00adcrats for health care that\u2019s af\u00adford\u00adable and works for us.\u201d\n\nEven Obama re\u00adcog\u00adnizes he\u2019s ra\u00addio\u00adact\u00adive in some places these days, telling Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic sen\u00adat\u00adors in a closed-door meet\u00ading last week that he \u201cwould not be of\u00adfen\u00added\u201d if they pre\u00adferred to cam\u00adpaign without him.\n\nStill, Crist en\u00adthu\u00adsi\u00adast\u00adic\u00adally re\u00adcounts his de\u00adcision to ap\u00adpear with the pres\u00adid\u00adent at a town hall in Fort My\u00aders in 2009 when he was tout\u00ading his eco\u00adnom\u00adic-stim\u00adu\u00adlus plan. (\u201cHe hugged me and I hugged him, and that sent Marco Ru\u00adbio in\u00adto or\u00adbit, \u201d Crist re\u00adcalls, re\u00adfer\u00adring to his rival for the U.S. Sen\u00adate in 2010.) He\u2019s also happy to talk about his de\u00adcision as gov\u00adernor to ex\u00adtend early vot\u00ading hours to handle the long lines lead\u00ading in\u00adto Obama\u2019s elec\u00adtion in 2008. (\u201cIt\u2019s nev\u00ader been for me Right versus Left be\u00adcause of my par\u00adents,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s al\u00adways been right versus wrong.\u201d)\n\nDemo\u00adcrat\u00adic strategist Steve Schale, who helped Obama win Flor\u00adida in 2008 and 2012, is among a num\u00adber of Obama team mem\u00adbers work\u00ading for Crist, in\u00adclud\u00ading poll\u00adster John An\u00adza\u00adlone and cam\u00adpaign man\u00adager Jim Mess\u00adina. And Schale says Crist\u2019s long em\u00adbrace of the pres\u00adid\u00adent is just fine by him.\n\n\u201cFrankly,\u201d said Schale, \u201cit is re\u00adfresh\u00ading to see a politi\u00adcian not look at a poll first to de\u00adcide who their friends should be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "The once-and-maybe-future Florida governor says \u201cit\u2019s hard\u201d to think of a policy difference between him and the president \u2014 and he even excuses the Obamacare rollout.", "title": "Charlie Crist Hugs Barack Obama All Over Again", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/2014/02/09/charlie-crist-hugs-barack-obama-all-over-again", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2014/02/10/151508050.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"site": "@nationaljournal", "image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2014/02/10/151508050.jpg"}, "description": "The once-and-maybe-future Florida governor says \u201cit\u2019s hard\u201d to think of a policy difference between him and the president \u2014 and he even excuses the Obamacare rollout.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Charlie Crist Hugs Barack Obama All Over Again"}, "description": "The once-and-maybe-future Florida governor says \u201cit\u2019s hard\u201d to think of a policy difference between him and the president \u2014 and he even excuses the Obamacare rollout.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "When he hugged Obama in 2009, Crist was a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan gov\u00adernor about to be run over by the tea-party re\u00advolu\u00adtion.\nRe\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are de\u00adterm\u00adined to make the midterm a ref\u00ader\u00aden\u00addum on the pres\u00adid\u00adent, so wheth\u00ader can\u00addid\u00adates ap\u00adpear with Obama or not, they\u2019re go\u00ading to be tagged as Obama Demo\u00adcrats.\nCrist\u2019s loy\u00adalty to Obama tells Demo\u00adcrats he\u2019s one of them \u2014 a stamp of ap\u00adprov\u00adal that a lifelong Demo\u00adcrat wouldn\u2019t need.\nI\u2019m proud he\u2019s my friend.\u201dThere are few reas\u00adons why Crist may want to stay close to Obama.\nHe nearly des\u00adtroyed his polit\u00adic\u00adal ca\u00adreer five years ago by wrap\u00adping his arms around Barack Obama."}
