But hounded by scandals and facing a real challenge from John Bel Edwards, Vitter may have run out of luck.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidates\u2019 debate a week ago Tuesday night was just bitch slapping compared to the heavyweight pugilists\u2019 battle televised an hour earlier by Louisiana Public Broadcasting for the state\u2019s first debate in a gubernatorial runoff debate.\n\nIn the first of two debates leading up to the Louisiana gubernatorial runoff election to be held Nov. 21, State Rep. John Bel Edwards called his opponent, U.S. Senator David Vitter, \u201ca liar, a cheater, and a stealer and I don\u2019t tolerate that.\u201d\n\nVitter fired right back, telling his opponent, \u201cYou are completely disingenuous.\u201d\n\nSince then the campaign has gotten even uglier.\n\nEdwards is a Democrat, Vitter a Republican, and both are Catholics in a state with a strong evangelical presence\u2014and a state that thrives on politics as blood sport. The central issue in this election campaign is a 2007 prostitution scandal that Vitter thought he had put behind him.\n\nThis election has become the dirtiest slug fest since the 1991 \u201crace from hell\u201d when Edwin Edwards (no kin to John Bel), though trailed by corruption scandals, won a record fourth term, crushing David Duke, the former Klan leader and closet Nazi. Both men later went to prison. Duke for mail fraud, Edwards for extortion tied to casino licenses. Such are the vagaries of democracy in the Bayou State.\n\nThe pivotal question this year is whether Edwards\u2019s growing lead is a purely anti-Vitter phenomenon\u2014and whether the senator is capable of reversing it. Vitter does possess samurai-level skills in slash-attack politics.\n\nBut a November 12 University of New Orleans (UNO) poll has Edwards at 54 percent, with a 22 point lead, gaining two points since the Tuesday debate.\n\nA larger question looms: If the margin holds, does the Edwards surge signal a sputtering of the Republican Southern strategy that exploits racial division by demonizing President Obama?\n\nEither way, if Edwards wins big, you can bet the car that Hillary Rodham Clinton will try to make him her new best friend.\n\nA lawyer and West Point graduate who frequently cites the military academy\u2019s honor code and touts himself as \u201cpro-life and pro-gun,\u201d Edwards is a blue dog Democrat\u2014one of the last of the centrist-conservative Democrats, blue dogs being an endangered species in Congress and nearly extinct in statewide offices across the beef red South. But there is nothing cookie-cutter about Edwards\u2019s views: Since taking his seat in the state legislature in 2006 and particularly since 2012, when he became state House minority leader, Edwards has spearheaded the opposition to Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s deep cuts to higher education and his refusal to take Medicaid funds under Obamacare\u2014to no avail.\n\nA Harvard graduate and Rhodes Scholar, Vitter got his start as a state house member in 1992, winning the suburban district outside New Orleans previously held by David Duke. He positioned himself as a contrarian, pushed through a term limits bill, and waged a particularly aggressive campaign against former Republican Gov. Dave Treen to win a 1999 special election to the U.S. House. In 2004 he was elected to the Senate, and reelected in 2011. A typical conservative on abortion, gun rights, opposition to the Affordable Care Act and All Things Obama, Vitter became the GOP\u2019s point man in Louisiana thanks to his enormous fundraising skills and his knack for engineering a Republican majority in the legislature and driving Democrats out of statewide offices. Currently Louisiana has not a single Democrat holding a statewide office.\n\nBut this year Vitter has been wounded by a video interview that an alleged prostitute of years past gave to the American Zombie blog of local muckraker Jason Brad Berry. (He and I are not related, nor do we work together.) Several newspapers have reported that some of Wendy Cortez Ellis\u2019s statements in the Zombie interview are inconsistent with what she said in interviews years before. But no one in the mainstream media has looked closely at those alleged discrepancies, nor in any depth at Vitter\u2019s past entanglement in a separate scandal, in Washington, when his name surfaced as a customer of the escort service run by Deborah Jean Palfrey, the \u201cD.C. Madam,\u201d who committed suicide in 2008 after a federal money-laundering conviction. Having won reelection to the Senate after the scandals, Vitter presumably thought he had laid those matters to rest.\n\nEdwards ran a TV ad during the recent LSU-Alabama football game, claiming that Vitter missed a key vote on a veterans\u2019 issue to take a call from Palfrey. Vitter responded on two levels. He has run ads showing him and his family at the dinner table, with a voice-under stressing his personal redemption and forgiveness of his wife. His other ads have attacked Edwards as being a liberal ally of President Obama. Vitter\u2019s new ads defending him on the prostitution accusations are consistent with his press conference in 2007, saying that he had committed \u201ca very serious sin,\u201d which he and his wife privately resolved. And Wendy Vitter, a New Orleans lawyer, still campaigns for her husband and calls him \u201cmy best friend.\u201d\n\nBut media coverage and the Edwards ad-buys resuscitating the old scandals have jolted Vitter\u2019s popularity, particularly among Republicans.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Although he now lives in Montana, Strother visits Louisiana often and still closely follows the state\u2019s politics. Strother, a Democrat, predicted before the runoff in a background memo to friends (used here with permission) that the election would \u201cturn into a referendum on Obama. It doesn\u2019t matter that Edwards has never even met Obama\u2026 Remember, race determines most elections in the South. A Democrat can seldom win more than 20 percent of the white vote in any Deep South state.\u201d\n\nAnd, according to the UNO poll, Edwards had 42 percent of the white vote with two days to go before the election.\n\nAnd despite little backing from the Democratic National Committee, Edwards led the open primary against three GOP candidates with 40 percent of the vote. Vitter came in second at 23 percent.\n\nVitter has the backing of industry and big business groups. Edwards\u2019s most important endorsement came from the Louisiana Sheriffs Association, a powerhouse in statewide elections. Sheriffs in the larger towns or cities have sizable staffs to run the parish courthouses; they maintain campaign organizations and are not restricted by term limits.\n\nIt also helps Edwards, 49, that his brother, Daniel, 47, is Tangipahoa Parish sheriff\u2014a fourth-generation sheriff in a sprawling family of lawyers, politicians, and law enforcement officials with deep Louisiana roots.\n\nTangipahoa is a heavily rural civil parish whose seat, the town of Amite (population 4,141) is 82 miles north of New Orleans. Edwards\u2019s law firm is in Amite; he lives in nearby Roseland (population 1,165). For much of the last century, the parish, which is 30 percent African-American, was known as \u201cBloody Tangipahoa,\u201d with a history of lawlessness that included a gruesome chapter involving the Ku Klux Klan. That stigma changed under Sheriff Frank Edwards, John Bel\u2019s father.\n\n\u201cFrank Edwards was one of the first sheriffs that hired blacks,\u201d says Donald Bell, the African-American pastor of New Life Outreach Ministries in the town of Hammond.\n\n\u201cFrank was balanced. Everybody loved him. John Bel had good training from his daddy. I was close to Frank. He lived and died politics. If Frank told you, \u2018Jerry can\u2019t beat John,\u2019 you could bet that Jerry wasn\u2019t gonna beat John. And Frank would give you two, three reasons why. He was a good Catholic guy. They were committed, just like John Bel\u2014he doesn\u2019t miss Mass. John Bel is a people person, down to earth, what you see is what you get.\u201d\n\nThe pastor refers to a monthly prayer breakfast that Sheriff Daniel Edwards, the candidate\u2019s brother, started 12 years ago. \u201cEvery month we go to a different church. Everyone who has questions or wants to talk, they do. We go to a white Baptist church, the Presbyterians, we go all over Tangipahoa Parish. In these meetings they don\u2019t see white or black, Republican or Democrat. They try to get everyone unified, in one accord.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people might say the Edwards have a political a monopoly,\u201d he continues, warming to his topic. \u201cBut they are well liked. I\u2019m 55 and I\u2019ve been pastoring 25 years. If I had something in my church, John Bel would come be a part of the service, not just mine but every church in Tangipahoa. He\u2019s a communicator. He got along with the NAACP and the school board. When he first decided to run it was a majority black district, drawn up for a black. Because of him being well liked, he won hands down.\u201d\n\nEven in a state famous for its political dynasties, the Edwards clan takes a back seat to no one. Sheriff Edwards\u2019s wife, Blair Downing Edwards, is a juvenile court judge in Tangipahoa. And Frank Edwards III is police chief in the town of Independence, which also lies inside the parish. And the family has some of the deepest roots in the state.\n\n\u201cMy great-great-great-great grandfather, Daniel Edwards, fought in the Battle of New Orleans in 1814 alongside Andrew Jackson,\u201d says Sheriff Daniel Edwards, who played catcher on the LSU baseball team before he graduated from Loyola Law School and then got into into politics and law enforcement. \u201cJackson gave him a sword. My cousin Andrew Edwards in Pontchatoula has the sword. The first Daniel served in the legislature of what was then the Republic of West Florida. That\u2019s where the term Florida Parishes originated with respect to Louisiana. Another ancestor, Morgan Edwards, settled in Madisonville [a nearby town bordering Lake Pontchartrain.] I have a brother named Morgan. My great great grandfather was Millard Filmore Edwards, sheriff in 1898. He had a son Frank Edwards, who was sheriff from 1928-48\u2014my grandfather. He also served in the Louisiana Senate. My dad was an only child. Frank M. Edwards Jr. served as sheriff from 1968-80. I was elected sheriff in 2003.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why he was still a Democrat, Daniel Edwards replied, \u201cIt\u2019s the party we better relate to. It\u2019s more inclusive. I\u2019m more of a fiscal conservative, but I think people who can\u2019t take care of themselves we owe some degree of help. I was born that way and still believe that way. We were all reared strongly in the Catholic faith. I am pro-life and pro-second amendment.\u201d\n\nThe hypocrisy and character issues that Edwards has used against Vitter are those on which Edwards will rise or fall come Saturday\u2019s election. But when you talk to people in his home parish, his appeal is more often linked to inclusivity, his religion, and about living amid people of different colors and creeds who coexist with some harmony in a downhome Southern way.\n\n\u201cTangipahoa is really a melting pot on the North Shore [of Lake Pontchartrain], a lot of Italians, African-Americans, whites, and we even have a community toward Livingston, outside my district, of Hungarians,\u201d says State Senator Ben Nevers, a veteran Democrat, who lives in the sawmill town of Bogalusa, and has long represented an area that is majority white. \u201cMost people want to vote for a person more than a party. What disappoints me most is that parties are trying to run the government, and I don\u2019t think that will work.\u201d\n\nNevers won his last election by 300 votes, \u201cthe closest I\u2019ve ever had and I\u2019ll be honest, I should have responded to mail outs linking me and the president. I\u2019ve never met Obama, never sent him money. I disagree with many of his positions but I support many others. It seems to be the only thing Republicans have to throw at you\u2014Obama. Republicans are throwing nothing but Obama at John Bel.\u201d\n\nIndeed, while Edwards blasted away at Vitter for dishonesty and lack of character, the senator fired back, just as Strother predicted, picturing Edwards as another version of Obama.\n\nBut try as he might, Vitter never landed a knockout punch, and in a post-debate poll, Edwards had extended his lead over Vitter by two points.\n\nWhat a difference a year makes.\n\nA year ago this month, Vitter stage-managed the U.S. Senate election of Baton Rouge Congressman Dr. Bill Cassidy over three-term incumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu. Cassidy avoided the press whenever possible, as Vitter has done until the final days of this election. Cassidy limited his debate appearances, as Vitter did in the first primary. Cassidy ran lurid TV ads showing Landrieu cheek to cheek with Obama, like Desdemona and Othello. On election night, Vitter took the stage with Cassidy, grabbing air time and stopping short of announcing for governor.\n\nSomewhere in the last 12 months, however, Vitter lost his mojo. And, apparently, his common sense.\n\n\u201cVitter may be forgiven for his past \u2018sins,\u2019 but he is still mean-spirited, vindictive, and threatening to people,\u201d publisher McCollister of the Greater Baton Rouge Business Report opined as the senator ran harsh ads against his GOP opponents in the open primary, slamming Lt. Governor Jay Dardenne, a moderate Republican, and Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, a right-wing Cajun. Now Angelle is angry at Vitter and Dardenne has endorsed Edwards, a move that offended certain of Republican die-hards.\n\n\u201cThe behavior of [Dardenne] endorsing Edwards is akin to that of a jilted man firing indiscriminately at his wife\u2019s car, mindless of the collateral harm and injury to many innocent people,\u201d fumed Peter Egan, chairman of the Republican Party in St. Tammany Parish, in a wondrous metaphor on political betrayal. St. Tammany (named with dripping irony for Tammany Hall in New York) is a GOP stronghold on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain.\n\nBut such signs of disarray offer no guarantee of easy victory for Edwards. Republicans are much better at turning out their vote, and, as Ray Strother brooded in his memo, \u201cunless Vitter is actually in jail, the hate vote will go to him. In fact, in jail he would still get that vote. Hate is stronger than all the damage that has been done to Louisiana in the past eight years under Bobby Jindal.\u201d\n\nBut Strother ignores the surpassing irony of this political season: after the hookers, Bobby Jindal has been David Vitter\u2019s most severe liability.\n\nThe least guarded secret in Louisiana politics is how much Jindal and Vitter, both Republicans, Ivy Leaguers, and Rhodes scholars, detest each other. Vitter timed his 2007 mea culpa press conference with his wife Wendy on the same day Jindal announced for governor. Guess who got the big coverage?\n\nNow the tables have turned on Vitter: the financial quagmire that Jindal\u2014who this week officially abandoned his campaign for the presidency\u2014created in his eight years as governor is so vast that while Republicans in other states are all still busy running against Obama, no matter who their real opponents are, Vitter is left in the peculiar position of running not merely against Edwards or Obama but \u201cagainst Baton Rouge,\u201d as the senator keeps saying. That is not an easy swallow for Republicans who hold a legislative majority. GOP Senate President John Alario recently attended a fundraising lunch for Edwards at a French Quarter restaurant, and when asked why, quipped that he liked good food.\n\nThe new governor\u2019s first order of business in 2016 will be a special legislative session to confront the budget crash. Jindal imposed draconian cuts on higher education to offset the skyrocketing health care costs created by his expensive alternative to Obamacare: UNO, once a rising regional research hub, lost 183 professors\u201439 percent of its full-time faculty. Some 290,000 people in the state have no health coverage, because Jindal refused Medicaid funds under Obamacare on ideological grounds. Edwards has said he will accept the funds, which would at least be a first step in stanching the hemorrhaging state budget.\n\nWhile Vitter tries to tar Edwards with Obama, Edwards has a stronger guilt-by-association card in pairing Vitter with Jindal, the most unpopular governor in Louisiana history and easily its worst, at least since 1939 when Dick Leche became the first governor in Louisiana to be sent to prison. To be sure, Jindal faces no indictment, other than in a political sense: even Republicans are now bailing on Vitter.\n\nSo are center-conservative blue dog Democrats like Ben Nevers, the state senator allied with Edwards. \u201cWe have a lot of poor people in Louisiana who deserve health care and there should be some provision for them when they can\u2019t afford insurance,\u201d Nevers says. \u201cI supported the expansion of Affordable Care Act in this state. I filed bills for three years giving Jindal the latitude to submit a waiver [to secure Medicaid funds]. He never even made application. We have a quarter of a million people or more in our state without health care\u2026 The Obama attacks are a racial strategy. I don\u2019t know what percentage to put on it, but the race issue is alive in Louisiana. People play that card, and it\u2019s wrong. We need to get past that and build up.\u201d\n\nWhoever wins on Saturday faces a staggering deficit created by Jindal. When he took office in 2007, he inherited a $900 million budget surplus from his Democratic predecessor, Kathleen Blanco. But after privatizing six Louisiana public health care hospitals (a system linked to medical school education and begun under Gov. Huey Long during the Depression), Jindal drove the state budget into a \u201cstructural deficit\u201d between $800 million and $1.6 billion, according to Moody\u2019s Investors.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s next governor must repair the huge financial damage caused by Jindal in creating a Republican experimental laboratory on health care.\n\nAs Vitter reels from blowback against Jindal, after both gained power and popularity in demonizing Obama, there is resonance in Dante\u2019s words from The Inferno: \u201cEach sinner swathes himself in his own torment.\u201d\n\nAlthough John Bel Edwards has fought Vitter with a bare-knuckle intensity which the senator has not previously encountered, those who know Edwards well see a compassion, in health care and other Democratic issues, rooted in his upbringing.\n\n\u201cThose kids in the Edwards family could have gone to any private, all-white high school in this state, but they chose to go to Amite High, a public school,\u201d says Louis Nick Joseph, an African-American council member of Tangipahoa.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli, David Vitter, Politics-Election, Louisiana, U.S. News,", "publicationDate": 201511200600, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "U.S. Senator David Vitter has led a charmed life in Louisiana politics.
