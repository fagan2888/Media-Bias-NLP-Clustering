The annual wave of Miller moths is right around the corner — and will be especially noticeable this year.

The number of moths across northeastern Colorado will be “well above average” according to predictions from Colorado State University experts.

The predictions are based on “unusually abundant” numbers of army cutworms across the northeastern plains that already caused some problems for farmers.

The report, completed in late April notes, that this year’s moisture and plenty of flowering plants created good conditions for the moths during their larvae cycle.

The experts predict the moths will start their migration through the northern Front Range at the end of May or early June.

Miller moths do not reproduce or lay eggs during their migration, but can be a nuisance as they find their way into homes.

Certain flowering plants, especially lilacs, cherries, spirea and cotoneaster may attract larger numbers of moths to a certain area.

To help keep the pesky fliers away, experts suggest sealing openings and cracks around windows and doors, and reducing lighting at night or switching out lights for non-attractive yellow lights.

Once they are in the home, there’s not much to do but to try to “swat or vacuum them.” One creative trap suggestion provided by CSU’s fact sheet is to — carefully — suspend a light bulb over a bucket partially filled with soapy water.

People living in the southeastern part of the state will have less to worry about as drought conditions there are expected to produce fewer moths.
