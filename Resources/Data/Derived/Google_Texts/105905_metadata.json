Chris Christie\u2019s presidential plans have been harmed by revelations that his henchmen took revenge on Democrats by causing traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge.\n\nIt is far too early to tell, but based on current information it is fairly easy to shift perspective and see how this could accelerate rather than impede his political career.\n\nUntil recently, conventional wisdom held that Christie\u2019s major problem lay in winning the GOP nomination over objections from conservative Tea Party types who felt he was too much of a centrist, prone to behaviors like collaborating with President Obama, aka the Great Satan.\n\nAs I understand this faction, they have two objections to Republican incumbents \u2013 there is a small number who won\u2019t even talk the talk, but there\u2019s a larger faction who are unwilling to walk the walk by disrupting the go-along-to-get-along Washington culture.\n\nWhich is to say there are many who say the Federal government spends too much, but few willing to close it down \u2013 or even have it default \u2013 as part of the effort to drive spending down. Similarly, while many Republicans hate Obamacare, only Sen. Ted Cruz was willing to stage a filibuster in an effort to force attention to the issue. That behavior cemented his relationship with the Tea Party.\n\nGov. Christie\u2019s performance was not dissimilar. He \u2013 or his agents \u2013 showed the Democrats that he was not unwilling to disrupt things if they were unwilling to give him what he wanted, in this case an endorsement.\n\nCoupled with his intemperate attacks on the teachers union, this suggests a personality who\u2019s not unwilling to ruffle feathers, unlike the smooth Washington operators who tend to say they hold their sworn enemies \u201cin minimum high regard.\u201d\n\nSo it would appear that what\u2019s happened in New Jersey could actually strengthen the Christie brand within the most conservative wing of the Republican Party that\u2019s generally seen as having a veto in candidate selection. Unless they let Christie through the primaries, he\u2019ll never get a chance to test the theory that he could win centrist Democrats in a general election, as he has in New Jersey.\n\nSpeculating about the 2016 presidential race now is little more than a series of nested fantasies, but the chattering class generally finds such fact-free debates irresistible. In that spirit, there\u2019s talk about how New Jersey traffic will impact Christie\u2019s chances of winning the White House.\n\nThere, too, today\u2019s fuss may prove marginally helpful, allowing voters to decide now whether he\u2019s a forceful leader or a bully. Stories between the 2016 convention and election about a conspiracy to stall traffic could prove quite damaging. Airing the issues now minimizes the impact they\u2019ll have then\n\nFor 16 years, Jim Jaffe worked for House Democrats who served on the Ways and Means Committee, apprenticing with Representatives Green, Gibbons and Gephardt before working for Chairman Dan Rostenkowski.
