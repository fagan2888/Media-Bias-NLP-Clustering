WICKENBURG, Ariz. (AP) - Several communities northwest of Phoenix were trying to put themselves back together Sunday after monsoon storms flooded streets and bent steel utility poles like aluminum cans.

The National Weather Service says between 1 and 4 inches of rain fell in and around Wickenburg Saturday afternoon in a 90-minute period.

The nearby cities of Wittman and Morristown were also battered.

Rain flooded at least two washes in Wickenburg, sending floodwaters into neighborhoods.

Some homes were flooded but there have been no reports of injuries. Arizona Public Service says more than 2,000 customers lost power.

As of Sunday, about 100 were still waiting for service to be restored.

APS says crews are working nonstop to replace more than 40 power poles.

Wickenburg is about 65 miles away northwest of Phoenix.
