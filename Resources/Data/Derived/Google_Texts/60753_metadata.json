Cook begins his new duties on April 21.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity to come home and do something in the county that not only I\u2019ve lived in my whole life, but that I\u2019m raising my family in,\u201d Cook said. \u201cRocking Horse has an incredible opportunity to do even more good in the community.\u201d\n\nCook, a Springfield native, graduated from Kenton Ridge High School in 1996 and holds both Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees from Wright State University. He served in several roles during his 12 years at the Miami County health district, including assistant health commissioner and director of emergency preparedness and response.\n\nThe Rocking Horse Center, 651 S. Limestone St., opened in 1999 to provide medical care to underserved children and had approximately 56,000 visits last year. Rocking Horse has expanded to four locations, where it serves 13,500 people of all ages and recently became a Federally Qualified Health Center.\n\nThe center opened a $7.9 million expansion at its South Limestone location last April.\n\nThe board of directors chose Cook after an \u201cextensive\u201d search for a new CEO, according to a press release.\n\n\u201cWe are fortunate to have found in Chris a leader with experience at growing and moving an organization forward, and someone who has deep roots in Clark County,\u201d said Rob Baker, the board\u2019s president. \u201cHis local ties will not only accentuate our many collaborative ventures, they will help him hit the ground running on our important strategic initiatives.\u201d\n\nThe appointment will strengthen the relationship between Rocking Horse and the Clark County Combined Health District, said Clark County Combined Health District commissioner Charles Patterson. They worked together during Cook\u2019s tenure in Miami County.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an enthusiastic, energetic and intelligent person who luckily for us already lives in Clark County,\u201d Patterson said.\n\nCook has several goals in the near future at Rocking Horse, including the opening of a dental clinic as well as the possibility of helping the medically underserved in other parts of the community.\n\n\u201cThose are some of the big things right off the bat,\u201d Cook said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Rocking Horse Community Health Center has hired Miami County Health Commissioner Chris Cook as its new CEO, the board of directors announced Wednesday.", "og": {"url": "http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/rocking-horse-hires-new-ceo/nfHdb/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/03/20/b0/fb/SNS_ChrisCook.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Rocking Horse Community Health Center has hired Miami County Health Commissioner Chris Cook as its new CEO, the board of directors announced Wednesday.", "title": "Rocking Horse hires new CEO"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2014/03/20/b0/fb/SNS_ChrisCook.jpg", "description": "The Rocking Horse Community Health Center has hired Miami County Health Commissioner Chris Cook as its new CEO, the board of directors announced Wednesday.", "site": "@springfieldnews", "card": "summary", "title": "Rocking Horse hires new CEO"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "springfieldnewssun", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/rocking-horse-hires-new-ceo/nfHdb/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2400028/news/news/rocking-horse-hires-new-ceo/nfHdb/", "keywords": "snsnewsletter,SNShomepage,local,community", "google-site-verification": "8vJEEijbdFqCz5Jlhv2SIUUb093Tw1ZWl6RD1VU7ZsU", "news_keywords": "snsnewsletter,SNShomepage,local,community"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce539\"", "article_summary": "By Michael CooperStaff WriterThe Rocking Horse Community Health Center has hired Miami County Health Commissioner Chris Cook as its new CEO, the board of directors announced Wednesday.\nThe Rocking Horse Center, 651 S.
