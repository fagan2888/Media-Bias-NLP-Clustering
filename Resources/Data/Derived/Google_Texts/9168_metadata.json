( Reuters/Jonathan Bachman )\n\nJoin us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.\n\nThe American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) announced Tuesday it has launched a new Web strategy to challenge Obamacare and the individual mandate.\n\nThe ACLJ, which already is challenging the HHS mandate in federal court, has launched ICantEnroll.com and is encouraging Americans to add their names to a growing chorus of protest to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe want to send a very strong message to the Obama administration that Americans are saying 'Enough is enough' when it comes to Obamacare,\u201d explains Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the ACLJ. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing a new legal strategy to stop the Obama administration from penalizing Americans who fail to sign up for a program that doesn't work. Obamacare is failing. The health care website doesn\u2019t work. The costs are too high. And the individual mandate is looming. With this new campaign, we are giving Americans an opportunity to voice their concerns.\u201d\n\nThe launch of ICantEnroll.com to protest Obamacare comes as HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is scheduled to testify before a House committee next week.\n\n\u201cWe expect to hear from thousands of dissatisfied Americans through our new website,\u201d Sekulow adds. \u201cAnd we will let Congress know about the feedback we receive prior to next week\u2019s hearing. We urge Congress to aggressively investigate this debacle\u2014the rollout of Obamacare. The American people deserve answers from the Obama administration, and the American people deserve accountability.\u201d\n\nSekulow also says the ACLJ is exploring a litigation strategy that will seek to protect Americans from penalties imposed by the Obama administration for a product Americans can\u2019t even obtain.\n\nDraw closer to God.
