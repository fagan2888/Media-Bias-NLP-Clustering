The groups argue the requirement infringes on religious liberty.\n\nSTORY: HHS issues proposed contraception coverage rule\n\nSTORY: Catholic university files 2nd suit against health care act\n\nThe mandate has attracted dozens of similar lawsuits.\n\nThis latest filing, targeting the Department of Health and Human Services, was brought by GuideStone Financial Resources, the Dallas-based provider of health benefits to Southern Baptist churches.\n\nGuideStone also provides benefits to more than 100 non-profit ministries. Those include Oklahoma City-based Reaching Souls International and Truett-McConnell College in Cleveland, Ga., two organizations that signed on to the lawsuit in order to represent the types of ministries expected to join in the class action, said Rod Miller, an attorney for GuideStone.\n\n\u201cWe know the other ministry organizations that we serve share the same views on the sanctity of life.\u201d Rod Miller, attorney for GuideStone Financial Resources\n\nIn the face of the criticism, the government created an exemption to its rule for churches and some church auxiliaries so they would not have to pay for contraception.\n\nBut religious organizations such as those suing still fell under the mandate based on the federal tax code, and their leaders are objecting to the regulations on the grounds that they violate religious freedom, Miller said.\n\n\"We know the other ministry organizations that we serve share the same views on the sanctity of life,\" he said.\n\nThe lawsuit asks for an injunction to block the mandate, which is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in Oklahoma by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and Locke Lord LLP, is the 74th against the government over its mandate, the groups said.\n\nEarlier this year, the Catholic Diocese of Nashville sued over the same requirements, arguing that all Catholic groups should be exempt. The case was dismissed, and after briefly contesting the ruling, the diocese withdrew its appeal in April.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1aH3qLu", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "NASHVILLE -- Three non-profit religious organizations, including a division of the Nashville-based Southern Baptist Convention, are suing the federal government over a controversial contraceptives regulation.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "NASHVILLE -- Three non-profit religious organizations, including a division of the Nashville-based Southern Baptist Convention, are suing the federal government over a controversial contraceptives regulation.", "title": "Southern Baptists fight contraception regulation", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/14/southern-baptists-contraception-health-law/2984927/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NASHVILLE -- Three non-profit religious organizations, including a division of the Nashville-based Southern Baptist Convention, are suing the federal government over a controversial contraceptives regulation.", "title": "Southern Baptists fight contraception regulation", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b4868a63aa64247a4f8810963591893c38fca36a/c=302-0-1501-1200&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/10/14/1381807958000-Southern-Baptists-health-care-101413.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Affordable Care Act", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Affordable Care Act", "title": "Southern Baptists fight contraception regulation", "author": "Tony Gonzalez", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/nation", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/10b95c5a0cc4841dfe85e0d5152886fc37ea0def/c=450-0-1350-1200/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/10/14/1381807958000-Southern-Baptists-health-care-101413.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5be9e152d0709e8bde6c762f3fba39540fc3467c/c=302-0-1501-1200/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/10/14/1381807958000-Southern-Baptists-health-care-101413.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f530ed7f8d6af32d67bd700d2cab6210edb4aa66/c=104-0-1699-1200/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/10/14/1381807958000-Southern-Baptists-health-care-101413.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e828558a84f6c89d2f7d8ccbdcc4cb9de736e3bc/c=0-93-1800-1109&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/10/14/1381807958000-Southern-Baptists-health-care-101413.jpg", "publishtime": "2013-10-14T23:36:41-04:00", "shorthed": "Southern Baptists fight contraception regulation", "articleid": 2984927, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2ff8313530f2ee0a19b3dcd69c1dbf6583bf0a22/c=0-93-1800-1109/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/10/14/1381807958000-Southern-Baptists-health-care-101413.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2965de97d4aba9947530f005e8e400a2e1ebc9d4/c=550-0-1220-1200/local/-/media/USATODAY/test/2013/10/14/1381807958000-Southern-Baptists-health-care-101413.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, contraception rule,"}, "article_summary": "STORY: HHS issues proposed contraception coverage ruleSTORY: Catholic university files 2nd suit against health care actThe mandate has attracted dozens of similar lawsuits.\nOn Monday, Oct. 14, 2013, a division of the Southern Baptist Convention said it is suing the federal government over the contraceptives regulation of the Affordable Care Act.\nThree non-profit religious groups are suing the federal government over mandate in health law.\nIn this Dec. 7, 2011, file photo, the headquarters of the Southern Baptist Convention is shown in Nashville.\nThis latest filing, targeting the Department of Health and Human Services, was brought by GuideStone Financial Resources, the Dallas-based provider of health benefits to Southern Baptist churches."}
