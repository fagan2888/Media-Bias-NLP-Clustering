Nancy Pelosi emerged into the sunlight April 1 to applaud a rush of sign-ups for Obamacare, and immediately described it as the long-sought goal of Gen. George Washington and the nation\u2019s Founding Fathers in 1787.\n\n\u201cIt is really so heart warming for those of us who worked so hard [to make sure] many more people in our country would have access to healthcare,\u201d she told reporters at the stakeout position just outside the West Wing portico.\n\n\u201cThere are those critics, bumps in the road, but they\u2019ve only been turbulence. They have not been an obstacle to the American people having healthier life that our that our founders wanted for them,\u201d she said.\n\nThose founders wanted \u201clife \u2014 a healthier life \u2014 liberty and the freedom to pursue their happiness, not [be] job-locked, but having benefits that having health-care policies that are portable, they could be self-employed, be a photographer \u2014 they could start their own business, they could change jobs, they could reach their aspirations,\u201d she declared.\n\n\u201cAnd isn\u2019t that a wonderful thing for a society and for an economy?\u201d she added.\n\nIn contrast, the GOP\u2019s House leader, Speaker John Boehner, called for the law\u2019s repeal.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s health care law continues to wreak havoc on American families, small businesses and our economy, and as I\u2019ve said many times, the problem was never just about the website \u2013 it\u2019s the whole law,\u201d he said in a March 31 statement.\n\n\u201cMillions of Americans are seeing their premiums rise, not the lower prices the president promised. Many small businesses are afraid to hire new workers, instead cutting hours and dropping health coverage for existing employees. Many Americans can no longer see their family doctor, despite the pledge no one would lose access to their physician. Seniors are feeling the impact, losing their Medicare Advantage plans the president promised they could keep. And taxpayers are being forced to pick up an unaffordable tab,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHouse Republicans will continue to work to repeal this law and protect families and small businesses from its harmful consequences,\u201d he added.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "George Washington apparently wanted gov't funded contraceptives", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Democratic leader Rep.
