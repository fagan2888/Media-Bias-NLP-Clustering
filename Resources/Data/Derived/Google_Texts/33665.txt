If you're wondering when Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) will wrap up his marathon non-filibuster floor speech in opposition to funding the Affordable Care Act, sometime before 1 p.m. EDT seems like a good bet. According to RushLimbaugh.com, that's when the Texas senator will appear on Rush Limbaugh's radio program.

If you were thinking Sen. Ted Cruz (R-2016) was looking awfully eager to wrap that not-filibuster up at noon, you might be right. Sen. Reid kept reminding him that he could continue his speech for another hourâ€”but defunding Obamacare, while important, isn't nearly as important as the very important meeting Cruz had lined up beforehand. The two are expected to share their tips on how to get paid to talk for long stretches of time without saying or accomplishing anything in particular.

Really, though: Rush Limbaugh? That was the best you could do, Cruz?
