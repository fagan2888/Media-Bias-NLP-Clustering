Kilduff at a June 4, event. Kevin Hagen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nIn one of the final acts of his 45-year career with the FDNY, Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano presided over a departmental promotion ceremony in Brooklyn on Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cToday is a day to reflect on everything you\u2019ve done to get to this point,\u201d Mr. Cassano said in a speech. \u201cLook at those banners hanging up from the rafters. I\u2019ve been a member of that family for the better part of my life.\u201d\n\nIn May, Mayor Bill de Blasio appointed former FDNY Chief of Department Daniel Nigro to replace Mr. Cassano, a holdover from former Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s administration.\n\nMr. Cassano looked back at the most trying time in the FDNY\u2019s recent memory: the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cAlmost 13 years ago, we were tested like never before. On one unimaginable morning, we lost 343 of the bravest people ever to wear an FDNY uniform. In fact, any uniform. They were our mentors, our friends, and our families. So many remarkable leaders in our department were killed that day.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Cassano sat back down on the dais, he was received with a standing ovation. As the applause continued, he stood briefly, saluted, and sat again.\n\nThe two top promotions of the day were Thomas E. McKavanagh, who became Deputy Assistant Chief in charge of the Bureau of Fire Prevention, and James C. Hodgens, promoted to Deputy Assistant Chief in charge of the Fire Academy.\n\nAlso promoted were 18 new Battalion Chiefs, 40 Captains, and 64 Lieutenants. According to the FDNY, the newly promoted officers have 1,900 years of experience with the FDNY among them.\n\nSpeaking to the press afterward, Mr. Cassano said he is most proud of the rebuilding of the Department after the attacks.\n\n\u201cWe sent our staff chiefs to management school because we were great at fighting fires, but we needed some of our management skills to be honed up, because now you have to rebuild from the bottom up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared for any event that we face,\u201d Cassano said. \u201cHurricane Sandy was a devastating storm that hit every borough in the city, and the department stepped up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the greatest job in the world,\u201d Mr. Cassano said.\n\nCassano said he is pleased with the progress being made on racial diversity in the department, noting that 47% of the recently graduated class of probational officers are people of color.\n\nIn March, the city agreed to pay $98 million in back pay and benefits in a settlement to a long-running lawsuit that charged the Fire Department of New York discriminated against minority applicants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re diversifying,\u201d Cassano said. \u201cEventually, when they get eligible to take an exam, that\u2019s what our promotional classes will look like. It\u2019s just going to take some time to get into the ranks. But we\u2019re dedicated to it. I\u2019ve led that fight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "In one of the final acts of his 45-year career with the FDNY, Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano presided over a departmental promotion ceremony in Brooklyn on Thursday morning.", "title": "FDNY Commissioner Presides Over Final Promotion Ceremony", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/06/05/fdny-commissioner-presides-over-final-promotion-ceremony/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NY-DA739_WATCH__P_20140604185237.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "FDNY Commissioner Presides Over Final Promotion Ceremony", "description": "In one of the final acts of his 45-year career with the FDNY, Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano presided over a departmental promotion ceremony in Brooklyn on Thursday morning.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Nick Pinto", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "In one of the final acts of his 45-year career with the FDNY, Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano presided over a departmental promotion ceremony in Brooklyn on Thursday morning.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-05T19:29:56-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/06/05/fdny-commissioner-presides-over-final-promotion-ceremony/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-20758", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "In one of the final acts of his 45-year career with the FDNY, Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano presided over a departmental promotion ceremony in Brooklyn on Thursday morning.", "title": "FDNY Commissioner Presides Over Final Promotion Ceremony", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/06/05/fdny-commissioner-presides-over-final-promotion-ceremony/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NY-DA739_WATCH__P_20140604185237.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-20758", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-05T19:59:31-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5db\"", "article_summary": "New York City Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano, Mayor Bill de Blasio and FDNY Chief of Department Edward S.
