[WATCH] JibJab’s look back at the year that was 2013

The geniuses behind JibJab – the California-based brothers behind such classic political videos as “This Land is Your Land” and “Time for Some Campaignin’,” are back with their latest end-of-the-year wrap up video for 2013.

Nearly every major political story – from “crack smoking mayors to Carlos Danger” – made the cut of “What a Year,” including the botched launch of Obamacare, sequestration and the government shutdown, and the National Security Agency wiretapping scandal.

On the pop culture side, the video made note of the arrivals of the Royal Baby and Kimye’s North West, the twerking nightmare that was Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke’s 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance, Sharknado and the “What does the Fox say?” phenomenon.

As always, Jib Jab paid homage to those we lost in 2013, including former South African leader Nelson Mandela, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and “Sopranos” actor James Gandolfini.

While JibJab is primarily known for its satirical political and pop culture videos, one can also make e-cards for friends and family, video spoofs of classic movies and star in a music video for classics like “The Monster Mash” or “Gagnam Style.” The company also owns a website – Storybots – designed specifically for kids and families.
