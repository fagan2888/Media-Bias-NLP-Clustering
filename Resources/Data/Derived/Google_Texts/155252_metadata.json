Let me assure you \u2014 it\u2019s going to be an issue in November. From the backward policies discussed in the GOP debate to political temper tantrums here in Virginia, the GOP is burning any bridge it might have to women voters.\n\nIn the recent GOP debate, we saw a party hyper-focused on policies that shame and blame women. Nearly all GOP presidential candidates favor taking away the right to choose, and many do not think there should be exceptions for rape and incest survivors. Some even believe there should be no exceptions when the life of the mother is in danger.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the prime-time players with bad ideas: Even folks who shared the pre-debate stage with Jim Gilmore had anti-women and -families policies to offer.\n\nCarly Fiorina has announced she opposes maternity leave. She shares that position with main-stage candidates like Chris Christie, who opposed family medical leave, and Scott Walker, who tried to nullify a statewide paid sick leave requirement.\n\nInstead of supporting policies that actually help women and families get ahead, Republicans suggest Americans \u201cwork longer hours\u201d and want you to believe that income inequality can be fixed by \u201cworking harder and selling more things.\u201d Of course, if all else fails, there\u2019s always Jeb Bush\u2019s solution: \u201cFind a husband.\u201d\n\nQuite frankly, after a night like that, was anyone surprised when Donald Trump made openly sexist attacks on moderator Megyn Kelly?\n\nUnfortunately, what we saw on the debate stage is echoed throughout Virginia. Here at home, Bill Howell and Tommy Norment embarked upon a crusade to fire a female Supreme Court justice, one with impeccable qualifications and a high-powered career that included presiding over the D.C. sniper trial.\n\nNothing says \u201cwe value women and their opinions\u201d like firing an extremely qualified woman and replacing her with a man.\n\nBut there\u2019s more on the GOP agenda than trying to fire a female judge. While Democrats are pushing forward-looking policies that respect women and will help them get ahead, Republicans\u2019 policies of the past would leave women behind.\n\nVirginia Democrats have strong candidates this fall who support real policies for women and families, not outdated and distracting attacks.\n\nDan Gecker, a Chesterfield County supervisor, is working for competitive and better teacher salaries to recruit the best and the brightest and improve Virginia schools. Dr. Jill McCabe, an emergency room pediatrician in Loudoun County, knows that thanks to the Affordable Care Act, being a woman is no longer treated as a pre-existing condition. And Gary McCollum, a Virginia Beach businessman raising a 3-year-old daughter, understands that women deserve equal pay for equal work.\n\nIn contrast, the Virginia GOP is taking a page from its national party\u2019s book and pushing out-of-touch candidates like Dick Black, who received a \u201cPants on Fire\u201d rating from The Times-Dispatch/PolitiFact VA for flagrant dishonesty in promoting his anti-choice position.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Black, though. Hal Parrish in Manassas has twisted the power of municipal zoning laws to prevent women\u2019s clinics from opening or operating. Nancy Dye in Roanoke served on the board of a so-called \u201ccrisis pregnancy center,\u201d where women are routinely misled, intimidated and denied resources when it comes to their health care choices. Bob Marshall questions whether marital rape exists.\n\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nWhy would women stand by these GOP candidates, when they clearly don\u2019t stand by women? We deserve better, and come November we are going to get it.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Richmond Times-Dispatch", "description": "Everywhere you look in Virginia, Republicans are torpedoing their relationship with women.
