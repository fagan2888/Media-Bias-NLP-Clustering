AUSTIN -- President Obama had a very brief meeting Thursday with a notable Texas politician, but it was enough to inject himself into the local governor's race.

Obama spoke briefly with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis after his civil rights speech at the Lyndon Johnson presidential library.

No cameras recorded the event, but the campaign of Republican candidate Greg Abbott quickly responded.

"Sen. Davis stated last month that she would not shy away from President Obama's visit to Texas, yet in another flip-flop, she instead decided to meet with him in secret -- away from the public and refusing to mention what they discussed," said a statement from Abbott spokesman Matt Hirsch.

He added: "We can only assume President Obama and Sen. Davis bonded over their shared support of ObamaCare and limiting Second Amendment rights. Texans want a governor who shares there values, not someone who wants to bring Obama's big government agenda and failed liberal values to our great state."

Abbott, currently the Texas attorney general, is favored to win the governor's race against Davis, a state senator from Fort Worth.

The White House had little to say about the meeting: "This afternoon, following his remarks at the LBJ Library, the President visited briefly with Texas state senator Wendy Davis."

From The Dallas Morning News:

"Bo Delp, spokesman for the Davis campaign, said the president and Democratic nominee briefly discussed the importance of the Voting Rights Act and its legacy in Texas.

"On limiting gun rights, both Obama and Davis have supported expanded background checks, a position favored by a majority of Americans and Texans, according to recent polls.

"Davis is supportive of the Affordable Care Act."
