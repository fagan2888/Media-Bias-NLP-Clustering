The thought of being able to provide benefits to your employees is almost secondary. Yet to keep your employees happy, that\u2019s a question that comes across my desk all the time.\u201d\n\nBecause of the large increase, the business owner told the Democratic hopeful that she is forced to keep most of her workers as contractors, adding that many leave for other employers who can provide more benefits.\n\nShe went on to say if she can\u2019t provide benefits for herself, there\u2019s no way she can cover her family. She said the reason her health insurance has increased by so much is because she \u201cunfortunately\u201d makes too much money to qualify for a subsidy under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cSo, I guess my question to you is not only are you looking out for people that can\u2019t afford health care,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m someone that can afford it, but it\u2019s taking a big chunk out of the money I bring home for myself.\u201d\n\nClinton responded, \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is one of the real worries that we\u2019re facing with the cost of health insurance because the costs are going up in a lot of markets \u2014 not all, but many markets. Right now, like with so many of these programs, there\u2019s just a cut off instead of what I would like to see a kind of gradual diminishment.\u201d\n\nThe former secretary of state went on to say she doesn\u2019t think there should be any income figure that determines whether or not an individual is eligible for an Obamacare subsidy. Instead, Clinton suggested the government should be investigating out-of-pocket costs, like premiums and deductibles.\n\n\u201cBut I mean that\u2019s my point \u2014 It\u2019s like what could have possibly raised your costs? And that\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand. We\u2019ve got to pick that apart to really make sure we understand it,\u201d a bewildered Clinton said.\n\nFrom there, Clinton shifted the blame toward private healthcare insurance providers, telling the business owner that the federal government needs to \u201cmake\u201d companies \u201cjustify what they are charging,\u201d adding that many of them are \u201cmoving costs up without really explaining, or at least to my satisfaction, why that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nShe said non-profit organizations need to play a larger role in the issue, too. Clinton told the woman she would like to see a \u201cpublic option\u201d so Americans can sign up for Medicare above a certain age in an effort to reduce costs.\n\n\u201cBecause a [$500] increase, assuming you didn\u2019t have some terrible health care, which it doesn\u2019t sound like you did\u2014,\u201d Clinton said, before being interrupted by the woman.\n\n\u201cI go to the gym,\u201d the business owner said. \u201cI don\u2019t go to the doctor.\u201d\n\nThis comes after Clinton admitted last year that Obamacare has \u201cunfortunate incentives that discourage full-time employment.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow the author of this story on Twitter:\n\nFollow @tregp", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton came clean about Obamacare during a town hall this week, telling one small business owner that she has no idea why the Affordable Care Act has raised her insurance costs by $500.
