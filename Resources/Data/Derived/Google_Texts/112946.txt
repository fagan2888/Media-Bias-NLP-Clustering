Editor's note: The Oklahoma Highway Patrol originally spelled the name of the man who died as "Rogers," then issued a correction Monday afternoon, saying it's spelled "Rodgers."

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol identified a man shot and killed by a state trooper late Saturday at 32nd West Avenue near 61st Street South in Tulsa.

The man was Tel Rodgers, 33, of Claremore. The OHP trooper is Bobby Raines, 28, of Sapulpa.

The OHP said Raines had stopped Rodgers' car for a traffic violation, when Rodgers got out of the car and ran.

The OHP said Raines chased Rodgers on foot and started to arrest him when Rodgers went for the trooper's gun.

The trooper fired twice, hitting Rodgers in the head and chest, according to the OHP.

Rodgers' family spoke with News On 6 on Sunday. A family member said he was getting his life together.

Raines has been a state trooper with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol for a year and a half.
