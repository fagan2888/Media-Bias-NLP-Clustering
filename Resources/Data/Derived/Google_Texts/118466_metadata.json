(AP) - When rushing to a call, there is no guarantee that crews from North Mountain Volunteer Fire and Rescue will return unscathed - a well-known fact among the handful of families who serve at the station in western Frederick County.\n\n\u201cYou want to let them go and get experience,\u201d North Mountain Fire Chief Josh Taylor said. \u201cBut at the same time, you want to hold them back by the collar to make sure they go home to their family.\u201d\n\nJosh Taylor, 33, wife Cassidi, 36, stepson Caleb Belford, 17, along with his brother and sister-in-law, Matt and Courtney Taylor, volunteer at North Mountain fire station at 186 Rosenberger Lane - about 15 miles west of Winchester.\n\nThey are among seven family units of roughly 30 total volunteers at North Mountain.\n\n\u201cIf one family member joins, others become interested,\u201d Josh Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nDede Wright, 38, an emergency medical technician and driver for North Mountain, said her husband, Wayne Wright, 41, and her two sons, Cody, 21, and Hunter, 18, volunteer at the station when needed.\n\nShe said the benefit of volunteering with her family is the extra time spent together and knowing she can rely on them.\n\n\u201cI know that no matter what, they\u2019ll have my back,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said son Hunter convinced her and the family to volunteer for North Mountain, and they joined two years ago.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all concerned for each other\u2019s safety when we go on a call, but that\u2019s the nature of what we do,\u201d she said. \u201cFor my boys, I feel that way every time we get a fire call - that\u2019s the mom in me wanting to protect them but I know they\u2019ve had a lot of training. They\u2019re smart boys and they wouldn\u2019t do anything to put themselves in danger.\u201d\n\nDede, who is a bus driver for Frederick County Public Schools, said Wayne and Cody were recently hired at the Loudoun County Department of Fire, Rescue and Emergency Management in Northern Virginia, and will begin training this month while still continuing to volunteer.\n\nJosh and Matt Taylor are full-time firefighters for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, and work three 24-hour shifts with a day off in between each shift, then have four days off.\n\nWhen they\u2019re not getting paid to work, they can be found at North Mountain fire station, not far from where they live.\n\nJosh and Cassidi Taylor even held their wedding in the fire station\u2019s social hall.\n\n\u201cThis is your family away from family,\u201d said Matt Taylor, 28, who is the assistant chief. \u201cA lot of people use it as support where support from regular family may not be offered.\u201d\n\nThe Taylors\u2019 father, Jeff Taylor, was president at North Mountain, which was founded in 1973.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around a fire station since I was a baby,\u201d Josh Taylor said. \u201cComing from a family of firefighters, upholding tradition is important.\u201d\n\nMatt Taylor said when the station first opened in 1974, it was big enough to house only one fire truck.\n\nNow, there are five bays and a separate garage that hold two fire engines, two ambulances, one mini water pumper, a brush truck and two utility vehicles - not to mention a TV room where children of the volunteers can hang out.\n\n\u201cWe have more people than we have space,\u201d Matt Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have. Almost every fire company in Frederick County has the issue of running out of room.\u201d\n\nFrederick County\u2019s Fire and Rescue Department has 11 volunteer fire and rescue companies with about 200 volunteers, 85 uniformed career staff and seven office staff.\n\nNorth Mountain has two paid staff members from the county\u2019s fire and rescue department who work Monday through Friday.\n\nFunding for the station comes from the county, donations and fundraisers, such as monthly pancake breakfasts and bake sales.\n\nThe Winchester Fire and Rescue Department has 66 career staff, three administrative staff, 21 volunteers in four volunteer stations. It also has 60 administrative volunteers who provide 24-hour fire protection and advanced medical life support service, according to the City of Winchester\u2019s website.\n\nClarke County has three volunteer fire stations with 16 career staff, 80-100 volunteers, and one administrative staff member, Frank Davis, who is director of the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department.\n\nAbout 80 percent of the calls that North Mountain responds to are for emergency medical services, Josh Taylor said.\n\nThe station\u2019s first response area measures 43 square miles in southwestern Frederick County, though he said they sometimes provide services to parts of West Virginia and can provide aid to the entire county.\n\nThe station responds to house or bush fires every three or four months, he said.\n\nThe minimum age to volunteer at North Mountain is 15, Josh Taylor said. At 16, volunteers can attend basic fire training or emergency medical services training academies, and take leadership and officer courses.\n\n\u201cWe try to protect younger people as much as possible,\u201d Josh Taylor said. \u201cPeople here ensure they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\n\nBelford, a senior at James Wood High School, said he wanted to join the fire department since he was little.\n\n\u201cI enjoy the family dynamic,\u201d he said. \u201cI like running calls, fighting fires \u2026 it\u2019s a lot more rewarding than a paperwork job.\u201d\n\nHe said he received probationary training when he was 15, and graduated from the Basic Fire Academy in Frederick County last spring.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an adrenaline rush,\u201d he said of responding to EMS and fire calls. \u201cYou have to be confident in your skills, and know the difference between confidence and competence.\u201d\n\nAbout 10 of the 30 volunteers at North Mountain are under the age of 20, Josh Taylor said.\n\nBelford said three of his best friends also volunteer at the station.\n\n\u201cIf I have kids, they\u2019ll volunteer, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my first home.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When rushing to a call, there is no guarantee that crews from North Mountain Volunteer Fire and Rescue will return unscathed - a well-known fact among the handful of families who serve at the station in western Frederick County, Virginia.", "Author": "RAYA ZIMMERMAN", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "When rushing to a call, there is no guarantee that crews from North Mountain Volunteer Fire and Rescue will return unscathed - a well-known fact among the handful of families who serve at the station in western Frederick County, Virginia.", "title": "Firefighting a family affair for Frederick County, Va., company", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/10/firefighting-a-family-affair-for-frederick-county-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/10/6584c29375dbbe016a0f6a7067006ce9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/10/6584c29375dbbe016a0f6a7067006ce9.jpg", "title": "Firefighting a family affair for Frederick County, Va., company", "description": "When rushing to a call, there is no guarantee that crews from North Mountain Volunteer Fire and Rescue will return unscathed - a well-known fact among the handful of families who serve at the station", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Disaster Accident, North Mountain, Josh Taylor, Caleb Belford, Matt Taylor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36df\"", "article_summary": "She said son Hunter convinced her and the family to volunteer for North Mountain, and they joined two years ago.\n\u201cYou want to let them go and get experience,\u201d North Mountain Fire Chief Josh Taylor said.\nAbout 80 percent of the calls that North Mountain responds to are for emergency medical services, Josh Taylor said.\nThey are among seven family units of roughly 30 total volunteers at North Mountain.\n\u201cIf one family member joins, others become interested,\u201d Josh Taylor said."}
