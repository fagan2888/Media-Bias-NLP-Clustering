Unless -- in some cases -- your employer is the government.\n\nAsk almost anyone, and they'll tell you they are spending more on health insurance. Premiums are up.\n\n\u201cWe are paying $280 per two-week paycheck,\u201d one Missoula resident told us.\n\n\u201cOur family plan is around $1,100 a month,\u201d said another.\n\nDeductibles are higher. \u201cThe last papers I signed made my deductible about $1,500,\u201d said one resident we talked to.\n\nA 2014 Kaiser Family Foundation report backs them up. It shows while premiums from 2004 to 2014 increased 69 percent, workers took the hardest hit, with an 81-percent increase.\n\nWhile reviewing policies we were struck by one thing -- private sector workers are burdened by rising premiums and near catastrophic copays, but public employees have few complaints.\n\n\u201cThe administration has always wanted to keep the health care benefit at a manageable and fair amount,\u201d said Assistant Missoula Finance Director Leigh Griffing.\n\nThat amount is $20 for an individual employee in Missoula and free for workers in Kalispell and Bozeman.\n\nCompare that to Kaiser\u2019s estimated average of $243 a month.\n\nThen there are deductibles. Missoula's -- $470 for a city employee, $1,300 for a family. Bozeman's is $1,500 per employee and $3,000 for a family. In Kalispell, it\u2019s $1,000 per employee and $2,000 for a family.\n\neHealth averages the 2013 individual deductible at $3,319, and $4,230 for families.\n\nIt appears the public plan is a lot better than what's available to private workers. Griffing explained, \u201cThe majority of public employees don't have salaries that are comparable with the private sector, so the administration has considered this a benefit they would offer.\n\nYour taxes pay Missoula, Bozeman and Kalispell\u2019s insurance bills.\n\nMost comes from what's called a permissive levy.\n\nNext year in Missoula, it will cost the owner of a $225,000 house $113.25 a year.\n\nGriffing wonders if the city will need more to cover the anticipated 9-percent jump in health costs.\n\n\u201cWe've been increasing taxes around 2 to 4 percent over the last handful of years, so that is considerably higher than what we have been levying for.\u201d\n\nThat means taxes will likely go up, too, for people already feeling the pinch from their own insurance.\n\n\u201cYou practically have to be in triage dying before you can use it,\u201d one resident said.\n\nIn 2018, employers -- public and private -- will face the potential of penalties under the Affordable Care Act's high-cost tax plan, often referred to as the \"Cadillac Plan\" tax.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation says employers will likely begin to modify insurance plans in the coming year to avoid substantial penalties. That means further increases in deductibles, eliminating covered services and capping or eliminating tax-preferred savings accounts.\n\nPublic employers are not exempt for Cadillac Plan penalties.", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "If you have health insurance, there's a good chance you'll pay more for less coverage next year.", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "NBCMontana", "og": {"site_name": "NBCMontana", "description": "If you have health insurance, there's a good chance you'll pay more for less coverage next year.", "title": "Health insurance breakdown: Costs for public vs. private employees", "url": "http://www.nbcmontana.com/news/health-insurance-breakdown-costs-for-public-vs-private-employees/35317642", "image": "http://www.nbcmontana.com/image/view/-/35317644/highRes/1/-/maxh/640/maxw/640/-/sq9lv4/-/Health-insurance-breakdown--Costs-for-public-vs--private-employees-IMG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nbcmontana.com/news/health-insurance-breakdown-costs-for-public-vs-private-employees/35317642", "site": "@NBCMontana", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 321856697858356}, "keywords": "health insurance, health, care, cost, money, premium, deductible, finance, public, official", "google-site-verification": "K4Ws-KA_6I54qWFEeX0IJlIclLoCp1gbJ55-k4mzxzo", "news_keywords": "health insurance, health, care, cost, money, premium, deductible, finance, public, official"}, "article_summary": "-If you have health insurance, there's a good chance you'll pay more for less coverage next year.\nAsk almost anyone, and they'll tell you they are spending more on health insurance.\nIt appears the public plan is a lot better than what's available to private workers.\n\u201cOur family plan is around $1,100 a month,\u201d said another.\nWhile reviewing policies we were struck by one thing -- private sector workers are burdened by rising premiums and near catastrophic copays, but public employees have few complaints."}
