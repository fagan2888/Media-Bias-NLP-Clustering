Joseph Bensmihen of Boca Raton, a founder of home health care businesses who describes himself as a moderate Republican, says he’ll open a campaign for the Palm Beach-Broward District 22 House seat held by Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach.

Democrats have a 40-to-31 percent registration advantage in the district and Frankel was re-elected with 58 percent last year against Republican challenger Paul Spain.

Bensmihen, 46, founded Boca Home Care Services and United Elder Care Services. Born with cerebral palsy, he has been an advocate for people with disabilities.

Bensmihen said he doesn’t believe Frankel is accessible enough to her constituents. He said his top issues are protecting seniors, spurring economic growth and supporting Israel.

Like many Republican candidates, Bensmihen is critical of the Affordable Care Act, saying “the way it was implemented is not sustainable.” But he doesn’t join many others in the GOP in advocating repeal of Obamacare.

“It’s the law of the land. What we have to do is look at what works and what doesn’t and we have to fix it,” Bensmihen said.

Bensmihen has tapped Todd Richardson as his general consultant. Richardson has experience in District 22, having worked on several of former Republican state Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff‘s campaigns in a district that shares many voters with the congressional district.
