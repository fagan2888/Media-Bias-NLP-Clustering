Every politician over-promises, after all; and anyone swept up by a presidential campaign as idealistic as Obama\u2019s in 2008 is bound to find themselves ultimately disappointed. But even if the trajectory of the president\u2019s career is familiar, his first presidential campaign was so uniquely romantic, so willing to describe voting for Obama with the moralistic language of national self-redemption, that the consequences of his failure are not.\n\nTo get a sense of how Obama\u2019s failures will reverberate beyond his time in office, look at the debate over the looming war on ISIS (aka ISIL), the Islamic extremist group that has established dominion over a large chunk of war-ravaged Syria and tottering Iraq, slaughtering and brutalizing most everyone it can in the process. Despite being widely perceived as \u201creluctant\u201d to launch yet another combat operation in the Middle East, President Obama \u2014 who was voted into office in large part due to his perceived interest in dialing back his predecessor\u2019s war on terror \u2014 announced he would be initiating a multinational and multipronged campaign to \u201cdegrade and destroy\u201d the group. Having thrown its lot in with those who\u2019d describe ISIS as the biggest threat since Saddam Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction, the administration has spent the time since trying to keep the military from forcing it to send ground forces to Iraq if airstrikes on ISIS don\u2019t do the trick.\n\nConsidering neither the American people nor the nominal leadership of Iraq want American soldiers to return to the country, that\u2019s a worthwhile goal. I certainly hope in the event a U.S. pilot is shot down that the president channels Reagan in Beirut rather than Johnson in Saigon. But before we get too excited about the White House\u2019s modest attempts to slow the rush to full-scale war, let\u2019s take a moment to reflect on an unpleasant reality: During the first major test of his ability to calm American society and arrest the momentum of another national episode of Islamist-inspired hysteria, the best Obama\u2019s been able to do, thus far, is resist the insane idea of deploying ground-level troops. For a guy who campaigned on \u2014 and as recently as last year was still talking about \u2014 ending the U.S.\u2019s \u201cperpetual wartime footing,\u201d redefining dovishness as little more than an aversion to \u201cboots on the ground\u201d is bitterly ironic.\n\nIf President Obama actually believed in his own rhetoric and strategy, of course, the story would be different. Obama has long maintained that he\u2019s no pacifist, even going so far as to devote his speech in acceptance of a wildly premature Nobel Peace Prize to the virtues of humanitarian intervention (previously known as war). If he truly considered ISIS a problem from hell, and he truly agreed with neoconservatives like Sen. Lindsey Graham and Sen. John McCain, who describe the group as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d that could have us \u201call get killed,\u201d I\u2019d be much more sympathetic. I\u2019d still side with the vast majority of experts who say these claims are absurd, mind you; but I\u2019d at least believe Obama\u2019s motivations were noble, however misguided. It\u2019s possible to be wrong for the right reasons.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The man who vowed to end our \"perpetual wartime footing\" embraces ISIS policy one might call neoconservatism-lite", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s worst defeat: How the president defined dovishness down", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The man who vowed to end our \"perpetual wartime footing\" embraces ISIS policy one might call neoconservatism-lite", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s worst defeat: How the president defined dovishness down", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/20/barack_obamas_worst_defeat_how_the_president_defined_dovishness_down/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/mccain_obama_graham.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The man who vowed to end our \"perpetual wartime footing\" embraces ISIS policy one might call neoconservatism-lite", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s worst defeat: How the president defined dovishness down", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/mccain_obama_graham.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Editor's Picks, Foreign policy, Iraq, ISIL, isis, Islamic State, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Neoconservatism, Syria, War on Terror", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If President Obama actually believed in his own rhetoric and strategy, of course, the story would be different.\nEvery politician over-promises, after all; and anyone swept up by a presidential campaign as idealistic as Obama\u2019s in 2008 is bound to find themselves ultimately disappointed.\nI\u2019d still side with the vast majority of experts who say these claims are absurd, mind you; but I\u2019d at least believe Obama\u2019s motivations were noble, however misguided.\nI certainly hope in the event a U.S. pilot is shot down that the president channels Reagan in Beirut rather than Johnson in Saigon.\nConsidering neither the American people nor the nominal leadership of Iraq want American soldiers to return to the country, that\u2019s a worthwhile goal."}
