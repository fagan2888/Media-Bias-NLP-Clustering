The state also will get money for its whole-person pilot project and a revamp of its Medi-Cal dental system.\n\nAs state and federal officials work out some of the remaining details of the new waiver called \u201cMedi-Cal 2020,\u201d CMS granted the state a temporary extension of the current waiver to Dec. 31. It was due to expire Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical step in the waiver renewal process and we appreciate all of the hard work done thus far with CMS. However, much work remains as we develop the details of the waiver programs and components,\u201d said Mari Cantwell, chief deputy director of Health Care Programs and state Medicaid director at the Department of Health Care Services, in a written statement,\n\nThe waiver agreement is significantly lower than the state\u2019s original request for $17 billion in programmatic funding.\n\nIt\u2019s also about $1 billion lower than the state\u2019s recently revised waiver request that totaled about $7.25 billion.\n\nSome of the \u201cMedi-Cal 2020\u201d waiver details:\n\nThe grand total for new 1115 waiver funding is set at $6.218 billion over five years, with the potential for additional federal funding for its uninsured effort, which could be determined after the first year, DHCS officials said;\n\nThe bulk of the waiver, about $3.3 billion, will go toward a public hospital incentive program, to include hospitals operated by municipalities and health care districts. That money is slightly down from the $4 billion requested by DHCS;\n\nThe state had asked for $1 billion over five years to care for the Global Payment Program, to help handle the remaining uninsured in California. It will get $236 million in the first year of the waiver, with the possibility for more funding later;\n\n$750 million will go toward improving dental health programs; and\n\n$1.5 billion goes toward the state\u2019s whole-person care pilot.\n\nErica Murray is president and CEO of the California Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems. She said this waiver takes big steps toward improving the state\u2019s safety-net system.\n\n\u201cThis agreement demonstrates public health care systems\u2019 shared commitment with CMS and the state to improve care and achieve better health for millions of low-income Medi-Cal and uninsured patients in California,\u201d Murray said in a written statement. \u201cPublic health care systems are eager to continue negotiating the specifics of the waiver so that we can start working toward achieving these ambitious goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the details are worked out and public hospitals, the state and counties take advantage of the opportunities provided, this waiver agreement will help improve care for millions of Californians with Medi-Cal coverage and those who remain uninsured,\u201d said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, in a written statement.\n\n\u201cCommunity groups have been working with their counties on revamping and improving their safety-net systems, and this will take those efforts to the next level,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWe expect to see an explosion of exciting activity at the county level to improve health care once the details are hammered out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>California gets almost everything it wanted in a scaled-back $6.2 billion waiver request for Medicaid delivery and payment system reforms approved over the weekend by federal regulators.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "California gets almost everything it wanted in a scaled-back $6.2 billion waiver request for Medicaid delivery and payment system reforms approved over the weekend by federal regulators.", "title": "$6 Billion Waiver Gets Federal Approval", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/6-billion-waiver-gets-federal-approval/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-11-02T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-02T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "CMS officials on Saturday agreed in principle to a five-year, $6.2 billion waiver for California\u2019s Medicaid program.\nIt\u2019s also about $1 billion lower than the state\u2019s recently revised waiver request that totaled about $7.25 billion.\n\u201cWe expect to see an explosion of exciting activity at the county level to improve health care once the details are hammered out.\u201d\nAs state and federal officials work out some of the remaining details of the new waiver called \u201cMedi-Cal 2020,\u201d CMS granted the state a temporary extension of the current waiver to Dec. 31.\nErica Murray is president and CEO of the California Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems."}
