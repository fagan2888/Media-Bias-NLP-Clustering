John Kasich speaks during a news conference at the Northeast Hamilton County Republican Club pancake breakfast, today, Cincinnati.\n\nHEATH, Ohio \u2014 While Republican presidential contender and Gov. John Kasich vowed he would remain positive in his campaign, he was directly asked today by an audience member at one of his own town halls why he was not defending his chief opponent's First Amendment rights.\n\nMr. Kasich has criticized billionaire buisnessman Donald Trump's rhetoric, but has at the same time vowed to maintain a positive campaign. The audience member asked him why he was not defending Mr. Trump's rights versus those of rally protests by groups like Black Lives Matter.\n\n\u201cIt's undeniable that he has created a toxic atmosphere dividing us ... ,\u201d Mr. Kasich said as he stood in front of scores of compressed natural gas vessels at a factory in a Licking County industrial park.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: Kasich touts job creation at once-closed former GM plant\n\n\u201cWhen you have a toxic atmosphere, nothing good ever happens,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has a right to speak, and the people have a right to protest. I tell you at some of these events, there is no doubt...people go to things looking for trouble, looking to cause trouble...\n\n\u201cWhy don't we just be positive. Why don't we talk about our visions?\u201d he asked.\n\nEarlier, he had directly criticized the tone of Trump\u2019s rallies, particularly since Mr. Trump cancelled a Chicago rally Friday because of the tensions around the venue.\n\n\u201cWe cannot create in this country a toxic environment where images of people slugging it out at a campaign rally -\u2014 think about it \u2014 are transmitted all over the globe...,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say 'What happened to America? What happened to our country?'\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s business-focused road tour through Ohio continued today, with Mr. Kasich defying attempts by Mr. Trump for the state's 66 winner-take-all delegates and to downplay the state\u2019s economic bounceback as just mere luck in finding shale oil and gas.\n\nMr. Kasich picked a 50,000 square-foot Xperian manufacturing plant east of Columbus to ramp up voters going into Tuesday's state primary in which he's not only banking on his first win but one that could serve as the make-or-break moment of his presidential campaign.\n\nXperian, a German-based company which makes pressure vessels for the compressed natural gas market, picked Ohio in 2013 for its first North American plant. It fits the scenario Mr. Kasich is repeatedly trying to hammer home \u2014 that he has been successful in luring jobs to Ohio and in bringing them here from other countries.\n\n\u201cToday we are standing in a facility primarly driven by German investment,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cWe're not sending our jobs there. They're sending their money here to put our people to work.\u201d\n\nThe fight for Ohio's delegates has boiled down to Mr. Kasich and Mr. Trump, who has stepped up his criticism of the governor after largely leaving him alone compared to his vitriliolic criticism of other current and former foes including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.\n\nWhile Mr. Kasich has cited the 400,000 new jobs in Ohio since the depths of the recesssion, Mr. Trump on the campaign trail and in debates has belittled that record as little more than luck from \u201cfracking\u201d of shale oil and natural gas.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Kasich declined to respond to a new Trump ad describing an absentee governor who has brought \u201cObamacare\u201d to Ohio in the form of expanded access to Medicaid, he left it to the superPAC supporting his candicacy to respond,\n\nNew Day for America did so with its own TV ad with the terms \u201cTrump losing. Unhinged lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cOhioans are too danged smart to ever trust you,\u201d states the narrator.\n\nMr. Kasich's depiction of his record as governor of a quintessential sing state has been the centerpiece of his case to Republican voters that he can translate his success here to the nation as a whole. He has promised that he will not only win Ohio on Tuesday in a bid to block Mr. Trump's path to the nomination but stands the best chance of delivering the battleground state in the fall.\n\nU.S. Sen. Rob Portman, who is also on the GOP primary ballot Tuesday, traveled with Mr. Kasich Saturday, downplaying suggestions that Mr. Kasich is now the \u201cestabllishment\u201d candidate.\n\n\u201cYou know John,\u201d he said. \u201cI know John. He's a reformer.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasich started the day with Mr. Portman at a pancake breakfast in Cincinnati and plans to finish tonight with a town hall at another business in Mansfield. Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio have abandoned Ohio, choosing not to invest time and money in a primary where a second-place finish yields zero delegates.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www4.toledoblade.com/image/2016/03/12/75x_b1_a4-4_cC_z_cT/GOP-2016-Kasich-cincinnati-03122016.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By JIM PROVANCE<br>BLADE COLUMBUS BUREAU CHIEF", "description": "HEATH, Ohio \u2014\u00a0While Republican presidential contender and Gov.
