Fault Lines' examination of states' decisions on whether to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and the U.S.'s new health care dichotomy premieres on Al Jazeera America on Saturday, July 12, at 7 pm ET/4 pm PT.

In "The Coverage Gap," Fault Lines travels to south central Florida to meet a cancer-sufferer who lost her husband and health coverage and had to move back in with her parents; to North Carolina, where Moral Monday activists protest for the state to expand Medicaid; and to a medical student-run free clinic in Texas serving the local low-income population that cannot get health care anywhere else.

The photos that follow, shot primarily by Fault Lines Correspondent Josh Rushing, take you behind the scenes of the film.
