Add butter and melt until lightly browned.\n\n\n\nWhen melted and light brown, add the cooked gnocchi. Allow the gnocchi to toast to golden brown, tossing every minute or so.\n\nWhile browning the gnocchi, warm the roasted butternut squash in a small pot, very slowly. Do not burn or scorch! When warmed through, cover and hold hot.\n\nAdd the sage and caramelized onion to gnocchi. Toss well to incorporate and add with white wine.\n\nAllow the wine to cook dry, and immediately add chicken stock and cream.\n\nSimmer the gnocchi and sauce for 45 seconds, allowing the flavors to combine and the sauce to reduce slightly. Adjust seasoning with salt and fresh cracked black pepper.\n\nRemove the pan from the heat and add spinach. Toss well to incorporate and wilt the spinach.\n\nImmediately add the grated Parmesan and toss well to incorporate and to flavor and thicken the sauce.\n\nRemove to a platter and using a spoon, place the roasted butternut squash in small even mounds across the top of the gnocchi, and drizzle the entire plate with truffle oil.\n\nSprinkle with shaved Parmesan cheese just before serving.\n\n\n\nOptions: Add pulled chicken or shrimp to the gnocchi after the cream has begun reducing.\n\n\n\nRoasted Butternut Squash\n\nIngredients\n\n1 medium butternut squash, washed, cut in half, seeds removed\n\n3 TBL butter\n\n3 TBL brown sugar\n\n4 ginger slices, 1/8\" thick, smashed\n\n8 sage leaves\n\n1 tsp rosemary, fresh, rough chop\n\n4 garlic cloves, smashed\n\n1 \u00bd tsp Kosher salt\n\ncracked black pepper, fresh ground\n\n1 cup water\n\nKosher salt and fresh ground pepper to taste\n\n\n\nProcedure:\n\nPlace two halves of butternut squash in a three-inch minimum deep pan with skin side down, flesh side up and evenly sprinkle flesh side of squash including cavity with butter, herbs, ginger, garlic, brown sugar, salt and pepper.\n\nPour water around squash and cover tightly with aluminum foil\n\nPlace in a 375 convection oven for approximately 70 minutes or until squash is extremely tender, like a mashed potato.\n\nRemove foil and let cool to room temperature. Remove large pieces of garlic, ginger and herbs, and reserve liquid.\n\nScoop soft squash flesh into a bowl and smash with a large fork or potato masher and add reserved liquid to create the consistency of mashed potatoes, but not too loose. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Either refrigerate for up to four days or keep warm for immediate use.\n\n\n\nMaking fresh Gnocchi\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 pound golden Yukon potatoes\n\n3 to 4 large egg yolks\n\n1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese\n\n1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg\n\n1/2 tsp sea salt\n\n1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting board and dough\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nBake the potatoes in a preheated 400 degree oven for one hour until fork tender. Let sit until cool enough to handle, cut in half, and scoop out the flesh.\n\nPass the potatoes through a potato ricer. Make a mound of potatoes on a table or work surface with a well in the middle, like making pasta, add three of the egg yolks, the cheese, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.\n\n\n\nMix in the potatoes and mix well with fingers. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of flour over the mound and, using your fingers, press it into the potatoes. Fold the dough over on itself and press down again.\n\n\n\nSprinkle on more flour, little by little, folding and pressing the dough until it just holds together (do not to knead it.) Work any dough clinging to your fingers back into the dough. If the mixture is too dry, add another egg yolk or a pinch of water. To test if the dough is the correct consistency, take a piece and roll it with your hands on a well-floured board into a rope 1/2-inch in diameter.\n\n\n\nIf the dough holds together, it is ready. If not, add more flour, fold and press the dough several more times, and test again.\n\nKeeping work surface and dough lightly floured, cut the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a rope about 1/2-inch in diameter.\n\n\n\nCut into 1/2-inch-long pieces. Lightly flour the gnocchi as you cut them. You can cook these as is or form them into the classic gnocchi shape using the back of a large fork.\n\nAs you shape the gnocchi, dust them lightly with flour and scatter them on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.\n\nWhen ready to cook, bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a few tablespoons of salt. Drop in the gnocchi and cook for about 90 seconds from the time they rise to the surface. Remove the cooked gnocchi with a skimmer, shake off the excess water, toss with a bit of oil and cool on a sheet pan in refrigerator until ready to use.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015 by News4Jax.com.
