Then the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans will go to work.\n\nNo one out\u00adside the Court\u2019s walls knows if it will is\u00adsue a dev\u00adast\u00adat\u00ading blow to the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act, but Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans have a strategy to cap\u00adit\u00adal\u00adize on it just in case. They feel fairly con\u00adfid\u00adent thatKing v. Bur\u00adwellwill go their way\u201d\u201di.e., that the justices will say the law does not al\u00adlow sub\u00adsidies for people who buy in\u00adsur\u00adance on fed\u00ader\u00adal ex\u00adchanges \u201c\u201dand they have a re\u00adsponse ready.\n\nThe chances that Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans will ac\u00adtu\u00adally agree amongst them\u00adselves on an Obama\u00adcare re\u00adplace\u00adment are ex\u00adceed\u00adingly slim, and even if they man\u00adage that and get something ap\u00adproved by both cham\u00adbers of Con\u00adgress \u201c\u201c which may re\u00adquire the use of the spe\u00adcial budget tool known as re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation \u201c\u201c an aw\u00adful lot of things would have to go right for their plan to work.\n\nThose steep odds haven\u2019t dis\u00adsuaded the GOP from at least try\u00ading. Their first step will be to pro\u00adpose freez\u00ading en\u00adroll\u00adment ex\u00adactly where it is. No one would be forced to drop an ACA health plan even if they can\u2019t get sub\u00adsidies to pay their premi\u00adums. Con\u00adgress will provide, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans say. At least for 18 months or so. The next step comes in 2017, when a new pres\u00adid\u00adent is ushered in. Un\u00adder this mas\u00adter plan, a GOP Con\u00adgress will then put forth a mar\u00adket-based health care pro\u00adpos\u00adal. In the\u00adory \u201c\u201c and it\u2019s a the\u00adory Demo\u00adcrats would cer\u00adtainly dis\u00adpute \u2014 it won\u2019t mat\u00adter wheth\u00ader the White House is oc\u00adcu\u00adpied by a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan or a Demo\u00adcrat. The GOP\u2019s Obama\u00adcare \u201cre\u00adplace\u00adment\u201d will be the only solu\u00adtion avail\u00adable.\n\nThis is the health care scheme that has come to\u00adgeth\u00ader piece by piece as the Obama\u00adcare foes in Con\u00adgress have ma\u00adtured from tan\u00adtrum-throw\u00aders to cal\u00adcu\u00adlat\u00ading strategists. The over\u00adall goal hasn\u2019t changed\u201d\u201dto get rid of Obama\u2019s health care law. But the think\u00ading about what to of\u00adfer in its stead is only now start\u00ading to gel in the GOP caucus.\n\nThe nug\u00adget of the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans\u2019 an\u00adswer to the ACA was hatched eight years ago, well be\u00adfore Obama\u00adcare was con\u00adceived. Two vet\u00ader\u00adan con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives\u201d\u201dSens. Richard Burr of North Car\u00ado\u00adlina and Tom Coburn of Ok\u00adlahoma\u201d\u201dbe\u00adlieved it should be just as easy for an in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal to buy health in\u00adsur\u00adance as it is for a work\u00ader to sign up with an em\u00adploy\u00ader. The two law\u00admakers worked stead\u00adily on a pro\u00adpos\u00adal to use tax cred\u00adits, cost-cut\u00adting tools like high-risk pool shar\u00ading, and health sav\u00adings ac\u00adcounts to bring down premi\u00adums.\n\nBurr re\u00adcently de\u00adscribed the pro\u00adpos\u00adal this way: \u201cWe\u2019ve bal\u00adanced the dif\u00adfer\u00adence between em\u00adploy\u00ader-based cov\u00ader\u00adage and in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal-based cov\u00ader\u00adage.\u201d\n\nBurr kept re\u00adfin\u00ading the pro\u00adpos\u00adal even after Coburn re\u00adtired in 2014. He sought sup\u00adport from Sen. Or\u00adrin Hatch of Utah well be\u00adfore it be\u00adcame clear that Hatch would chair the Sen\u00adate Fin\u00adance Com\u00admit\u00adtee. \u201cOr\u00adrin has al\u00adways had a deep in\u00adterest in health care,\u201d Burr toldNa\u00adtion\u00adal Journ\u00adal.\u201cHe has a very tal\u00aden\u00adted health care staff. We went in there and said, \u2018Hey, shoot holes in this. And if you can\u2019t find any, co\u00adspon\u00adsor with us.\u2019 And they couldn\u2019t find any\u00adthing.\u201d\n\nLo and be\u00adhold, Hatch signed on. The Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans took con\u00adtrol of the Sen\u00adate, and Hatch be\u00adcame chair\u00adman of the com\u00admit\u00adtee through which all health care bills must pass. \u201cYeah, we got lucky,\u201d Burr said with a smile.\n\nHatch and Burr are now the two prin\u00adcip\u00adal op\u00ader\u00adat\u00adors of the \u201cre\u00adplace ACA\u201d scheme. They got a big polit\u00adic\u00adal boost earli\u00ader this year when Rep. Fred Up\u00adton, the House En\u00adergy and Com\u00admerce Com\u00admit\u00adtee chair\u00adman, signed on. Up\u00adton\u2019s thumbs-up showed that the GOP means busi\u00adness on health care, even in the bois\u00adter\u00adous House. Up\u00adton\u2019s spon\u00adsor\u00adship also signaled a shift among row\u00addi\u00ader House Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans away from their laser fo\u00adcus on ACA re\u00adpeal to\u00adward a meas\u00adured solu\u00adtion. Im\u00adport\u00adantly, it showed that the GOP is will\u00ading to ad\u00admit that the health care sys\u00adtem needs some at\u00adten\u00adtion from Con\u00adgress.\n\nFin\u00adance Com\u00admit\u00adtee Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans also see Up\u00adton\u2019s par\u00adti\u00adcip\u00ada\u00adtion as a way to show off the power they can wield when the House and Sen\u00adate lead\u00aders of cor\u00adrel\u00adat\u00ading com\u00admit\u00adtees work closely to\u00adgeth\u00ader. In the past, Sen\u00adate Fin\u00adance chair\u00admen and House En\u00adergy and Com\u00admerce chair\u00admen some\u00adtimes seemed like they were on sep\u00adar\u00adate plan\u00adets, even if they were in the same polit\u00adic\u00adal party.\n\nBurr says Up\u00adton\u2019s sup\u00adport is no ac\u00adci\u00addent. \u201cFred and I were on En\u00adergy and Com\u00admerce to\u00adgeth\u00ader,\u201d he said, re\u00adfer\u00adring to his own time in the House. \u201cThis be\u00adgins to cre\u00adate a plat\u00adform with\u00adin the House that we\u2019re able to get people fa\u00admil\u00adi\u00adar with the struc\u00adture of the plan.\u201d\n\nThe Burr/Hatch/Up\u00adton pro\u00adpos\u00adal puts on dis\u00adplay the GOP\u2019s fun\u00adda\u00adment\u00adal philo\u00adsophy on health care. Not sur\u00adpris\u00adingly, it is dia\u00admet\u00adric\u00adally op\u00adposed to Demo\u00adcrats\u2019 views. Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans be\u00adlieve that if you make cov\u00ader\u00adage af\u00adford\u00adable, more people will buy it. They do not be\u00adlieve in man\u00addat\u00ading that people have in\u00adsur\u00adance or dic\u00adtat\u00ading how health plans should look, as the ACA does. And they want states to take the lead in mak\u00ading in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal plans easi\u00ader for people to get. In keep\u00ading with their small-gov\u00adern\u00adment credo, they want the fed\u00ader\u00adal gov\u00adern\u00adment\u2019s role in health care to be much smal\u00adler than it is now.\n\nAc\u00adknow\u00adledging con\u00adsumers\u2019 de\u00adsire not to get gouged, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans have built a few Obama\u00adcare-like pro\u00adtec\u00adtions in\u00adto their plan. For ex\u00adample, no one could be denied cov\u00ader\u00adage based on a preex\u00adist\u00ading con\u00addi\u00adtion. Peri\u00adod. No as\u00adter\u00adisk. Par\u00adents would be able to cov\u00ader their chil\u00addren un\u00adtil age 26. (That one does have an as\u00adter\u00adisk: States could opt out.) In\u00adsur\u00adance com\u00adpan\u00adies would be barred from kick\u00ading people off their plans if they make too many claims.\n\nThis is com\u00adplex le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion with a lot of mov\u00ading parts, in\u00adclud\u00ading shifts in the tax code that might make some tax pur\u00adists nervous. That\u2019s why Burr says Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are simply lay\u00ading the ground\u00adwork now for 2017 im\u00adple\u00adment\u00ada\u00adtion. Even though it\u2019s hard to ima\u00adgine Con\u00adgress passing ma\u00adjor le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion ever again, Burr is con\u00adfid\u00adent that\u2019s how this will go down. \u201cWe got to where we are through a pro\u00adcess of elim\u00adin\u00ada\u00adtion. It\u2019s not that we woke up one day and said, \u2018Gosh, here\u2019s the mod\u00adel that we need to use.\u2019 It was be\u00adcause we elim\u00adin\u00adated everything else,\u201d he said.\n\nNow Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans just need to wait for one last elim\u00adin\u00ada\u00adtion. It will have to come from the Su\u00adpreme Court.\n\nThis art\u00adicle has been up\u00addated.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "Finance Committee Republicans have been working for a while on a new health care plan.
