Gregg has been co-founder and partner of Duidon Partners since late 2014. She's also on the boards of Quest Diagnostics and TeamHealth. She was CEO of BCBST for nearly a decade, from January 2003 until late 2012.

"We are very pleased to be adding an individual to Acadia's board with the healthcare expertise and accomplishments that Vicky Gregg has achieved across her outstanding career. We welcome her to Acadia, and we look forward to her contributions to our company's ongoing growth as one of the healthcare industry's leading providers of high-quality behavioral healthcare," Joey Jacobs, Acadia's chairman and CEO, said in a statement.

Acadia, based in Franklin, provides patient behavioral health and addiction dependency care for children, teens and adults of all ages. The company has transformed since 2010 as it has expanded its territory and federal legislation, notably the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 and Affordable Care Act, increased access to mental health and addiction recovery services.

Gregg, a nurse, started her career at Erlanger Regional Medical Center and has held numerous high-level positions. She's served on the boards of the BlueCross BlueShield Association, National Institute of Healthcare Management, America's Health Insurance Plans, National Institutes of Health Commission on Systemic Interoperability and the University of Tennessee Board of Trustees.
