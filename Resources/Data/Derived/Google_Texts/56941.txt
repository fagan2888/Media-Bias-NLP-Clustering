BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Is Argentina’s World Cup only about Lionel Messi?

Coach Alejandro Sabella seems to be getting a little exasperated with the observation — also made by Diego Maradona — that his team is overly reliant on the little magician.

Messi scored four of Argentina’s six goals in the group stage in Brazil and set up Angel Di Maria for the winning goal in the second round against Switzerland.

Ahead of the quarterfinal against Belgium, Sabella responded to another question about his playmaker’s significant influence with: “I repeat: Any team that has a player like Messi will greatly depend on him.”

But Sabella also said “there is teamwork” in Argentina’s game and interrupted a reporter to describe, in detail, the crucial role of another player in that Di Maria goal.
