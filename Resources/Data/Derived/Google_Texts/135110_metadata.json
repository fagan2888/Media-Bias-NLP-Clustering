It\u2019s becoming increasingly apparent that the icon of conservative male virility lent support to war criminals who shot 80 children from the sky. Per a report from the Associated Press:\n\n\u201cOn Thursday, Putin blamed Ukraine for the crash, saying Kiev was responsible for the unrest in its Russian-speaking eastern regions. But he didn\u2019t accuse Ukraine of shooting the plane down and didn\u2019t address the key question of whether Russia gave the rebels such a powerful missile.\u201d\n\nIf gathering rumors are to be believed, Russian interlopers may have already absconded to Moscow with Malaysian Airlines Flight 17\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d recorder. And as of Saturday morning, the crash site in Eastern Ukraine remains unsecured. As evidence decays and/or is purposefully tampered with, Putin\u2019s Thursday statement may be the closest thing we ever get to an admission of the truth. A wise person once told me that when an unpleasant man tells you something about himself, believe him. And by shying away from implausible deniability (a sport in which the Russian thug routinely indulges), Putin is speaking loud and clear.\n\nRussian sponsorship of the downing of the defenseless civilian airliners. Yeah, that\u2019s real bravery. Keep talking McCain Nation.\n\nMoving onto another human tragedy a little closer to home, the Republican Party continued its parade of heartless, xenophobic double talk about the Central American child immigrant crisis. Even as Colorado\u2019s Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper offered a ray of humanitarian hope in writing, \u201cIf Denver or other communities in Colorado want to offer their support and sponsorship while these children are in the legal system, the state respects and would defend that decision,\u201d and Pope Francis publicly cautioned the devout to love and protect the kids, a dark strain of ugliness continued to permeate the official GOP response.\n\nThis past week, retired medical doctor and Republican House member Phil Gingrey told NBC News, \u201cThe border patrol gave us a list of the diseases that they\u2019re concerned about, and Ebola was one of those\u2026I can\u2019t tell you specifically that there were any cases of Ebola, I don\u2019t think there were, but of course Tuberculosis, Chagas disease, many \u2013 small pox, some of the infectious diseases of children, all of these are concerns.\u201d\n\nThese alarmist and disgusting comments continue to undercut our nation\u2019s once-vaunted reputation as a refuge for freedom seekers. On a secondary level, you have to wonder if the GOP understands that they won\u2019t be able to erase Hispanic voter memory in 2014 and beyond. Yet the certainty that the party is briskly digging its own electoral grave doesn\u2019t do much to relieve the dire and fearful predicament of the kids. They\u2019ve run from terror only to be treated as enemy invaders by the Land of the Free.\n\nThis year has been unbelievably tough for those in favor of contemplative, deliberate foreign policy, sensible gun and comprehensive immigration reforms and last but not least, liberty for the GOP\u2019s most discounted \u201cspecial interest group\u201d \u2013 women.\n\nNew York Times commentator Timothy Egan makes the case this week that the SCOTUS\u2019 disastrous Hobby Lobby decision does more than assault female reproductive freedom. It also takes a swipe at our founding principle \u2013 the separation of church and state. He writes, \u201cIn the United States, God is on the currency. By brilliant design, though, he is not mentioned in the Constitution. The founders were explicit: This country would never formally align God with one political party, or allow someone to use religion to ignore civil laws. At least that was the intent. In this summer of the violent God, five justices on the Supreme Court seem to feel otherwise.\u201d\n\nAs Americans continue to grapple with the Supreme Court\u2019s increasingly partisan suppression of human rights in favor of corporate ones, the media is finally (finally!) beginning to take the five Catholic male justices responsible to task in a semi-bipartisan way. Meanwhile, Democratic Congressional leaders are trying to develop and pass legislation that would grant women access to everything promised by the Affordable Care Act. May they be relentless.\n\nIt was a week when modern Republican claims to be defenders of freedom, limited government and human dignity were clearly exposed as money and power grabbing, racist scams. Individual rights trump all else \u2013 except for women who want to make their own family planning decisions. Give us your tired and your poor \u2013 unless they are frightened brown children. We have no money to take care of them properly as dictated by law. Those funds are subsidizing the lifestyles and business ventures of the one percent. And that weak-willed, effeminate Obama. If only he\u2019d man up and covertly supply terrorists who murder international civilians like that macho Vladimir Putin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though you'd never guess by listening to its representatives speak, it was a terrible week for modern Republican ideology.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Becky Sarwate", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Though you'd never guess by listening to its representatives speak, it was a terrible week for modern Republican ideology.", "title": "Republican Ideology Has Its Worst Week Ever", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/07/20/conservative-dogmas-worst-week.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/lets_talk_ideology.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-20T10:06:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-07-20T10:06:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-20T10:06:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7e8\"", "article_summary": "Though you\u2019d never guess by listening to its representatives speak, it was a terrible week for modern Republican ideology.\nMoving onto another human tragedy a little closer to home, the Republican Party continued its parade of heartless, xenophobic double talk about the Central American child immigrant crisis.\nIt was a week when modern Republican claims to be defenders of freedom, limited government and human dignity were clearly exposed as money and power grabbing, racist scams.\nNew York Times commentator Timothy Egan makes the case this week that the SCOTUS\u2019 disastrous Hobby Lobby decision does more than assault female reproductive freedom.\nPer a report from the Associated Press:\u201cOn Thursday, Putin blamed Ukraine for the crash, saying Kiev was responsible for the unrest in its Russian-speaking eastern regions."}
