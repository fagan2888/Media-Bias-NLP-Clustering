There is too much suffering involved.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "A romance created at war continued at Fort Logan Cemetery on Memorial Day", "title": "A romance created at war continued at Fort Logan Cemetery on Memorial Day", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/26/a-romance-created-at-war-continued-at-fort-logan-cemetery-on-memorial-day/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140526__20140527_A4_CD27FORTLOGANp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140526__20140527_A4_CD27FORTLOGANp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-26T15:09:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:25:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb978\"", "article_summary": "Rosanna died 17 years ago after raising two boys with her husband and serving two tours with the United States armed forces during World War II and the Korean war.\nDepner also served in World War II and in Korea as a pilot in what used to be called the Army Aircorps.\nDepner visits Fort Logan every year on Memorial Day \u2014 and, on other days, as often as he can \u2014 to leave flowers on the grave of his wife, Rosanna.\nFamilies, veterans and active servicemen and women joined in an 11 a.m. ceremony at the cemetery before walking the grounds to visit graves.\nAbout halfway through the ceremony, Earl Depner, 94, wandered off into the rows of marble gravestones by himself."}
