Come back to HealthCare.gov to join the millions of people who have found quality and affordable coverage. We\u2019ve rolled your information over into your 2016 application and it\u2019s ready for your review.\n\nGet covered and save: 8 out of 10 people who enrolled in a health insurance plan qualified for financial help. In fact, most people can find plans for $75 or less per month.\n\nSubmit your application and see what you could save in 2016.\n\nDon\u2019t miss your chance to get affordable coverage \u2013 sign up for a 2016 plan today!\n\nYou\u2019ll note that HHS is still pushing the \u201cfinancial help for 80%, most can get a plan for under $75/month\u201d angle, otherwise known as The Carrot. There\u2019s nothing wrong with doing this (well, aside from not addressing the \u201chigh deductible\u201d issue), but most interested parties assumed that they\u2019d be pushing hard on the increased individual mandate penalty for not having ACA-compliant coverage this year \u2026 aka, The Stick.\n\nAs a reminder, here\u2019s a simplified breakdown (assuming you don\u2019t qualify for an exemption):\n\n2014: If you weren\u2019t covered in 2014, the penalty you had to pay last spring was either $95 per person ($47.50 per child under 18) or 1% of your household income.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t covered in 2014, the penalty you had to pay last spring was either $95 per person ($47.50 per child under 18) or 1% of your household income. 2015: If you weren\u2019t covered this year, the penalty you will have to pay spring 2016 will be either $325 per person ($162.50 per child) or 2% of your household income.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t covered this year, the penalty you will have to pay spring 2016 will be either $325 per person ($162.50 per child) or 2% of your household income. 2016: If you don\u2019t get covered for the 2016 year (which, for the most part, means enrolling during open enrollment \u2026 which is to say, NOW), the penalty you\u2019ll have to pay in spring 2017 will be either $695 per person ($347.50 per kid) or 2.5% of your household income.\n\nObviously there are exceptions to the above; besides financial hardship (ie, the least expensive qualifying policy is still more than 8% of your income even after tax credits), you\u2019re also exempt from the penalties above if you\u2019re in jail, a Native American, have certain religious objections and so forth. The main points here, however, are:\n\n1. The penalty is a lot higher this year.\n\nA lot of people probably found out they only had to pay $95 apiece (or 1% of their income) and figured, \u201cWell, that sucks but it\u2019s not too bad.\u201d $95 is about the equivalent of a monthly cable bill for many families: annoying but hardly crippling. However, that\u2019s going up to $325 a pop for 2015 (payable in 2016) and $695 or 2.5% of income for 2016 (payable in 2017).\n\nThe big concern here is that many people will be \u201ca year behind\u201d in their thinking, either not knowing that the penalty has increased at all, or not realizing (assuming they\u2019re still not enrolled by then) that by the time they pay the tax for last year, they already owe an even higher fee for this year as well. In other words, get covered for 2016 NOW.\n\n2. HHS needs to (eventually) start pushing The Stick.\n\nAs Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Larry Levitt noted this morning, \u201clack of awareness of the mandate makes it less effective as a tool to increase enrollment.\u201d Like the \u201cDoomsday Machine\u201d in Dr. Strangelove, the whole point of any sort of incentive/penalty is lost if people don\u2019t know it exists.\n\nOf course, as Levitt also noted, they also have to proceed with caution here, because the individual mandate penalty has been among the least popular provisions of the ACA since day one, so they\u2019re obviously reluctant to push it any more than they have to.\n\nMy advice to the HHS Dept.? Keep pushing The Carrot for the next three weeks (through the December 15th deadline for January 1st coverage), but then immediately start pushing The Stick hard right up until January 31st. Remember, there\u2019s currently a grace period for the mandate tax, so those who enroll between December 16, 2015 and January 31, 2016 still won\u2019t have to pay it as long as they\u2019re covered for the year by March 1st.\n\nMy advice to everyone else? GET COVERED NOW anyway. Accidents and illnesses can happen in January or February as well, after all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 2014 individual mandate penalty of $95 is about the equivalent of a monthly cable bill for many families: annoying but hardly crippling.
