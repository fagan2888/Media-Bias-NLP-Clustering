(Remember her cover of Kanye West\u2019s \u201cStronger\u201d last season?) In it, she dances and kicks in a stairwell, lies on the floor under a metric ton of sepia filter, flips off the camera and\u2026 writes music?\u2026 while lip-syncing a heavily AutoTuned cover of Edie Brickell\u2019s \u201cWhat I Am.\u201d\n\nHere are the lyrics Marnie sings, for those who were distracted by her dancing:\n\nI\u2019m not aware of too many things\n\nI know what I know, if you know what I mean\n\nPhilosophy is the talk on a cereal box\n\nReligion is the smile on a dog\n\nI\u2019m not aware of too many things\n\nI know what I know, if you know what I mean, d-do yeah\u2026\n\nThe song was born the same year as the 25-year-old \u201cGirls\u201d characters; in 1988 it was the breakout hit for Brickell\u2019s band, Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. Brickell released two albums with New Bohemians \u2014 but \u201cWhat I Am\u201d was their signature.\n\nPerhaps the fast-rising Brickell, in 1988, was something of a spiritual predecessor to our \u201cGirls.\u201d A Los Angeles Times review of a New Bohemians performance asked whether \u201cWhat I Am\u201d reflected \u201c[d]elusions of grandeur on Brickell\u2019s part? A bit too much spinach, perhaps?\u201d But the reviewer concluded:\n\n22-year-old Brickell indeed came off as a self-assured young woman \u2014 but charmingly, not condescendingly, so. A native Texan who only began her first tour outside that state last month, Brickell seems at once both slyly insinuating and shyly guileless.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Allison Williams's ballad on \"Girls\" has a 25-year history -- beginning with singer Edie Brickell VIDEO", "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Allison Williams's ballad on \"Girls\" has a 25-year history -- beginning with singer Edie Brickell VIDEO", "title": "Inside Marnie\u2019s humiliating viral video on \u201cGirls\u201d: The story of \u201cWhat I Am\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/inside_marnies_humiliating_viral_video_on_girls_the_story_of_what_i_am/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/edie_brickell_girls.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Allison Williams's ballad on \"Girls\" has a 25-year history -- beginning with singer Edie Brickell VIDEO", "creator": "@dpd_", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/edie_brickell_girls.jpg", "title": "Inside Marnie\u2019s humiliating viral video on \u201cGirls\u201d: The story of \u201cWhat I Am\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Inside Marnie\u2019s humiliating viral video on \u201cGirls\u201d: The story of \u201cWhat I Am\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, allison williams, edie brickell, Editor's Picks, Girls, music on girls, songs on girls, Video, what i am, what was the song on girls tonight", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde399\"", "article_summary": "Topics: allison williams, edie brickell, Editor's Picks, Girls, music on girls, songs on girls, Video, what i am, what was the song on girls tonight, Entertainment NewsOn the most recent episode of \u201cGirls,\u201d Marnie\u2019s life is temporarily ruined by an embarrassing music video she shot with her ex Charlie; he\u2019s uploaded the video to the web and her attempts to get it taken down (and to ignore all the vicious comments) aren\u2019t working.\nThe video is pretty awful \u2014 the second in an ongoing series of musical humiliations for Marnie.\nA native Texan who only began her first tour outside that state last month, Brickell seems at once both slyly insinuating and shyly guileless.\nBrickell released two albums with New Bohemians \u2014 but \u201cWhat I Am\u201d was their signature.\nA bit too much spinach, perhaps?\u201d But the reviewer concluded:22-year-old Brickell indeed came off as a self-assured young woman \u2014 but charmingly, not condescendingly, so."}
