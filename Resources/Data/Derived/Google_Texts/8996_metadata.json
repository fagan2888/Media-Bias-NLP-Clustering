Everything was OK,\u201d Melissa said.\n\nKayden recovered and life was back to normal when Melissa received something in the mail from the ambulance company.\n\n\u201cSix months later, we get the bill from Cataldo and it says that we owe them $3,600,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cI was in shock. I was in awe.\u201d\n\nMelissa started making phone calls to figure out what was going on. She says the ambulance company told her that since Kayden\u2019s insurance only covered emergency ambulance rides, which are typically linked to 911 calls, she would have to pay the entire bill.\n\n\u201cWho has that type of money? Not us. It didn\u2019t seem fair, and nobody was giving me any answers. Nobody was pointing me in any type of direction. I had nowhere else to go,\u201d Melissa said.\n\nBut she did have somewhere else to go. She reached out to Solve it 7.\n\n\u201cI saw a Solve it 7 segment on the news and so I figured, well shoot, I\u2019ll try it,\u201d Melissa said.\n\nWe reached out to Cataldo Ambulance and the representative we talked to said they tried calling Melissa a few times to work with her on the bill, but they never heard back.\n\n\u201cI was completely confused,\u201d Melissa responded.\n\nMelissa told us she never received any calls on her cell phone, the only number she says she gives out. She then remembered a landline that her family added in the fall as part of a new cable bundle.\n\n\u201cI did check the voicemails and I saw that I had four of them from Cataldo. They were able to bring my bill down to $350,\u201d Melissa said.\n\nThe vice president of Cataldo gave us this statement: \u201cIn this case, like many others, we made a very concerted effort to work with the family and extended a substantial discount so they could resolve the outstanding balance in a manner they could afford.\u201d\n\nMelissa is grateful her son is safe and the bill problem has been resolved.\n\n\u201cKayden is healthy, he\u2019s doing great. We are all good. You guys really did a lot for us, so big thank you.\u201d Melissa said.\n\nIs there a problem you need help with?
