Empower patients

We talk about patient-centered care, but we really have doctor-centered care. What I want are tools that patients can use to empower themselves. Right now I'm the doctor. I have all the knowledge. I'm in control. I want to flip that dynamic. In the same way I am required by law to ask about allergies and medications, and talk about a past medical history, I want doctors to take the time to sit down, slow down and ask a patient: What's a good day for them? What's important for them? What are their values? What are their religious beliefs, their ritual beliefs? I want to know what their hopes and fears are for medical care, and where they want to spend the end of their life. I want to be required to have to ask that of all patients, at least to give them the opportunity. And sure, there may be some patients who are not ready to have that conversation, but I want them to know that I am open to having that conversation. It's the ultimate wellness pitch, I tell people: We are all going to die someday, and part of living well means addressing this life's final chapter. That's not about end of life. It's about a good life, for as long as you can, as best as you can."
