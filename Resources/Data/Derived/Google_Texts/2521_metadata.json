Following his arrest, Johnson\u2019s bail was set at $1 million.\n\nYesterday morning, Johnson chose not to speak before he was sentenced, but Morales\u2019 family did, approaching the judge armed with a poster of Morales\u2019 photos and wearing T-shirts printed with the words \u201cJustice Has Been Served.\u201d\n\nThey wept together as Lopez, Morales\u2019 mother, spoke of a long-awaited justice finally realized.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this justice for six years,\u201d she said, her voice often breaking off because of overwhelming emotion. \u201cI love my son, I love my son, I love my son.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who was represented by attorney Raymond Beam Jr., must serve at least 46 years in prison before he is eligible for parole, or when he is 73\n\nHe did not show any emotion as Isabella delivered his sentence, even when Isabella said at one point that his actions spoke to his \u201ccomplete lack of humanity and respect for our laws.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who grew up without parents starting at 5 years old, was first arrested at 8 and had a total of 27 juvenile run-ins with the law, Isabella said, noting that his record was \u201chorrendous.\u201d\n\nIsabella did not say what Johnson was arrested for at 8 years old.\n\nAfter getting his first adult conviction handed to him at 17 years old, Johnson spent most of his life in prison, Isabella said. His crimes included attempted murder, robbery, weapons offenses and aggravated assault, he said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s sentencing yesterday morning came after a long, arduous string of legal twists and turns.\n\nHis first trial in May 2011 ended in mistrial when a juror told the judge he feared for his life after three men the juror associated with Johnson showed up at his home.\n\nAfter Hurricane Sandy knocked out power to the courthouse in October 2012, the second trial was delayed, but ended with Johnson being convicted of aggravated manslaughter and robbery in the shooting death of Morales, the armed robbery of a second man and resisting arrest.\n\nThe jury was hung, however, on the more serious charges of murder and felony murder.\n\nIn February 2013, a motion for yet another trial was made by Johnson\u2019s then-attorney, Janet Costello, but was ultimately denied, D\u2019Andrea said yesterday.\n\nD\u2019Andrea said he also made a motion to try Johnson again on the murder and felony murder, but that motion was also denied by the appellate division of the court.\n\nThe two motions by the defense and the prosecution, along with other post-verdict motions, delayed Johnson\u2019s sentencing to nearly two years after the date of his conviction, D\u2019Andrea explained.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Morales\u2019 family waited patiently for the day justice would come.\n\n\u201cDo you know how many times I was crying, saying \u2019I miss you\u2019?\u201d Lopez told The Jersey Journal shortly after the sentencing. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy today. Finally, finally, finally. I know he\u2019s here with us. I feel that he was holding me.\u201d\n\nLopez said she was devoted to taking care of Morales\u2019 two sons, now ages 6 and 8. The older son, who was old enough to remember what had happened to his father, had told his mother, \u201cMommy, when I grow up, I want to be a police [officer], I want to arrest the monster who killed my daddy,\u201d Lopez said.\n\nMorales\u2019 sister, Jessica Martinez, 34, and her two daughters, Amy Castoire, 14, and Emily Lopez, 17, cried with Lopez as they all reflected on the kind of person Morales was.\n\n\u201cHis happiness,\u201d said Martinez, when asked what she remembered most about Morales, eliciting both laughs and tears from the family. \u201cHe was always smiling, always dancing.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s done, so now it\u2019s time for me to find myself again,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Jonathan Lin | The Jersey Journal", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "bayonne,jersey-city", "title": "Killer gets 55 years; victim's family says 'Justice was served'", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Killer gets 55 years; victim\\u0027s family says \\u0027Justice was served\\u0027\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/killer_gets_55_years.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/08/08/15577240-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13601958\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-09T07:00:24Z\", \"author\": \"Jonathan Lin | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"@hudson-county\",\"bayonne\",\"jersey-city\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/08/08/15577240-small.jpg", "description": "A bereaved family&#8217;s patience for justice was rewarded in a courtroom yesterday morning when a Jersey City man convicted of killing a 21-year-old man was sentenced to 55 years in prison, the maximum allowed for his charges.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, August 09, 2014, 11:13 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/08/08/15577240-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"jclin\", \"author_nickname\": \"Jonathan Lin | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"11098115\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "A bereaved family&#8217;s patience for justice was rewarded in a courtroom yesterday morning when a Jersey City man convicted of killing a 21-year-old man was sentenced to 55 years in prison, the maximum allowed for his charges.", "title": "Killer gets 55 years; victim's family says 'Justice was served'", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/killer_gets_55_years.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, August 09, 2014, 11:05 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "A bereaved family&#8217;s patience for justice was rewarded in a courtroom yesterday morning when a Jersey City man convicted of killing a 21-year-old man was sentenced to 55 years in prison, the maximum allowed for his charges."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9519\"", "article_summary": "Finally, finally, finally.\nHis crimes included attempted murder, robbery, weapons offenses and aggravated assault, he said.\nJohnson was also convicted of the armed robbery of a second victim that night and resisting arrest with force.\n\u201cHis happiness,\u201d said Martinez, when asked what she remembered most about Morales, eliciting both laughs and tears from the family.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this justice for six years,\u201d she said, her voice often breaking off because of overwhelming emotion."}
