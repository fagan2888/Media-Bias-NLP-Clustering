(The magazine, that is\u2026)\n\nThis month\u2019s edition of the Smithsonian is featuring Bill\u2019s article on Kudzu; it explodes some of the many myths about \u201cThe Green Monster.\u201d\n\nBill says kudzu was never as big of a deal that it was made out to be, and it\u2019s getting harder and harder to find! It\u2019s most common along southern roadsides, but once you go deeper into the woods, it disappears entirely.\n\nMyth number one is that kudzu is impossible to get rid of. Bill says anyone who has cows or horses or goats has no kudzu problem. Turn those animals loose on a field of kudzu and it\u2019s gone in a year. Kudzu only thrives where grazers can\u2019t go.\n\nBut there\u2019s a new type of grazer in town that Bill talks about in his article. It\u2019s called\u2014appropriately enough\u2014the kudzu bug. Bill says it smells like a combination of grape Kool-aid and stinkbug, and it LOVES kudzu.\n\nThe kudzu bug isn\u2019t eating ALL the kudzu, but Bill says it eats enough that other weeds start out-competing the kudzu in the places where it once thrived.\n\nLearn much more in the September edition of Smithsonian Magazine.
