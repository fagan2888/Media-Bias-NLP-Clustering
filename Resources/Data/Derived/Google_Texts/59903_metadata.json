The build up, with offensive dwarf pantomimes and other slights, still didn\u2019t prepare us (non-readers of the books) for the foaming-at-the-mouth, raving, paralyzing poisoning that was to come.\n\nHBO had asked critics not to mention that a pivotal episode was coming tonight, nor who was involved, so here\u2019s hoping viewers shared the surprise. The sadistic, sociopathic King Joffrey, (played by the amazing Jack Gleason), got his comeupance. His bride Margaery Tryell (Natalie Dormer) got what she should ultimately consider the wedding gift of a lifetime. Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) endured hideous abuse from the King and then ended up accused of the murder he did not commit. Sansa (Sophie Turner), who was spirited away and who last week made a strange new friend in Ser Dontos Hollard (Tony Way), may know something about this turn of events. Then again, the Red Viper, Prince Oberyn Martell, is in town for the nuptials and has pledged to repay debts. What did he mean by that, beyond acting out at the brothel last week?\n\nAfter the initial gasp, a couple of thoughts: credit to the writers-producers for being unafraid to kill off key characters in this sprawling epic. We\u2019ve known from the first that nobody on \u201cGoT\u201d is safe when it comes to shedding blood/trimming the cast. We\u2019ve seen plenty of deaths by sword; they caught us offguard here. Also, Gleason has been a consistently intriguing, fascinating presence playing this evil young royal. He will be greatly missed. And Joffrey, the most hated character in the entire series, the one who made our skin crawl, he\u2019ll be missed, too.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Game of Thrones,HBO,Joffrey and Margaery,The Lion and the Rose", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Ostrow Off The Record", "description": "Spoilers for tonights episode of \"Game of Thrones,\" which will be better remembered as Joffrey and Margaery's wedding.\r\nDo they know how to throw a wedding on this series or what?", "title": "Spoiler alert: \"Game of Thrones\" recap, \"The Lion and the Rose\"", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2014/04/13/game-thrones-recap-lion-rose/18258/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/files/2014/04/gamesofthrone.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Spoilers for tonights episode of \"Game of Thrones,\" which will be better remembered as Joffrey and Margaery's wedding.\r\nDo they know how to throw a wedding on this series or what?", "title": "Spoiler alert: \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d recap, \u201cThe Lion and the Rose\u201d", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2014/04/13/game-thrones-recap-lion-rose/18258/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/files/2014/04/gamesofthrone.jpg", "creator": "@ostrowdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Thoughts on the \"Lion and the Rose\" episode of the HBO series \"Game of Thrones\"--better known as Joffrey's wedding"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3ff\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019d barely caught our breath after last season\u2019s famed Red Wedding installment when the lovely outdoor festivities of the king\u2019s wedding left us stunned.\nHere comes a spoiler for tonight\u2019s episode of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which will be better remembered as Joffrey and Margaery\u2019s wedding.\nThe sadistic, sociopathic King Joffrey, (played by the amazing Jack Gleason), got his comeupance.\nAnd Joffrey, the most hated character in the entire series, the one who made our skin crawl, he\u2019ll be missed, too.\nDo they know how to throw a wedding on this series or what?"}
