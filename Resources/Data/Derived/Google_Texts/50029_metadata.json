Their land allotment will grow along with the herd, the tribe said, with 1,000 more acres reserved, the Cherokee said in a media release. The females will be joined by 10 bulls in a week, the tribe said.\n\n\u201cFor most of us, the American bison symbolizes our great country\u2014free, strong and resilient. Those are the traits we identify in ourselves as Indian people,\u201d said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker in the statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why the bison has always represented something deeply spiritual to our tribal ancestors and why it\u2019s important for us to reintroduce bison within our homelands. Today, we are able to reconnect the Cherokee Nation with a prominent part of our history and our cultural roots.\u201d\n\nThe new arrivals capped a multi-year effort by the Cherokee to obtain bison. Last week the tribe announced that it had been awarded a few small herds by the InterTribal Buffalo Council, whose aim is to restore bison to traditional lands.\n\nRELATED: The Mighty Bison Returns to Cherokee Nation\n\n\u201cIt is a historic event here in the Cherokee Nation,\u201d said InterTribal Buffalo Council President Ervin Carlson. \u201cOur main purpose is to return bison back to Indian Country, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. It\u2019s a big part of our culture since we are connected to them spiritually, so for the Cherokee Nation it\u2019s a great day, and for us as well, to bring bison to their Nation.\u201d\n\nLocal station KOTV's NewsOn6 reported on the event.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Greeted with a welcome blessing, 38 female bison trundled their way down a ramp from a tractor-trailer onto Cherokee Nation land on Thursday October 9, ending a 900-mile journeyBison arrive on the Cherokee Nation for the first time in more than 40 years, with 38 female American buffalo from Badlands National Pk.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/11/video-watch-38-bison-set-foot-cherokee-nation-land-157304", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/badlandsbison-cherokee_nation.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Video: Watch 38 Bison Set Foot on Cherokee Nation Land"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-10-11T10:30-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Video: Watch 38 Bison Set Foot on Cherokee Nation Land"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/11/video-watch-38-bison-set-foot-cherokee-nation-land-157304", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Bison, Cherokee, Cherokee Nation, Endangered Species, Intertribal Buffalo Council, Badlands National Park, Native American culture", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 5}, "dcterms.title": "Video: Watch 38 Bison Set Foot on Cherokee Nation Land"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd597\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: The Mighty Bison Returns to Cherokee Nation\u201cIt is a historic event here in the Cherokee Nation,\u201d said InterTribal Buffalo Council President Ervin Carlson.\nJust after sunrise the magnificent animals were munching on grass in their new home on 66 acres of tribal land near Kenwood in Delaware County, Oklahoma.\nGreeted with a welcome blessing, 38 female bison trundled their way down a ramp from a tractor-trailer onto Cherokee Nation land on Thursday October 9, ending a 900-mile journey from Badlands National Park in South Dakota.\nThose are the traits we identify in ourselves as Indian people,\u201d said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker in the statement.\nToday, we are able to reconnect the Cherokee Nation with a prominent part of our history and our cultural roots.\u201dThe new arrivals capped a multi-year effort by the Cherokee to obtain bison."}
