And we thought, \u2018It\u2019ll be so bizarre for us and the crowd, so let\u2019s do it!\u2019 But then it became like a memorial tour and a way to raise money for his family.\u201d\n\nThe \u201chis family\u201d in question is that of Robert Casale, a.k.a. Bob 2, Gerald\u2019s brother and longtime Devo guitarist/keyboardist who died of heart failure in February at age 61.\n\n\u201cBob\u2019s family was destitute because he didn\u2019t have insurance and there\u2019s all these catastrophic care bills because he was trying to get Obamacare right when it happened,\u201d Casale said. \u201cSo we started a donation site that Pearl Jam and Shepard Fairey put on their sites. But that wasn\u2019t enough to help with (Bob\u2019s) family not losing their house.\u201d\n\nCasale had already pitched the idea for a \u201cHardcore Devo\u201d tour, as the band\u2019s 1974-1977 period has come to be known, which would consist exclusively of songs originally recorded on four-track tape machines in the basements of Akron, Ohio, where Devo formed.\n\nBut with the renewed emphasis on fundraising for Casale\u2019s late brother\u2019s family \u2014 and the prospect of reviving twitchy art-punk masterpieces like \u201cJocko Homo,\u201d \u201cMongoloid\u201d and \u201cMidget\u201d \u2014 lead singer Mark Mothersbaugh and the rest of Devo decided it was high time for a \u201cHardcore\u201d return.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll even be more raw and more primitive because we\u2019re doing it as a four-piece,\u201d Casale said of the tour, which plays Denver\u2019s Summit Music Hall on June 23. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t possibly short-term think of putting somebody else on stage to play Bob\u2019s parts. But we started as a raw, experimental art band and we were kind of like the White Stripes or the Black Keys when they were still in diapers, so we think we can pull this off. It\u2019ll be intense, and it won\u2019t be slick, but it\u2019ll be catchy and mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nCasale\u2019s confidence is well-deserved. He\u2019s directed most of Devo\u2019s music videos (including the bondage-themed, MTV-era classic \u201cWhip It\u201d) and collaborated on almost every other aspect of Devo\u2019s famously nerdy, creepy visual aesthetic.\n\nBut even without the band\u2019s usual theatrics, Casale thinks the \u201cHardcore\u201d-era songs will stand on their own and act as a fitting tribute to the inspiration behind the tour.\n\n\u201cDevo was always about being somewhat intentionally infantile and transgressive and disrespectful and politically incorrect,\u201d Casale, 65, said. \u201cWe\u2019re older now, but luckily most of the songs are so whacked-out and conceptual that it\u2019s not like we\u2019re touring as a group who made our fortune doing \u2018Jessie\u2019s Girl.\u2019 Devo songs were never really of-their-time.
