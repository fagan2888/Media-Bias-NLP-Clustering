Rick Scott on Tuesday stepped up his opposition to the Senate plan to expand Medicaid to cover 800,000 low-income Floridians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThere is no support in the House. I\u2019m not going to support it. It\u2019s not a program that has worked.\u201d\n\nThe annual legislative session ended Friday night, with no budget agreement and after the House walked away three days earlier \u2013 in move that violated the state constitution. The impasse was the result of a $4 billion difference in the legislative budget bills and the House\u2019s adamant opposition to the Senate\u2019s plan to offer private insurance through a Medicaid expansion.\n\nScott said he is studying all his options, including calling lawmakers back into a special session to pass a bare-bones budget to keep the state operating when the new budget year begins on July 1. The Senate has proposed a June 1-20 special session that would include consideration of a new state budget and Medicaid expansion, although the House has not agreed to the agenda.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m looking at,\u201d Scott said about calling back lawmakers himself. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get a budget done by the end of June. I\u2019m going to make sure we continue to run the state. So I\u2019ll do what the right thing is for our citizens.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s comments in opposition to the Senate\u2019s Florida Health Insurance Affordability Exchange Program (FHIX) are the strongest yet since he reversed his position earlier this spring and came out against Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCritics say Scott bears responsibility for the impasse because of the mixed messages he has sent: opposing Medicaid expansion after the Affordable Care Act was approved, then favoring the expansion in 2013, then reversing himself.\n\nNow, Scott\u2019s clear alignment with the House position could complicate finding a compromise with the Senate on the health care funding impasse.\n\nThe Senate had advanced its exchange program plan as way to provide insurance to more low-income Floridians, anticipating the demise or reduction of the $2.2 billion federal program, known as the low-income pool (LIP), that compensates Florida hospitals for their care of the uninsured.\n\nA spokeswoman for Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, said the Senate remains \u201ccommitted to advancing long-term solutions to address health care coverage for low-income Floridians.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Senate advanced FHIX as a free-market, consumer-driven solution with conservative guard rails to protect Florida taxpayers if the federal government fails to meet its commitments,\u201d Katie Betta said.\n\n\u201cThe president (Gardiner) is open to other ideas for long-term solutions to address health care coverage for low-income Floridians. Currently, the Senate\u2019s FHIX proposal is the only option on the table,\u201d she added.\n\nScott, whose administration formally asked for an extension of LIP in late April, has become embroiled in a lawsuit with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) over LIP and its linkage to Medicaid expansion.\n\nScott, along with Attorney General Pam Bondi, has filed a lawsuit alleging the federal government is violating a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that states could not be \u201ccoerced\u201d into expanding Medicaid. Texas and Kansas, which have not expanded Medicaid and have similar hospital funding programs, are supporting Florida\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nScott opened his meeting with the Cabinet on Tuesday by praising Bondi for her role in the lawsuit and saying it was \u201cwrong\u201d for the federal government \u201cto try to force us to expand Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot coerce a state into expanding Medicaid,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue, Medicaid expansion, that needs to be decided by our lawmakers not by the federal government. The Supreme Court has spoken loud and clear on that issue.\u201d\n\nYet with the lawsuit against HHS as a backdrop, Scott is traveling to Washington, D.C., to meet with the head of that federal agency, Sylvia Burwell, today to request her agency continue to fund Florida\u2019s $2.2 billion LIP program.\n\nScott said he had no qualms about the lawsuit and the state\u2019s advocacy for continuing the hospital funding program.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be doing what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is illegal.\u201d\n\nIn a related action, Scott issued an executive order on Tuesday creating a Commission on Healthcare and Hospital Funding, which he said could help guide his office and lawmakers as they deal with the health care funding issues and the new state budget.\n\nThe commission, which will be appointed by Scott, will look at \u201cthe role of taxpayer funding for hospitals, insurers and health care providers.\u201d It will also look at the affordability, access and quality of health care services that is supported by public funding.\n\nScott, a former private hospital executive who has been skeptical about the role of public hospitals, said the commission would also look at how much \u201ctaxpayer-funded hospitals\u201d pay for lobbyists, campaign contributions and advertising.\n\nThe governor\u2019s order did not specify the size of the commission or give any indication of its timetable. Scott created a similar commission in 2011 that concluded that public hospitals have a role in Florida\u2019s health care system.\n\nThe head of the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, which represents the hospitals that provide of the bulk of uncompensated care to low-income Floridians, said the hospitals would work with the new commission.\n\n\u201cFlorida\u2019s safety net hospitals are transparent and accountable and look forward to sharing with the commission how they achieve operational efficiencies while providing high-quality healthcare to all patients seeking treatment, regardless of their ability to pay,\u201d said Tony Carvalho, president of the hospital group.\n\nCarvalho said the group hopes to have some of its members on Scott\u2019s commission and he said the group would continue to advocate for financial support for the hospitals that have large caseloads of uncompensated care.\n\n\u201cWe encourage Gov. Scott to advocate for Florida's fair share of supplemental healthcare funding in the LIP replacement model to maintain current levels of support for our state\u2019s healthcare safety net services and programs,\u201d Carvalho said.\n\nEARLIER: With the 2015 legislative session in shambles and a government shutdown looming, Gov.
