ATLANTIC CITY â€” The largest casino workers union in Atlantic City took a step toward going on strike at the Taj Mahal.

Eighty percent of the roughly 1,000 Local 54 members who voted Thursday gave the OK to the union's contract committee to call for a strike should it deem it necessary, it said in a news release.

The union represents bartenders, cooks, housekeepers and bellmen but not card dealers.

Trump Entertainment Resorts owns the property now, but lender Carl Icahn is taking ownership as it comes out of bankruptcy. Last year, the casino ended pension and health insurance for its unionized workers. That decision has been the center of litigation that's now being contemplated by the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.

Icahn has said he'll cut of funding and close the casino if courts force the restoration of benefits.

"Carl Icahn may have thought that workers in Atlantic City would turn a blind eye to his abusing the employees at the Taj," Bob McDevitt, president of Local 54, said in a statement Friday. "He may have thought that Taj employees would have just been happy to have a job, but this vote shows that the men and women at the Taj are ready to fight to defend the kind of jobs that were promised when gaming was legalized- jobs with good pay and good benefits, in a workplace where everyone is treated fairly."

The National Labor Relations Board has received 20 complaints against the Taj Mahal for such alleged unlawful actions as threatening workers, changing schedules, changing workloads and restricting union access.

In 2004, about 10,000 members of Local 54 went on strike at seven properties in Atlantic City for 34 days.

Icahn's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Associated Press

Four Atlantic City casinos closed last year. Eight remain open.
