A talk with Rep. Jan Schakowsky, sponsor of a bill to make permanent America\u2019s commitment to abused women worldwide.\n\nA strong liberal and a feminist, Illinois Democrat Jan Schakowsky worked hard to win bipartisan backing for the International Women Against Violence Act. It was touch and go until Thursday morning, when just hours before she was scheduled to introduce the bill on the House floor, two upstate New York Republicans, Reps. Richard Hanna and Chris Gibson, agreed to sign on to the legislation known as I-VAWA, which Schakowsky says \u201cwould make ending violence against women a pillar in foreign policy\u2026 to be considered in all things that we do.\u201d\n\nSchakowsky calls Hillary Clinton as secretary of State \u201ca major force in making sure the mindfulness about women was there,\u201d but says statutes are needed to make permanent the Office for Global Women\u2019s Issues in the State Department, led by an ambassador-at-large, and to create a senior coordinator for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment at the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nIn a political climate where the votes of women are prized, you\u2019d think I-VAWA would be a no-brainer. Crafted in part to meet Republican demands, the bill calls for no new federal money. Still, it raises alarm bells. \u201cOne of the things Republicans are hesitant about is seeing health and women in the same sentence,\u201d Schakowsky told The Daily Beast in an interview Wednesday evening in her office. \u201cThey think it\u2019s about reproductive rights and abortion. Most are not even supportive of contraceptives abroad, which is astounding,\u201d she added.\n\nAnother buzzword that arouses GOP suspicions: empowerment. \u201cI was once told that meant empowering women to have abortions,\u201d says the aide who was working on securing Republican backing.\n\nSchakowsky recalls that when she entered Congress in 1999, there was an active bipartisan pro-choice caucus. Now only one of those Republicans is left\u2014New York\u2019s Hanna\u2014yet she remains convinced that the recent raft of antiabortion measures around the country and in Congress represent a \u201clast gasp\u201d by the GOP. \u201cI honestly think this is desperation, that they have lost the war on these social issues.\u201d\n\nHeartened by the support she got from Hanna and Gibson,\u2014the only two Republicans who broke with their party to vote against delaying the Affordable Care Act in the leadup to the government shutdown\u2014Schakowsky says, \u201cIf we can just break through to a couple of them and break the logjam, they can all hold hands together and come on the bill.\u201d\n\nThere is a correlation between the status of women and the level of violence, and I-VAWA would identify between five and 20 countries where violence against women is severe, making them eligible for training programs and assistance. \u201cIf I were just talking politics, we want Republicans to look for things that reach out to women and reflect women\u2019s priorities. This isn\u2019t such a big stretch to go internationally,\u201d she says, noting that a minority of House Republicans joined Democrats to pass the Violence Against Women Act in February, the domestic version of the I-VAWA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping this isn\u2019t a \u2018gotcha\u2019 bill,\u201d she continues, \u201cthat it falls more into the Violence Against Women category as something Republicans should be able to support. I\u2019d rather it not be a defining issue, but I can\u2019t read their minds anymore.\u201d As we neared the end of the interview, Schakowsky asked, \u201cHave you ever put on a burka?\u201d She described a burka that she keeps at home that she invites visitors, women and men, to try on so they know what it\u2019s like. She describes the garment as sky blue polyester with a rectangular mesh opening for the eyes, which doesn\u2019t allow peripheral vision. \u201cIt\u2019s such a feeling of disappearing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can imagine how you can feel safe in it at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe I-VAWA failed to get the necessary votes in 2010, so this is the second attempt to rally support in the House. Asked how she came to embrace this cause, Schakowsky cites the women and children she sees, and their great needs, when she travels around the world, to Afghanistan, India, and Congo. \u201cAnd when I speak to women here\u2014the most empowered women in the world\u2014I tell them our sisters need us to stand up for them and think about them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "eleanorclift"}, "keywords": "Congress, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201311221045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "It should be a no-brainer for any legislator seeking female votes.
