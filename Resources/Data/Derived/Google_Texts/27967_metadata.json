Ex-gov announces bid for Congress\n\nFormer Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards officially announced he is running for Congress on Monday, hoping to recharge a political career after serving nearly a decade in prison on federal corruption charges.\n\nEdwards announced his bid Monday at a weekly meeting of the Baton Rouge Press Club, ending months of speculation as to whether the 86-year-old former governor, convict and reality star would run for the vacant Baton Rouge-area seat.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given a great deal of thought to do this, I\u2019ve read articles from pundits \u2026 and I acknowledge there are good reasons why I should not run,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cBut there are better reasons why I should, and good reasons should give way to better reasons. Therefore I will be a candidate for Congress from the 6th Congressional District this year.\u201d\n\nReports trickled out last month that the Democrat was seriously considering jumping into the race to replace Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who is not running for reelection in order to challenge Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) for her seat in the upper chamber, but Edwards\u2019s 35-year-old wife, Trina, cautioned he had not made his final decision.\n\nHis wife joined him Monday for the announcement, as did their infant son. He said he had not made a final decision \u201cuntil recently\u201d and wanted to announce it before the entire press corps at once.\n\nEdwards poked fun at his age and criminal record in his announcement Monday. He said the Constitution requires that a person who wants to run for Congress be at least 25 years old.\n\n\u201cAnd clearly, I meet that qualification,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThere\u2019s a guy in Florida, 101 years old running, and by the time I am his age, I\u2019ll be in my seventh term.\u201d\n\nEdwards said if he is elected, he wants to serve on the Public Works Committee and Agriculture Committee to help his home state economy. He also took some conservative positions, including being against Obamacare and for the Keystone pipeline.\n\n\u201cI did not vote for Obama \u2014 where I was at the time there were no voting machines,\u201d Edwards said, alluding to his federal prison sentence. \u201cBut I would not have voted for Obamacare were I in Washington, not because I don\u2019t agree with the intent \u2026 because it is too fraught with pitfalls and unknown dangers.\u201d\n\nHe said if he were to go to Congress, he would try to work across the aisle and fix the partisanship in Washington today.\n\n\u201cAll they do is argue and complain and cry and nothing is accomplished,\u201d Edwards said, saying thanks to his \u201cCajun mother\u2019s advice and attitude, I have learned to work with people of other situations.\u201d\n\nEdwards also rejected that he was running for the seat, in a Republican district, in an effort to boost turnout for Landrieu\u2019s reelection bid, saying he and Landrieu have not spoken \u201cone word\u201d about their campaigns.\n\n\u201cI assume that we will both benefit from our respective candidacies, but frankly, I thought for a long time about running for her seat. I determined not to do it because I just didn\u2019t want another statewide race, spend that much time with it,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cI assume we\u2019ll help each other, but she\u2019s running her race and I\u2019m running mine.\u201d\n\nBefore serving four terms as governor of Louisiana, Edwards was a member of the House of Representatives for seven years.\n\nEdwards was convicted in 2000 of extorting businesses applying for casino licenses.\n\nOn Monday, Edwards maintained that he did nothing to corrupt the public office he held, and said the trial was not about his governorship.\n\n\u201cIt was not about Edwin Edwards the governor. It was about Edwin Edwards who was a friend of people who, for reasons of their own, falsely testified about our relationship after I was out of the governor\u2019s office,\u201d Edwards said.\n\nA poll taken after his release in 2011 found him the second-most popular governor in the state since 1980, with 30 percent saying he was the best governor in that time, 5 points behind incumbent Gov. Bobby Jindal.\n\nHe is the first serious Democrat to announce his candidacy for the seat.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Edwin Edwards aims to recharge his career in Louisiana after serving nearly a decade in prison.", "title": "Ex-gov announces bid for Congress", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/edwin-edwards-louisiana-ex-gov-to-announce-bid-for-congress-104732.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2012/01/120129_edwin_edwards_605_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,2014 Elections,Louisiana,Edwin Edwards", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Edwin Edwards aims to recharge his career in Louisiana after serving nearly a decade in prison.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9dd7\"", "article_summary": "Edwin Edwards officially announced he is running for Congress on Monday, hoping to recharge a political career after serving nearly a decade in prison on federal corruption charges.\nHe said the Constitution requires that a person who wants to run for Congress be at least 25 years old.\nEx-gov announces bid for CongressFormer Louisiana Gov.\n\u201cIt was not about Edwin Edwards the governor.\nStory Continued Below\u201cI\u2019ve given a great deal of thought to do this, I\u2019ve read articles from pundits \u2026 and I acknowledge there are good reasons why I should not run,\u201d Edwards said."}
