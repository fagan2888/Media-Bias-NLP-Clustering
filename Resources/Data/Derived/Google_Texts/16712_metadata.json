Now I worry how long I\u2019ll live.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor almost seven years I have fought and survived Stage 4 gallbladder cancer, with a five-year survival rate of less than 2 percent after diagnosis,\u201d she said.\n\nHer op-ed, which received significant attention from conservatives online, comes as millions of Americans are being dropped from their health insurance plans because of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\n\nSundby will be released from her current plan effective Dec. 31. She said her only options going forward are to either enroll in Obamacare and lose her cancer doctors, or to start her treatment all over again with a new provider at rates that are approximately 40 to 50 percent more expensive.\n\nWorse than just losing her doctors through Obamacare, Sundby said, is that nothing available through the government-run program comes even close to comparing with what she had through her private insurer.\n\nAnd on top of that, Covered California, the Golden State\u2019s Obamacare insurance exchange, is nearly inoperable.\n\n\u201cAfter four weeks of researching plans on the website, talking directly to government exchange counselors, insurance companies and medical providers, my insurance broker and I are as confused as ever. Time is running out and we still don\u2019t have a clue how to best proceed,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe Obama administration and supporters of the president\u2019s health care law have urged consumers to be patient as officials address the many errors with the Obamacare websites.\n\nSundby explained her soon-to-be-lost plan: \u201cSince March 2007 United Healthcare has paid $1.2 million to help keep me alive, and it has never once questioned any treatment or procedure recommended by my medical team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company pays a fair price to the doctors and hospitals, on time, and is responsive to the emergency treatment requirements of late-stage cancer. Its caring people in the claims office have been readily available to talk to me and my providers,\u201d she said.\n\nBut, she said, she was informed in January that United would be dropping her from her current plan because of the impending health care law and it was suggested she enroll in the state\u2019s online exchange. But Obamacare just doesn\u2019t offer her the same options as her previous plan, forcing her to choose between Stanford University, which has \u201ckept (her) alive,\u201d and the University of California, San Diego, where her primary-care doctors are located.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to the president\u2019s promise, \u2018You can keep your health plan\u2019? Or to the promise that \u2018You can keep your doctor\u2019?\u201d she asked. \u201cThanks to the law, I have been forced to give up a world-class health plan. The exchange would force me to give up a world-class physician.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a cancer patient, medical coverage is a matter of life and death,\u201d she said. \u201cTake away people\u2019s ability to control their medical-coverage choices and they may die. I guess that\u2019s a highly effective way to control medical costs. Perhaps that\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nClick here to read full Sundby\u2019s op-ed.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nThis post has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "A San Diego woman says she has been kicked off her insurance plan due to Obamacare while battling Stage 4 gallbladder cancer.  \u201cI had great cancer doctors and health insurance,\u201d Edie Littlefield Sundby wrote in a Sunday Wall Street Journal op-ed. \u201cMy plan was canceled.
