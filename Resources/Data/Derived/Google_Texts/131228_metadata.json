However, University President Margaret McKenna -- a liberal now under fire for marginalizing a conservative voice -- insisted in an earlier interview that the campus features a \u201cvariety\u201d of political viewpoints.\n\nTuerck and McKenna made their remarks to Boston Herald Radio's Newsfeed hosts Zuri Berry and Joe Dwinell in separate, back-to-back phone interviews this afternoon.\n\nTuerck said the Obamacare project nixed by the university was aimed at studying the effects of the controversial health care law on employment across the United States. It was to be co-authored by University of Chicago economics professor Casey Mulligan.\n\n\u201cThat got turned down,\u201d said Tuerck. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but that is the environment in which we\u2019ve been operating.\u201d\n\nTuerck said Suffolk officials have tried to \u201cshut me up\u201d over the past 10 years for his organization\u2019s conservative viewpoints and for his comments over the years to the Herald.\n\n\u201cThere were past attempts at censorship of us, which I fought off but became at a minimum an irritant,\u201d said Tuerck. \u201cI don\u2019t blame anyone in charge now for those episodes. Those took place over a period of time, and I don\u2019t want to go into details, but there were attempts to shut me up, especially when I was talking to the Herald. A lot of people there didn\u2019t like what I was saying.\u201d\n\nTuerck said the censorship attempts began a decade ago. He characterized them as efforts \u201cto control what I say based on public relations or political considerations.\u201d\n\nMcKenna, who took over 6 months ago, said she\u2019s never met Tuerck, but insisted the campus is a place for a wide range of political perspectives.\n\n\u201cIf I found out there was anything done here that would in any way interfere with our students hearing about a variety of views, ideologies and philosophies, I would make sure that that would never happen,\u201d said McKenna. \u201cA good education depends on our students being exposed to the widest varieties and philosophies, otherwise it\u2019s not a good education, and we would be negligent.\u201d\n\nTuerck said he sent an email citing his concerns to McKenna requesting a meeting with her, but was not offered one. Instead, McKenna referred his complaints to the university's provost.\n\nTuerck is now planning to make the Beacon Hill Institute completely independent of the university, though he said he is saddened that that likely means no longer working with school faculty and students.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in going back,\u201d said Tuerck. \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave and I can\u2019t imagine how anybody at Suffolk could convince me to stick around after this episode. I\u2019ve just had enough.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beacon Hill Institute projects vetoed by Suffolk University included an Obamacare study involving a prominent University of Chicago economist, BHI", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "parsely-page": "{\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bostonherald.com\\/news\\/local_coverage\\/herald_bulldog\\/2015\\/12\\/beacon_hill_institute_chief_obamacare_study_spiked_by\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"1065056514\",\"title\":\"Beacon Hill Institute chief: Obamacare study spiked by Suffolk U.\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-02T21:15:00Z\",\"tags\":[\"Beacon Hill Institute\",\"Suffolk University\",\"David Tuerck\",\"section-News\"],\"authors\":[\"Chris Cassidy\"],\"section\":\"News\"}", "twitter": {"description": "Beacon Hill Institute projects vetoed by Suffolk University included an Obamacare study involving a prominent University of Chicago economist, BHI", "card": "summary", "title": "Beacon Hill Institute chief: Obamacare study spiked by Suffolk U."}, "og": {"image": "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/gallery/public/media/2015/12/01/120115davidtuerck.jpg?itok=5ons5RqX", "description": "Beacon Hill Institute projects vetoed by Suffolk University included an Obamacare study involving a prominent University of Chicago economist, BHI director David Tuerck told Boston Herald Radio today -- adding that he had been chided for his comments to the Herald in the past.", "title": "Beacon Hill Institute chief: Obamacare study spiked by Suffolk U."}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597309570500616}, "viewport": "maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A lot of people there didn\u2019t like what I was saying.\u201dTuerck said the censorship attempts began a decade ago.\nTuerck said his institute has long been the target of \u201cattempts at censorship\u201d by Suffolk.\nBeacon Hill Institute projects vetoed by Suffolk University included an Obamacare study involving a prominent University of Chicago economist, BHI director David Tuerck told Boston Herald Radio today -- adding that he had been chided for his comments to the Herald in the past.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to leave and I can\u2019t imagine how anybody at Suffolk could convince me to stick around after this episode.\nTuerck and McKenna made their remarks to Boston Herald Radio's Newsfeed hosts Zuri Berry and Joe Dwinell in separate, back-to-back phone interviews this afternoon."}
