Richard Burr touts health care law replacement\n\nSam Shaw | Published 02/10/15 11:48pm\n\nU.S. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., is a co-sponsor of legislation that he describes as a \u201cbicameral Republican blueprint.\u201d The Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility and Empowerment Act would keep aspects of the current health care law \u2014 it would allow adults to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance plan until age 26 \u2014 but it drops the requirement for Americans to buy insurance.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments related to the Affordable Care Act this spring and could overturn significant portions of it, including the individual mandate.\n\n\u201cThere is a good chance that Congress will need to pass a bill this year responding to the Court\u2019s decision,\u201d said John Dinan, political science professor at Wake Forest University.\n\nHe said Republicans are working on the bill to make changes to areas of the law the Supreme Court might object to.\n\nGary Pearce, a Democratic analyst, said Republicans now hold the reins of power in Congress \u2014 though the party doesn\u2019t have a large enough majority to overcome a filibuster or presidential veto.\n\n\u201cThey can pass pretty much whatever they want to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll end up going down the tubes when it gets to the White House.\u201d\n\nThe idea behind the individual insurance mandate was originally a Republican idea, Pearce said, because it promotes personal responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe people who don\u2019t have insurance \u2014 (taxpayers) end up paying for their care,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, sought to remedy this shortcoming and drive down costs. It requires Americans to purchase insurance or pay a tax penalty. It provides subsidies for those who could not otherwise afford insurance and funds expanded Medicaid coverage in states that will accept it.\n\nAs of Friday, 480,000 North Carolina residents had signed up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The state hasn\u2019t accepted Medicaid expansion, though Gov. Pat McCrory suggested in January that he would be open to it.\n\nBurr said the Affordable Care Act has made healthcare worse because it increased the weight of bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cWe can lower costs and expand access to quality coverage and care by empowering individuals and their families to make their own health care decisions, rather than having the federal government make those decisions for them,\u201d said Burr in a statement Thursday.\n\nBurr will have to defend his Senate seat in 2016, and Pearce said the latest health care proposal was political theater.\n\n\u201cBurr is doing exactly what Tillis did in last year\u2019s campaign, which is saying \u2018I\u2019m against Obama,\u2019\u201d Pearce said.\n\nstate@dailytarheel.com\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "After years of opposing the Affordable Care Act and organizing more than 50 votes to repeal it, Republicans are using their majority in Congress to push for a replacement.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Tar Heel", "description": "After years of opposing the Affordable Care Act and organizing more than 50 votes to repeal it, Republicans are using their majority in Congress to push for a replacement.", "title": "Sen.
