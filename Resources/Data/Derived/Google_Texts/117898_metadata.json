Kevin Brady (R-Texas) and Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) sent letters to the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of the Treasury and Office of Management and Budget asking them to produce subpoenaed documents related to the cost-sharing reduction program, which the administration has not produced because of the House-sought lawsuit over the program.\n\nThe program in question relates to deductibles, co-pays and other means of cost-sharing for insurers under the Affordable Care Act. The administration has argued that the 2010 health care law authorizes such expenditures, but Republicans argued in court that such funding was not appropriated by Congress.\n\nSince a district judge ruled in favor of the House in its lawsuit against the Obama administration, the officials should now turn over the documents, Brady and Upton write. They had maintained the litigation was not a reason for the administration to delay sharing the information.\n\n\u201cMuch of the Administration\u2019s objection to the Committees\u2019 oversight is seemingly rated in its purported concerns about disclosing information related to the ongoing litigation brought by the House regarding the cost sharing reduction program,\u201d they wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell. \u201cThose objections notwithstanding, however, the district court has rendered its decision the merits of the case.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice has said it would appeal the ruling.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "Two House committee chairmen\u00a0again on Monday called\u00a0on the Obama administration to provide documents related to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s cost-sharing reduction program.
