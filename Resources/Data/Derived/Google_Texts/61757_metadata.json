In the lawsuit that followed in federal court there, U.S. District Judge William Conley enjoined enforcement of the provision and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted before, doctors have been among the most vocal critics of such provisions. As several contended in the Wisconsin case:\n\nDoctors providing services submitted letters from hospitals rejecting their requests for admitting privileges mostly because they wouldn\u2019t admit the number of patients required. Hospitals normally require physicians with admitting privileges to admit a certain number of patients each year and with complications of abortions being rare, those minimum admission rates would never be met by doctors performing abortion. The law requiring hospital admitting privileges only applies to abortion providers. Those providing outpatient surgery, oral surgery, or other outpatient procedures are not required to have admitting privileges.\n\nThey\u2019ve also argued that admitting privileges are not necessary, since patients in distress are sent to the emergency room, where they are treated by physicians there.\n\nIn North Carolina, an admitting privileges requirement was one of several abortion restrictions proposed early in the 2013 long session but dropped from the bill ultimately signed into law, pending the adoption of regulations by the Department of Health and Human Services. That process has since been stalled.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6ba\"", "article_summary": "The law requiring hospital admitting privileges only applies to abortion providers.\nThose providing outpatient surgery, oral surgery, or other outpatient procedures are not required to have admitting privileges.\nIn June, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked efforts by Wisconsin\u2019s Attorney General to reinstate a state law requiring that abortion providers have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.\nThey\u2019ve also argued that admitting privileges are not necessary, since patients in distress are sent to the emergency room, where they are treated by physicians there.\nFor the second time in days, a federal judge has ruled as unconstitutional state provisions requiring doctors who perform abortions at clinics to have admitting privileges at local hospitals."}
