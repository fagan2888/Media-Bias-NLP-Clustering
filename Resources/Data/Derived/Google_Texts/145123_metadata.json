Yet the Vatican\u2019s subsequent remarks made it crystal clear that you did indeed mean to reject Trump\u2019s claim to be a Christian.\n\nAfter assuring the public that your comments should in no way be understood as \u201ca personal attack\u201d or \u201can indication of voting,\u201d your spokesperson at the Vatican added that \u201cthe Pope said what we all know, when we follow his teaching and his position: that we should not build walls but bridges. He has always said this, continuously, and he has said this about the issues of migration in Europe, many times.\n\n\u201cTherefore the key point is welcome\u2014the building of bridges instead of walls\u2014that is characteristic of this Pontificate. It must be interpreted and understood in this way\u201d (emphases added).\n\nSo, Holy Father, the reporter who initially questioned you about Trump\u2019s stance on immigration in effect got it right: Trump is indeed in favor of deporting millions of illegal immigrants, and he is indeed in favor of erecting a wall. Admittedly, Trump does not intend on separating families, as this reporter dishonestly said. But you never spoke to this aspect of Trump\u2019s policy; you spoke only to Trump\u2019s view on the construction of a wall.\n\nAnd now we know that you didn\u2019t express a problem with people who only want to build walls. You believe that anyone who wants to build walls per se is not a Christian.\n\nFrancis, it brings this Catholic no satisfaction to suspect that the heir to Saint Peter is using this holy office to advance a political agenda. How can such suspicions not arise? After all, you made the unprecedented move to single out an American citizen\u2014an American presidential candidate with millions of supporters\u2014as a faux Christian for wanting to secure his country\u2019s borders.\n\nMoreover, not only have you refrained from questioning the Christianity of such leftist politicians as, say, President Barack Obama; you have been photographed smiling ear to ear with this man who has not only supported the slaughter of tens of millions of unborn human beings who would otherwise have been born if not for Roe v. Wade, but who three times voted against the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act.\n\nThe latter, in case you didn\u2019t know, is a law that would have provided protections to infants who survived botched abortion attempts. As things currently stand, such infants must be allowed to die.\n\nThis same person also bequeathed to us his infamous \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d\u2014more ominously, and accurately, known as Obamacare\u2014a law for which not a single member of American\u2019s other national party voted and which requires Catholic and other Christian employers to subsidize both contraceptive and, worse, abortion services for their employees.\n\nAnd it also coerces all taxpayers to do the same.\n\nAgain, from you, Your Holiness, we heard nothing.\n\nObama is the first president to have endorsed \u201csame-sex marriage.\u201d\n\nYet I don\u2019t recall you saying of Obama that he is not a Christian.\n\nOf course, Obama is hardly the only politician in the United States who has supported such things. The point, though, is that you have never challenged the Christian bona fides of anyone who has advocated on behalf of such policies.\n\nChristians throughout the Middle East and Africa are being butchered, enslaved, raped, and pillaged by their Muslim oppressors\u2014and yet, Holy Father, you choose instead to use your global influence to shame the West about \u201cclimate change,\u201d \u201cinequality,\u201d and the West\u2019s reluctance to allow still more immigrants into its lands.\n\nNor do you ever, ever emit a syllable to the immigrant about his responsibility, his duty, to express gratitude\u2014lots and lots of gratitude\u2014to his hosts.\n\nSpeaking as a Roman Catholic Christian, Your Eminence, I confess to finding the uniquely harsh nature of your judgment concerning Donald Trump\u2019s religiosity and the fact that it was a position on, of all things, border security that aroused your ire to be deeply troubling.\n\nYour moral priorities as a man, and a Christian, are wildly out of order.\n\nGiven that you have resources in exposure and influence that most of us can only dream of, this is a real tragedy for the countless millions of victims the world over whose plight may have been altered if only you spoke on their behalf.\n\nRemember, as a wise man once said, \u201cThe only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\u201d\n\nSincerely,\n\nJack Kerwick", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dear Holy Father, As everyone by now knows, because of Donald Trumps position on immigration and his desire to build a wall along Americas southern border, you said of him that he is not a Christian..05/26/2016 20:28:24PM EST.", "author": "Jack Kerwick", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Dear Holy Father, As everyone by now knows, because of Donald Trumps position on immigration and his desire to build a wall along Americas southern border, you said of him that he is not a Christian.", "title": "Jack Kerwick - A Catholic's Letter to Pope Francis", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/jackkerwick/2016/02/25/a-catholics-letter-to-pope-francis-n2124622", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/49/7f26bee5-65f8-4d3c-98d2-aa90aa1ed641.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Dear Holy Father, As everyone by now knows, because of Donald Trumps position on immigration and his desire to build a wall along Americas southern border, you said of him that he is not a Christian.", "title": "Jack Kerwick - A Catholic's Letter to Pope Francis", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/jackkerwick/2016/02/25/a-catholics-letter-to-pope-francis-n2124622", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/49/7f26bee5-65f8-4d3c-98d2-aa90aa1ed641.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "A Catholic's Letter to Pope Francis, Jack Kerwick, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "And now we know that you didn\u2019t express a problem with people who only want to build walls.\nYou believe that anyone who wants to build walls per se is not a Christian.\nBut you never spoke to this aspect of Trump\u2019s policy; you spoke only to Trump\u2019s view on the construction of a wall.\nHe has always said this, continuously, and he has said this about the issues of migration in Europe, many times.\nFrancis, it brings this Catholic no satisfaction to suspect that the heir to Saint Peter is using this holy office to advance a political agenda."}
