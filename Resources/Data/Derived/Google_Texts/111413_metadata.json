However, Bush was unclear about what an increased effort against ISIS would mean in terms of the number of U.S. troops, punting that decision to \u201cmilitary generals.\u201d\n\nRelated: Congress Wants to Slam the Door on the Syrian Refugee Program\n\nHe said, \u201cMilitarily, we need to intensify our efforts in the air \u2013 and on the ground. While air power is essential, it alone cannot bring the results we seek. The United States \u2013 in conjunction with our NATO allies and more Arab partners \u2013 will need to increase our presence on the ground. The scope of which should be in line with what our military generals recommend will be necessary to achieve our objective.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cBut the bulk of these ground troops will need to come from local forces that we have built workable relationships with.\u201d\n\nBut in comments directed to his audience of military college cadets, he left no doubt that he was proposing to send young Americans into the fight.\n\n\u201cLet there be no doubt, this will not be easy. Some of you in this room will serve on the front lines of that fight against ISIS and against radical Islamic terrorism. You will sign up for an uncertain fate, on foreign fields of battle, because your country, and the cause of freedom, are calling you.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why ISIS Is Counting on the West to Win More Recruits\n\nThere has been an element of opportunism in many of the campaigns\u2019 responses to the Paris attacks \u2013 most have been quick to pin blame on the Obama White House and former secretary of state and current Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton. And while Bush has done his share of finger-pointing, the former governor\u2019s remarks today coincide with the release of a substantive policy proposal to restructure the military and reorient U.S. national security policy.\n\nBush previewed some of the speech in an appearance on Fox News Wednesday morning, saying that it will require \u201cfierce force\u201d to root out ISIS.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't mean a law enforcement exercise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means using the military to destroy ISIS and we have the capability of doing this and we should take it seriously and do it, as a leader in the world, not by ourselves.\u201d\n\nIn South Carolina, his prepared remarks were heavy on emotional imagery when he discussed the Paris attacks, decrying the \u201cbrutal savagery\u201d of ISIS he said, \u201cAs we gather today, in the aftermath of the bloodshed in Paris, let it be said that this generation knew the cost of war, but also knew the even greater cost of acquiescence to an enemy with which there is no co-existence.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin Doubles Down on Syria Bombing Campaign\n\nHe went on to advocate a sharp increase in spending on the U.S. military, funded in part by reforming a Pentagon bureaucracy that he described as unaccountable and spendthrift.\n\nHe echoed the claim voiced by many in the GOP that President Obama has been insufficiently aggressive in his foreign policy, and warned that a Clinton presidency would translate into more of the same.\n\n\u201cI reject their diminished view of America\u2019s role in the world,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Joining many of his fellow candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, Jeb Bush on Wednesday used the recent terrorist attacks in Paris as a springboard to launch a call for intensified U.S. efforts against the terror group ISIS and to propose overhauling U.S. defense policy and funding.", "title": "Jeb Bush: We Need U.S. Ground Troops to Fight ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Jeb-Bush-We-Need-US-Ground-Troops-Fight-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-bush-jeb_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Jeb-Bush-We-Need-US-Ground-Troops-Fight-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-bush-jeb_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Joining many of his fellow candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, Jeb Bush on Wednesday used the recent terrorist attacks in Paris as a springboard to launch a call for intensified U.S. efforts against the terror group ISIS and to propose overhauling U.S. defense policy and funding.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ad5\"", "article_summary": "Unlike the others, he has now explicitly called for an increased deployment of U.S. ground troops, in comments delivered at the Citadel, a military college in South Carolina.\nThe United States \u2013 in conjunction with our NATO allies and more Arab partners \u2013 will need to increase our presence on the ground.\nSome of you in this room will serve on the front lines of that fight against ISIS and against radical Islamic terrorism.\nBush previewed some of the speech in an appearance on Fox News Wednesday morning, saying that it will require \u201cfierce force\u201d to root out ISIS.\n\u201cI reject their diminished view of America\u2019s role in the world,\u201d he said."}
