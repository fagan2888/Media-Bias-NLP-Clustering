It was another exciting night at Meridian's Frank Cochran Center. "Dancing like the Stars" got underway with yet again some familiar faces.

Meridianite Fredie Carmichael was among the many who danced in Saturday nights event. The event raised money for the Multi County Community Service Agency and Carmichael says he is glad to have helped such a good cause.

"A great audience, a great night tonight to raise money for such a great cause," Carmichael said. "It's for an organization that does so much for the folks in this community who need it the most. It's really hard to overstate that point, how much this organization helps those who need it the most in this community."

Mayor Percy Bland also surprised the crowd with a special dance with MCCSA founder Callie Cole.
