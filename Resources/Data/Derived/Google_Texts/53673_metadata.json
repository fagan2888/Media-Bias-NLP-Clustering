More than 1,100 parents or guardians, average age 42, participated.\n\n\u201cWe were interested in parental perception of the importance of sleep duration and sleep quality, habits, and routines of the families and children, and obstacles preventing adequate sleep,\u201d Penn State associate professor Orfeu Buxton said in a special release.\n\nSufficient sleep duration is conservatively estimated to be at least nine hours a night for ages 6-11 and at least eight hours for ages 12-17, researchers say.\n\nSignificant predictors of adequate sleep duration were found to be regular sleep-wake routines, consistent enforcement of rules about caffeine, keeping technology off in their bedrooms overnight and parents\u2019 education.\n\n\u201cReducing the encroachment of technology and media into sleep time and supporting well-known sleep hygiene principles should be a focus of public health intervention goals for sleep health,\u201d the release said.\n\n\u201cWe have previously demonstrated the negative effect that use of light-emitting technology before bedtime can have on sleep, and now in this study we see how parental rules and routines regarding technology can influence the quantity and quality of their children\u2019s sleep,\u201d said Anne-Marie Chang, assistant professor of bio-behavioral health at Penn State and co-author of the study.\n\nChang and colleagues recently demonstrated that reading on an iPad before bedtime, compared with reading a print book, can impair sleep, delay circadian timing and make children less alert the following morning.\n\nOther factors contributing to poor sleep, researchers said, complicated and hectic daily schedules with competing work, school, social and recreational activities. Neighborhood noise also plays a role in disrupting sleep.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Dose", "description": "Ninety percent of children did not sleep the full amount of time recommended for their age group, researchers found.", "title": "Bedtime study: Let sleeping kids lie; 90% sleep-deprived", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/2015/01/27/let-sleeping-kids-lie-study-shows-family-rules-help-rest-well/4813/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Ninety percent of children did not sleep the full amount of time recommended for their age group, researchers found.", "title": "Bedtime study: Let sleeping kids lie; 90%  sleep-deprived", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/2015/01/27/let-sleeping-kids-lie-study-shows-family-rules-help-rest-well/4813/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@electadraper", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdadd\"", "article_summary": "Other factors contributing to poor sleep, researchers said, complicated and hectic daily schedules with competing work, school, social and recreational activities.\nEstablished rules and routines help children get age-appropriate sleep amounts, according to the 2014 National Sleep Foundation\u2019s \u201cSleep in the Modern Family\u201d Poll, released Jan. 26.\n\u201cReducing the encroachment of technology and media into sleep time and supporting well-known sleep hygiene principles should be a focus of public health intervention goals for sleep health,\u201d the release said.\nResearchers from Penn State, Case Western Reserve University, the University of Chicago and others evaluated U.S. households with children aged 6 to 17 years old using Internet-based interviews.\nWhile most parents endorsed the idea of the importance of sleep, 90 percent of children did not sleep the full amount of time recommended for their age group, researchers found."}
