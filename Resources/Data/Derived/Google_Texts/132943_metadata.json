Steve King (R-IA)\n\nJust five days after House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) attempted to dismiss talk of impeachment as a \u201cscam started by Democrats at the White House,\u201d a key Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee told Fox News Sunday that the Republican House should impeach President Obama if he uses his executive authority to defer deportation for millions of undocumented adults.\n\nRep. Steve King (R-IA), who has led the charge to eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), successfully pushed this week to pass a House bill to defund the renewal of the deferred status for hundreds of thousands of undocumented residents brought to the United States as children.\n\nAsked by host Chris Wallace about the probability of executive action by the Obama administration to stop deporting the millions of undocumented adults, King made it clear that this would be an impeachable offense. If Obama should take unilateral action to expand DACA beyond its current levels, he said, \u201cCongress has to sit down and have a serious look at the rest of this constitution and that includes that \u2018i\u2019 word we don\u2019t want to say.\u201d Wallace pressed him to clarify the threat:\n\nWallace: But you\u2019re saying if he were to do that then impeachment would be on the table? King: I think then we have to start, sit down and take a look at that. Where would we draw the line otherwise? If that\u2019s not enough to bring that about, then I don\u2019t know what would be.\n\nWatch the video:\n\n\n\nKing had dabbled in impeachment advocacy before, but told CNN last week \u201cI am not pushing impeachment.\u201d\n\nSpeaker Boehner, ironically, urged President Obama to take unilateral executive action to address the border crisis this week \u2014 a day after almost every House Republican in his caucus voted to sue the president for using similar authority to implement Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Rep.
