Stallard offers three tips on how to use stories to \"enthuse, engage and energize\" employees.\n\nTell stories that tie in people and your organization's vision\n\n\n\nPutting a human face on your organization, Stallard says, keeps the vision in clear focus. He cites videos of patient stories on New York-Presbyterian Hospital's website as a great example. \"The stories you'll see don't always have happy endings,\" he writes, \"but they are very effective at communicating the importance of their work.\"\n\nUse stories to convey your leadership values\n\n\n\nFor example, Stallard says, while talking with leaders from New York-Presbyterian, he found many of them were familiar with a story about then-CEO Herb Pardes, M.D. As a child, Pardes spent several months in the hospital with Perthes disease, and described the unfriendly atmosphere and limits placed on the time he could spend with family members. As a result, he said Pardes made sure New York-Presbyterian employees understood his desire to provide healthcare with a personal, human touch.\n\nLive up to the values you promote\n\n\n\nEffective leadership involves reinforcing your values by walking the walk, Stallard writes. Pardes, for example, did not just tell his employees about the importance of connecting with patients. He also regularly made bedside visits to patients and family members. In addition, he worked to foster a culture where other New York-Presbyterian workers formed similar connections, urging them to take steps like learning the names of patients and their family members. These strategies, Stallard writes, helped New York-Presbyterian achieve recognition as one of the nation's top hospitals for both patient care and consistent profitability during Pardes' tenure.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read Stallard's column\n\n- check out New York-Presbyterian's patient stories\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHealthcare lessons from 3 (more) unlikely sources\n\nWhat hospitals can learn from college football\n\nHow healthcare leaders can deal with fear, uncertainty and greed\n\nHospitals and communities: Understand the patient population", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare leaders can motivate staff through the use of stories, according to a\u00a0Fox Business column.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Healthcare leaders can motivate staff through the use of stories, according to a\u00a0Fox Business column.", "title": "3 ways healthcare leaders can motivate staff", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/3-ways-healthcare-leaders-can-motivate-staff/2013-11-26", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "healthcare leadership,New York Presbyterian Hospital,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21db\"", "article_summary": "Healthcare leaders can motivate staff through the use of stories, according to a Fox Business column.\nLive up to the values you promoteEffective leadership involves reinforcing your values by walking the walk, Stallard writes.\nHe cites videos of patient stories on New York-Presbyterian Hospital's website as a great example.\nAs a result, he said Pardes made sure New York-Presbyterian employees understood his desire to provide healthcare with a personal, human touch.\nThese strategies, Stallard writes, helped New York-Presbyterian achieve recognition as one of the nation's top hospitals for both patient care and consistent profitability during Pardes' tenure."}
