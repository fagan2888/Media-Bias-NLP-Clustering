I would never drink that now.\u201d\n\nIn the past two years, first Hari, then her husband, who are based in Charlotte, North Carolina, quit lucrative jobs as consultants to make their living from Foodbabe.com, where Hari challenges companies like Coca-Cola for using ingredients she says are harmful.\n\nMetrics can vary, but according to her figures, Food Babe has more than 3 million readers a month; com-Score shows 1.1 unique visitors for January, roughly double the traffic of a year ago.\n\nOther Food Babe targets have included Starbucks (accusations of \u201chazardous chemicals\u201d in pumpkin spice lattes), Chick-fil-A (which she called Chemical-Fil-A), Whole Foods (for genetically modified and hidden ingredients) and Subway.\n\nTo protest the sandwich chain\u2019s use of azodicarbonamide in its bread, Hari posted a video of herself chewing another item in which the chemical is found: a yoga mat. In less than 24 hours, Hari\u2019s petition to the company to remove the dough conditioner had 50,000 signatures. The next day, Subway, which Hari said had not replied to any previous correspondence, emailed her to say it was already in the process of removing the chemical, which had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to argue with a crusade to help Americans eat better and to win more transparency from both food companies and the federal agency, but Hari, a former computer science major with no training as a food scientist, nutritionist or chef, has managed to become a flash point.\n\nHer click-me headlines (\u201cDo You Eat Beaver Butt?\u201d for a post about what\u2019s in so-called natural flavorings) and camera-ready looks have won her a rabid Foodbabearmy, billings as an expert on television shows, a book (\u201cThe Food Babe Way\u201d) that made its debut at No. 4 on The New York Times best-seller list last month, and a spot (along with Beyonc\u00e9 and Kim Kardashian) on Time Magazine\u2019s \u201c30 Most Influential People on the Internet.\u201d\n\nBut her statements \u2014 often incorrect \u2014 and faulty reasoning have produced numerous memes and parodies, not to mention aggressive reactions from doctors and scientists, who call her scientifically illiterate.\n\nAsked about Hari\u2019s biggest sin, Joseph A. Schwarcz, director of McGill University\u2019s Office of Science and Society exhaled loudly and said, \u201cWhere do I start?\u201d\n\nBASIC CHEMISTRY\n\nScientists splutter with frustration that to Hari, the word \u201cchemical\u201d is always a pejorative and that she yells fire about toxins but ignores that fruits and vegetables are full of naturally occurring toxins, and that the dose makes the poison.\n\n\u201cPeach pits, for example, are very natural, but they contain cyanide,\u201d said Fergus M. Clydesdale, a professor of food science at the University of Massachusetts. \u201cOranges have methanol, which is very toxic. And we\u2019ve been eating those for thousands of years.\u201d\n\nClydesdale also pointed out that the body is made of chemicals, and that we eat partly to replenish those chemicals with chemicals from food.\n\nBut mostly, the biggest objection to Hari is the paranoia and fear she whips up. The blog Science-Based Medicine calls her \u201cthe Jenny McCarthy of Food.\u201d\n\nHari, however, dismissed this criticism as manufactured by \u201cthe processed food lobby\u201d and \u201cindustry-funded science.\u201d She sees herself as an activist and 21st-century Upton Sinclair \u2014 her reference \u2014 who provides information that \u201ccould be a lifesaver,\u201d which is what she wrote in a widely mocked post, now deleted, that demonized the microwave oven for destroying nutrients and causing cancer.\n\nHari, the daughter of Indian immigrants, grew up with a preference for Burger King and anything from the deep fryer over homemade Indian food.\n\nShe had eczema, asthma, stomach problems and \u201csevere\u201d food allergies, the last of which critics (and at least one person who said she knew her growing up) dispute because Hari has advocated lying to servers about allergies to butter, dairy, corn and soy to avoid possible sources of genetically modified food.\n\nAt age 23, she had appendicitis, something she said was caused by her \u201clifestyle of poor nutrition,\u201d though most experts say it is a random occurrence. She read books like \u201cSpiritual Nutrition\u201d and \u201cConscious Eating\u201d and applied the skills she learned as an award-winning debater in high school \u2014 \u201cwe learned how to research, like find obscure books and look at microfiche,\u201d she said \u2014 to food. She read labels, cleaned up her diet and saw results. Her eczema, asthma and allergies went away, and she said she was off all prescription drugs within three to four years.\n\nIn 2011, friends encouraged her to share her experiences and lessons. She asked her husband to register the domain name eathealthyliveforever.com, but he suggested Food Babe instead. In a picture on her blog, Hari wears a yellow bikini and does a backbend known as yoga\u2019s wheel pose, \u201cFood Babe\u201d written in the beach sand in front of her.\n\nHari\u2019s posts follow one of a handful of simple but effective formulas. Sometimes she finds an ingredient, often an ugly-sounding chemical (propylene glycol, which she said was in beer), and finds a secondary industrial use (antifreeze) for it. In this case, Hari actually confused her chemicals. Dr. David H. Gorski, a surgical oncologist who also has a degree in chemistry, wrote on Science-Based Medicine that the beer ingredient is propylene glycol alginate, which, despite its name, is not even close to propylene glycol, is not antifreeze and is derived from kelp.\n\nAnother of her approaches is to find an unappetizing-sounding source of something (isinglass, for example, a colorless, tasteless collagen made from fish bladders that\u2019s been used for centuries to clarify beer without causing harm) and cry foul.\n\nIn both cases, Hari usually profits, promoting expensive alternatives for which she receives Amazon affiliate commissions. (Making a percentage off referrals is a common moneymaker for blogs.) Hari, who also sells eating guides ($17.99 a month) with \u201capproved brands,\u201d said her methods were \u201cbad business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI talk about a ton of products pro bono because it\u2019s just the right thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably should reach out before I write about some of these products.\u201d\n\nA MEASURE OF FEAR\n\nKevin M. Folta, chairman of the horticultural sciences department at the University of Florida, described Hari\u2019s lecture at the university in October as a \u201ccorrupt message of bogus science and abject food terrorism.\u201d Her fee was $6,000.\n\nFolta added, \u201cShe found that a popular social media site was more powerful than science itself, more powerful than reason, more powerful than actually knowing what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nEven Hari\u2019s supporters concede that she is inflammatory.\n\n\u201cSometimes we may not share the same degree of concern about ingredients that she has or wouldn\u2019t express it the way she does,\u201d said Ken Cook, a founder of the Environmental Working Group, whom Hari calls a mentor. \u201cBut what we tend to have in common is this sense that there\u2019s been way too much leniency granted to the food industry when it comes to allowing ingredients into the marketplace.\u201d\n\nPerhaps because Hari inspires a measure of fear in companies, she is often neither mentioned nor credited with a change in practices.\n\nAsked about her role in Subway\u2019s decision to remove azodicarbonamide from its bread, a company spokesman said in an email that the process began \u201cbefore the ingredient began generating headlines.\u201d Asked specifically about Hari, he repeated the same phrase.\n\nLike other outspoken women, Hari has her share of online attacks that are at times obscene, misogynistic and frightening.\n\n\u201cMy friends say, \u2018How are you going to get through it?\u2019' she said. \u201cAnd I just kind of laugh and say: \u2018I\u2019ll be like Taylor Swift. I\u2019ll just kind of shake it off.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe does not often engage directly even with those offering thoughtful criticism, instead blocking them from her Facebook page, which has more than 930,000 likes. One \u201cBanned by Food Babe\u201d Facebook group has nearly 7,000 members; another has nearly 700. Hari said people are only blocked for obscenities, but Schwarcz, who is among the banned (though not a Facebook group member), said he merely questioned her credentials.\n\nAs for those credentials, Hari said that chemistry shouldn\u2019t be necessary to decipher what to eat. She pointed out that her undergraduate major was actually in the College of Engineering at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, so she took \u201chard science, oh my gosh, Physics 3, Calculus 3.\u201d Asked how she liked them, she said, \u201cI mean, who likes those?\u201d\n\nIn another much-mocked post, \u201cFood Babe Travel Essentials \u2014 No Reason to Panic on the Plane!\u201d Hari criticized the air on an airplane. Because of cost concerns, the air \u201cpumped in isn\u2019t pure oxygen, either, it\u2019s mixed with nitrogen, sometimes at almost 50 percent,\u201d she wrote. Except ambient air isn\u2019t pure oxygen, either. It\u2019s roughly 78 percent nitrogen. The widely discredited post, where Hari also complained about the flight attendants\u2019 stinginess with water in first class, was removed swiftly.\n\nIn an interview, Hari said she didn\u2019t remember the post, which Cook brought up by name. She then said it would have disappeared from the blog because it was old. Weeks later, in an email, she admitted that it had been removed because of mistakes, and said that she planned to start noting when she clarified or corrected posts.\n\nHari said the these particular posts \u2014 which she wouldn\u2019t acknowledge as having been discredited \u2014 were a feeble exercise in nitpicking that detracted from her mission.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to pick apart every little sentence I\u2019ve written . . .\u201d she said, her voice trailing off. She added of her critics, \u201cThey have to dig so far and deep to find something to make me look crazy, because what I\u2019m saying now is so sane and is so real.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/04/MAC_CHEESE_MODIFY_2-001.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "She asked her husband to register the domain name eathealthyliveforever.com, but he suggested Food Babe instead.\nOne \u201cBanned by Food Babe\u201d Facebook group has nearly 7,000 members; another has nearly 700.\n\u201cPeach pits, for example, are very natural, but they contain cyanide,\u201d said Fergus M.
