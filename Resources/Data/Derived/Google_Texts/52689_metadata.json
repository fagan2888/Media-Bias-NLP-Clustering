Patty Murray and Virginia Congressman Bobby Scott \u2014 would be a huge leap from the existing $7.25 minimum, topping all but the highest state mandates.\n\nThe Raise the Wage Act would limit options for people willing to work for less and employers forced to pay low-skill workers more, Heath explained. Layoffs and reductions in hiring are just two of several likely outcomes.\n\n\u201cWhen labor costs go up, that money has to come from somewhere \u2014 consumers will find that prices go up or stockholders will find that they are getting less returns,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFew may be crying over the idea of lower returns for stockholders, but lots of stocks are held by people who aren\u2019t rich and receiving pensions,\u201d Heath continued. \u201cAnd lower profitability discourages investment, which is important for all of us in terms of job creation.\u201d\n\nSmall businesses \u2014 from restaurants to bookstores to coffee shops \u2014 are especially ill-equipped for costly government mandates. The Faces of $15, a project of minimum wage critics at the Employment Policies Institute, tracks negative consequences small businesses face in Seattle and elsewhere.\n\nIf the $15 minimum wage demanded by labor unions is too much, might $12 be the magic number? Or was President Obama on track when he began pushing a $10.10 minimum wage?\n\n\u201cThe $12 by 2020 plan is more incremental but more permanent, as it would tie minimum wage to median wages and would also harmfully phase out the lower subminimum wage for tipped jobs,\u201d Heath said.\n\n\u201cSo, in the short run, perhaps the president\u2019s plan is worse. In the long run, the $12 by 2020 plan is worse,\u201d she opined.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t aim to get minimum wage \u2018just right.\u2019 There should be no minimum wage at all,\u201d Heath said, citing economist Milton Friedman\u2019s point that the real minimum wage is always $0: \u201cThat\u2019s what jobless workers earn.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not $15, union officials see Murray and Scott\u2019s $12 by 2020 plan as progress.\n\nMary Kay Henry, president of Service Employees International Union, and Richard Trumka, president of union coalition AFL-CIO, endorsed the bill the day it was unveiled.\n\nTheir endorsements were accompanied by a lengthy Economic Policy Institute defense of the Raise the Wage Act \u2014 hardly a surprise, since Henry sits on EPI\u2019s board of directors, and Trumka is chairman of the board.\n\nWage mandates are a boon to labor bosses because they hamper competition from non-union businesses and often mean contractually obligated raises for union workers, which increase union dues taken as a percentage of wages.\n\nEmployers can afford a mandated $12 minimum wage, EPI explained, because wages haven\u2019t kept up with productivity gains. EPI used data from 1968, the year the minimum wage peaked relative to overall wages, as a benchmark.\n\nEPI economist David Cooper told Watchdog.org, \u201cWe believe the economy could support a $12 minimum wage by 2020 without any negative effect on employment.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhasing-in the increases to $12 over a five-year period would be a pace consistent with the increases the US has done in the past two decades, which have been studied extensively and found to have had little to no effect on employment,\u201d Cooper said in an email.\n\n\u201cShifting more income into the pockets of low-wage workers would likely put those dollars right back into the businesses facing higher labor costs, as workers go out and spend their increased earnings,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut Heath noted the argument that minimum wage mandates cycle money back into the economy is flawed because \u201cthe money that is going to wage earners has to be taken from someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to help the poor, then the focus should be helping low-skill workers get a job in the first place,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that some employers \u2014 like (Walmart), for example \u2014 are deciding to raise wages on their own. But a government mandate to force all employers to follow suit could end up harming the very people that they want to help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The $12 minimum wage proposed by Democrats in Congress would kill job opportunities for workers without much education or experience.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The $12 minimum wage proposed by Democrats in Congress would kill job opportunities for workers without much education or experience.", "title": "A $12-minimum wage mandate threatens entry-level workers - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/afscme-twitter-fightfor15-2015-04-27.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-13T10:22:17+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/216018/12-minimum-wage/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The $12 minimum wage proposed by Democrats in Congress would kill job opportunities for workers without much education or experience.", "title": "A $12-minimum wage mandate threatens entry-level workers - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/afscme-twitter-fightfor15-2015-04-27.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Jobs + Growth", "tag": "government regulation", "published_time": "2015-05-13T04:00:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-13T10:22:17+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "minimum wage, federal minimum wage, raise the wage act, wage mandates, independent women's forum, hadley heath manning, economic policy institute, david cooper, 12 by 2020"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd97f\"", "article_summary": "A $12 minimum wage would be imposed nationally by 2020.\nBy Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgA $12 minimum wage proposed by congressional Democrats would hurt the workers lawmakers are trying to help \u2014 those lacking experience and education.\nEmployers can afford a mandated $12 minimum wage, EPI explained, because wages haven\u2019t kept up with productivity gains.\n\u201cThe good news is that some employers \u2014 like (Walmart), for example \u2014 are deciding to raise wages on their own.\nOr was President Obama on track when he began pushing a $10.10 minimum wage?"}
