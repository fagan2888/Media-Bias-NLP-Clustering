Like credit cards with their overlooked perks, home, health, and auto insurance policies often provide coverage for hidden or unusual items. Before you spend money out of pocket on massages, pot hole damage, or property improvements, check your policies.

The Christian Science Monitor has rounded up 26 surprising things covered by insurance. Some of them are not very likely to ever be needed—such as property damage from meteorites and space debris or stampeding cows—but others could be very useful.

For example, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, most health insurers cover breast pumps for new mothers. If you have chronic pain and a prescription from your doctor, you might be able to get your health insurance to pay for regular massages or even a hot tub.

Some home insurance policies will cover the cost of home improvements required by your town to bring it up to code, and many car insurers consider hitting a pothole to be a collision, so you could get them to cover that damage.

Coverage will vary by policy of course, and as always will be limited by your deductible. You’ll probably also want to weigh the potential risk of your policy rate rising if you make a claim.
