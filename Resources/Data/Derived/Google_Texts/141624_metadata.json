The resulting outcry prompted them to clarity their views.\n\nAll 50 states have laws requiring vaccines for school students, although exemptions vary from state to state, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nTwenty states allow exemptions on philosophical grounds, while West Virginia and Mississippi are the only states that do not permit religious exemptions.\n\nThe U.S. experienced 644 measles cases in 27 states in 2014, including one large outbreak among unvaccinated Amish people in Ohio that resulted in 383 cases.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California officials said Friday the measles outbreak that disease investigators traced to Disneyland is officially over.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "California officials said Friday the measles outbreak that disease investigators traced to Disneyland is officially over.", "title": "Calif. says measles outbreak linked to Disneyland is officially over", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/17/calif-measles-outbreak-linked-disneyland-over/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/17/Measles_Outbreak.JPEG-06f90.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/17/Measles_Outbreak.JPEG-06f90.jpg", "description": "California officials said Friday the measles outbreak that disease investigators traced to Disneyland is officially over.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Calif. says measles outbreak linked to Disneyland is officially over"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5da4\"", "article_summary": "California officials said Friday the measles outbreak that disease investigators traced to Disneyland is officially over.\nThe U.S. experienced 644 measles cases in 27 states in 2014, including one large outbreak among unvaccinated Amish people in Ohio that resulted in 383 cases.\nThe outbreak had frustrated U.S. health officials and experts, who saw an illness that was virtually stamped out come creeping back into American life.\nOfficials said no new cases had been reported for the last 42 days, or two successive incubation periods for measles.\nThe outbreak began in December, sickening 147 people in seven states \u2014 131 in California \u2014 and kick-started a national debate over childhood vaccination."}
