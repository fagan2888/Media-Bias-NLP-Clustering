One of Issa's eight complaints: Cats cannot call 1-800-ObamaCare while going through tunnels.

When the Chairman of the House Oversight Committee has been reduced to posting pictures of sad-looking cats criticizing the Obamacare rollout, you know things in Washington have devolved quite a damn bit. But no, there is indeed an official house.gov post titled:Let's remember that Rep. Darrell Issa, when he is not having his staff put up pictures of cats that cannot haz Obamacare, is the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee and is ostensibly dedicated to finding and investigating instances of the government pointlessly tossing away taxpayer money for silly reasons. JUST THROWING THAT OUT THERE.The obvious question: Will this become a theme, for the obsessive scandal-seeker Issa? Perhaps the follow-up will be Seven Cats Who Still Have Questions About Benghazi. A brave Democrat will counterattack with Five Dogs Who Know More About The Constitution Than Rand Paul, only to be rebutted by the Issa committee masterwork Three Hamsters We Are Currently Investigating For Possibly Being Involved With Solyndra.

We might be tempted to say that this is a marked degradation for Issa, but is it really? Surely, posting cat pictures on the internet is one of the more productive things Darrell Issa does with his time, and probably considerably less expensive than any of the other hobbies he has taken up as ostensible government overseer. No, I think we need to encourage more of this. Perhaps, somewhere in America, there is a photogenic cat that will crack the Benghazi conspiracy wide open.
