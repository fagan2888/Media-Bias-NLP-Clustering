Huffaker has a stack of letters from Covered California urging her to re-enroll and update her financial information. They\u2019re all unopened.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m beyond apathy,\u201d Huffaker said. \u201cI\u2019m at the point of paralysis.\u201d\n\nShe had enrolled her family in a silver plan. That\u2019s Covered California\u2019s second tier of coverage. Monthly premiums at the silver level are bumped up in exchange for not having to chip away at a deductible before prescriptions and nonessential treatments are fully covered.\n\nHuffaker qualified for subsidies to bring her premiums down, but the $700 monthly cost was still a lot to take on. Huffaker was unemployed for much of the year, and she and her husband were putting their daughter through her first year of college.\n\nTo keep costs down, Huffaker only used her health insurance if it was a necessity. She put off getting recommended labs done. When her son gouged his knee, she found herself trying to make the call on whether he needed stitches instead of driving straight to the emergency room.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that those numbers are going through my head when I\u2019m making choices about health care,\u201d Huffaker said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I see the problem still existing with Obamacare. The money situation is still so much a part of care.\u201d\n\nBut Huffaker said she\u2019ll take Obamacare over what she had before \u2013 \u201c39 percent increases year over year, benefits decreasing and nothing we could do about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a panacea for me, by any stretch, but it\u2019s still so much better than what existed before,\u201d Huffaker said. \u201cThere are certainly things to fix, but I think of it in terms of \u2013 not to go all JFK \u2013 it\u2019s good for the country, so I\u2019ll take my lumps.\u201d\n\n\u2018It Doesn\u2019t Feel Like Welfare\u2019\n\nBecki Mendia keeps a stash of natural remedies \u2013 coconut oil and cinnamon for respiratory health and apple cider vinegar for digestive health \u2013 in her daughter\u2019s City Heights home. She moved there after divorcing several years ago and started the homeopathic regimen to get by without health insurance.\n\nIn June, she became one of the 2.2 million Californians to join Medi-Cal. The Affordable Care Act expanded the state\u2019s version of Medicaid to families and individuals earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nMendia said the expansion \u2013 nearly 30 percent of Californians are now on Medi-Cal \u2013 reduced the stigma that had kept her from looking into the program.\n\n\u201cI always thought it was part of the welfare system, and maybe it still is, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it,\u201d she said.\n\nMendia hasn\u2019t been to the doctor yet, but she said the change over last year is immense.\n\n\u201cHaving insurance right now, it\u2019s like a platform that I can go ahead and move around from and not be afraid,\u201d she said.\n\nSince getting on Medi-Cal, Mendia has put away some money and started taking classes to increase her job skills.\n\n\u2018The Affordable Care Act Should Make Health Care More Affordable, Right?\u2019\n\nJeff Schoellerman, a San Diego neuroscientist, is curious if the Affordable Care Act will eventually have an effect on what we pay toward Medicare and disability out of our paychecks.\n\nThere are a lot of different takes on the recent health insurance rate hikes. Did the Affordable Care Act cause them? Would it have been a lot worse if the law didn\u2019t exist? And what do we make of those plans that actually lowered rates (yes, they exist)?\n\nAll Jeff Schoellerman needs to know is written in plain English in his employer\u2019s 2015 benefits booklet.\n\n\u201cACA mandates have increased our financial responsibilities.\u201d\n\nOr, in plainer English, \u201cYour premium is going up because of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nSchoellerman is a neuroscientist at a pharmaceutical company. He gets to the heart of the matter with all the precision you\u2019d expect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Affordable Care Act. It should make health care more affordable, right?\u201d\n\nHis increase amounts to a couple hundred dollars a year, but he\u2019s taking it in stride.\n\n\u201cI see a little less in my paycheck every month, but it\u2019s not so much that I\u2019m not going to be able to put food on the table,\u201d Schoellerman said.\n\nFor the avid cyclist \u2013 he rides to and from work everyday \u2013 the bigger disappointment is that the law hasn\u2019t yet impacted the cost of emergency care. Before landing his current job and its benefits package, Schoellerman landed in the emergency room after a car hit him on his bike. He\u2019s still paying off the $30,000 bill.\n\nIndeed, the average cost of an emergency room visit went up $432 to $1,345 between 2009 and 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The numbers for 2014 aren\u2019t yet available, but early studies suggest emergency room visits are leveling off, and even decreasing in some cases, under the Affordable Care Act. That could mean the cost to hospitals and patients will eventually level off.\n\nBut Schoellerman isn\u2019t optimistic.\n\n\u201cIt seems like this price gouging that happens with ambulance rides and emergency room visits is not going to change,\u201d Schoellerman said. \u201cI think that should have been the main focus of this health care plan.\u201d\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s Get Crackin\u2019 on Single-Payer\u2019\n\nScripps Ranch health care advocate Sylvia Hampton says the Affordable Care Act won't help her friend, who doesn't like his employer's insurance options.\n\nNot much has changed for Sylvia Hampton since the rollout of Obamacare. She and her husband are on Medicare, which the health reform law left relatively untouched.\n\nAnd her opinion on the law hasn\u2019t changed much either, despite heavy news coverage of website glitches and dropped plans and the perhaps buried lead that 6.7 million low-income Americans gained Medicaid coverage by May. Before all of that Hampton was calling for a single-payer health system. And she still is.\n\n\u201cThe single-payer system is what every other industrialized country has and it\u2019s the gold standard for cost savings, efficiency and to cover everybody,\u201d Hampton said.\n\nBut Hampton may be even more passionate about the idea after seeing how Obamacare didn\u2019t work this year for her daughter, whose husband lost his job. She started out the year expecting she could pay her premium and ended it with one that\u2019s stretching her bank account.\n\nThat\u2019s because the law bases what you pay in premiums on what you projected your income will be. You can adjust your subsidy midyear if your income changes, but the option doesn\u2019t exactly resolve the feelings of uncertainty Americans have felt since the recession.\n\nWhile the law helped low-income Americans, Hampton said, it missed the boat for that other large group it aimed to help: middle-class workers cast out into the individual market.\n\n\u201cNow that they\u2019ve cut down on the number of uninsured, the hospitals are doing better, and boy are the insurance companies doing better,\u201d Hampton said. \u201cBut these people in the middle who don\u2019t work for large corporations like Boeing or Qualcomm, and those who are making a little bit too much money to qualify for the subsidies, they are the ones who are upset and angry \u2013 mad as hell, actually \u2013 about what\u2019s happening to them. They feel like the law didn\u2019t help them at all, which in many cases it didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHampton said throwing out the law and starting from scratch isn\u2019t the answer. But she said piecemeal change isn\u2019t either.\n\n\u201cThis is getting real old. I mean I\u2019ve been working on this for 20 years,\u201d said Hampton, who is the health care director for the San Diego League of Women Voters. \u201cLet\u2019s get crackin\u2019 here.\u201d\n\nThis article relates to: City Heights, Health Care, News, Share\n\nWritten by Megan Burks Megan Burks is a reporter for Speak City Heights, a media project of Voice of San Diego, KPBS, Media Arts Center and The AjA Project.
