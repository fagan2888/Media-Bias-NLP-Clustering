Well, here’s an innovative thought: Why not eat insects? It’s a worthy question, given the points presented in the below video by the guys of AsapSCIENCE.

The technical term for eating insects is “entomophagy.” “Humans have harvested the eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of certain insect species from forests or other suitable habitats to eat for thousands of year,” according to the University of California, Riverside‘s Center for Invasive Species Research. The practice of eating insects isn’t uncommon for much of the world today.

Both the video and UCR report that insects are a good source of proteins, essential minerals, vitamins and fat. There is also an argument to be made about their sustainable farming. “There is a strong case in favor of mass rearing insects for food as this practice is probably less environmentally damaging than other forms of protein production,” UC Riverside has written.
