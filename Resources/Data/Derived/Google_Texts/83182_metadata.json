Instead, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky opened his speech at an Alabama GOP dinner at the Renaissance Hotel in Montgomery Friday night with a story about a local woman who was caught last year stealing eggs.\n\nThe story, he said, was about justice, in that the woman, a poor resident of Tarrant, a blighted area north of Birmingham dotted with industrial plants, couldn\u2019t afford the eggs for her family. \u201cAs a Christian, I think about that our religion talks about redemption, and that maybe the law should give people second chances.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the law should give people second chances.\u201d Senator Rand Paul\n\nThe Tarrant police officer, rather than arrest the woman, reprimanded her for stealing, and then bought the eggs for her. Then over the following weeks, the police took food to her house, Paul said. \u201cWe do have to have police to stop violent criminals, but I love the fact that there can be some discretion, some discernment, and some help,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul then recognized two Tarrant police officers, then launched into a series of attacks on big government. He ridiculed the government shutdown, \u201cnon-essential\u201d federal employees who are paid to do nothing, and the near-impossible challenge of firing federal workers such as those at the VA.\n\nHe rehashed his oft-used criticism of government spending at NIH on research involving fruit flies, among other wastes of taxpayer dollars. \u201cThey spent $2.4 million of your NIH money on origami condoms. I don\u2019t even know what that is,\u201d he said.\n\nNASA research, too, was under attack. The result, he told those in attendance, was an $18 trillion debt. \u201cOur debt is now bigger than our economy,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul criticized Obama for what he called a usurpation of power, a \u201cgrabbing of powers that aren\u2019t his.\u201d He ticked off examples such as Obamacare, immigration law, and war powers.\n\nOn the heels of Pinterest shutting down Paul\u2019s fake Hillary Clinton account, which has been criticized as being sexist, Paul again hammered Clinton for her role in what he called \u201cthe scandal of Benghazi.\u201d He told the audience he\u2019d say to Clinton, \u201cif you\u2019re not going to defend the troops, you\u2019re not going to defend our embassies, if you have shown that you are derelict in your duty to provide security to the United States, you should forever preclude yourself from running for the presidency,\u201d he said, to applause from those watching.\n\nWhat drew shouts of approval, however, was the gold standard Republican rallying cry to cut taxes.\n\nNear the end of his 25 minute speech, Paul noted the need to diversify the Republican constituency. \u201cI tell people that when we win big, when we win the presidency again\u2014it\u2019s not Alabama\u2019s fault, you guys are doing just fine\u2014but there\u2019s some other states we\u2019re having trouble with: Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio. We win a lot of those states, but we can\u2019t win the big cities, because we\u2019re not getting enough African-American vote, we\u2019re not getting enough Hispanic vote, we\u2019re not getting enough working class vote. We\u2019re not really, I think, showing enough concern, for those who aren\u2019t sharing in the American dream,\u201d he said.\n\nTo win more African-American votes, Rand and other potential Republican contenders need to do \u201ca little more reaching out and explaining\u201d of values, said Angelitta Carmichael, of Mobile, Alabama. She said values differ dramatically among Christians between Democrats and Republicans. In the coming months, Carmichael said she\u2019s closely watching Paul and Jeb Bush.\n\nWayne Reynolds, a Vietnam Veteran, was cautious in his assessment of Paul as a contender for the Republican nomination. \u201cI support him proceeding so we have a choice. He\u2019s a good choice for us to consider,\u201d Reynolds said after the speech. He said he\u2019d like to see what the other candidates have to offer before settling on one nominee; he\u2019s particularly impressed with Bush and Gov. Walker. But, he said, it\u2019s a long way till 2016, \u201cand my vote will go to whoever can best beat the Democrat.\u201d\n\nOther marks in the plus column for Paul? \u201cHe\u2019s conservative, he\u2019s for cost-maintenance, he\u2019s for national defense,\u201d Reynolds said, \u201cbut he\u2019s not for putting our soldiers at risk needlessly.\u201d\n\nA number of Alabama Republican officials were among the 950 people in attendance, including Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, whose name, when it was read out, drew hoots and cheers. Moore is leading the charge against gay marriage in the state, where he ordered probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Kentucky senator thinking about a presidential run visits Montgomery for dinner with the Alabama GOP.", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i763RjYDAA84/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "The Kentucky senator thinking about a presidential run visits Montgomery for dinner with the Alabama GOP.", "title": "Rand Paul Talks\u00a0Eggs, Crime, and Second Chances in\u00a0Alabama", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-21/rand-paul-talks-eggs-crime-and-second-chances-in-alabama", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i763RjYDAA84/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-21/rand-paul-talks-eggs-crime-and-second-chances-in-alabama", "twitter": {"description": "The Kentucky senator thinking about a presidential run visits Montgomery for dinner with the Alabama GOP.", "title": "Rand Paul Talks\u00a0Eggs, Crime, and Second Chances in\u00a0Alabama", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-21/rand-paul-talks-eggs-crime-and-second-chances-in-alabama", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i763RjYDAA84/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "The Kentucky senator thinking about a presidential run visits Montgomery for dinner with the Alabama GOP."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Rand Paul Talks\u00a0Eggs, Crime, and Second Chances in\u00a0Alabama", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NK3UDQ6KLVR701", "keywords": "Rand Paul,2016", "parsely-type": "post", "date": "2015-02-21T04:41:50.301Z", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-21T04:41:50.301Z", "parsely-tags": "Rand Paul,2016,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Rand Paul,2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcffed\"", "article_summary": "Near the end of his 25 minute speech, Paul noted the need to diversify the Republican constituency.\nPaul then recognized two Tarrant police officers, then launched into a series of attacks on big government.\nWayne Reynolds, a Vietnam Veteran, was cautious in his assessment of Paul as a contender for the Republican nomination.\nInstead, Sen.
