In real life, sportsmen use sound suppressors for their firearms at the shooting range, Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., says.\n\nThe heavily regulated suppressors remain lawful in 41 of 50 states. But current law makes obtaining one difficult. Before purchasing the silencing devices, consumers must pay a $200 tax and undergo a strict background check.\n\nNow Salmon wants to make sound suppressors accessible across the country. His Hearing Protection Act would eliminate the tax while simplifying the background checks. And if passed, the bill would do more than rebrand the image of suppressors for firearms.\n\nIt could dramatically change the way shooters protect their hearing, Salmon said.\n\n\u201cIt just makes sense,\u201d Salmon told The Daily Signal, \u201cbecause suppressors make a big difference, so that guys like me can shoot and keep their hearing.\u201d\n\nSalmon\u2019s father, a World War II veteran, introduced him to shooting as a sport when he was a boy. More than 50 years later, shooting has left Salmon wearing hearing aids.\n\nSort of a muffler for rifles and pistols, suppressors can reduce sound, flash, and recoil significantly during a gunshot. And though they don\u2019t completely silence the noise, the devices make guns quieter and safer, gun advocates say.\n\n\u201cSuppressors significantly reduce the chance of hearing loss for anyone who enjoys the shooting sports,\u201d Chris Cox, executive director of NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement. \u201cOn behalf of the NRA and our 5 million members, I want to thank Rep. Salmon for his leadership on this important bill.\u201d\n\nSilencers haven\u2019t always received that sort of praise.\n\nIn response to Prohibition-era violence, the 1934 National Firearms Act strictly regulated their use. Using a silenced firearm during a crime carries a mandatory prison sentence of at least 30 years.\n\nAnd today, while a standard instant background check takes less than an hour, the permit process for obtaining a silencer can take up to 10 months.\n\nSalmon described that process as \u201cantiquated\u201d and said the rules \u201cjust don\u2019t make sense.\u201d The Arizona Republican points out that criminals aren\u2019t packing quieter heat.\n\nA Western Criminology Review article from 2007 reports that of 80,000 federal criminal prosecutions over 10 years, only 30 to 40 involved someone using silencers.\n\nStill, getting the legislation through Congress and into law will be a long shot.\n\nIn the last year of his term, President Obama has made stricter gun control an increased priority. In January, the White House revealed a new package of executive orders designed to curb what it calls gun violence.\n\nSalmon remains bullish about his bill\u2019s chances.\n\nBy framing the issue around a safety measure, by \u201ccouching this the way I have,\u201d Salmon said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why [Obama] would be against protecting people\u2019s hearing. I don\u2019t know why anybody would.\u201d\n\nThe Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence did not respond to The Daily Signal\u2019s requests for comment.
