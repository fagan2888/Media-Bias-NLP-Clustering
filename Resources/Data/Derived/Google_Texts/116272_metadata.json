We have an African-American character. We have an Asian-American character, so I think we are dealing with different ethnicities,\" Haigh said. \"There's always a limit to what you can put in a half-hour show and we've never tried to represent the whole of the LGBT community because it's an enormous community made up of lots of different elements. All we can really do is try and tell a story about our characters.\"\n\nHear more from Haigh and Lannan in the clip above and to see the full interview, which also tackles sex on the screen and more comparisons to \"Girls,\" head here.\n\n\"Looking\" premieres on HBO on Sunday, January 19, at 10:30pm ET.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Pride Movies Pride Movies\n\n1 of 45 'Weekend' SteveDenver:\n\nThis film was hailed as a \"mainstream gay romance\" for its joyously real depiction of two men who meet, converse, connect and couple for a weekend.
