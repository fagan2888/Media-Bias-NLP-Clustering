It\u2019s his first job, but, already, he\u2019s picking up on the store\u2019s standards.\n\n\u201cWell, a lady came through the drive through,\u201d McGee said. \u201cShe was pretty upset. She was crying.\u201d\n\nIt happened last week. McGee says the woman could hardly speak. Finally, he understood, she wanted to order a shake.\n\n\u201cAnd then I made it for her and I handed it to her and I\u2019m like, your shake is on me tonight, you have a good night,\u201d McGee said.\n\nShe smiled and drove away. Earlier this week, she returned and asked to speak with a manager.\n\n\u201cI was really shocked actually,\u201d McGee said. \u201cI didnt expect her to come back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never know, when someone asks for a manager, if it\u2019s going to be good or bad,\u201d VanDyke added.\n\nBut it was good. The woman told VanDyke about McGee\u2019s kind act and explained why she was distraught that day.\n\n\u201cShe told me that, you know, she had just lost her husband a few weeks ago, and it was really tough, and I understood where she was coming from because I\u2019ve had the same experience and so I felt really bad for her, but it was really cool that Brenden could cheer her up,\u201d VanDyke said.\n\nThe woman also asked VanDyke whether Whitey\u2019s would be able to give him recognition.\n\n\u201cI said no, we don\u2019t have any employee of the month kind of thing, but we do let our office know,\u201d VanDyke said.\n\nSo they put a note under his employee file and a small, \u201cWay to go Brenden\u201d sign in back room for his small act of kindness, which, for the woman, went a long way.\n\n\u201cIt definitely is better to be kind and polite, I mean, we automatically have to be polite to people, but it\u2019s always nice to go that extra mile,\u201d McGee said.\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
