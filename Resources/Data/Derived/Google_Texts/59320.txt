An Oklahoma City man was arrested after being accused of exposing himself to people at St. Eugene's School in The Village.

A woman told police 26-year-old Christian Costello was walking around the school Friday afternoon around 4 p.m.

The woman said she saw him with his pants down in front of a school window. He then reportedly turned to face her with his genitals exposed.

Officers with The Village Police Department said when they found Costello, he was chewing on bird feathers, dandelions and other weeds.
