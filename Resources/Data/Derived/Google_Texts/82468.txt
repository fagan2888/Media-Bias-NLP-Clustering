But I hope when people read this, and I hope they do, is that they understand that when he reached across and grabbed my arm after the speech on September the 14 in the National Cathedral, I mean, incredibly emotional moment for me, it was in many ways symbolic of what he’d meant for me as president. In other words, he was a comforter.

Bush also had some super deep “thoughts” on ISIS, like how it is bad and we should defeat it somehow. Yet in a treacherous move of treachery, which really makes you wonder if he’s even a Republican anymore, he refused to say how it is all Obama’s fault for being a secret terrorist-lover, even though he was given the perfect opportunity to do so:

First thing is there has to be a goal, and the president has laid out what I think is a good goal, and that is to degrade and defeat ISIS. Once you state the goal, then you have to put plans in place to achieve the goal. And seems like to me the initial plans are being adjusted, and all I hope is that we succeed, because ISIS is lethal.

Sure hope Republicans don’t hear about Dubya’s gushing over the current president’s “good goal,” or they might have to IMPEACH!
