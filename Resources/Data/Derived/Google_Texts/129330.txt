Niwot officials on Friday urged residents to cut back on water usage after the volume of water into its sanitation plant quadrupled.

“If you can avoid doing laundry or taking long showers we would really appreciate it because that would help a great deal,” said Gayle Packard, general manager of the Niwot Sanitation District.

She said normally the plant processes 600,000 gallons of wastewater a day, and with flooding the plant now has 2.5 million gallons per day.

“They can flush,” she said. “We don’t want to create a health problem.”

The concern is keeping the right mix of microbes in the water to adequately treat sewage before it leaves the plant, Packard said.

“The water from the flooding goes into the manholes and just pours into our plant,” she said. “We have every pump going.”

The sanitation district serves the towns of Niwot and Gunbarrel.
