Another chapter will begin to unfold this coming Sunday evening when the CBS news magazine show 60 Minutes examines the situation.\n\nAccording to the Charlotte Business Journal, Duke CEO Lynn Good will be interviewed by Leslie Stahl. No word on whether they will discuss the intimate relationship between Duke and the McCrory administration.\n\nThe Guv. of course is a former 28-year Duke employee, who keeps hiring many of his former colleagues into state government.\n\nThe story was apparently recorded in September, but the coal ash mess hasn\u2019t gotten any better since \u2014 with residents of Lee County balking at hosting a repository, new leaks springing up and a federal investigation of the whole situation still lurking out there somewhere.\n\nBottom line: Stay tuned.
