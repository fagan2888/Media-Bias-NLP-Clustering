This year, over 150 Connecticut wish kids and their families will travel for their Make-A-Wish experience. The average number of miles needed for one domestic round-trip ticket is 50,000.

Help make a difference on Thursday, Jan. 22 by donating your unused airline miles. Participating programs include Delta Air Lines SkyMiles, United Airlines MileagePlus and US Airways Dividend Miles.

Make-A-Wish will recognize your company’s support through the web and social media channels upon the campaign’s completion.

You can donate your miles here.
