I won every argument but one.\u201d\n\nKrupp then detailed the only political argument he claimed her ever lost, a drunken encounter he had with a \u201cconservative gay prick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sat in a pizza joint, chomping on meat-heavy pizza and slamming whisky sours with gay guys on Pride Parade day in Columbus, Ohio; My gay roommate and friends loved to ironically \u2018bro-out.\u2019 I love gays because they are all liberal fucks too,\u201d Krupp wrote.\n\n\u201cSomeone mentions politics and everyone perks up, distracted from the whisky. Equal rights get first dibs, followed by education and then sassy comments about closeted Republicans. Feeding off the energy, I introduce abortion: \u2018Old men controlling women\u2019s bodies.\u2019 The guy who\u2019s stayed silent, Chip, joins the conversation,\u201d Krupp wrote.\n\nKrupp claimed that he at first told Chip, a conservative on the abortion issue, that his \u201cignorant views come from his biological disregard toward pregnancy,\u201d prompting Chip to explain a procedure by which fetuses can be removed from the womb, grown elsewhere, then given up for adoption.\n\n\u201cThe whisky yelled at Chip for being a terrible gay man. Chip smirked, knowing full well he won the argument,\u201d Krupp wrote. \u201cTo this day, I haven\u2019t fact checked Chip\u2019s scientific report. Beyond the women\u2019s rights implications, I\u2019m afraid it would be the ultimate surrender if I knew the truth. No matter, the liberal fuck lost to the conservative gay prick that day; one rode off into the sunset, the other ordered another whisky.\u201d\n\nKrupp\u2019s parents, an accountant and an attorney, are \u201cChicago Machine Democrats,\u201d according to a source.\n\nAs The Daily Caller reported, Krupp was accused of racism and anti-Semitism during his college-aged stint as the editor of the Madison, Wisconsin comedy newspaper the \u201cMadison Misnomer.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMisnomer\u201d ran a piece joking about 9/11 and was accused of running offensive content, according to a 2010 Krupp interview with The Badger Herald.\n\n\u201cWe have gotten complaints about the paper being too harsh on Jewish students. It\u2019s a comedy newspaper. Is there any doubt 95 percent of the writers are Jewish?\u2026Actually, people have called us racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, fascist, ageist, homophobic, self-loathing, Glenn Beck supporters, Coasties and other negative words people commonly mistake with communism. To them I give a huge middle finger, and then probably agree with their concerns,\u201d Krupp said.\n\n\u201cThat person was murdered,\u201d Krupp said of the critic who compared him to a Glenn Beck supporter.\n\n\u201cWe have no morals, and we will attack you. But you really don\u2019t have to worry because no one reads the paper anyway,\u201d Krupp added.\n\nThough Krupp has been widely condemned for his smirking, cocoa-sipping performance in multiple Obamacare ads, at least one individual claiming to be a personal friend of Krupp\u2019s has come out in Pajama Boy\u2019s defense, and said that President Obama is \u201clucky\u201d to have Krupp in his corner.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Ethan Krupp characterized himself pretty harshly", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Ethan Krupp, the little man who played \"Pajama Boy\" in a widely mocked Obamacare ad, once characterized himself as a \"liberal fuck.\"    Krupp, an Organizing for Action (OFA) content writer who became", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Pajama Boy: \u2018I am a liberal f***\u2019", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/12/27/obamacares-pajama-boy-i-am-a-liberal-f/", "image": {"width": 689, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/pajamaBoy-e13874871215341.jpg", "height": 297}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Well said, sir", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Pajama Boy: \u2018I am a liberal f***\u2019 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/12/27/obamacares-pajama-boy-i-am-a-liberal-f/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/pajamaBoy-e13874871215341.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-27 08:45:29", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare's Pajama Boy: 'I am a liberal f***'", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,pajama-boy,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "ethan krupp,obamacare,pajama boy", "sailthru.description": "Ethan Krupp, the little man who played \"Pajama Boy\" in a widely mocked Obamacare ad, once characterized himself as a \"liberal fuck.\"    Krupp, an Organizing for Action (OFA) content writer who became", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/pajamaBoy-e13874871215341.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d23\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA Liberal Fuck is not a Democrat, but rather someone who combines political data and theory, extreme leftist views and sarcasm to win any argument while make the opponents feel terrible about themselves.\n4037885Ethan Krupp, the little man who played \u201cPajama Boy\u201d in a widely mocked Obamacare ad, once characterized himself as a \u201cliberal fuck.\u201dKrupp, an Organizing for Action (OFA) content writer who became the face of progressive America while wearing a onesie pajama suit, also remarked that gays \u201care all liberal fucks\u201d and criticized a \u201cconservative gay prick\u201d on his now-deleted WordPress blog, entitled \u201cNot Being Creative.\u201d\u201cI am a Liberal Fuck,\u201d Krupp wrote in one post.\nNo matter, the liberal fuck lost to the conservative gay prick that day; one rode off into the sunset, the other ordered another whisky.\u201dKrupp\u2019s parents, an accountant and an attorney, are \u201cChicago Machine Democrats,\u201d according to a source.\nChip smirked, knowing full well he won the argument,\u201d Krupp wrote.\nFeeding off the energy, I introduce abortion: \u2018Old men controlling women\u2019s bodies.\u2019 The guy who\u2019s stayed silent, Chip, joins the conversation,\u201d Krupp wrote."}
