Terry McAuliffe has made no secret of his desire to provide approximately 400,000 uninsured Virginians access to health care coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nSince taking office last January, McAuliffe has encountered fierce resistance from Republicans equally determined to keep Obamacare out of the commonwealth.\n\nUnable to expand Medicaid without legislative approval, McAuliffe\u2019s only hope is to gain control of the Senate and negotiate some type of agreement with the Republican-dominated House.\n\nThe first part of that equation likely hinges on the Democrats\u2019 ability to win the 10th District seat, which has been held by moderate Republican John Watkins since 1998.\n\nThe 10th District includes parts of Chesterfield and Richmond and all of Powhatan County.\n\nThe GOP currently holds a 21-19 advantage in the Senate. Assuming the status quo holds for all other contested seats, swinging the 10th District into the Democrats\u2019 column effectively would give them control of the chamber because Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam holds the tie-breaking vote.\n\nAll three Democrats enthusiastically supported the expansion of Medicaid during last week\u2019s forum.\n\n\u201cI have built my career standing up for what is right,\u201d Francis said. \u201cYou will never have to wonder where I stand on these priorities.\u201d\n\nBy continuing to tout her progressive credentials, Francis is trying to woo the party\u2019s base while subtly raising questions about her opponents\u2019 political loyalties.\n\nMcMurtrie has close ties to former Gov. Bob McDonnell, who appointed him to the Virginia Commonwealth University board of visitors in 2010.\n\nPolitical disclosure forms show that McMurtrie has given money to Virginia governors from both parties \u2013 McDonnell and Jim Gilmore on the right, McAuliffe and Mark Warner on the left.\n\nBut if people in his own party are skeptical about McMurtrie, it pales in comparison to how some Democrats feel about Gecker\u2019s past representation of Kathleen Willey, one of the women who made allegations of improper behavior against former President Bill Clinton.\n\nFurther adding to the intrigue is that Hillary Clinton is considered an overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic nomination for president in 2016.\n\nMcAuliffe, a close friend of both Bill and Hillary Clinton, called Gecker \u201ca progressive leader\u201d in announcing his endorsement for the 10th District seat last Friday.\n\n\u201cThe governor seems to be saying, \u2018If I can forgive Dan, you should too,\u2019\u201d said one Richmondarea Democrat, who asked not to be identified.\n\nGecker already had been endorsed by Sen. Donald McEachin (D-Henrico), chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus, as well as eight of the nine members of the Richmond City Council.\n\nMcEachin was one of about 150 people in attendance at last week\u2019s forum, which lasted 75 minutes. What they heard was Gecker sounding little like the self-described \u201cfiscal conservative\u201d who has represented Midlothian on the Board of Supervisors for the past seven-and-a-half years.\n\n\n\nWhile McMurtrie and Francis stayed on their talking points, Gecker demonstrated command of the wide-ranging topics and related his experiences as a local government official to state and national issues.\n\nAsked by Carper to identify the first bill he\u2019d sponsor as a member of the General Assembly, Gecker instead spoke in general terms about \u201cdisparities in opportunity\u201d for residents of the diverse 10th District.\n\n\u201cI know what I want my legacy to be,\u201d he said. \u201cOur most significant challenge is the income divide. It\u2019s clear today that where you live to a large extent determines the quality of the education available to your children.\n\n\u201cI want to be a legislator who says to people, \u2018We will give you a hand up and a path forward.\u2019 If we don\u2019t do that, we\u2019re going to continue to have the same problems plague our country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chesterfield Observer", "description": "With less than a month remaining before 10th District Democrats select their nominee for November's state Senate election, the party's three candidates got together to share their views on an array of topics last week at Swift Creek Middle School.", "title": "Chasing Gecker", "headline": "Chasing Gecker", "image": "http://www.chesterfieldobserver.com/sites/www.chesterfieldobserver.com/files/images/2015-05-20/4p1.jpg", "url": "http://www.chesterfieldobserver.com/news/2015-05-20/Front_Page/Chasing_Gecker.html", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": "emma.breeden"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ourhometowninc", "image": "http://www.chesterfieldobserver.com/sites/www.chesterfieldobserver.com/files/images/2015-05-20/4p1.jpg", "description": "With less than a month remaining before 10th District Democrats select their nominee for November's state Senate election, the party's three candidates got together to share their views on an array of topics last week at Swift Creek Middle School.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chasing Gecker"}}, "article_summary": "The 10th District includes parts of Chesterfield and Richmond and all of Powhatan County.\nFrancis, a nonprofit lobbyist and first-time political candidate, noted several times that she\u2019s \u201cthe only progressive Democrat\u201d in the 10th District race.\nMcAuliffe, a close friend of both Bill and Hillary Clinton, called Gecker \u201ca progressive leader\u201d in announcing his endorsement for the 10th District seat last Friday.\nThe first part of that equation likely hinges on the Democrats\u2019 ability to win the 10th District seat, which has been held by moderate Republican John Watkins since 1998.\nAssuming the status quo holds for all other contested seats, swinging the 10th District into the Democrats\u2019 column effectively would give them control of the chamber because Democratic Lt.
