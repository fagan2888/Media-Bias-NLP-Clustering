When finalized it will be the largest free-trade agreement in history, impacting up to one-third of world trade and roughly 40 percent of the global gross domestic product. The deal has attracted a fair share of criticism from a wide range of groups, including concerns over proposed regulations for biologic drugs in participating countries. Specifically, critics are concerned about the length of data exclusivity granted to the companies that hold the patents on these drugs. Below is a primer on biologics and how they are being addressed in the TPP.\n\nWhat are biologics and biosimilars?\n\nBiologic drugs include any therapy derived from a biological source; a group which includes vaccines, anti-toxins, proteins, and monoclonal antibodies. Because they are typically much larger and more structurally complex than traditional \u2018small-molecule\u2019 drugs, they are also more difficult\u2014and much more costly\u2014to develop and manufacture. Biologics are also among the most expensive drugs on the market, costing an average of 22 times more than nonbiologic drugs. Avastin, a cancer drug, can cost more than $50,000 a year, while the rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade can cost up to $2,500 per injection.\n\nGiven these high costs, there is substantial interest in encouraging the development of biosimilars, a term used to describe follow-on versions of an original biologic. Estimates of the potential cost savings vary substantially, but some have predicted that competition from biosimilars could reduce US spending on biologics by $44 to $66 billion over the next ten years. In the European Union, biosimilars have been on the market since 2006, and a 2013 analysis found that, for the 14 biosimilars on the market, the average price discount was about 25 percent. By 2020, the overall cost savings are projected to total $16-$43 billion.\n\nAfter the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed in 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed an accelerated approval pathway for biosimilars, modeled after the pathway used for the approval of small-molecule generics. In order to meet the criteria for biosimilarity, the drug must share the same mechanism of action for the approved condition of use, and there must be no clinically significant differences between the two drugs in terms of purity, safety, or potency. FDA recently approved its first biosimilar, Zarxio, which is a copy of the oncology drug Neupogen.\n\nWhat issues are being raised over data exclusivity in the US?\n\nUnder current FDA regulations, biologic drugs are granted 12 years of data exclusivity following approval. During this period of exclusivity, the FDA may not approve a biosimilar application that relies on the data submitted as part of the original biologic application. This form of temporary monopoly is distinct from patent protection, which is granted well before approval and is not related to clinical data. Data exclusivity does not prevent another company from generating the data independently, but drug companies are unlikely to go to the considerable (and costly) effort of replicating a full course of clinical trials for a drug that is already on the market. (Though biosimilars may need to undergo some additional clinical testing under current FDA regulations, the amount of data required to support approval would certainly be less than what is required for an original biologic approval.)\n\nThe 12-year exclusivity period for biologics was established in the ACA following intense debate, and has continued to attract criticism. (By contrast, the period of data exclusivity is just five years for small-molecule drugs.) Supporters argue that given the greater cost and difficulty of bringing a biologic to market a longer period of exclusivity is necessary to incentivize innovation. Others argue that the resulting restrictions on competition keep drug prices unnecessarily high, inevitably putting a strain on the health system and keeping potentially life-saving drugs out of reach for many patients.\n\nHow would the TPP affect data exclusivity?\n\nFor the 11 countries besides the U.S. that are involved in the TPP, current data exclusivity protections range from zero (Brunei) to eight years (Japan). Under the Obama Administration\u2019s current proposal, participating countries would increase those periods to match the US standard of 12 years. Curiously, this proposal directly contradicts the administration\u2019s ongoing domestic efforts to lower the period of data exclusivity. Since the ACA passed, the Obama administration has repeatedly proposed reducing it to seven, arguing that this would save Medicare $4.4 billion over the next decade. Some have noted that, once the 12-year period is enshrined in the TPP, it will become significantly more difficult to change it through the US legislative process. Furthermore, imposing US standards on the 11 member countries would inevitably restrict competition at the global level, and many patient advocacy and international humanitarian organizations have argued that doing so would undermine the efforts of US global health initiatives like the Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which rely on price competition to manage program costs.\n\nIt is unclear whether the US will be successful in its efforts. There have been reports that the issue of data exclusivity has become a significant point of contention, and the US delegation may seek to compromise on its demands. It may, for example, negotiate exceptions for the poorer countries involved in the negotiation, as the Washington Post notes. However, the details of the negotiations are largely confidential, which makes it challenging to assess the possibilities, their relative advantages, or how the US Trade Representative (which is leading the US negotiations) is balancing the need to ensure adequate incentives for innovation with the need to control drug costs and facilitate patient access to potentially life-saving therapies.\n\nEditor's note: Elizabeth Richardson, a research associate in the Center for Health Policy, contributed to the research and writing of this post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This Health Policy 101 blog explains how a major trade deal -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- is attracting criticism over the length of data exclusivity granted to pharmaceutical companies that hold the patents on biologic drugs.", "title": "Health policy 101: How the Trans-Pacific Partnership will impact prescription drugs", "og": {"site_name": "The Brookings Institution", "description": "This Health Policy 101 blog explains how a major trade deal -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- is attracting criticism over the length of data exclusivity granted to pharmaceutical companies that hold the patents on biologic drugs.", "title": "Health policy 101: How the Trans-Pacific Partnership will impact prescription drugs", "url": "http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/health360/posts/2015/05/19-trans-pacific-partnership-prescription-drugs", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/blogs/health360/biomedical/health360_pharma3/health360_pharma3_16x9.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en", "type": "website", "determiner": "auto"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 151106990, "title": "Health policy 101: How the Trans-Pacific Partnership will impact prescription drugs", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu//~/media/blogs/health360/biomedical/health360_pharma3/health360_pharma3_16x9.jpg?w=560", "height": 315}, "site": {"identifier": "BrookingsInst", "id": 151106990}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "This Health Policy 101 blog explains how a major trade deal -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- is attracting criticism over the length of data exclusivity granted to pharmaceutical companies that hold the patents on biologic drugs."}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 137459917707}, "ces": {"broadcontenttype": "Commentary ; Blog Posts", "programs": "Economic Studies", "topics": "Health ; Biomedical Innovation", "topicsbroad": "Health", "centers": "Center for Health Policy", "contentdate": "2015/05/19 11:20:00", "title": "Health policy 101: How the Trans-Pacific Partnership will impact prescription drugs", "researchactivities": "Center for Health Policy ; Economic Studies", "topicsspecialized": "Biomedical Innovation"}, "keywords": "TPP and pharmaceuticals, TPP effect on drugs, TPP and drug pricing, trade agreement and drug pricing, trans-pacific partnership and pharma effects, trans pacific partnership biologics, 7 year exclusivity TPP biologics TPP, 12 year exclusivity, biologics exclusivity in the TPP, obama TPP biologics", "article": {"tag": "Health", "published_time": "2015-05-19", "modified_time": "2015-5-21"}}, "article_summary": "Biologic drugs include any therapy derived from a biological source; a group which includes vaccines, anti-toxins, proteins, and monoclonal antibodies.\nSpecifically, critics are concerned about the length of data exclusivity granted to the companies that hold the patents on these drugs.\nThe 12-year exclusivity period for biologics was established in the ACA following intense debate, and has continued to attract criticism.\nUnder current FDA regulations, biologic drugs are granted 12 years of data exclusivity following approval.\nThe deal has attracted a fair share of criticism from a wide range of groups, including concerns over proposed regulations for biologic drugs in participating countries."}
