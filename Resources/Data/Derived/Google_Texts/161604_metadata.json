For suburban Cook County sites, go to www.countyclerk.com. For city sites, go to www.chicagoelections.com. To read our endorsements in state Legislature races and the Cook County Circuit Court clerk race, as well as for candidate questionnaires and related news stories, go to suntimescandidates.com.\n\n1st District, Democratic Primary\n\nOur endorsement goes to longtime incumbent Bobby L. Rush in this district, which runs southwest from near McCormick Place to south of Joliet, taking in much of Chicago\u2019s South Side. Rush has missed more votes on Capitol Hill than any other member of Congress in recent times, but he\u2019s had to get through some tough times in his personal life, caring for his ill wife, struggling with the gun slaying of his son and fighting illness of his own. Despite his missed votes, Rush\u2019s seniority in Congress puts him in a position to deliver for his constituents. His opponents, Ald. Howard B. Brookins Jr. (21st) and civic activist O. Patrick Brutus, say it\u2019s time for a change. We say: not yet. And when this seat in Congress does change hands, it should go to someone with a wealth of experience and measurable accomplishments.\n\n1st District, Republican Primary\n\nIn a demographically diverse district that stretches from Chicago\u2019s Near South Side to Will County, you might welcome a good competitive race in the November general election: 700,000 people can\u2019t all think alike. Good luck with that. Two marginal candidates, underfunded and enjoying no notable party support, are running in the Republican primary. Neither stands much chance in this solidly Democratic district. Blogtalk radio host Jimmy Lee Tillman II, who was the Republican nominee two years ago because nobody ran against him, wants to build a wall along the Mexican border and deport some 11 million undocumented residents. The other candidate, August \u201cO\u2019Neill\u201d Deuser, a retired special education teacher who lives in Mokena, ran unsuccessfully for the state House two years ago as a Democrat. He did not participate in our endorsement process. No endorsement.\n\n2nd District, Democratic Primary\n\nRobin Kelly, first elected in 2013, is endorsed for re-election over three less experienced or accomplished candidates. In her brief time in Congress, Kelly has distinguished herself as a thought leader on two issue of importance to her South Side and south suburban constituents: health care and gun violence. In 2015, she authored a substantive \u201cKelly Report\u201d on health disparities, in cooperation with fellow members of Congress and medical professionals. In 2014, she authored \u201cKelly Report: Gun Violence in America.\u201d Among other policy recommendations, the report calls for a repeal on gun manufacturers\u2019 legal immunity so that gun violence victims can sue them for damages. Also on the ballot is former USPS mail handler Marcus Lewis. Two other candidates, Charles Rayburn and Dorian C.L. Myrickes, did not participate in our endorsement process.\n\n4th District, Democratic primary\n\nWe strongly endorse the incumbent, Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, a champion for immigration reform for a congressional district that covers several heavily Latino communities, including Brighton Park, Little Village, Melrose Park and Cicero. Despite persistent efforts, Gutierrez has been unable to get an immigration bill through the Republican-led House, but he can claim other pivotal victories: He and his colleagues in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus were influential in President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action in 2012 that gave temporarily legal status to Dreamers, those brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Later, Gutierrez and the Caucus helped the White House shape its 2014 deferred action for millions of undocumented parents with U.S.-born children, an action the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing. Gutierrez is an easy choice over radio broadcaster Javier Salas, a former policy adviser to Gov. Pat Quinn who has no experience as an elected official. At the same time, we urge Gutierrez to spend more time in Washington for House votes. He ranks second for most absences.\n\n5th District, Green Primary\n\nThe 5th District is the only place in the Chicago area where voters can pick up a Green Party primary ballot in this election. The primary contest pits well-known atheist advocate Rob Sherman against remodeling contractor and political newcomer Warren \u201cGrizz\u201d Grimsley. We think Grimsley\u2019s call to forgive all student loan debt \u2014 even for former students who can afford to pay \u2014 is unrealistic. But overall we prefer his classic Green Party stance to Sherman\u2019s call for vastly expanding the concealed carrying of firearms and replacing the income tax with a consumption tax. We also think Sherman, of Buffalo Grove, should commit to moving into the district if he wins. The district borders Lake Michigan on the Near North Side and extends west to DuPage County, including all or parts of Elmhurst, Elmwood Park, Franklin Park, La Grange Park, Norridge, Northlake, River Grove, Schiller Park and Oakbrook Terrace. The winner will face Democrat Mike Quigley and likely an appointed Republican candidate in November.\n\n6th District, Republican Primary\n\nFor the same reason nine-year incumbent Peter Roskam has drawn a hard-right challenger in this Republican primary, he\u2019ll be tough to beat in November. Roskam is a staunch conservative in a conservative west suburban district that stretches over parts of four counties, but he\u2019s no ideological dead-ender. He voted for the Omnibus Appropriations Bill FY 2016, for example, which kept the government from shutting down. It was far from a perfect bill, to Roskam\u2019s thinking, but it included many good conservative provisions, such as a continued ban on federal funds for most abortions. Now Roskam is being criticized for that vote by challenger Gordon \u201cJay\u201d Kinzler, a doctor, because the bill also funded Planned Parenthood. Roskam declined to sit for an interview with the Editorial Board, ruling out an endorsement, but Kinzler might only add to Washington\u2019s destructive polarization. No endorsement.\n\n6th District, Democratic Primary\n\nAmanda Howland is a lawyer, former school administrator and \u2014 perhaps best of all \u2014 professional mediator. She says she would use her bridge-building skills to \u201cat least try\u201d to end the \u201chyper-partisanship\u201d in Washington. Incumbent Peter Roskam, she says, is out of touch with the 6th District\u2019s generally fiscally conservative but socially moderate values. Howland, a College of Lake County trustee, says a \u201ctop priority\u201d in Congress would be to reduce student debt by lowering loan rates. She would restructure the tax code to strengthen the middle class, ending \u201ctax havens and accounting gimmicks\u201d for \u201cwealthy special interests.\u201d She would revise the Affordable Care Act to address the problem of rising premiums and high deductibles for those who do not qualify for subsidies. Also on the ballot is Robert Marshall, a physician and perennial candidate whose ideas are not always feasible. To increase representation in Washington for the most populous states, he would divide them into smaller states, each retaining two senators. Illinois would be divided four ways \u2014 Chicago, Suburban Cook, North Illinois and South Illinois. We endorse Amanda Howland.\n\nComing Wednesday: Endorsements in the 7th District Democratic race, 10th District Democratic race, 11th District Republican race and 14th District Democratic race.\n\nFollow the Editorial Board on Twitter: Follow @csteditorials\n\nTweets by @CSTeditorials", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Even in Illinois, where Springfield pols have mastered the art of gerrymandering to create legislative districts that lopsidedly favor one party or", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/editorial-eight-endorsements-for-congress/", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Editorial: Eight endorsements for Congress"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/editorial-eight-endorsements-for-congress/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "Editorial: Eight endorsements for Congress"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Coming Wednesday: Endorsements in the 7th District Democratic race, 10th District Democratic race, 11th District Republican race and 14th District Democratic race.\n2nd District, Democratic PrimaryRobin Kelly, first elected in 2013, is endorsed for re-election over three less experienced or accomplished candidates.\nHere are our endorsements in eight Chicago-area congressional races, with more endorsements to come on Wednesday.\n6th District, Democratic PrimaryAmanda Howland is a lawyer, former school administrator and \u2014 perhaps best of all \u2014 professional mediator.\nTwo marginal candidates, underfunded and enjoying no notable party support, are running in the Republican primary."}
