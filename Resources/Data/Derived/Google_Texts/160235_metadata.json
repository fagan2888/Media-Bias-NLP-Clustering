It's a day to celebrate and care for the person you married, whether you\u2019ve been together three or 35 years.\n\nSpouses Day isn\u2019t a national holiday; it is similar to Valentine\u2019s Day, without all the consumerism and emphasis on spending money. It\u2019s a day to stop what you're doing and think about the value that your spouse brings to your life, and the best ways for you to show your gratitude and appreciation. Over time, it can be hard to let go of the little arguments you have, or even take time to go on dates or spend time in the bedroom. Remember, a happy marriage has been linked to better physical and mental health in various studies. So you\u2019re investing not only in you and your spouses\u2019 happiness, but your collective health as well. These five tips will assist you in making your Spouses Day \u2014 and overall marriage \u2014 special.\n\nBe Their Best Friend\n\nWhile being romantic is important, one of the most important aspects of a solid, long-term marriage is friendship. Friendship lasts after the fires of passion have died down, and helps keep people grounded and standing side by side through stressful situations, life transitions, and even mid-life crises.\n\nIn a recent study, researchers examined why people who were married managed to have greater life satisfaction and overall stability than people who were single. They found that friendship was a major factor in making married people happy. \u201cWe explore friendship as a mechanism which could help explain a causal relationship between marriage and life satisfaction, and find that wellbeing effects of marriage are about twice as large for those whose spouse is also their best friend,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nIndeed, marrying your best friend \u2014 or focusing on improving your friendship over time \u2014 can have a positive impact on both of your lives. Treat your spouse not only as a piece of furniture in the house, but also as your best friend. You\u2019d never lie to your best friend, or mistrust or hurt him or her, so remember that when dealing with your spouse as well.\n\nDo Something Special That Reflects Their Favorite Things\n\nOn Spouses Day, take your husband or wife out to one of their favorite restaurants, to see a movie they've been interested in, or perhaps just let him or her watch a favorite TV show all night while you cook dinner. Do some chores to show you're thinking of them, and that you want to make their day a little easier. Or cook them their favorite breakfast in bed.\n\nGo On A Date That Costs Little To No Money\n\nWining and dining your spouse can be fun, but sometimes it\u2019s even better to do something simple. Take inspiration from some of your first dates, when it was all about getting to know each other without extravagance; when even just a walk in the park was exciting. Let go of the stresses you both experience in daily life and forget the arguments \u2014 and little blames \u2014 you hold over each other\u2019s heads. Go for a walk, have a picnic (indoors or outdoors, depending on where in the world you live), share a $20 bottle of wine and go somewhere you've never been before to explore a new part of the world, and explore each other.\n\nCherish Their Value\n\nFighting with your spouse is normal, but too much fighting can put a strain on the relationship. One of the best ways to avoid this is to make a list of all their good qualities and values that made you fall in love with them in the first place. It\u2019s often easy to overlook these things as time goes on and you begin gathering a checklist of their flaws; but focusing on the positives can always turn things around for the better. Make a list of 10 or more things that highlights your partner\u2019s amazing qualities \u2014 from trustworthiness and honesty to sense of humor \u2014 and read over that list when you\u2019re angry at them. It will put things in perspective and help you cherish their value every day.\n\nTreat Them Like Your Girlfriend Or Boyfriend, Not A Spouse\n\nSeveral years into marriage, it\u2019s likely you might start feeling like your spouse is more like your roommate than your lover. You become so comfortable with one another that the \u201cspark\u201d is rarely there the way it was in the beginning of the relationship. While this is natural and not necessarily a bad thing, it\u2019s important to keep some of that original excitement and lightheartedness alive in the relationship. As Jenny Perry wrote for the Huffington Post, it\u2019s possible to keep things alive with a little bit of touching up and focus. \u201cWe\u2019ve recreated our relationship, enhanced it, and made it even richer and more fulfilling,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s all about our intention and focus.\u201d\n\nAnd while lovey-dovey and overly romantic acts might seem to only be reserved for the honeymoon period, bringing them back could have a reigniting effect on your relationship. Perry, aiming at women \u2014 but not limited to them \u2014 wrote: \u201cMy tips: Text him both sexy and sweet messages. Own your beauty. There is nothing sexier than a happy, confident woman who can ask for what she wants in the bedroom. Make sex fun for you. Work on yourself. Be his girlfriend. Create your own magic, your love potion is you. Say \u2018I love you,\u2019 often.\u201d\n\nSpouses Day doesn't have to be a day of extravagance and spending money. It's the simple things that count and make life worthwhile: good friendships, positive thoughts, little acts of caring, and putting someone else's needs in front of your own.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "spouses day 2015, happy marriage, spouses", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Spouses Day is Jan. 26.
