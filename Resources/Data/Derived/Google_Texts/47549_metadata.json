It\u2019s Christmas in July at the U.S. Embassy compound. Behind high walls topped with fierce-looking metal impediments meant to discourage climbers, there\u2019s a party under way.\n\nClose your eyes and you could be at a stateside summer barbeque or an office holiday party. Even with them open, the local realities of dirt roads and dirty water, civil war, mass graves, and nightly shoot-to-kill curfews seem foreign. These walls, it turns out, are even higher than they look.\n\nOut by the swimming pool and the well-stocked bar, every table is packed with people. Slightly bleary-eyed men and sun-kissed women wear Santa hats and decorations in their hair. One festive fellow is dressed as Cousin Eddie from National Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation complete with a white sweater, black dickey, and bright white loafers. Another is straddling an inflatable killer whale that he\u2019s borrowed from the collection of playthings around the pool and is using as improvised chair while he stuffs his face from an all-American smorgasbord. We\u2019re all eating well tonight. Mac and cheese, barbequed ribs, beef tenderloin, fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans, and for desert, peach cobbler. The drinks are flowing, too: wine and whisky and fine Tusker beer.\n\nYuletide songs drift out into the sultry night in this, the capital of the world\u2019s newest nation. \u201cSimply having a wonderful Christmastime,\u201d croons Paul McCartney.\n\nJust 15 minutes away, near the airport in an area known as Tongping, things aren\u2019t quite so wonderful. There\u2019s no fried chicken, no ribs, no peach cobbler. At Juba\u2019s United Nations camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs), they\u2019re eating sorghum and a crude porridge made from a powdered blend of corn and soy beans provided by the United Nations\u2019 World Food Program. Children at the camp call it \u201cthe yellow food.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no good,\u201d one of them tells me, with a quick head shake for emphasis.\n\nI mention to a few of the embassy revelers that I\u2019m heading several hundred miles north to Malakal. A couple of them assure me that, according to colleagues, it\u2019s \u201cnot that bad.\u201d But while we\u2019re chowing down, an emaciated young girl in Malakal clings to life. This one-year-old arrived at the hospital run by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders, or MSF) at the U.N. camp there several days earlier, severely malnourished and weighing just 11 pounds. It\u2019s uncertain if she\u2019ll survive. One in 10 children who arrive at the hospital in her condition don\u2019t.\n\nA Man-Made Famine\n\nAs John Kerry, then-chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, put itin 2012, the United States \u201chelped midwife the birth\u201d of South Sudan. The choice of words may have been cringe-worthy, but hardly divorced from reality. For more than 20 years, a bipartisan coalition in Washington and beyond championed rebel forces here. As the new nation broke away from Sudan, after decades of bloody civil war, the U.S. poured in billions of dollars in aid, including hundreds of millions of dollars of military and security assistance, and sent military instructors to train the country\u2019s armed forces and advisers to mentor government officials.\n\nIt would be Washington\u2019s major nation-building effort in Africa, a new country destined to join Iraq and Afghanistan as a regional bulwark of democracy and a shining example of American know-how. On South Sudan\u2019s independence day, July 9, 2011, President Obama hailed the moment as a \u201ctime of hope\u201d and pledged U.S. partnership to the new land, emphasizing security and development. There\u2019s precious little evidence of either of these at the U.N. camps and even less in vast areas of the countryside now teetering on the edge of a catastrophic famine.\n\nSince a civil war broke out in December 2013, at least 10,000 South Sudanese have been killed, untold numbers of women and girls have been victims of sexual violence, and atrocities have been committed by all parties to the conflict. As a result, in the eyes of the United Nations, in a world of roiling strife \u2014 civil wars, mass killings, hunger, and conflicts from Iraq to Gaza, Ukraine to Libya \u2014 South Sudan is, along with the Central African Republic and Syria, one of just three \u201cL3 emergencies,\u201d the world\u2019s most severe, large-scale humanitarian crises. The country has also just displaced Somalia \u2014 for six years running the archetypal failed state \u2014 atop the Fund for Peace\u2019s 178-nation list of the world\u2019s most fragile nations.\n\nToday, close to 100,000 people are huddled on United Nations military bases around the country, just a fraction of the almost 1.5 million who have been put to flight and are waiting out the war as internal exiles or as refugees in the bordering nations of Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Sudan. Such massive levels of displacement guarantee another nightmare to come. Since so many subsistence farmers weren\u2019t around to plant their crops, despite fertile ground and sufficient rain, seeds never met soil and food never had a chance to grow.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time, because it\u2019s the rainy season, there\u2019s nothing we can do in terms of agriculture,\u201d says Caroline Saint-Mleux, the regional emergency coordinator for East and Central Africa at CARE International. Above us, the sky is darkening as we sit in plastic chairs in the muddy \u201chumanitarian hub,\u201d a grimy ghetto of white tents, nondescript trailers, and makeshift headquarters of aid agencies like the International Committee of the Red Cross and MSF, on the outer edge of the U.N. base at Malakal. Her organization did distribute a limited number of seeds to farmers still on their land earlier in the year, but can do no more. The planting season is long past. \u201cIt would be a waste of energy at this point,\u201d she says, resignation in her voice.\n\nFamine \u201cis a very realistic possibility,\u201d Deborah Schein tells me. She\u2019s the coordinator for the United Nations in Upper Nile State, where Malakal is located. Right now, experts are crunching the numbers and debating whether to formally declare a famine. Whether it\u2019s this fall or early next year, aid workers say, it\u2019s definitely coming and the sooner it comes, the more lives can be saved. Recently, U.N. Security Council President Eug\u00e8ne-Richard Gasanacalled attention to \u201cthe catastrophic food insecurity situation.\u201d Already, 3.9 million people \u2014 about one in three South Sudanese \u2014 face dangerous levels of food insecurity. However, unlike in Ethiopia in the 1980s, where drought led to crop failures that killed one million people, Vanessa Parra, Oxfam America\u2019s press liaison in South Sudan, says this country is facing an \u201centirely man-made famine.\u201d\n\nNyajuma\u2019s Story\n\nIf it were dry, it would take only five minutes to walk from Deborah Schein\u2019s office at the U.N. base in Malakal to the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res field hospital in the adjoining IDP camp where 17,000 South Sudanese are now taking refuge. But the rains have turned this ground into fetid mud and an easy walk into a slip-sliding slog.\n\nAt the end of a gray, mucky expanse that nearly sucks the boots off your feet, an MSF flag flies outside a barn-sized white tent. Before you enter, you need to visit a foot-washing station, then have your feet or boots disinfected. Even then, it\u2019s impossible to keep the grime out. \u201cAs you can imagine, this is not the best environment for a hospital,\u201d says Teresa Sancristoval, the energetic chief of MSF\u2019s emergency operations in Malakal.\n\nStep inside that tent and you\u2019re immediately in a ward that\u2019s electric with activity. It\u2019s hard to believe that this 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week hospital is manned by only three expat doctors and three expat nurses, plus a medical team leader. Still, add in various support personnel, local staff, and the many patients and suddenly this giant tent begins to shrink, putting space at a premium.\n\n\u201cThe great majority of the hospital is pediatrics,\u201d says Sancristoval, a compact dynamo from Madrid with the bearing of a field general and intense eyes that go wide when making a point. Not that she even needs to point that out. In this first ward, the 15 metal-frame beds \u2014 blue paint peeling, thin mattresses, four makeshift bamboo posts topped with mosquito nets \u2014 are packed tight, all but two filled with mother and child or children. Some days, there\u2019s not a bed to spare, leaving patients ill with infection and wracked by disease to sleep on whatever space can be found on the floor.\n\nOn a bed adjacent to the main thoroughfare sits a tiny girl in a yellow top and pink skirt, her head bandaged and covered in a clingy mesh net. Nyajuma has been in this hospital for two weeks. She was lying here inside this tent, wasted and withered, the night we were having our Christmas feast at the embassy about 400 miles south in Juba.\n\nNyajuma weighed only 11 pounds on arrival. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the average one-year-old girl in the U.S. weighs more than double that. She was quickly started on the first of two powdered therapeutic foods to combat her severe malnutrition, followed by a regimen ofPlumpy\u2019nut, a high-protein, high-calorie peanut paste, four times a day along with two servings of milk.\n\nIt would have been bad enough if her only problem were severe malnutrition, but that condition also exacerbated the skin infection beneath the bandages on her head. In addition, she suffers from kala azar, a deadly disease caused by a parasite spread by sandflies that results in prolonged fever and weakness. On top of that, she is being treated for two other potentially lethal maladies,cholera and tuberculosis. Her mother, resting beside her, looks exhausted, world-beaten. Pregnant on arrival, she gave birth five days later. She lies next to Nyajuma, listless, but carefully covers her face with her arm as if to shield herself from the harsh world beyond this bed.\n\nDuring her first week at the hospital, nurse Monica Alvarez tells me, Nyajuma didn\u2019t crack a smile. \u201cBut now, voil\u00e0,\u201d she says lifting the child, sparking a broad grin that reflects the sea change in her condition. Nyajuma is enduring the rigors of kala azar and tuberculosis treatments with great aplomb. \u201cShe\u2019s eating well and she\u2019s smiling all the time,\u201d says Alvarez, who\u2019s quick with a smile herself. But Nyajuma is still in the early stages of treatment. Once stable, severely malnourished children can be transferred to ambulatory care. But it takes roughly six weeks for them to make a full recovery and be discharged. And in today\u2019s South Sudan, they are the lucky ones.\n\nOf those who make it to the hospital in such a condition, 10% don\u2019t survive, Javier Roldan, MSF\u2019s medical team leader, tells me. \u201cWe have people who come in in later stages or have a co-infection because malnutrition has compromised their immune system, which makes treatment much more complicated.\u201d He talks of the difficulty of losing patients for want of better facilities, more staff, and greater resources. \u201cThe outcome of a baby weighing one and a half kilos [3.3 pounds] in Europe or America would be no problem at all, but here there\u2019s quite a high mortality rate,\u201d says Roldan. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating for the medical staff when you have patients die because you don\u2019t have the means to treat them.\u201d\n\nAnd Malakal is no anomaly. At the MSF feeding station in Leer, a town in adjoining Unity State, they\u2019ve treated roughly 1,800 malnourished children since mid-May, compared to 2,300 in all of last year. North of Leer, inBentiu, the site of repeated spasms of violence, the situation is especially grim. \u201cOver five percent of the children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition,\u201d says CARE\u2019s Country Director for South Sudan Aimee Ansari. \u201cOn the day I left Bentiu, CARE helped parents transport the bodies of children who had died from malnutrition to a burial site.\u201d In all, according to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the U.N. World Food Program (WFP), almost one million South Sudanese children under five years of age will require treatment for acute malnutrition in 2014. UNICEF projects that 50,000 of them could die.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America\u2019s African experiment in nation building has its limits, and we're this close to flying over the edge", "author": "Nick Turse", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "America\u2019s African experiment in nation building has its limits, and we're this close to flying over the edge", "title": "Global aid operations are just one catastrophe away from total collapse", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/09/global_aid_operations_are_just_one_catastrophe_away_from_total_collapse_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/07/mystery_bug_afflicts_south_sudanese_children.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "America\u2019s African experiment in nation building has its limits, and we're this close to flying over the edge", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/07/mystery_bug_afflicts_south_sudanese_children.jpg", "title": "Global aid operations are just one catastrophe away from total collapse", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Global aid operations are just one catastrophe away from total collapse", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Africa, global aid, South Sudan, TomDispatch.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd211\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Africa, global aid, South Sudan, TomDispatch.com, News, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on TomDispatchJuba, South Sudan \u2014 The soft glow of the dancing white lights is a dead giveaway.\nAt Juba\u2019s United Nations camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs), they\u2019re eating sorghum and a crude porridge made from a powdered blend of corn and soy beans provided by the United Nations\u2019 World Food Program.\n\u201cOver five percent of the children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition,\u201d says CARE\u2019s Country Director for South Sudan Aimee Ansari.\nAnd in today\u2019s South Sudan, they are the lucky ones.\nA Man-Made FamineAs John Kerry, then-chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, put itin 2012, the United States \u201chelped midwife the birth\u201d of South Sudan."}
