She was in the epicenter of the arts and fashion scene, helping stage major exhibitions.\n\n\u201cI always loved St. Pete, but, you know, I was one with the world, nomadic in a sense, and really open to opportunity,\u201d Williams recalls.\n\n\u201cIt was a weird thing. It was like, when I was here, I loved it, but I thought, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s bigger and brighter things,\u2019 and then I got away and I was like, \u2018Oh my Gosh! What have I done?\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Williams found herself spending a meager amount of savings to open the first incarnation of ARTPool on First Avenue North, an art gallery that has since moved into an old auto garage on Central Avenue and now offers an eclectic array of handmade jewelry, paintings, vintage clothing, vinyl records and an outdoor caf\u00e9.\n\nQuirky fashion parties are scheduled once a month on Saturday nights, such as a Day of the Dead-themed \u201cAbnormal Formal\u201d coming up this weekend.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunately \u2014 or fortunately \u2014 what happened for me. I was in London and I was like, I love all the fashion and the art, but I really miss St. Pete and I miss what\u2019s going on there and what can be going on there,\u201d said Williams, 30.\n\nWhenever Williams would help arrange an art exhibition in Chelsea or a fashion show in London, she wondered why she couldn\u2019t create the same thing back in her home town, only perhaps with a little less pomp and pretension and a little more fun and eccentricity.\n\n\u201cI traveled a lot and got great inspiration. All these other cities, they have \u2018art pools\u2019 or creative, inspirational spaces for people, but I really felt this void, and I was really close to my family, and I just thought, you know, why not create this mecca in St. Pete?\u201d said Williams, who runs her business with the help of her mother, Becky Williams, and significant other, Evan Williams.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nStep into one of the slick bars, coffee houses or microbreweries that have rapidly popped up around downtown in the past few years and the owner may have a similar homecoming story to tell.\n\nBut many of the young business owners now investing in their hometown didn\u2019t see the same potential when they were youths.\n\nAs teens at Gibbs or St. Petersburg high schools, they hit the beach every weekend, but dreamed of skipping out on \u201cGod\u2019s Waiting Room\u201d to live in a real city, like Manhattan or Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone I can remember growing up thought they were going to move somewhere else,\u201d said Nathan Stonecipher, 33, co-owner of Green Bench Brewing Company.\n\n\u201cFor me, personally, since I was doing finance, I thought I would be in Charlotte, which is kind of the southern part of the banking industry, because there just wasn\u2019t much going on here.\u201d\n\nStonecipher remembers playing manhunt, a nighttime version of tag that involves flashlights, with friends at what is now the Vinoy Golf Course.\n\n\u201cIt was closed and that was just a vacant piece of land, so we used to play manhunt or whatever else on this old golf course that hadn\u2019t been used in 20 years, all boarded up and shut down and roped off,\u201d he said.\n\nFew people hung around downtown in those days unless there was a special event going on.\n\nHeading into a construction career out of college, Stonecipher\u2019s childhood friend and now business partner, Steven Duffy, didn\u2019t initially expect to come back to St. Pete.\n\n\u201cOn the day we graduated high school, it was pretty much, \u2018Who is going away to college? How far are they going and are they going to stay there?\u2019 \u201d said Duffy, 32.\n\n\u201cNo one said,\u2018Right after college, I\u2019m moving straight back here.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nSarah Perrier grew up nearby in Seminole but attended Gibbs High School to study dance, which would take her to college in Philadelphia and eventually into a career with a professional dance company.\n\nShe left for the north in 1994, probably for good, she thought then.\n\nIn Philadelphia, she would gain an affection for \u201ccoffee culture\u201d during the long, cold winters, and also for a man who happened to be in the coffee business.\n\nOver the course of many trips with her husband, Raphael, to visit family back in St. Pete, Sarah began to warm up to the idea of coming back home.\n\n\u201cYou could just see things were happening here,\u201d Sarah Perrier said.\n\nThe Renaissance Vinoy had been restored, her father and uncle built up the adjacent Vinoy condos, and the Perriers could see a momentum growing.\n\n\u201cMy husband said, \u2018We should move here. There are so many opportunities,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\n\nIn 2008, the couple opened its first Kahwa Coffee shop on the ground floor of a condo building at Fifth Avenue and Second Street North.\n\nAt the time, there still weren\u2019t many people walking the streets.\n\n\u201cWe had an idea of what we wanted to create: a gathering place, the coffee shop where you would see all your friends there in the morning. There would be artists, there would be business people, there would be moms there with their kids, kind of a cross-section of different people,\u201d Sarah Perrier said.\n\n\u201cWe thought that would work, but you don\u2019t really know.\u201d\n\nIn a city without a significant local coffee culture, the Perriers have seen their freshly roasted coffee brand grow into six locations in St. Petersburg and Tampa, with more in the works.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThere\u2019s a T-shirt popular among the young artists and entrepreneurs that reads: Paris, London, Tokyo, St. Pete.\n\nMany of the city\u2019s young business owners say they wouldn\u2019t have the same creative drive if they hadn\u2019t left the Sunshine City for a while to experience a big, global city.\n\nMatt Kaye spent a decade managing bars and night clubs among the hip and artistic in Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg neighborhood.\n\n\u201cNew York was the most creative place I\u2019ve ever been. It was amazing,\u201d said Kaye, 37.\n\nAfter 10 years he watched the neighborhood become so cool that housing prices drove out many of the creative types, and Kaye felt an urge to return to the Sunshine City.\n\nIn 2012, he opened The Bends bar at 919 First Ave N. with his fianc\u00e9e and a group of long-time friends.\n\nThe bar, known as \u201cA Classy Dive,\u201d offers modestly priced specialty cocktails, displays canvasses and sculptures on the walls from local artists, and its d\u00e9cor is almost entirely made of recycled materials Kaye collected around the area \u2014 the bar, made of wood from the old Johns Pass pier, the old Edison-style light bulbs found in the ceiling of the property.\n\n\u201cI kind of came back like a grown up. I went up there and got all my knowledge and creativity and came back here to let it all loose,\u201d said Kaye.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nAs Stonecipher and Duffy saw the mecca St. Petersburg was becoming, not just for aging snowbirds, but for young entrepreneurs and families, both say they knew they\u2019d found the place where they wanted to invest their lives.\n\n\u201cI think deep down I always thought \u2018I\u2019m going to move back to St. Pete,\u2019\u201d Duffy said.\n\nTheir Green Bench brewery, near Tropicana Field off of Central Avenue, is named for the historic green benches that lined downtown streets in the city\u2019s 20th century heyday.\n\nThey, like the other city natives, feel they have a stake in making their hometown flourish again for their families and the community at large.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to live here forever, we want to make this community the best it can be, selfishly, since we live here,\u201d said Stonecipher.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere and hopefully it encourages younger people to come and do the same thing.\u201d\n\njboatwright@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-1277", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 12 Oct 2014 23:46:47 -0400", "Description": "ST.
