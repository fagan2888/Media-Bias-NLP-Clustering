Whether one agrees with the legislation or not, one thing we should all agree on is that health professionals from all disciplines must work together \u2014 and not in silos \u2014 for the benefit of the patient.\n\nThe law emphasizes interprofessional education for students and professionals, as well as inclusion of the patient and family in the health care team.\n\nThis is a paradigm shift from the 20th century in which patients were not actively involved as members of the health care team to help manage their own care. In addition, professionals often delivered fragmented and \"siloed\" health care, not working or communicating with other members of the medical team to provide coordinated care in concert with the individual patient/consumer seeking the care.\n\nWith the growing incidence of chronic illnesses, there is a need to both prevent and manage these ongoing medical challenges in a collaborative manner with health and social professionals involving the patient and the family at every step.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that interprofessional team-based collaborative care delivered throughout the life span within the context of a medical home can: 1) enhance patient outcomes; 2) reduce overall care costs; 3) reduce medical errors; 4) reduce procedural duplication; 5) enhance pharmaceutical compliance; 6) actively involve the patient in his or her own health care and increase overall health care satisfaction. In fact, the team approach has been endorsed by more than 60 professional organizations.\n\nWe, as a health care community, still have a long way to go to achieve the ideal interprofessional environment. We must continue to build mutual respect among all health and social professions. At the same time, we must respect patients and take time to listen to and understand their questions, concerns, and desires.\n\nAs professionals, we must be open to shared leadership in patient care and coordination. This means open communication and trust at all levels. In addition, our payment systems must be better coordinated and the patient/consumer needs to understand the payment system and not fear asking questions.\n\nAt Nova Southeastern University, we place a heavy emphasis on this team approach as we shape our next generation of health care leaders. We include interprofessional education in our curricula, integrate different professions into basic science courses so students gain an understanding and mutual respect for their peers, and even host programs, such as Interprofessional Education Day on our campus to emphasize the importance of working together to benefit our patients.\n\nThis is the future of health care. Don't get left behind in your silos.\n\nDr. Cecilia Rokusek is assistant dean of research and innovation, and project director for NSU's Center for Interprofessional Education and Practice in Nova Southeastern University's College of Osteopathic Medicine.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Interprofessional education and patient involvement essential in health care", "Description": "Six years after the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law (March 23, 2010), America is still adapting to health care reform.
