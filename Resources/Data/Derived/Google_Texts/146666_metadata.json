No one will be able to take that away from you. It hasn\u2019t happened yet. It won\u2019t happen in the future.\u201d\n\nBut as Patti Davis and millions more are finding out, even though they are happy with the insurance company and plan offered by their employers, businesses across the country are no longer offering health coverage.\n\nCould the president please explain why I and others are losing our health ins. plans? Wasn\u2019t supposed to happen! \u2014 patti davis (@patti_davis) October 25, 2013\n\nDavis also seems to be disappointed with the President\u2019s handling of the government shutdown, prompting her to write Obama an open letter on October 13, which reads in part:\n\n\u201cWe all remember your campaign tag of \u201cno drama Obama. Interesting that there has been one drama after another in your presidency, this last one really tipping the scales.\u201d\n\nPatti Davis contrasts Obama\u2019s style of governing with her father\u2019s saying, \u201cit was how he lived, how he conducted himself.\u201d\n\nDavis has always been known for speaking her mind, which led to an estrangement from her parents that lasted many years.\n\nWhile she blames Republicans for the government shutdown, Patti Davis is not happy with how Obama handled the three-week impasse.\n\n\u201cIf 80 percent is the fault of the Republicans, you could have dealt with your 20 percent a little better. Announcing that you won\u2019t negotiate is not showing leadership, it\u2019s showing a pouting face to the country and the world.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting Davis is avidly promoting her book on Twitter while criticizing Obama.\n\nWhat do you think of Patti Davis\u2019 statements?
