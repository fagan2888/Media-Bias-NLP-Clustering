Every time I ran, somebody said I needed to be home with my kids,\u201d Haskin added. \u201cNobody ever talks about men being responsible parents.\u201d\n\nThe Dallas Morning News reported Saturday evening that Davis inaccurately conveyed some details of her biography\u2014among them, describing herself as a teenage single mother when her divorce was not finalized until she was 21. It also reported that her second husband had helped her pay for college and law school, a detail that Davis hasn\u2019t included in the inspiring, up-by-the-bootstraps personal story she has used on the campaign trail.\n\nClose video The right\u2019s obsession with Wendy Davis Alex Wagner talks about the right\u2019s obsession with Wendy Davis\u2019 backstory, calling out Redstate\u2019s Erick Erickson\u2019s Tweets on Davis as \u201creally, really creepy.\u201d embed like save share group\n\nThe report has received national attention and handed the campaign of Greg Abbott, Davis\u2019 likely Republican opponent, a potentially damaging line of attack.\n\nMany of the conservative responses to the story appear to bear Haskin out. As msnbc documented, several right-wing pundits slammed Davis not for being inaccurate, but for prioritizing her career despite having a family.\n\n\u201cWendy Davis apparently abandoned her children, had her husband foot her bills, and divorced after adultery accusations,\u201d tweeted Ben Shapiro, a prominent conservative writer, in one typical example.\n\nThe newspaper report included an anonymous quote from a different former colleague of Davis on the city council, who called Davis \u201ctremendously ambitious,\u201d adding: \u201cShe\u2019s not going to let family or raising children or anything else get in her way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat that comment really tells you is how hard Wendy works,\u201d Haskin told the Star-Telegram.\n\nDavis has acknowledged the factual errors\u2014\u201cmy language should be tighter,\u201d she told the paper. But her campaign also has blamed the Abbott camp for pushing the story.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised by Greg Abbott\u2019s campaign attacks on the personal story of my life as a single mother who worked hard to get ahead.,\u201d the Davis campaign said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cBut they won\u2019t work, because my story is the story of millions of Texas women who know the strength it takes when you\u2019re young, alone and a mother.\u201d\n\nDavis cited the criticism in a fundraising appeal sent Wednesday. She wrote in an email to supporters that her opponents have \u201cstooped to a new low by attacking my family, my education, and my personal story \u2013 playing politics with the journey that has been my life.\u201d\n\nWayne Slater, the DMN reporter who wrote the story, told msnbc he had had no contact with the Abbott campaign for the story.\n\nBut Peggy Fikac of the San Antonio Express-News, suggested Tuesday that Team Abbott has pitched reporters on a version of the story. \u201cAbbott\u2019s campaign has questioned details and pointed out discrepancies in the story she tells of her life,\u201d Fikac wrote.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The controversy over Wendy Davis\u2019 personal history would never have erupted were it not for Davis' gender, according to one Texas Republican.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-23", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "The controversy over Wendy Davis\u2019 personal history would never have erupted were it not for Davis' gender, according to one Texas Republican.", "title": "Texas GOPer: If Wendy Davis were male, 'none of this would ever come up'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-23", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/texas_governor_davis_interview.jpeg-0e512.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-23", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/texas_governor_davis_interview.jpeg-0e512.jpg?itok=ffJcjKGr", "height": 553}, "title": "Texas GOPer: If Wendy Davis were male, 'none of this would ever come up'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The controversy over Wendy Davis\u2019 personal history would never have erupted were it not for Davis' gender, according to one Texas Republican."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-22T13:45:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "zachary-roth", "tags": "culture-war,democrats,equality,texas,war-on-women,wendy-davis,women", "title": "Texas GOPer: If Wendy Davis were male, 'none of this would ever come up'", "published": 1, "date": "01/22/2014 13:45:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-23"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "The controversy over Wendy Davis\u2019 personal history would never have erupted were it not for Davis' gender, according to one Texas Republican.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Equality, Women, Culture War, Texas, War On Women, Wendy Davis"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda10\"", "article_summary": "The controversy over Wendy Davis\u2019 personal history would never have erupted were it not for Davis\u2019 gender, according to one Texas Republican.\n\u201cWendy Davis apparently abandoned her children, had her husband foot her bills, and divorced after adultery accusations,\u201d tweeted Ben Shapiro, a prominent conservative writer, in one typical example.\nClose video The right\u2019s obsession with Wendy Davis Alex Wagner talks about the right\u2019s obsession with Wendy Davis\u2019 backstory, calling out Redstate\u2019s Erick Erickson\u2019s Tweets on Davis as \u201creally, really creepy.\u201d embed like save share groupThe report has received national attention and handed the campaign of Greg Abbott, Davis\u2019 likely Republican opponent, a potentially damaging line of attack.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised by Greg Abbott\u2019s campaign attacks on the personal story of my life as a single mother who worked hard to get ahead.,\u201d the Davis campaign said in a statement Tuesday.\nAs msnbc documented, several right-wing pundits slammed Davis not for being inaccurate, but for prioritizing her career despite having a family."}
