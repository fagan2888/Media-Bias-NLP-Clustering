Stephanie Grace breaks down Edwards' gameplan to win governor's race\n\nHow'd he do it? Stephanie Grace breaks down Edwards' gameplan to win governor's race\n\nThey say it\u2019s better to be lucky than good, but Gov.-elect John Bel Edwards didn\u2019t have to worry about the distinction in the march toward his remarkable victory Saturday.\n\nEdwards, a relatively unknown Democratic legislator from Amite, was both. And he needed to be in order to take down a legendary tactician who\u2019d never before lost a race.\n\nNo question about it, Edwards ran a strong race. He set the terms of the conversation, easily deflecting charges that he\u2019s too liberal to govern reliably Republican Louisiana and shifting the focus to personality, character and the social issues on which he holds more conservative positions.\n\nHe leveraged his rural roots to an impressive 40 percent primary finish against three Republicans, a feat even more striking given low turnout in highly Democratic urban centers. He started with few energetic backers other than trial lawyers and organized labor, particularly the state\u2019s teachers unions, but later won key endorsements from the state sheriffs association and one of his Republican primary rivals, Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne.\n\nBut Edwards also was exceedingly fortunate in drawing U.S. Sen. David Vitter as a runoff opponent, just as Vitter\u2019s famous political acumen dried up.\n\nVitter limped into the runoff with just 23 percent of the primary vote. He spent the rest of the brief second round trying to regain his footing, largely by linking Edwards to President Barack Obama in a relentless cascade of negative ads, including several that capitalized on anti-Syrian refugee sentiment after the Paris attacks. Vitter had used the anti-Obama tactic to great effect in his 2010 re-election bid, but it fizzled this time around.\n\nVitter also committed some unforced errors that highlighted his reputation as someone who\u2019d do anything to win. His primary-season attacks on Dardenne and Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle left such a bad taste that neither backed him in the runoff, and many of their supporters took the hint and looked elsewhere.\n\nThen there was the spying scandal, in which a Vitter-paid private investigator was caught conducting surveillance on an Edwards contributor and longtime Vitter adversary Newell Normand, the Republican sheriff from Vitter\u2019s home of Jefferson Parish. Normand advertised his displeasure far and wide, and even cut an anti-Vitter super PAC commercial.\n\nPerhaps most surprisingly, Edwards was able to keep Vitter\u2019s 2007 prostitution scandal front and center. His shockingly direct \u201cprostitutes over patriots\u201d ad, which highlighted a congressional vote honoring fallen soldiers that Vitter missed on the same day records show he got a call from a Washington, D.C., brothel, drew national attention. And Edwards kept the topic alive during debates. Asked about his low ranking from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, for example, he countered that he gave 100 percent only to his wife.\n\nThen in the race\u2019s final days, Gov. Bobby Jindal ended his ill-fated presidential bid and swooped back in from Iowa. Whether or not it really was payback for 2007, when Vitter and his wife Wendy held their \u201cstand by your man\u201d news conference just as Jindal was announcing for governor, Jindal sure seemed to enjoy messing with his longtime adversary\u2019s desperate last push.\n\nThe upshot of all the focus on Vitter was that the race became a referendum on him. And even in victory, Edwards remains something of a blank slate.\n\nHe\u2019s got clear record of pushing economically populist measures, and his first big move will be to accept the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion. To do much more, Edwards will need help from some of the Republicans who dominate the Legislature, and all eyes will now be on who joins the leadership and which fights Edwards chooses to pick. There\u2019s clearly some nervousness about his intentions from the LABI crowd over tort reform issues and from backers of charters and private school vouchers.\n\nOther than that, though, Edwards seems to be starting off with goodwill.\n\nChalk that up as yet another impressive accomplishment from a soon-to-be governor that Louisiana is still just getting to know.\n\nStephanie Grace can be contacted at sgrace@theadvocate.com.
