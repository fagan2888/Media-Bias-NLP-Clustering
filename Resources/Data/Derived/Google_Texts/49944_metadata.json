Perez\u2019s cautious response to questions about the leaders\u2019 concerns underscored how the complexities of the president\u2019s signature domestic accomplishment and a longstanding goal of labor continue to present political difficulties for Mr. Obama.\n\nIn his speech before A.F.L.-C.I.O. members, Mr. Perez praised labor for helping enact the health law, but acknowledged that \u201cchallenges remain.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview here, he said, \u201cThe administration has been working to address questions and concerns raised by a wide array of stakeholders.\u201d\n\nMr. Trumka declined to offer details about his telephone conversation with Mr. Obama, except to say: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to solve problems.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe and a group of union leaders also met late last month at the White House with Denis McDonough, the chief of staff, and Mr. Perez. Two other sessions have taken place since then with more junior administration officials, union officials said. The sit-down with Mr. Obama himself, Mr. Trumka and the union presidents is set for Friday.\n\nAny erosion of health care benefits poses a singular threat to labor leaders, whose arsenal of tools to attract workers into union membership has dwindled alongside the decline of their organizations and their concomitant loss of influence around the country. Many unions and retirees have lost some benefits since the recession began, especially in the public sector as governments froze pension plans.\n\nSeveral union presidents also expressed intense frustration with an administration that they have repeatedly aided on policy and politics, some citing their lingering disappointment over Mr. Obama\u2019s decision not to campaign aggressively for labor\u2019s signature legislative goal, a bill that would have helped unionize more workers.\n\nConservatives, of course, have bashed the Affordable Care Act since before it was passed in 2010, and aspects of the legislation remain unpopular across the country.\n\nAhead of the opening on Oct. 1 of the health insurance marketplaces created to cover the uninsured by the law, the president is facing rising anger from some of the most loyal members of his party base. Compounding the unions\u2019 anger, the business community \u2014 often labor\u2019s archenemy and a frequent Obama critic on health care \u2014 received an important reprieve this summer when the administration delayed for one year the requirement that employers offer their workers\u2019 health coverage or face a penalty of $2,000 for each uninsured full-time employee.\n\n\u201cOur members are the exact type of people that Obamacare was supposed to take care of,\u201d said D. Taylor, president of Unite Here, a union of hotel and restaurant workers that has about 200,000 members with Taft-Hartley plans, employer-provided coverage named after the 1947 labor law. \u201cWe were the first union to endorse Obama. We were big supporters of health care reform.\u201d\n\nMr. Taylor cast doubt on the president\u2019s assurances that those Americans who liked their health plans could keep them.\n\n\u201cUnder the way the A.C.A. has been rolled out by the Treasury and I.R.S. regulations, it will make it completely impossible to live up to that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is an example of unintended consequences. And it\u2019s completely disheartening that the biggest earlier supporter of the president hasn\u2019t gotten the same listening and benefit of big business with the one-year delay in the $2,000 penalty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLabor\u2019s dismay is not new, but union leaders had been restrained, waiting for their closed-door negotiations with the administration on this issue to bear fruit. That anger burst into the open this summer when the so-called employer mandate was postponed.\n\nSome state labor federations have passed resolutions excoriating the health law. Mr. Trumka, torn between trying not to anger the administration while mollifying some of his unions, may have headed off a full-throated call to repeal the law entirely, but some union presidents say they believe they have no other choice.\n\nUnion leaders note that under the law, workers whose family income is less than four times the poverty line will qualify for subsidies in the form of tax credits to obtain health insurance in the exchanges, with insurance sold by for-profit, nonprofit and cooperative companies. The union leaders say they want similar treatment \u2014 for unionized workers to qualify for those tax credits to help finance their Taft-Hartley insurance plans, which covers about 20 million workers and retirees.\n\n\u201cWe just want to be treated like equals \u2014 we don\u2019t want special treatment,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cAn employer will say, \u2018O.K., your plan costs about $10,000 a year. Let me get this straight. I only pay a $2,000 penalty if I drop you. That\u2019s an $8,000 saving for me.\u2019 That\u2019s actually going to happen all over this country.\u201d\n\nBut others doubt that unions would get such a carve-out because it would also encourage many nonunion workers to seek tax credits to help with their employer-based plans.\n\nRepublicans are already trying to prevent any accommodation of unions on this issue. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, introduced a bill earlier this week that would amend the health law to specifically bar Taft-Hartley plans from receiving any subsidies.\n\nRepublicans say unions are double dipping \u2014 through these new insurance subsidies as well as the tax breaks that union members receive by not having to pay income tax on the value of the health coverage their employers provide.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20130911213248, "twitter": {"description": "Labor leaders meeting in Los Angeles approved a sharply worded resolution that
