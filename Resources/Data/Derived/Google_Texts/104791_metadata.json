But that is not the case, it seems. Several applicants are furious as they are not getting information for the queries they are posing in the country. What is even worse is brazenly irresponsible reply. To many applications, the terse reply is 'Nil'.The officials seem to be finding it quite easy to write 'Nil' and post the responses back. But citizens taking all the pain to take recourse to the Right to Information (RTI) Act to find out the working of the public authorities are a disappointed lot.One such applicant is Kalpesh Lalit Kumar Gupta, an assistant professor of law, from Surat. He had filed an RTI query with the Union ministry of finance. He got more than 1,000 letters but not the information that he required.In Telangana, an RTI applicant wrote letters to all the 10 district collectors on what measures they had taken to create public awareness about RTI. He also sought to know how much money was spent in spreading awareness.\"I have got replies from seven collectors a week ago and the information I got is shocking. The reply simply mentions 'Nil'. I will await the response from other collectors also and take recourse to law. If necessary, I will file police complaints against them,\" said Gadda Thirupathi.An RTI activist, Rakesh Reddy Dubbudu of Hyderabad also has not got information that he has been seeking under the Act. He wanted to know if any central government employee had been asked to compulsorily retire in the last 15 years as per CCS and other rules. \"So far I have got 500 letters as replies from various departments. The information furnished is 'Nil' in the reports. Only in one reply I got information that one person had retired,\" Rakesh Reddy told STOI. Every day as many as 20-30 letters come with invariably the same reply.Another applicant, Pramod Rao Errabelli, had approached the ministry of home affairs asking if any complaints had been lodged in Delhi and NCR region against Amway, and multi-level marketing scams. The response he got from every police station in Delhi and NCR region was: \"The requisite information may be treated as NIL\".\"It clearly shows that they are not interested in parting with any information. I will now be writing to the DGPs of every state for information on complaints against multi-level marketing companies,\" Pramod Rao said.Apart from getting 'Nil' information which is frustrating, RTI applicants are annoyed that a lot of public money is wasted by government departments in sending their replies through speed post. \"Why should one get hundreds of letters? The information can be collated by the head office of the department internally. The applicant can be sent one reply with the collated information,\" Dubbudu said.He said close to Rs 10,000 would have been spent by the government departments on sending replies to him. Kalpesh Lalit Kumar Gupta described as 'waste' the amount of Rs 50,000 that was used for postage to send him 1000 letters from various offices under the ministry of finance for an RTI query he had sent.The applicants said even the postmen are getting angry at the number of letters that are having to deliver to the RTI applicants. Sanjeev Kumar, who filed an RTI application with the agriculture ministry on subsidy for seeds, said he gets 50-70 registered posts everyday and the postman is not really pleased.", "article_metadata": {"Last-Modified-Time": "04.36AM IST", "description": "The Right to Information Act (RTI) has been enacted with a lofty goal of ensuring transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority and is considered a powerful instrument in the hands of citizens to expose corruption.
