Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has been a major booster of the Nevada monument designation and has said he wants to protect \u201cCity,\u201d a massive earthen art installation, which the artist Michael Heizer has worked to create over nearly half a century. The sparsely populated and undeveloped area also serves as a migration corridor for large mammals such as mule deer and pronghorn.\n\nThe Basin and Range monument alone, at more than 1,000 square miles, is nearly the size of Rhode Island \u2013 much to the chagrin of its opponents who cite the president\u2019s latest designations as more evidence of executive overreach.\n\nPresidential monument designations have been a highly controversial executive function for decades. Theodore Roosevelt was the first to use the Antiquities Act of 1906 to designate Devils Tower, Wyoming, as a national monument, and later to protect Native American ruins and artifacts. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran into strong resistance from lawmakers and states\u2019 rights activists when he circumvented Congress to proclaim the Jackson Hole National Monument in Wyoming in 1943.\n\nRelated: Despite Evidence, Global Warming Ranks Low on Americans\u2019 Worry List\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter made substantial use of the proclamation authority. In 1978, Carter proclaimed 15 new national monuments in Alaska after Congress adjourned without passing any major legislation to protect Alaskan lands. Carter caused such a furor that it wasn\u2019t until 1996 that another Democratic president \u2013 Bill Clinton \u2013 invoked the Antiquities Act to proclaim the majestic Grand Staircase-Escalate in southern Utah as a national monument.\n\nWhile environmentalists and conservationists hailed Clinton\u2019s action, western ranchers and local officials strongly opposed the move, arguing that it would further impede cattle grazing in the rugged, remote area and hurt local businesses.\n\nAngry lawmakers from the area introduced a handful of bills to curtail future use of the Antiquities Act, although none of those bills ever advanced. Clinton\u2019s successor, Republican President George W. Bush, designated at least 200 million acres of marine reserve near Hawaii at the end of his administration.\n\nSince taking office in 2009, Obama has made federal lands protection a hallmark of his environmental agenda, along with efforts to combat industrial carbon emissions and climate change.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Budget Boosts EPA to Fight Climate Change\n\nJust last Wednesday, the House voted to adopt an amendment introduced by Rep. Cresent Hardy (R-NV) that would block the use of federal money to carry out the presidential designation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act in 17 counties in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon and Utah.\n\n\u201cThis [his amendment] is about empowering local communities and local stakeholders most affected by monument designations, and will increase transparency, allow for local input, and provide for improved management of our public lands,\u201d Hardy said.\n\nHardy\u2019s rider was attached to the fiscal 2016 Interior Department appropriations bill, which House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) decided to pull back Thursday following an angry floor debate over another amendment restricting the display of the Confederate flag.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a move that will further burnish his conservationist credentials while angering man", "title": "Obama\u2019s New Record: 260 Million U.S. Acres Are National Monuments", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/12/Obama-s-New-Record-260-Million-US-Acres-Are-National-Monuments", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07122015_Berryessa-Snow-Mountain.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/12/Obama-s-New-Record-260-Million-US-Acres-Are-National-Monuments", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07122015_Berryessa-Snow-Mountain.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In a move that will further burnish his conservationist credentials while angering man", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The new monument lands include:Berryessa Snow Mountain in California, a landscape containing rare biodiversity and an abundance of recreational opportunities.\nThe action makes Obama the president that has protected more public lands and waters than any other president, according to a White House statement \u2013 more than 260 million acres or 19 national monuments.\nPresidential monument designations have been a highly controversial executive function for decades.\nIn 1978, Carter proclaimed 15 new national monuments in Alaska after Congress adjourned without passing any major legislation to protect Alaskan lands.\n\u201cBy creating these three new national monuments, President Obama is continuing his commitment to preserving America\u2019s treasured places and cementing his well-deserved place in conservation history,\u201d said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters."}
