He was seven years older than I was, and his name was\u2014of course I\u2019m not really going to tell you his name, but let\u2019s call him Eli.\n\nEli was tall, a bit imperious, and foreign. His whole demeanor seemed to me at the time to contain both a quality of mystery and a kind of irresistible magnetism that made it impossible for me to think clearly. Twice that weekend, as we talked and flirted, I felt enraptured almost to the point of vomiting. We did nothing more than kiss, but when he invited me to spend two months with him in Israel the following summer, I didn\u2019t hesitate. I flew across the ocean, and for two months we hiked, swam, played backgammon, ate falafel, did other things. There was little soul-baring or opening of hearts. But that was okay with me. Genuine emotional intimacy couldn\u2019t compare with the love that grew out of my daydreams. My memories of those months are a softly lit montage of romance and adventure.\n\nAfter I returned home, I closed my eyes every night and imagined how it would be if we ever were reunited. I imagined our reunion, our lovemaking, our bodies entwined on some exotic, sun-drenched beach. I imagined our week-long hike through a rainforest (rainforest in Israel?), our desert wedding, our beautiful, bilingual children.\n\nThis fantasy played in my head on an endless loop, probably two or three times a day for about four years, despite the fact that our actual communication during this time involved the occasional, casual phone call and emails where we\u2019d talk about favorite episodes of Seinfeld. We never talked about anything you\u2019d call substantive. Nothing about our families. Nothing about our friends or our hopes or our lives: all the things I imagined we\u2019d eventually interlace. Despite the overwhelming exteriority of our interactions (save, I guess you\u2019d have to say, for sex), I was convinced that he was truly and profoundly the man of my dreams, that if it weren\u2019t for the infuriating fact that we lived on separate continents, we would surely live happily ever after.\n\nThen, five years after we\u2019d first met, I received an email from him with the news that he was moving to Palo Alto for graduate school. Suddenly we were practically going to be neighbors.\n\nA few weeks later, I drove to his new apartment in a trance of happiness. Finally, finally, we\u2019d be together. I sat down at the caf\u00e9 where we\u2019d arranged to meet, was sitting there nervously when he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes. I smiled. We kissed. He sat down at the table across from me and we began to talk. He was very sweet, very handsome, very nice. Nice, nice guy. Great guy. Just swell. Not a bad word from me you\u2019ll get about him.\n\nWithin 15 minutes, it was abundantly, painfully clear that we hadn\u2019t a thing in common. I was trying to be a writer. He was an engineer. I liked to talk about and share every thought that passed through my mind in thorough, at times excruciating, detail; he seemed happy to sit in silence. We made small talk the rest of the evening like two people standing beside each other in an elevator, spent the night together (why not?), but never really spoke again.\n\nAs I drove back to San Francisco, it did occur to me that, though I\u2019d dated other men, I\u2019d essentially wasted five years of my life fantasizing about a version of someone who didn\u2019t exist outside my head. But amazingly, I was able to bury this realization beneath my embarrassment and eagerness to get on with the next phase of my life.\n\nOver a decade would pass before it would finally sink in, when recalling this youthful romance, that perhaps it was an example of how my fantasy world, dream life, whatever you want to call it, which, as a writer and a creative person, I\u2019d always thought of as something unique and beautiful, a kind of fingerprint of my soul, could actually be a force of stasis and self-sabotage \u2014 a limitation or flaw in my character, rather than a gift.\n\n* * *\n\nThe word \u201cfantasy\u201d itself sounds steamy and exciting. When we think of \u201cfantasy,\u201d we think of sex, love, our secret dreams and desires. But fantasies don\u2019t, in fact, have to be erotic. They can arise just as easily from a place of fear or anxiety or boredom as from arousal. Every time I sit in a flight and imagine for a microsecond a scenario by which the plane might explode or break in half or otherwise cease being in the sky, that\u2019s a fantasy. Every time we watch a little story play out inside our head, we\u2019re fantasizing, whether we realize it or not, and it seems to me that, though succumbing to fantasies about other people can be dangerous or self-defeating, the act of fantasizing itself is also an essential part of being human, of being capable of both abstraction and empathy. When I read a story about Syrian refugees and imagine for a moment what it would be like to have to ride across the sea at night in a dingy with my hungry, terrified children, I am fantasizing, and I do think that without the ability to make this imaginative leap, to pretend that we know people more than we do and imagine ourselves in their place, we\u2019d all be worse off.\n\nThe problem arises when we allow our idea of a person, what we want or need them to be, to stand in for what they are. In On Balance, the psychoanalyst and literary critic Adam Phillips notes how Anna Freud famously said, \u201cIn our dreams we can have our eggs cooked exactly how we want them, but we can\u2019t eat them.\u201d He elaborates: \u201cSo satisfying are our fantasies that they can become a refuge, a retreat from reality; if real sexual relations are too difficult \u2014 too frustrating, too pleasurable \u2014 in our fantasies we can have our relationships cooked exactly as we want them.\u201d This tendency, this reliance on dream-life to make my reality more palatable, has been a part of my makeup for so long that I have no memories of life without it. Eli stands out in my mind because of the duration of the fantasy. But the truth is that, on a smaller scale, this basic story has played out more times than I can count \u2014 with the men I dated when I was single, and more recently, with friends, acquaintances, family members, colleagues.\n\nGenerally, it goes something like this: I meet a new person, a new friend, another writer, a cool mom. This person enters my life and I say to myself, oh, yes, this is an excellent person, super-smart, super-cool, funny or charming or some amalgamation of the human qualities I most admire. This is my kind of person, I say to myself or to anyone who will listen, usually my husband. I adore this person. I idealize this person, this new friend, new acquaintance, whoever. But then, gradually, something happens. Or often, nothing happens, and that\u2019s the problem. The excitement wanes. The idealization fades. Life strips the relationship of the sheen that made it so initially irresistible, and what I\u2019m left with is an actual person, with actual problems of their own, with constraints on their time and irritating habits, an actual, unedited other person, and of course, myself. What fun is that?\n\nThis past winter, I wrote about my odd, intense friendship with a person who, upon meeting, I instantly believed was the coolest, most uninhibited, sophisticated, badass woman I\u2019d ever known. In my mind, she came to represent youth, freedom, literary hipness, the excitement of single life in the city, all the things that I, as a married mother, felt my life was missing. For months, the brightness of the fantasy I created around how exciting and brilliant she was made everything else in my life seem dim by comparison. But as our friendship evolved, I began to see how much of this excitement I\u2019d projected onto her, how much of it arose precisely from the fact that she wasn\u2019t actually in my life the way my other friends and family were.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Is it possible to fall in love with someone you don't really know?\" I asked; he said that it was much, much easier", "title": "I fall for strangers: I thought my fantasies made me writerly and special \u2014 it took decades to see how they were ruining my life", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Is it possible to fall in love with someone you don't really know?\" I asked; he said that it was much, much easier", "title": "I fall for strangers: I thought my fantasies made me writerly and special \u2014 it took decades to see how they were ruining my life", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/03/i_fall_for_strangers_i_thought_my_fantasies_made_me_writerly_and_special_it_took_decades_to_see_how_they_were_ruining_my_life/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/life_essay_hands.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Is it possible to fall in love with someone you don't really know?\" I asked; he said that it was much, much easier", "title": "I fall for strangers: I thought my fantasies made me writerly and special \u2014 it took decades to see how they were ruining my life", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/life_essay_hands.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kim Brooks", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Pick, Fiction, Life stories, Love and Sex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6e8\"", "article_summary": "When we think of \u201cfantasy,\u201d we think of sex, love, our secret dreams and desires.\nI flew across the ocean, and for two months we hiked, swam, played backgammon, ate falafel, did other things.\nAfter I returned home, I closed my eyes every night and imagined how it would be if we ever were reunited.\nFor months, the brightness of the fantasy I created around how exciting and brilliant she was made everything else in my life seem dim by comparison.\nNothing about our friends or our hopes or our lives: all the things I imagined we\u2019d eventually interlace."}
