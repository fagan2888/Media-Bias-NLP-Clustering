House Speaker Tim Moore has a new job, after he was hired this week to serve as the attorney for Cleveland County, where he lives.\n\nOne of his tasks in the county position will be to \u201c[a]dvise the Board and Manager on proposed legislation,\u201d according to a copy of Moore\u2019s contract, which was obtained by N.C. Policy Watch.\n\nThat could raise questions about whether the new job poses a conflict of interest for Moore, a Kings Mountain Republican. As head of the state House of Representatives, Moore has considerable influence and insider knowledge about state budget negotiations as well as other pieces of state legislation that affect counties around the state.\n\nMoore\u2019s legislative staff said that his county-based job will be limited to offering advice on proposed legislation in the county, and not any state legislation.\n\nThe House Speaker job tends to be a time-consuming one, though all members of the legislature are considered part-time lawmakers with many still running businesses or going to jobs in their home districts. Moore makes $38,151 a year as House Speaker.\n\nThe Shelby Star noted that when Moore was hired Tuesday at a county commission meeting, he made reference to his position in the state legislature.\n\n\u201cMoore joked about having another job that gave him \u2018some insight\u2019 about what is going on in the state and communities but still had a law practice to keep up,\u201d the Shelby Star wrote in an article about Moore\u2019s hiring.\n\nState ethics law prevents those in public positions, like lawmakers, from using their public position to bring \u201cfinancial benefit to the covered person or legislative employee, a member of the covered person\u2019s or legislative employee\u2019s extended family, or business with which the covered person or legislative employee is associated.\u201d\n\nClayton Somers, Moore\u2019s chief of staff, said Friday afternoon that Moore sought an informal ethics opinion before taking the job, and that the legislation referred to in the contract was only county-based proposals, not state legislation.\n\n\u201cHe is not going to advise the county on any state legislation,\u201d Somers said.\n\nMoore will receive a $25,000 annual retainer, and will bill the county $250 an hour for whatever work he does serving as the legal adviser to the county commission, according to a copy of his contract obtained from Cleveland County by N.C. Policy Watch.\n\nThe job will require Moore to attend commission meetings, consult with the county commission and county manager as needed and prepare legal documents and contracts, in addition to offering advice about pending legislation.\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d said Jane Pinsky, the head of the N.C. Coalition for Lobbying and Government Reform, about Moore\u2019s new contract employee job with the county.\n\nEven if the arrangement is legal and Moore operates in an ethical manner, it can still leave the public with the impression that those in political power are able to easily secure jobs because of their public roles, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one more thing that people think if you\u2019re one of the good old boys, there\u2019s a benefit to that,\u201d Pinsky said.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a8d\"", "article_summary": "N.C.
