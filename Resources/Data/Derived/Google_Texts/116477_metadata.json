Topics ranged from the president's quip that he would love to see the world ruled entirely by women for two days to the role she played in expediting Jamaica's current deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nClarke revealed that on exiting the plane, she felt \"a sense of pride swell up inside [her] chest. It was enormous and a unique feeling\".\n\nThe congresswoman said she was not just coming home on a regular visit but representing her people.\n\nSIGNIFICANT TRIP\n\n\"This trip is very significant for the Caribbean region and certainly for the constituency that I represent. This opens up new lens through which the United States views the region, particularly the English-speaking Caribbean and small-island states,\" Clarke said.\n\nShe continued: \"We have often heard that the Caribbean islands feel neglected and overlooked by the United States government, but this signals a new day and - certainly on my end and in Congress - this helps in our ability to focus policy towards the region by having had the visit of a sitting president.\"\n\nThe daughter of retired Jamaica-born New York council woman Dr Una Clarke disclosed that during the flight from Washington D.C., she and President Obama discussed regional issues.\n\n\"We spoke about the region and the work that Jamaica has done to meet the benchmarks of the IMF agreement; and how pleased he was in this respect. He again expressed his pleasure with seeing Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller's work in navigating what has been very austere Budget measures. He's excited about recalibrating the relationship between the United States and the Caribbean region and Jamaica, in particular,\" Clarke said.\n\nThis is also a working trip for Clarke, who said she would be leveraging the president's visit.\n\n\"It holds a lot of sway with the body that I'm a member of,\" Clarke explained.\n\nShe noted that the trip would elevate the profile of the type of work that she had been doing in seeking partnerships with the region around homeland security and looking at ways in which they could get the US private sector to partner with the local private sector to create opportunities for employment.\n\nBorn to Jamaican parents, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke has always held the island close to her heart. On Wednesday, when United States President Barack Obama stepped out of Air Force One, she was right behind him beaming with pride, ready to introduce him to her 'homeland'.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For United States Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, the opportunity to travel to Jamaica with United States President Barack Obama aboard Air Force One was the result of a lot of...", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"image": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2015/04/09/YvetteClarkeK20150409RM.jpg?itok=o6qZyche", "description": "For United States Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, the opportunity to travel to Jamaica with United States President Barack Obama aboard Air Force One was the result of a lot of...", "title": "'A sense of pride swell up inside my chest' Congresswoman Clarke"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/media/article_images/2015/04/09/YvetteClarkeA20150409RM.jpg", "image0": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/media/article_images/2015/04/09/YvetteClarkeA20150409RM.jpg", "description": "For United States Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, the opportunity to travel to Jamaica with United States President Barack Obama aboard Air Force One was the result of a lot of...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'A sense of pride swell up inside my chest' Congresswoman Clarke"}, "keywords": "Congresswoman, Clarke, Obama", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=3, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe58f7\"", "article_summary": "Clarke revealed that on exiting the plane, she felt \"a sense of pride swell up inside [her] chest.\nHe's excited about recalibrating the relationship between the United States and the Caribbean region and Jamaica, in particular,\" Clarke said.\nThis opens up new lens through which the United States views the region, particularly the English-speaking Caribbean and small-island states,\" Clarke said.\nOn Wednesday, when United States President Barack Obama stepped out of Air Force One, she was right behind him beaming with pride, ready to introduce him to her 'homeland'.\nFor United States Congress-woman Yvette Clarke, the opportunity to travel to Jamaica with United States President Barack Obama aboard Air Force One was the result of a lot of perseverance and leveraging all her contacts."}
