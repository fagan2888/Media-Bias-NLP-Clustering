A small percentage constituted sex-based crimes, and more than half were financial in nature.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Human Services also has reported a 19 percent increase in calls to the Boulder County adult protection hotline from July to November when compared with the same time frame in 2013.\n\nLongmont Police Detective Chris Merkle said that before the law passed, Colorado was among the last three states to not have a mandatory reporting law for at-risk seniors.\n\nHe said these types of cases can be tough to investigate because many elders are likely to know the person committing the crime and may fear having no one to care for them if they report the incident.\n\n\"It can be something where somebody is financially exploiting an at-risk elder,\" he said. \"Seventy to 90 percent of people that are perpetrating these acts against at-risk elders are somebody that the at-risk victim knows.\"\n\nWalsh said many of the reports won't lead to prosecution but added the increase in reports will be useful for determining patterns of crimes, such as various scams targeting seniors, so officials can respond appropriately.\n\nShe said another law that passed in April created a new felony that allows the state a new avenue to prosecute people who financially exploit vulnerable seniors. Her office is already prosecuting several people under the new law and the first grand jury indictment came a few weeks after it passed.\n\nShe said the DAs office has always aggressively prosecuted such cases but charged people with theft before, which was sometimes hard to prove to a jury because senior victims had often voluntarily handed over money or assets.\n\nMerkle said that once law enforcement receives such a report and deems that there could be such a crime, it will submit its report to adult protection services and the district attorney's office and begin its own investigation. He added that officers at LPD, particularly the patrol day shift, have noticed a \"marked increase\" in the number of reports coming in, although he did not have exact numbers.\n\n\"If we're getting more reports, there's obviously more investigations that needed to be done,\" he said. \"Yeah it does tie up patrol and stuff like that, but in the end it's worth it. I'd rather have that, than miss out on something that we need to know about.\"\n\nJohn Bear: 303-684-5212, bearj@timescall.com or twitter.com/johnbearwithme", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27179123/elder-abuse-reports-jump-boulder-county", "modificationDate": "2014-12-22T06:34:05-0700", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By John Bear \n  Times-Call staff writer", "description": "The Boulder County District Attorney's office is expecting the number of  elder abuse and exploitation reports it receives to jump at least 100 percent by the end of the year when compared to a similar time frame in 2012.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27179123:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-21T13:00:00-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27179123/elder-abuse-reports-jump-boulder-county", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Boulder County District Attorney's office is expecting the number of  elder abuse and exploitation reports it receives to jump at least 100 percent by the end of the year when compared to a similar time frame in 2012.", "title": "Elder abuse reports jump in Boulder County"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "The Boulder County District Attorney's office is expecting the number of  elder abuse and exploitation reports it receives to jump at least 100 percent by the end of the year when compared to a similar time frame in 2012.", "title": "Elder abuse reports jump in Boulder County", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27179123/elder-abuse-reports-jump-boulder-county", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-21T13:00:00-0700", "endDate": "2024-12-20T17:34:21-0700", "sailthru.title": "Elder abuse reports jump in Boulder County", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By John BearTimes-Call", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-12-20T17:38:30-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4b6\"", "article_summary": "In Weld County, call 970-346-7676 or visit http://tinyurl.com/weldadultservicesThe Boulder County District Attorney's office is expecting the number of elder abuse and exploitation reports it receives to jump at least 100 percent by the end of the year when compared to a similar time frame in 2012.\nLongmont Police Detective Chris Merkle said that before the law passed, Colorado was among the last three states to not have a mandatory reporting law for at-risk seniors.\nWalsh said the 2012 numbers showed about 22 percent of the reported crimes involved abuse and 22 percent involved neglect.\n\"If we're getting more reports, there's obviously more investigations that needed to be done,\" he said.\n\"It can be something where somebody is financially exploiting an at-risk elder,\" he said."}
