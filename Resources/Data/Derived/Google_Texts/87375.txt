A 5-year-old white tiger named Karma has found a home at a Wylie-based big cats rescue center.



In-Sync Exotics Wildlife Rescue and Educational Center welcomed the female tiger this week, after receiving a phone call from a breeder who wanted to give her up because he wasn’t getting the results he had hoped for. Karma will be the first female white tiger to call In-Sync Exotics home.

Karma’s white coat is due to a recessive gene that is passed down from a mother and father who both carry the gene. White tigers are often the result of inbreeding, which rarely happens naturally in the wild, and many do not survive, according to the cat sanctuary.

In-Sync Exotics is a rescue center for abused, neglected and unwanted exotic cats, including tigers, lions, cougars and leopards. Last summer, seven large cats died there after an outbreak of a dog disease — canine distemper — spread through the center.
