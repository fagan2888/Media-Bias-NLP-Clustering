These findings have led many to theorize that a few extra hours of rest may help lower a person\u2019s risk of developing the disease. The new study, which was presented at the AACR-Prostate Cancer Foundation Conference on Advances in Prostate Cancer Research, shows that the link may be even stronger than previously thought.\n\n\u201cOur findings are in line with previous experimental studies and provide further support for the influence of the circadian rhythm in prostate carcinogenesis,\u201d Sarah Markt, doctoral candidate at the Harvard School of Public Health and lead author of the study, told Medical Daily.\n\nMelatonin and Prostate Cancer\n\nFor the study, Markt and her colleagues surveyed 928 Icelandic men involved in the AGES-Reykjavik cohort. The researchers were looking for urinary levels of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, the main breakdown product of melatonin. Each participant was followed from 2002 to 2009.\n\nAt the end of the study, 111 men had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Twenty-four had progressed to an advanced stage of the disease. By comparing the incidence of cancer to the 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels, the team found that participants with levels above the median value (17.14 nanograms/milliliter of urine) had a significantly lower risk of developing the disease.\n\n\"Sleep loss and other factors can influence the amount of melatonin secretion or block it altogether, and health problems associated with low melatonin, disrupted sleep, and/or disruption of the circadian rhythm are broad, including a potential risk factor for cancer,\" Markt said in a press release. \"We found that men who had higher levels of melatonin had a 75 percent reduced risk for developing advanced prostate cancer compared with men who had lower levels of melatonin.\u201d\n\nSleeping It Off\n\nAccording to official U.S. estimates, prostate cancer kills about 30,000 Americans annually, with nearly 200,000 new cases each year. Besides skin cancer, it is the most common cancer in American males. Although few sufferers report early symptoms, signs of nascent prostate cancer include difficulties urinating and back pain.\n\nBy illuminating a possible preventative strategy against prostate cancer, the study adds yet another clear benefit of proper rest and sufficient sleep. Another example is a Northwestern University study from 2013, in which researchers show that a good night\u2019s sleep may help you unravel phobias and fear memories.\n\nAlthough the statistical link is strong, Markt is quick to point out that the findings need to be reproduced in a larger sample size before any public health recommendations can be made. \"Further prospective studies to investigate the interplay between sleep duration, sleep disturbance, and melatonin levels on risk for prostate cancer are needed,\" she explained in the release.\n\nThat said, you can\u2019t really go wrong with a few extra hours of sleep, right?\n\nSource: Markt S, Sigurdardottir LG, Rider JR, Haneuese S.
