During their fight, King Arthur chops off the Black Knight\u2019s arms.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got no arms left!\u201d Arthur declares.\n\n\u201cJust a flesh wound,\u201d the Black Knight retorts, kicking wildly at Arthur. \u201cI\u2019m invincible!\u201d he finally screams, relentlessly ignoring his pitiful vulnerability.\n\nIt is a shame that Monty Python isn\u2019t around to adapt the press release entitled: \u201cGovernor Steve Beshear\u2019s Legacy: A Kentucky Stronger At Its Core\u201d into its next screenplay. Truly, the main character\u2019s haughty proclamations would make the Black Knight look like a sober realist.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Kentucky\u2019s massive pension problems, which worsened significantly under Beshear. The word \u201cpension\u201d appears in Beshear\u2019s legacy release under the heading \u201cBudget Turnaround,\u201d which is like describing an airplane crash in a paragraph entitled \u201cSuccessfully Brought Metal Tube Back to Earth.\u201d\n\nGov.-elect Matt Bevin has sounded the alarm appropriately on the state\u2019s pension system, ranked among the nation\u2019s worst-funded, according to a Bloomberg report. In 2008, Beshear\u2019s first year as governor, the pension system was 52 percent funded; today it sits at 19 percent. If you are but moderately proficient at math you know this is not a \u201cbudget turnaround\u201d as Beshear claims.\n\nBeshear\u2019s pension handoff to Bevin is the worst financial problem any governor of Kentucky has ever left a successor. Ignoring Republican calls for drastic pension reform put the state at risk for bankruptcy, destroyed its credit rating, and leaves virtually no discretionary funding for education and social services. That is Beshear\u2019s true legacy.\n\nBevin\u2019s plan to implement a 401k-style system for new state workers is similar to what you find in the private sector and will create the fiscal discipline necessary to close the tens of billions in unfunded liabilities. Beshear should have embraced this common-sense solution when the Kentucky Senate\u2014in an effort led by David Williams and Damon Thayer\u2014passed it with bipartisan support in 2011.\n\nLike most good Republican ideas in Frankfort, Beshear and Democratic House Speaker Greg Stumbo killed it, burying their heads for the sake of political expediency. Bevin is smart to propose changes beyond what the legislature passed in 2013, and he is right when he says the problem will take \u201ca generation at least\u201d to fix. Beshear campaigned on implementing good ideas no matter their party of origin; fulfilling that promise would have saved the state billions, along with its credit rating.\n\nAnother ticking time bomb left in Bevin\u2019s desk by Beshear, has to do with the 51,000 Kentuckians who obtained insurance through the now-defunct Kentucky Health Cooperative, the government-subsidized insurance carrier created under Obamacare. These people are among the sickest\u2014and most expensive\u2014insurance customers in the state.\n\nThe remaining private insurance companies left in the exchange will take on these expensive customers, forcing them to ask for further rate increases next year. Beshear will be safely retired to his horse farm when that happens, leaving Bevin to muck the health care stalls he left behind. The few remaining Frankfort Democrats will cynically and falsely claim that Bevin\u2019s policies are driving up insurance rates.\n\nThe truth is that Beshear \u2014 who never faced the voters after unilaterally implementing Obamacare through executive order \u2014 is the real culprit. Obamacare and its supporters are responsible for massive rate hikes already, and it is about to get worse.\n\nBeshear rides out of office as more of his punch bowl unpleasantries come to light. WDRB-TV reports that Beshear\u2019s claim of 12,000 new jobs because of expanded Medicaid \u201chasn\u2019t materialized.\u201d The report says that \u201c3,000 jobs were supposed to be added at hospitals alone in 2014\u2026But instead, hospital employment in Kentucky declined by 2,660 jobs.\u201d\n\nBeshear says he\u2019s leaving the state with a $242 million surplus; one Frankfort insider laughed at that and said: \u201cThey\u2019ve put off paying every bill they can. That surplus is spent and then some. This next budget is going to be brutal.\u201d Another tells me to prepare for a shortfall between $500 million and $800 million.\n\nFinally, there are rumors Beshear plans to sign an onslaught of state contracts for major Democratic donors in his final days. The word is that Bevin\u2019s team asked for information on these contracts and was told, in short, to pound sand. Transparency and good governance, thy name is not Beshear.\n\nIt is fitting that Beshear, forever linked to Obama, is exiting this way. Obama, like Beshear, will also be remembered for telling us things that just aren\u2019t true. ISIS is not a \u201cJV team,\u201d nor is it \u201ccontained.\u201d Americans, as it turns out, were not allowed to keep their health care plans if they liked them. These guys have produced enough bologna to put Oscar Mayer to shame.\n\nKentuckians have been fed a tremendous amount of bunk over the past eight years about our supposed solid state of affairs. A new Republican governor is left to tell us the truth \u2013 that state government is afflicted with far more than simple flesh wounds. Kentucky\u2019s arms are, in fact, off.\n\nScott Jennings is a former adviser to President George W. Bush and U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell.
