They\u2019re going to be slippery tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSunday night lows will hover just above zero, Meier said.\n\nMonday should see highs in the 20s for the Denver area, Meier said, but no snow is expected.\n\n\u201cThe heavy snow will shift to the southwest part of the state,\u201d he said.\n\nAreas with significant snow totals like 18 inches in Westminster and 12.7 inches in Boulder could expect to add a few more inches of light snow throughout Sunday evening.\n\nDenver\u2019s heavy snowplows were scheduled to remain on duty overnight on the main streets in preparation for the Monday morning commute, according to a news release by Denver Public Works.\n\nThe city allowed residential snowplow drivers made up of Denver Public Works and Denver Parks and Recreation employees to go home for the evening.\n\nThe slick roads caused at least two fatal crashes in the state Saturday, one in Greeley and one in Longmont.\n\nColorado State Patrol Trooper Josh Lewis said fender benders were plentiful Sunday morning and were expected to remain an issue into Monday morning\u2019s rush hour.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing plenty of slide-offs, plenty of low-level property damage crashes,\u201d said Lewis.\n\nBoth the Colorado Senate and House canceled Monday\u2019s sessions due to inclement weather and icy roads.\n\nAs of 4 p.m. Sunday, 170 flights were canceled at DIA \u2014 about 11 percent of scheduled flights, airport officials said.\n\nPrior to the storm, the airport saw 29.9 inches of snow.\n\nOfficials expect this storm to help surpass the 38.4-inch snow total from the 2013-14 year.\n\n\u201cSnow-removal crews have been working since Friday night and continue to clean runways and other surfaces as needed,\u201d according to a DIA news release. \u201cThe snow has been fairly light most of the day and has not had a significant impact on flight operations overall.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration is not showing significant delays in Denver, the release said.\n\nEven as the heavy snow departs, Colorado will find itself in the icy grip of arctic weather for the next few days.\n\nTemperatures are not expected to rise above freezing until Tuesday.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Treacherous Monday commute expected as snow stops, temps drop", "title": "Treacherous Monday commute expected as snow stops, temps drop", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/22/treacherous-monday-commute-expected-as-snow-stops-temps-drop/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20150221_025627_IMG_1582.jpg", "height": 459}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20150221_025627_IMG_1582.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-22T08:40:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-18T18:49:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c82\"", "article_summary": "Monday should see highs in the 20s for the Denver area, Meier said, but no snow is expected.\nAs of 4 p.m. Sunday, Denver International Airport received about 1.5 inches of snow Sunday, totaling 7.5 inches from Friday through Sunday afternoon.\nAreas with significant snow totals like 18 inches in Westminster and 12.7 inches in Boulder could expect to add a few more inches of light snow throughout Sunday evening.\nBernie Meier, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder, said Denverites should expect light snow to taper off overnight Sunday.\nDIA officials expected an additional 2 to 4 inches to fall through 4 a.m. Monday, according to an airport news release."}
