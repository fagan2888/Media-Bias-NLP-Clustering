Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., said in a statement Tuesday that a federal audit he had requested of the Maryland exchange last winter has moved "into a full-blown investigation" by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.



"I called for the audit of the Maryland exchange because tens of millions of taxpayer dollars were wasted, and those who wasted them should be held accountable," said Harris, an Obamacare opponent and a medical doctor.



"Now we know that fraud may have occurred and subpoenas have been issued. Lt. Gov. [Anthony] Brown was in charge of the exchange, and it appears fraud may have gone on under his watch," Harris said.

Tom McGraw, president and CEO of Noridian Healthcare Solutions, said in a statement said: "On July 30, Noridian Healthcare Solutions received a document request from the inspector general. The company is cooperating fully as that office continues its ongoing review of the MHBE."

It is not clear who else received subpoenas. A spokeswoman for a subcontractor that Noridian used, EngagePoint, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Donald White, a spokesman for the HHS inspector general's office, declined to comment.
