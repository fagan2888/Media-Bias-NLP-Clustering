However, a breakfast loaded with sugar, fat, and unhealthy calories does just the opposite and increases a person\u2019s risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. The Environmental Working Group (EWG) issued a report on Thursday revealing that breakfast cereal marketed for children contains an average of 40 percent more sugar than adult cereal.\n\nBack in 2011, EWG researchers analyzed the nutritional facts behind 84 children\u2019s cereal to see which brands matched up with the World Health Organization's recommendation of no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugar. On average, the research team found, children\u2019s cereal was made up of 29 percent sugar. The biggest offender, Kellogg\u2019s Honey Smacks, contained 15 grams of sugar per serving.\n\nThe recent report from the EWG analyzed 181 children\u2019s cereals, including the 84 that were featured in the original report. In 2014, the average children\u2019s cereal is still made up of 20 percent sugar even though some companies have reformulated their recipe to include less sugar. Ten of the cereals that were able to lower their sugar content only did so by one gram.\n\n\u201cWhen you exclude obviously sugar-heavy foods like candy, cookies, ice cream, soft and fruit drinks, breakfast cereals are the single greatest source of added sugars in the diets of children under the age of eight,\u201d nutritionist and EWG consultant Dawn Undurraga, co-author of the organization\u2019s new report, Children\u2019s Cereals: Sugar by the Pound, said in a statement. \u201cCereals that pack in as much sugar as junk food should not be considered part of a healthy breakfast or diet. Kids already eat two to three times the amount of sugar experts recommend.\u201d\n\nThe EWG\u2019s 10 Worst Children\u2019s Cereals:\n\n1.
