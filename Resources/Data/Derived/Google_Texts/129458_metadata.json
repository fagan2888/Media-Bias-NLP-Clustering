AFT reported \u201cGross Salary Disbursements\u201d of $401,578 to Weingarten last year.\n\n\u201cThe story of America is the story of its working people \u2014 their struggles and successes and their hopes for a better future for themselves and their families,\u201d former NEA president Dennis Van Roekel said in a 2013 Labor Day statement. \u201cOn Labor Day, and every day, we celebrate their contributions to our society, those struggles and successes, including those of public school workers.\u201d\n\nVan Roekel was paid $411,172, taken from public school workers, last year.\n\nGarcia was elected NEA president this summer after years spent performing renditions of union anthem \u201cSolidarity Forever\u201d and bashing \u201cbillionaire bullies\u201d who support union reform.\n\nGarcia has taken over $240,000 per year from NEA members and forced \u201cfair share\u201d fee payers every year since 2007.\n\nIn a blog post this February, Garcia slammed school choice vouchers that give poor families options outside of union-dominated public schools as \u201cone of the more shameful and shakiest pillars of school reform nincompoopery.\u201d\n\nThis Labor Day, Eskelsen Garcia visited with President Obama and his staff on Air Force One. She gave the president a copy of Rabble Rousers, her book about \u201csocial justice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Teachers union presidents Randi Weingarten and Lily Eskelsen Garcia claim to speak for American workers, but collect huge salaries from the very educators they accuse taxpayers of shortchanging.", "title": "Union Boss Pay Refutes \"Solidarity\" Rhetoric", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/AP172214527922.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-05T17:04:52+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/168606/union-boss-pay-refutes-solidarity-rhetoric/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "tag": "AFT,American Federation of Teachers,Big Labor,Dennis van Roekel,Labor Day,Lily Eskelsen Garcia,Lorretta Johnson,National Education Association,NEA,Randi Weingarten,union bosses", "published_time": "2014-09-04T04:00:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-05T17:04:52+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Teachers union presidents Randi Weingarten and Lily Eskelsen Garcia claim to speak for American workers, but collect huge salaries from the very educators they accuse taxpayers of shortchanging.", "title": "Union Boss Pay Refutes \"Solidarity\" Rhetoric", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/AP172214527922.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Teachers union presidents Randi Weingarten and Lily Eskelsen Garcia claim to speak for American workers, but collect huge salaries from the very educators they accuse taxpayers of shortchanging."}, "article_summary": "When confronted about her 2013 pay as disclosed to the U.S. Department of Labor by AFT, Weingarten has insisted her salary is only $360,000.\nGarcia was elected NEA president this summer after years spent performing renditions of union anthem \u201cSolidarity Forever\u201d and bashing \u201cbillionaire bullies\u201d who support union reform.\nAFT Secretary-Treasurer Lorretta Johnson, a co-signer of the union\u2019s Labor Day message, was paid $353,097 in 2013.\n\u201cTogether, by being member-mobilized, community-engaged, solution-driven and, yes, a little bad ass, we can reclaim the promise of America,\u201d AFT asserted this week in a Labor Day statement.\n\u201cOn Labor Day, and every day, we celebrate their contributions to our society, those struggles and successes, including those of public school workers.\u201dVan Roekel was paid $411,172, taken from public school workers, last year."}
