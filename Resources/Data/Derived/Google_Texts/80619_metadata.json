The game will be played at a later date, but no decision has been made on when it will be made up.\n\nIt is the fourth time this season wet weather has wiped out a game, and the third time on the current homestand.\n\nDespite a wintery forecast, the Dodgers and Rockies are still scheduled to play a single game on Sunday afternoon, with the first pitch scheduled for 2:10 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning starting Saturday evening and going through Sunday morning, saying that between 5 inches to 10 inches of snow could fall along the Interstate 25 corridor. Rain is expected to turn to snow in Denver about 9 p.m.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a little bit of everything. Heavy rain, flash flooding, snow. A lot of moisture and a little heating can go a long way on the Eastern Plains, producing a lot of hail and the potential for tornadic activity,\u201d said Kari Bowen, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder.\n\nA winter storm watch was upgraded to a winter storm warning a little after 1 p.m. Saturday. Meanwhile, a flood warning remains in effect until 8:15 p.m. Saturday for the same Front Range cities.\n\nThe Dodgers and Rockies are both expected to keep their rotations intact for Sunday\u2019s game, meaning that Dodgers left-hander Clayton Kershaw, the two-time National League Cy Young Award winner, would face Colorado lefty Jorge De La Rosa.\n\nTickets from Saturday\u2019s game will be valid for the rescheduled game or exchanges can be made for any game throughout the remainder of the 2015 season \u2014 value for value, best available seating, as long as the exchange is made prior to the rescheduled game.\n\nComplimentary tickets have a value of zero dollars and therefore may not be exchanged.\n\nDiscounted tickets may be exchanged only for the amount paid to the Rockies and are subject to any constraints applicable to the original sale.\n\nThere will be no cash refunds. Ticket exchanges will be accepted at the Coors Field ticket office and all Rockies Dugout stores.\n\nTickets purchased via StubHub for Saturday\u2019s game will be valid for the rescheduled game.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies-Dodgers game at Coors Field postponed because of inclement weather", "title": "Rockies-Dodgers game at Coors Field postponed because of inclement weather", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/09/rockies-dodgers-game-at-coors-field-postponed-because-of-inclement-weather/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150509__rockiesp1.jpg", "height": 418}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150509__rockiesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-09T16:10:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T13:38:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A winter storm watch was upgraded to a winter storm warning a little after 1 p.m. Saturday.\nTickets purchased via StubHub for Saturday\u2019s game will be valid for the rescheduled game.\nSaturday night\u2019s Rockies game against the Los Angeles Dodgers has been postponed because of inclement weather.\nTickets from Saturday\u2019s game will be valid for the rescheduled game or exchanges can be made for any game throughout the remainder of the 2015 season \u2014 value for value, best available seating, as long as the exchange is made prior to the rescheduled game.\nIt is the fourth time this season wet weather has wiped out a game, and the third time on the current homestand."}
