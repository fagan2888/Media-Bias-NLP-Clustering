School corporations have cut the hours of bus drivers, teachers' aides and others who haven't been getting insurance to make sure they don't work enough hours \u2014 30 hours a week \u2014 to qualify for health care under the law.\n\nIf opponents' challenge to the ACA's subsidies had been successful, employers could not have been penalized for not providing insurance, because the penalties are triggered if a worker needs a subsidy to get coverage.\n\nNow that that aspect of the schools' suit has been decided, U.S. District Judge William T. Lawrence can address the state sovereignty issue.\n\nBefore putting the case on hold pending Thursday's Supreme Court decision, Lawrence had said Zoeller cannot make the 10th Amendment claim for the state. That's because Indiana was part of the first challenge to the ACA in which the 10th Amendment claim was raised and rejected.\n\nLawrence still has to rule on whether the schools have the right to make that case.\n\nHamilton said he is not deterred by the fact the Supreme Court has now ruled twice in favor of the law.\n\n\"Today's decision ... cannot be read more broadly in terms of limiting future legal challenges,\" he said. \"We were hoping for relief today. We didn't get it.\"\n\nBut Josh Blackman, a conservative legal blogger and associate law professor at South Texas College of Law, said Chief Justice John Roberts has effectively said, \"We're done here.\"\n\n\"The battle over Obamacare isn't over, but today the chief justice signaled it won't go through the courts,\" Blackman said.\n\nBeth Cate, an associate professor at the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said the schools can be encouraged by the fact the court has spoken out strongly on the importance of federalism and of state sovereignty being respected. That includes its 2012 decision upholding the constitutionality of the ACA \u2014 but giving states the final say on whether Medicaid would be expanded.\n\n\"So we know that a majority of justices on the court cares about federalism,\" she said. \"The question really is, will they see this employer mandate as a real hit to federalism or not.\"\n\nOn the one hand, Cate said, government employers are subject to a wide variety of regulations that also apply to private employers. On the other hand, there's a \"particular antipathy to having the feds tax the states even if they can otherwise regulate the states as employers to some extent.\"\n\nIf the schools win their 10th Amendment argument, that won't have the same collateral effects on subsidy recipients as the main part of their challenge would have. Rather than invalidating subsidies in Indiana, a win for the schools under what's left of the challenge would affect public employers and their workers, who would not be subject to the employer penalties for not providing insurance.\n\n\"The 10th Amendment argument would apply only to the state and local units of governments \u2014 cities, towns, counties,\" Hamilton said.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Thursday she can't comment on pending litigation.\n\n\"What I will say is, with regard to the application of how employers are treated, we have followed the statute and continue to do that,\" she said.\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Brad Heath contributed to this report.\n\nContact Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com or @mgroppe on Twitter.\n\nSchool districts in lawsuit\n\nHere are the Indiana school corporations challenging the Affordable Care Act:\n\n- Area 30 Career Center Education Interlocal, Greencastle\n\n- Benton Community School Corporation, Fowler\n\n- Charles A.
