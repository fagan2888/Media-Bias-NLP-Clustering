They\u2019ve lived through some of Israel\u2019s history now.\u201d\n\nThe program instills in children firsthand, critical thinking skills about the complexity of the conflict in the region, she said.\n\nMany of the students will talk about their experiences and new-found perspectives during the Israel Solidarity Rally at Temple Emanuel Sanctuary at 51 Grape St. in Denver at 6:30 p.m. Monday.\n\n\u201cWe moved around a lot, but we were completely safe,\u201d Ben Potts said. \u201cEveryone was so loving and so caring to look out for us. They treated us like family \u2014 with love.\u201d\n\nSadly, the threat of violence is ingrained into everyday life, said Potts and his friend, Taylor Bernstein, another East High student.\n\nOne day they were in the market, and rocket sirens begin to blare, they recalled.\n\n\u201cWe start running for the shelters,\u201d Potts said. \u201cThe Israelis were just walking around like normal, like this happens all the time.\u201d\n\nBernstein said Israelis welcomed them into a shelter until the sirens stopped.\n\n\u201cFor these guys to do what they did for us to keep us safe was incredible,\u201d Bernstein said.\n\nMichal Uziyahu, an Israeli emissary to JEWISHcolorado, said she hoped the students learned many things, especially that \u201cIsrael is not fighting the Palestinian people, but terrorist organizations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese kids can come home to a safe place; our kids are there,\u201d said Uziyahu, who said she would return to Israel in a year. \u201cIt\u2019s the only home they have.\u201d\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Jewish teens return Sunday after 5 weeks in embattled Israel", "title": "Colorado Jewish teens return Sunday after 5 weeks in embattled Israel", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/13/colorado-jewish-teens-return-sunday-after-5-weeks-in-embattled-israel/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140713__Colorado-Jewish-Teensp1.jpg", "height": 528}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140713__Colorado-Jewish-Teensp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-13T18:57:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:32:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "His mother, Joanne, dabbed at her eyes as her son arrived home from five weeks in Israel, one of 71 Denver-area teenagers who participated in this year\u2019s Colorado Israel Study Tour.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve toured, they\u2019ve learned, they\u2019ve been in all parts of the country,\u201d Adler said as she waited in the terminal for the youths to clear customs.\nJoanne Potts paused for almost as long as her son\u2019s hug when she was asked how worried she had been.\nFor their safety, the students were kept away from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, said Phyllis Adler, the executive director of the Colorado Agency for Jewish Education.\nBut she never wavered in whether he should make the trip with other students between their junior and senior years."}
