He defended that decision yesterday when he spoke at the White House Working Families Summit:\n\nWhen Noah asks me one day, \u2018What happened? What was it like when I was born?\u2019 I could have answered \u2018Well, Stephen Strasburg hung me a breaking ball that day, son, and I slammed it into the right-field corner.\u2019 But I think it\u2019s going to go so much further in that I\u2019m the one who cut his umbilical cord. And long after they tell me that I\u2019m not good enough to play professional baseball anymore, I\u2019ll be a father. And I\u2019ll be a husband. So that was a reason on the front end that I wanted to be there for my wife and for my son.\n\nSome in the the New York media criticized Murphy for missing the games. Sports radio host Mike Francesa griped, \u201cYou\u2019re a Major League Baseball player. You can hire a nurse to take care of the baby if your wife needs help.\u201d\n\nBut Murphy said his teammates and manager were all supportive of his decision to take advantage of a relatively new baseball rule that allows players to go on paternity leave for three days.\n\n\u201cWe try to take Jesus Christ and we try to put him in the center of everything,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cSo instead of OK, I\u2019m a father; I\u2019m a husband; I\u2019m a baseball player, I just try to take Jesus, put him right in the middle.\u201d\n\nMurphy is not the first player to miss games for family reasons. In 1987, Mark McGwire set the rookie record for home runs with 49. But he missed the last two games of the season\u2014and chance for an even 50 home runs\u2014to witness the birth of his first child. In 1965, Dodgers ace Sandy Koufax opted not to pitch the first game of the 1965 World Series to observe the Jewish high holiday of Yom Kippur.\n\nThe Dodgers won the 1965 World Series against the Twins, Mark McGwire had a long, celebrated career that has since been mired in controversy, and based on his performance, Daniel Murphy is on pace to have a standout year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York Mets infielder Daniel Murphy had his priorities right when he chose to miss the first two games of the season to witness the birth of his son.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "New York Mets infielder Daniel Murphy had his priorities right when he chose to miss the first two games of the season to witness the birth of his son.", "title": "Professional Ballplayer Explains Why Skipping Games to Attend Son's Birth Was a No-Brainer", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014_06_10_MurphyMets_Thurman.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-10T13:56:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1uSqYYQ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "New York Mets infielder Daniel Murphy had his priorities right when he chose to miss the first two games of the season to witness the birth of his son.", "title": "Professional Ballplayer Explains Why Skipping Games to Attend Son's Birth Was a No-Brainer", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014_06_10_MurphyMets_Thurman.jpg"}, "creator": "@ToddThurman", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Marriage and Family", "published_time": "2014-06-10T13:55:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-10T13:56:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "New York Mets, faith, paternity leave, fatherhood, Daniel Murphy"}, "article_summary": "In 1965, Dodgers ace Sandy Koufax opted not to pitch the first game of the 1965 World Series to observe the Jewish high holiday of Yom Kippur.\nSports radio host Mike Francesa griped, \u201cYou\u2019re a Major League Baseball player.\nAnd long after they tell me that I\u2019m not good enough to play professional baseball anymore, I\u2019ll be a father.\nBut he missed the last two games of the season\u2014and chance for an even 50 home runs\u2014to witness the birth of his first child.\n\u201cWe try to take Jesus Christ and we try to put him in the center of everything,\u201d Murphy said."}
