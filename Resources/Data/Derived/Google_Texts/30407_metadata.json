The culture associated with research overall is detrimental to furthering results, he said.\n\n\u201cWe slow down our best young minds by making them spend years and years in the lab before they can get their own grants,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when they do, the grant, they spend a third of their time writing a grant that takes months to be approved and awarded.\u201d\n\nWhen research is published, the data is typically inaccessible for at least a year, because academic journals keep the data for some time after a report is published. Much of that research is funded by taxpayers, he said.
