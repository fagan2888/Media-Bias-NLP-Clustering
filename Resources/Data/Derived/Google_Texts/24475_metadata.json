In October, they packaged reams of publicly-available data into a website, healthsherpa.com, that allowed users to immediately view exchange plans in their area. But the site was intended for research only; users still had to purchase them through the federal and state health exchanges or, in some cases, directly through insurers.\n\nThat changed last week, when the programmers \u2014 Michael Wasser, George Kalogeropoulos and Ning Liang \u2014 added functionality to their website that allows people to actually sign up for plans on their site, and joined a group of so-called Web brokers who offer a way to enroll in qualified health plans that they say is quicker and simpler than using the federal exchange.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that we\u2019re building an easier place to sign up for health insurance where you get the same exact results as you would on HealthCare.gov,\u201d said Mr. Wasser.\n\nMr. Wasser said the programmers were approached last fall, after they started their website, by Bryan Sivak, the chief technology officer for the Department of Health and Human Services. They made an agreement that would allow healthsherpa.com to integrate with elements of HealthCare.gov and sign individuals up for on-exchange plans, with subsidies.\n\nThe HealthSherpa team has since added two more employees and raised $1.1 million in seed funding. Their business model is similar to that of an insurance broker, since they will earn commissions from insurance companies when the individuals who use their site to sign up for coverage pay their premiums.\n\nMr. Wasser said it currently took users on the site about an hour to sign up for care. First, users enter their zip code to see a list of available plans in their area, which they can refine according to their age, family size and their preferred level of coverage. After selecting a plan, they are directed to a page on healthcare.gov, where they enter information to determine their eligibility for tax credits and cost-sharing reduction. Users are then directed back to healthsherpa.com to confirm and enroll.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just working to try to find as many ways as we can to shorten the time it takes for people to sign up,\u201d said Mr. Wasser, who said he and his team would eventually like to reduce sign-up time to as little as 10 minutes.\n\nSo far, according to Mr. Wasser, several hundred people have started the application process on his website, and about 40 had completed the signup process \u2014 about a third of whom had applied for subsidies.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human services has about 30 agreements with Web brokers intended to enable the sites to offer consumers options outside the federal exchange to sign up for health care under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cBy strengthening the multiple channels to enroll in quality, affordable coverage through the Marketplace, we are offering Americans more options to purchase new coverage,\u201d said Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nBut the sites have offered varying levels of functionality, in part because of technical issues in determining users\u2019 eligibility, which is still done through the federal system.\n\n\u201cThe reason we\u2019re not seeing more web brokers doing this process online right now is because the eligibility system is still being fixed,\u201d said Claire McAndrew, the private health insurance director of FamiliesUSA, a health care consumer advocacy group.\n\nGoHealth.com, for example, has been signing up users for exchange plans with subsidies using a call center since November. And last month, GetInsured.com announced the launch of a web-only enrollment process for plans under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 something the company had initially planned on offering sooner. As HealthSherpa does, it now directs customers to HealthCare.gov and then back to its own sites during the process.\n\nThe website eHealth can sign people up for plans, but the company\u2019s C.E.O., Gary Lauer, recently told CNBC it had been unable to process subsidies.\n\nThe private exchanges say that their tools make it easier for users to see available plans, and that their sign-up process is quicker than the federal exchange.\n\nBut consumer advocates warn that Web brokers\u2019 presentation of insurance plan information may be influenced by their commission deals with those companies.\n\n\u201cFor some plans you\u2019ll see the premiums, the benefits, the cost sharing \u2014 for other plans you\u2019ll see a name. That can really influence which plan a consumer might pick,\u201d said Ms. McAndrew, who added, \u201cI always recommend that people go to the official marketplace website.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140306145154, "BN": "affordable-care-act", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/affordable-care-act/post", "per": "Wasser, Michael", "org": "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;Health and Human Services Department;HealthCare.gov", "keywords": "Wasser Michael,E-Commerce,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,Health and Human Services Department,HealthCare.gov,United States,Business,Exchanges", "GBLC": "Business;Exchanges", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jess Bidgood", "SCG": "affordable-care-act", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Jess Bidgood", "byl": "Jess Bidgood", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2014/03/06/more-than-one-way-to-buy-a-plan/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "Private websites are offering alternatives to HealthCare.gov for buying health plans.", "card": "summary", "title": "More Than One Way to Buy a Plan"}, "blogpostid": 100000002754316, "description": "Private websites are offering alternatives to HealthCare.gov for buying health plans.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 6, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1394135514, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/jess_bidgood/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Exchanges", "modified_time": "2014-03-06T19:51:54-05:00"}, "geo": "United States", "utime": 20140306195154, "PUD": 20140306, "pdate": 20140306, "des": "E-Commerce;Health Insurance and Managed Care;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "In Practice", "description": "Private websites are offering alternatives to HealthCare.gov for buying health plans.", "title": "More Than One Way to Buy a Plan", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2014/03/06/more-than-one-way-to-buy-a-plan/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/../../packages/images/nytdesign/2013/national/inPractice/inPractice-75.png", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "More Than One Way to Buy a Plan", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 6, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd98ba\"", "article_summary": "But consumer advocates warn that Web brokers\u2019 presentation of insurance plan information may be influenced by their commission deals with those companies.\nThat can really influence which plan a consumer might pick,\u201d said Ms. McAndrew, who added, \u201cI always recommend that people go to the official marketplace website.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that we\u2019re building an easier place to sign up for health insurance where you get the same exact results as you would on HealthCare.gov,\u201d said Mr. Wasser.\nMr. Wasser said it currently took users on the site about an hour to sign up for care.\nAfter selecting a plan, they are directed to a page on healthcare.gov, where they enter information to determine their eligibility for tax credits and cost-sharing reduction."}
