Shipping company FedEx Corp. has a plan to adjust its new pilots union contract if the “Cadillac tax” on high cost health plans takes effect during the six-year contract.

The company says it agreed with pilots that it would have a “process that will be used between the company and the union” if the Cadillac tax would impact the contract, FedEx General Counsel Christine Richards said during the company’s first quarter earnings call Wednesday.
