That is done now.\u201d\n\nIn a 6-3 decision on King vs. Burwell, the Supreme Court handed President Barack Obama his second major win on his signature health care law, upholding nationwide tax subsidies for millions of Americans.\n\nJustice Scalia, reading part of his dissent from the bench, said, \u201cWe should start calling this law SCOTUScare\u201d because of how the Supreme Court has repeatedly changed aspects of the president\u2019s law in order to uphold it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you get around it, guys,\u201d Beck\u2019s co-host Stu Burguiere agreed, arguing that the Supreme Court has become both judicial and legislative. \u201cThey\u2019re freaking inserting words into laws after they\u2019re passed. They\u2019re putting words into laws that aren\u2019t there. The design of this country with this system is completely gone.\u201d\n\nBeck said America needs a \u201creset\u201d because there is \u201cnothing left\u201d of the system as it was created.\n\n\u201cIt will get a reset because they have violated mathematical principles,\u201d Beck argued. \u201cThey violated $18 trillion in debt and printing money. It will reset because there\u2019s nothing left of this. So now the question is, when we reset, do we, A, tear each other apart, B, do we go to a new Constitution, or, C, do we hang on and reset to the original Constitution and become much more free and Libertarian in our nature?\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
