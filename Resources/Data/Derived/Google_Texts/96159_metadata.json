(A recent Dispatch query about the topic on Facebook quickly drew more than 60 responses.)\n\nBecause of its therapeutic benefits, some mental-health professionals endorse the activity.\n\n\u201cI encourage any executive to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to spend the lunch hour coloring, doodling,\u2019\u201d said Leslie Marshall, a licensed professional clinical counselor with Directions Counseling Group in Worthington.\n\nColoring, she said, opens the frontal lobe of the brain - the home of organizing and problem solving - and focuses the mind.\n\n\u201cIt allows us to not be too regretful of the past or too anxious about the future,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we want people to forget what it\u2019s like to be in reality, but, for 20 minutes \u2026 we can push aside that stress.\u201d\n\nSuch a notion probably explains the range of coloring books geared toward adults.\n\nIncluded are books and websites devoted to geometric-shaped designs called mandalas; humorous options designed by comedians (Coloring for Grown-Ups and The Hipster Coloring Book for Adults); and posh alternatives - priced at $160 no less - sold by the French fashion house Hermes.\n\nEarlier this year, Scott O\u2019Brien - a Euclid, Ohio, native and Los Angeles resident - raised more than $23,000 on the crowd-funding site Kickstarter to create Why Is Daddy Sad on Sunday?\n\nThe coloring book depicts disappointing moments in Cleveland sports history and allows adults to share the moments with children. (Recently released is a companion coloring book, Why Is Daddy Happy on Sunday?)\n\nThree months ago, central Ohio illustrator Katie Barron released a 98-page coloring book with scenes from Downtown, the Clintonville neighborhood, German Village and the Short North.\n\nShe had started the project in the spring of 2013 as a senior at the Columbus College of Art & Design, viewing it as an effective way to share her art without having to sell originals or produce commissions.\n\n\u201cColoring - it\u2019s kind of interactive,\u201d said Barron, 24.\n\nHer book, sold on Amazon.com and at eight area shops, includes activities, too.\n\nBecause of the intricate drawings, she said, she doesn\u2019t recommend the book for anyone younger than 8.\n\n\u201cAdults do jigsaw puzzles,\u201d she said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything nerdier about coloring than (there is about) doing jigsaw puzzles.\u201d\n\nOne day recently, Barron hosted a \u201ccoloring night\u201d with a retailer, State & Third, that stocks her book.\n\nDiane Lazor and Susan Brown, friends from Grove City, were among the 10 people at the event - with wine, colored pencils and a few pages from the book.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved to color,\u201d Lazor, 56, said as she shaded the leaves of a tree in an Ohio Theatre scene.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll color when the guys are watching football.\u201d\n\nBrown, a 48-year-old mortgage-company employee, receives crayons and a coloring book each year for Christmas from her family.\n\n\u201cIt does relieve stress,\u201d she said. \u201cNo two pages are ever the same.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, New Albany resident Susan Clark has worked in a 368-page activity book called Scribbles by Japanese illustrator Taro Gomi.\n\nColoring books take the intimidation out of creativity, the 43-year-old said.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m coloring, I\u2019m not thinking about anything but what\u2019s in front of me,\u201d said Clark, who has \u201cquite the arrangement\u201d of crayons, markers and colored pencils.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing earth-shattering, but it allows my mind to calm down.\u201d\n\nSome people don\u2019t easily appreciate the simplicity of coloring, psychologist Craig Travis said.\n\n\u201cIt gets you out of your adult mind, where you know nothing but problems,\u201d said the director of behavioral sciences at OhioHealth Grant Medical Education.\n\n\u201cIt breaks from the patterns and habits we have.\u201d\n\nAdults who color, Travis said, might like how they are carried back to their carefree youth and the age of wonder.\n\nEven the smell of crayons, clinical counselor Marshall said, evokes nostalgia.\n\nChris Blanton of Columbus looks forward to Crayola releases of new colors and the accompanying clever names.\n\nFor the holidays, the 32-year-old has asked his family for crayons and coloring books - preferably with Disney and comic-book themes.\n\nColoring, Blanton said, relaxes him after long days of work as an account manager for a cleaning company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s soothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI can go be a child again. And all the problems of the day - I don\u2019t have to sit and think about them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Columbus Dispatch, http://www.dispatch.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Twice a week or so, Amanda Ghiloni pulls out a coloring book and gussies up an animal, a Disney princess or a simple scene from a dollar-bin tablet.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Twice a week or so, Amanda Ghiloni pulls out a coloring book and gussies up an animal, a Disney princess or a simple scene from a dollar-bin tablet.", "title": "Grown-ups find coloring books a break from stress", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/13/grown-ups-find-coloring-books-a-break-from-stress/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/13/cfbc7737e1992530680f6a706700b1ba.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/13/cfbc7737e1992530680f6a706700b1ba.jpg", "description": "Twice a week or so, Amanda Ghiloni pulls out a coloring book and gussies up an animal, a Disney princess or a simple scene from a dollar-bin tablet.", "card": "summary", "title": "Grown-ups find coloring books a break from stress"}, "Author": "ALLISON WARD", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "For the holidays, the 32-year-old has asked his family for crayons and coloring books - preferably with Disney and comic-book themes.\nThe coloring book depicts disappointing moments in Cleveland sports history and allows adults to share the moments with children.\nColoring books take the intimidation out of creativity, the 43-year-old said.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m coloring, I\u2019m not thinking about anything but what\u2019s in front of me,\u201d said Clark, who has \u201cquite the arrangement\u201d of crayons, markers and colored pencils.\n(Recently released is a companion coloring book, Why Is Daddy Happy on Sunday?)"}
