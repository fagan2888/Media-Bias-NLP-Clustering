I wanted dentures,\u201d said Sandra Twine, from Paterson, New Jersey.\n\nShe saw an ad online to apply for a free dental grant in the amount of $1,800. The catch was, the grant was only good at Westchester Smile Design.\n\nWhen she went to Westchester Smile Design in Yonkers, Dr. Shay Markovitch told her he would make her a full set of dentures but it would cost much more than the grant would cover.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You have the $1,800 grant and you need about $3,000 worth of work but what you need to do is sign this loan,\u2019\u201d said Sandra.\n\nSo Sandra signed up for a $1,500 loan from the Lending Club, through the dental office.\n\nBut when Sandra got her insurance card from Obamacare she decided she was going to ask a dentist closer to home to do the work.\n\nThat dentist told her she only needed a partial, not a full set, and the work would be free with her insurance.\n\nThen she got a bill from the Lending Club saying Westchester Smile Design had collected the $1,500 for the work it claimed to have done for Sandra.\n\nSandra said there was no work done. Dr. Shay Markovitch disagreed.\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018You have to pay the loan back because we have dentures in our office for you.\u2019 I said, how do you have dentures in your office for me when you never put any molding in my mouth, you never measured me, the only thing you did was the x-ray and I paid for that. I don\u2019t owe you anything.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nWe went with Sandra to speak with Dr. Markovitch.\n\nHe showed her the dentures he made for her.\n\nShe said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way those are mine and I\u2019m not putting them in my mouth.\u201d\n\nDr. Markovitch said he was tired of arguing with her and told her and PIX11 he would rescind the loan.\n\nSandra thanked PIX11 profusely. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he would have rescinded the loan if you hadn\u2019t been here with me.\u201d\n\nAnd then she smiled.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PATERSON, N.J. \u2014 \u201cI wanted a nice smile.\u00a0 I wanted dentures,\u201d\u00a0 said Sandra Twine, from Paterson, New Jersey.
