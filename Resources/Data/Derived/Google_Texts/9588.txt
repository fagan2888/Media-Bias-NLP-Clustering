"It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning by our Superintendent of schools, Mr. Howard “Bud” Stewart, that Mr. David Allardice, the former principal of the middle school, and our current principal for the Academy of Tucson Elementary School, was involved in a fatal car accident while driving home Friday night. He was a strong influence within our school district. Mr Allardice was a wonderful principal and friend who will be missed greatly by all of us.

All faculty and staff are prepared to serve as an important model for helping kids handle tragedies like these. It is important that they know they are loved and supported as they talk about their feelings.



Classes and activities will resume on Monday and our deepest sympathies go to the entire Allardice family. The Academy of Tucson District cares deeply for all involved.
