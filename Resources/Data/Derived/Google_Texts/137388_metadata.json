Macfadyen, Noozhawk Publisher | @noozhawk | Published on 04.13.2015 10:26 p.m.\n\nCottage Health System announced Monday that it will explore the sale of its Santa Barbara Outpatient Surgery Center.\n\nThe divestment is intended to alleviate Federal Trade Commission unease about the hospital system\u2019s proposed merger with Sansum Clinic.\n\nIn June 2013, the two nonprofit health-care providers unveiled plans to develop an integrated health system that would unite Cottage, the South Coast\u2019s only inpatient hospital, with Sansum, the region\u2019s largest outpatient clinic.\n\nAlmost from the start, however, the FTC expressed concerns over the proposed merger\u2019s effect on local competition.\n\nIn a Monday afternoon phone interview with Noozhawk, Cottage President/CEO Ron Werft and Sansum CEO Kurt Ransohoff said 18 months of discussions with the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition began to focus on the competitive overlap of the off-campus outpatient surgery center.\n\nThe center, at 2403 Castillo St. across Junipero Street from Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital\u2019s emergency room, has four surgical rooms and employs 40 people.\n\nIn 2014, the center handled 2,500 operations \u2014 for everything from orthopedic to gynecological to pediatric procedures, according to Maria Zate, Cottage Health System\u2019s communications director.\n\nLast August, Sansum opened a spacious, state-of-the-art medical and outpatient surgical center at 4151 Foothill Road. It, too, has four surgical suites and is adjacent to the offices of a number of Sansum physicians who work in the complex.\n\nWerft said Cottage Health System has retained Cain Brothers & Co., a New York City-based investment banking firm that focuses exclusively on the health-care industry.\n\n\u201cCain Brothers will approach ambulatory surgery companies around the country about the possibility of acquiring the center,\u201d he said.\n\nThe search for prospective buyers likely would take \u201cabout six months,\u201d he said.\n\nTypically, he added, companies interested in the purchase would seek to identify potential physician investors from the area.\n\n\u201cThe FTC requires that the buyer must be independent, and that they will continue to be viable competition,\u201d Werft said.\n\n\u201cThey want the same level of competition, or more.\u201d\n\nHe declined to speculate on a purchase price or possible buyers, but noted that there are a number of companies that specialize in running outpatient surgery centers.\n\nWerft said the sale of the surgery center makes sense now because Sansum\u2019s new Foothill Road clinic was designed and built in an integrative manner. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act encourages such efficiencies and partnerships, he added.\n\nHe also emphasized that Cottage currently has 24 operating suites in its Santa Barbara, Goleta and Santa Ynez Valley hospitals. When the new Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital opens later this year, it will add two more to the mix.\n\nShould the Sansum merger be approved, Sansum\u2019s four outpatient operating suites would replace the divested ones, and Cottage Health System\u2019s net gain would be two.\n\nWerft said a sale of the outpatient surgery center would be contingent on the approval and completion of the Cottage-Sansum merger. He expected that Cottage would retain ownership of the free-standing building, which includes doctors\u2019 offices on its second floor and off-street parking.\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk publisher Bill Macfadyen can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .
