The deal would allow tech companies such as Google and Facebook to legally handle European citizens\u2019 data, with the rules also helping industries such as hospitality and retail.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf the Privacy Shield is not finalized, businesses fear a chilling of transatlantic trade, valued at $1 trillion in 2014.\n\n\u201cSomething needs to get done. This no-man\u2019s-land, this uncertainty, is creating a lot of global tension and impacting global business,\u201d said Aaron Tantleff, a lawyer in the privacy and information management practice at Foley & Lardner LLP.\n\nThe European Commission and the Obama administration crafted the Privacy Shield after a previous agreement on data sharing was struck down by Europe\u2019s high court over concerns about U.S. spying.\n\nThe new deal, which is only in draft form, underwent a review from a working group of 28 data protection authorities in Europe.\n\nTheir opinion, while non-binding, had been tensely awaited as a barometer of the deal\u2019s viability in court, and came back decidedly mixed.\n\nThe group wrote that the current draft of the deal is a \"major improvement\" over the predecessor negotiated in 2000, but warned the draft still gives the U.S. too much leeway to carry out surveillance.\n\n\u201cThe possibility that is left in the Shield for bulk collection which is massive and indiscriminate is not acceptable,\u201d said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, chairwoman of the group of 28 data protection authorities.\n\nThe U.S. and the EU are under no obligation to change the agreement, but if they don\u2019t, the matter could return again to Europe\u2019s high court \u2014 with potentially ruinous results.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s robust enough to satisfy the working party, then it has a good chance of surviving scrutiny by the European Court of Justice,\u201d Susan Foster, a privacy attorney at Mintz Levin who works in both the EU and the U.S., told The Hill.\n\nIf negotiators don\u2019t adequately address the working party\u2019s concerns, Tantleff said, \u201cyou\u2019re almost guaranteeing court action.\u201d\n\nSome think it\u2019s unlikely the Commission and the Commerce Department, which led the talks on the U.S. side, will return to the negotiating table. The Commission has already indicated that it will persevere with the deal as written.\n\n\u201cFollowing #WP29 opinion today, I will continue to work for EU-US #PrivacyShield in place by summer. Important for our citizens & business,\u201d Andrus Ansip, Vice President for the Digital Single Market on the EU Commission, tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nIf Commerce and the Commission feel they have already reached the best deal feasible, Tantleff said, they might move forward without renegotiating.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is free to do whatever it wants,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the pressure that currently exists with U.S. organizations and even in Europe, with organizations there trying to conduct business, my bet is that we\u2019re going to see the Commission go forward with Privacy Shield.\u201d\n\nOthers say none of the complaints raised by the working group are particularly damning. A few minor tweaks, those experts say, and the agreement could proceed.\n\n\u201cI think the criticisms are relatively contained and fairly mild,\u201d said Alan Charles Raul, former associate counsel to the president and leader of Sidley Austin\u2019s privacy and data security practice. \u201cI think it could provide the basis for some refinements by the Commission and ultimate approval of the draft adequacy decision.\u201d\n\nThe pressure from companies to finish the data pact has been fierce.\n\nTech and industry groups have long been behind the deal. Microsoft offered one of the first major commercial endorsements of the Privacy Shield this week.\n\n\u201cGiven the crucial importance of transatlantic data flows to the global digital economy, the national data protection authorities should not try to hold the digital economy hostage to extract further tweaks to the agreement,\u201d said Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a technology think tank.\n\nBut privacy advocates have fired back.\n\n\u201cInsane how industry lobbyists ignore all warnings and demand that #PrivacyShield is adopted. Later they'll complain about legal instability,\u201d tweeted Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy activist.\n\nCritics have long warned that unless the U.S. overhauls its privacy and national security laws, there is no legal framework that can stand up in European courts, where privacy is considered a fundamental right under the EU Charter.\n\nThe European Court of Justice, Europe\u2019s high court, struck down the Privacy Shield\u2019s predecessor over fears about American snooping. Over 4,000 companies had used the so-called Safe Harbor agreement to shuttle information across the Atlantic.\n\nSchrems, who brought the original case against Facebook that brought down Safe Harbor, has already indicated that he will challenge the new Privacy Shield with the data protection authorities if he believes it inadequately protects the right to privacy in the EU.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the working party\u2019s approval so vital, legal experts say: Their official opinion is an indicator of how well Privacy Shield will fare when it\u2019s attacked.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A key group of regulators are demanding changes to the agreement.", "description": "A key group of regulators are demanding changes to the agreement.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Katie Bo Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A key group of regulators are demanding changes to the agreement.", "title": "Companies await fate of data sharing deal", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/276536-companies-await-fate-of-data-sharing-deal", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/2014-10-20-getty-computer-data_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-17T08:00:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-17T08:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/276536-companies-await-fate-of-data-sharing-deal", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-17T08:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-17T08:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-17T08:00:01-04:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/276536-companies-await-fate-of-data-sharing-deal", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A key group of regulators are demanding changes to the agreement.", "card": "summary", "title": "Companies await fate of data sharing deal"}, "dcterms.title": "Companies await fate of data sharing deal"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTIf the Privacy Shield is not finalized, businesses fear a chilling of transatlantic trade, valued at $1 trillion in 2014.\nBusinesses on both sides of the Atlantic are anxious for the so-called Privacy Shield to be put in place.\nThe new deal, which is only in draft form, underwent a review from a working group of 28 data protection authorities in Europe.\nThe European Court of Justice, Europe\u2019s high court, struck down the Privacy Shield\u2019s predecessor over fears about American snooping.\nMicrosoft offered one of the first major commercial endorsements of the Privacy Shield this week."}
