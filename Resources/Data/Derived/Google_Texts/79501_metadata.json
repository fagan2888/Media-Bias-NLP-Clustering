The widely cited survey of 487 large U.S. employers also found that while employers remain concerned about the cost and effectiveness of their programs, they are more committed to providing some form of health care coverage to employees over the next 10 years than they have been in recent years. Employer confidence in offering health care coverage 10 years from now has nearly doubled to 44% today, from 25% in 2014.\n\nThe findings of the 20th annual Towers Watson/NBGH Best Practices in Health Care Employer Survey point to a growing affordability challenge for employees, especially for lower-wage workers. Health care costs for 2015 are expected to average $12,041 per employee, up from $11,567 in 2014. On average, employees will pay 22.2% of total premium costs in 2015, which in payroll deductions translates into an average employee contribution of $2,676, or $223 a month.\n\n\u201cAgainst the backdrop of sluggish economic growth and low inflation, which limit the degree to which companies can raise prices on goods and services, employers continue to aggressively manage their health benefit plans to rein in costs,\u201d said Randall K. Abbott, a North American leader and senior strategist in Towers Watson\u2019s Health and Group Benefits practice. \u201cBy and large, employers have done a good job managing costs in recent years. Despite this success, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s excise tax looms ahead in 2018, and four out of five employers now identify changes to health and pharmacy plan designs as their most important strategic priority.\u201d\n\nEmployer actions taken and planned include:\n\nCurbing the high cost of specialty pharmacy through new coverage/utilization restrictions: 53% of employers have done so already; another 32% are likely to by 2018\n\n53% of employers have done so already; another 32% are likely to by 2018 Adopting spousal surcharges: 27% of employers have implemented; could rise to nearly 60% in three years\n\n27% of employers have implemented; could rise to nearly 60% in three years Using a defined contribution strategy instead of defined benefit: 20% today; expected to double by 2018\n\n20% today; expected to double by 2018 Offering more customization by adding voluntary benefits: 34% today; could reach 70% by 2018\n\n\u201cWhile we have experienced several years of slower growth in health care trend, health care cost increases are still multiples of CPI,\u201d said Brian Marcotte, president and CEO of the NBGH. \u201cEmployers are trying to balance offering valuable benefits that meet employees\u2019 needs with the looming excise tax, which makes it imperative that they focus on areas where there are opportunities to make changes while preserving quality and effectiveness.\u201d\n\nOther findings from the survey include:\n\nEmployers have nearly universally adopted account-based health plans (ABHPs). Eighty-two percent of companies offered an ABHP in 2015, and another 4% expect to add an ABHP for the first time in 2016. Health savings accounts (HSAs) are the dominant model, with more than 70% of companies offering an ABHP with an HSA.\n\nEighty-two percent of companies offered an ABHP in 2015, and another 4% expect to add an ABHP for the first time in 2016.

Employer concerns about employee well-being are prompting them to consider further changes to their health benefit plans and workforce health strategies. These concerns include health risks arising from lifestyle choices, lack of employee engagement in their own well-being and participation in wellness programs; and concerns about employee financial health.\n\nEmployer concerns about employee well-being are prompting them to consider further changes to their health benefit plans and workforce health strategies.

Employers are transitioning to value-based payment strategies. Over 70% of employers identify reimbursement methodologies that are based on cost, quality, improved efficiency and better outcomes as important to consider in selecting health plan vendor partners.\n\nAbout the Survey\n\nThe 20th annual Towers Watson/NBGH Best Practices in Health Care Employer Survey tracks employers' best practices and the results of their efforts to provide and manage health benefits for their workforce.
