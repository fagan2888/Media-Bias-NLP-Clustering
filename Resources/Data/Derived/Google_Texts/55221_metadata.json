It seeks to amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to state that the service is unfair or deceptive. This would give the agency the power to enforce the provision and it would also make advertising for such therapies illegal.\n\nThe Obama administration in April said it supported efforts to ban the practice, which has been rejected by reputable medical organizations including the World Health Organization, American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association and American Medical Association. These groups believe such treatments are ineffective and ethically dubious because they assume that homosexuality is a mental illness.\n\n\u201cThere is no medical condition known as \u2018being gay or lesbian\u2019. That is not a medical disease, defect, and for people to charge money to treat you for something that\u2019s not an illness is fraud,\u201d Lieu told Buzzfeed. \u201cThere already is an established baseline that you cannot practice medicine below a reasonable standard of care, and when you purport to treat someone for a condition they don\u2019t have, that would be medical malpractice.\u201d\n\nRelated: 'Praying the gay away': Trauma survivors crusade to ban conversion therapy\n\nLieu\u2019s bill builds on existing state legislation to extend protections to transgender people and people of all ages, not just the minors who are often forced into the therapy by their parents.\n\nAs part of conversion therapy, therapists have been known to induce nausea or enact other physical punishments on patients when they are confronted with arousing same-sex images.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign supports Lieu\u2019s legislation and called it an important step to end a practice it believes is \u201cdangerous and discredited\u201d. It has been working with the National Center for Lesbian Rights and other groups to block the practice state by state.\n\nThe HRC\u2019s government affairs director, David Stacy, said that the legislation could save lives. \u201cThis vitally important legislation has the potential to save countless lives across this country by helping to end a practice that uses fear and shame to tell LGBT people the only way to find love or acceptance is to change the very nature of who they are.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity said that such bans \u201crob\u201d teens of the freedom to seek out counseling from whomever they wish. The group is holding a conference to discuss this type of therapy in October, with sessions including \u201cHomosexuality 101\u201d and a physician\u2019s assessment of \u201cthe health risks associated with human sexuality\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Bill would block people from offering as a commercial enterprise discredited treatment that purports to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Amanda Holpuch", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Bill would block people from offering as a commercial enterprise discredited treatment that purports to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation", "title": "House Democrats seek to ban gay conversion therapy nationwide", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/house-democrats-ban-gay-conversion-therapy-nationwide", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2014/1/13/1389646572736/US-psychologists-found-co-012.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=9289426a883feea28dab221a72ec8663", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2015/may/19/house-democrats-ban-gay-conversion-therapy-nationwide?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/house-democrats-ban-gay-conversion-therapy-nationwide", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2015/may/19/house-democrats-ban-gay-conversion-therapy-nationwide?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@holpuch", "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2014/1/13/1389646572736/US-psychologists-found-co-012.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2015/may/19/house-democrats-ban-gay-conversion-therapy-nationwide?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "LGBT rights,House of Representatives,Democrats,US politics,US news,US Congress,US domestic policy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-05-19T17:28:11.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-holpuch", "section": "World news", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T21:34:30.000Z", "tag": "LGBT rights,House of Representatives,Democrats,US politics,US news,US Congress,US domestic policy"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2014/1/13/1389646572736/US-psychologists-found-co-012.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=38514a10d13cbd0a241f0d1e3d798298", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "LGBT rights,House of Representatives,Democrats,US politics,US news,US Congress,US domestic policy"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd27\"", "article_summary": "It has been working with the National Center for Lesbian Rights and other groups to block the practice state by state.\nHouse Democrats on Tuesday introduced legislation that would ban the discredited practice of conversion therapy \u2013 when a mental health professional attempts to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity.\nAs part of conversion therapy, therapists have been known to induce nausea or enact other physical punishments on patients when they are confronted with arousing same-sex images.\nIt seeks to amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to state that the service is unfair or deceptive.\nTed Lieu, a Democrat from California, and Suzan DelBene, a Democrat from Washington, introduced the legislation."}
