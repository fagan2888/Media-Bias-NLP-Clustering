Numerous studies indicate that certain grains, fish, and legumes are associated with lower rates of breast cancer incidence and mortality. For breast cancer survivors, conscientious eating may also help prevent recurrence of the disease.\n\nAlthough most studies fall short of establishing a causal link between nutrition and resistance, many specialists argue that the overall statistics speak for themselves. \"We have to take a global look at survivorship,\" said Alison Estabrook, chief of breast surgery at St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt Hospital, where female patients are currently being invited to attend a seminar on the protective capacity of certain superfoods. \u201cIt's clear better eating habits increase the possibility that a woman won't get breast cancer or have a recurrence.\"\n\nThe following three foods have been singled out by researchers for their apparent influence on health factors associated with breast cancer mortality and incidence. Isoflavones, carotenoids, and omega-3 fatty acids are among the nutrients believed to assist women in their fight against the disease that kills upwards of 39,000 Americans each year.\n\nSoybeans\n\n\"It was feared that components of soy had estrogen-like properties that influenced the growth of breast cancer cells,\" Barry Boyd of the Greenwich Hospital-Yale Health Systems said, speaking to CNN. \"Science has not only proved an absence of risk, there's also a possible benefit.\u201d\n\nBoyd is right: last year, at least two peer-reviewed studies found a link between the consumption of soybeans and a statistically significant reduced breast cancer mortality and recurrence. Published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and the Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, the research efforts illuminated the protective capacity of isoflavones \u2013\u2013 an organic compound occurring in soybeans, chickpeas, peanuts.\n\nSquash, Kale, And Sweet Potatoes\n\nThese foods derive their preventive qualities from carotenoids \u2013\u2013 the natural pigment found in orange foods like carrots, squash, and sweet potatoes as well as dark greens like kale and spinach. In a 2009 study published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, the substance was linked to a \u201cgreater likelihood of breast cancer-free survival.\u201d According to Mitchell Gaynor of Gaynor Integrative Oncology, women who want to up their carotenoid intake should increase their overall consumption of cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower as well.\n\nSalmon, Haddock and Cod\n\nThese fish contain significant quantities of omega-3 fatty acids \u2013\u2013 a substance tied to numerous health benefits by previous research. In a 2011 study published in the Journal of Nutrition, experts found that the consumption of these acids inhibited the proliferation of cancerous cells as well as the progression of tumors. In addition, a diet high in omega-3 was associated with a 25 percent reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence.\n\nSources:\n\nSarah J Nechuta, Bette J Caan, Wendy Y Chen, Wei Lu, Zhi Chen, Marilyn L Kwan,Shirley W Flatt, Ying Zheng, Wei Zheng, John P Pierce, and Xiao Ou Shu.
