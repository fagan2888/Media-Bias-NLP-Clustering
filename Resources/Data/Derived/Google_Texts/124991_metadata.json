But she sent a pointed message, and one that she delivered seated beside Hun Sen\u2019s wife, Bun Rany.\n\nHuman rights groups praised the remarks as a rare foray into foreign affairs for a first lady.\n\n\u201cEven though Mrs. Obama didn\u2019t name names, it\u2019s more than we have heard in a long time from a first lady on a foreign trip,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for President Obama to state publicly what rights benchmarks he expects to see from Cambodia, and press Hun Sen to commit to it.\u201d\n\nMrs. Obama wrapped up a five-day trip to Asia Sunday to promote the U.S.-led education initiative \u201cLet Girls Learn,\u201d which she and the president announced earlier this month. The community-based program, to be run by the Peace Corps, is meant to help millions of girls in the developing world stay in school and overcome economic or cultural pressures that force many to drop out.\n\n\u201cLet Girls Learn\u201d is starting in 11 countries, including Cambodia. Mrs. Obama\u2019s visit follows a three-day trip to Japan, which is helping to fund the project.\n\nThe trip gave the first lady, who is traveling without her husband, a chance to soak up some of Asia\u2019s rich culture. In Japan, she visited Buddhist and Shinto shrines, and in Cambodia she traveled to Siem Reap, home to the famed Angkor Wat temple complex.\n\nAt a high school outside of Siem Reap, Mrs. Obama greeted students with a traditional gesture of hands pressed together and a head bow. She walked the compound\u2019s dirt paths and then met with 10 girls who shared tales of rising early to feed their families and help with farming before heading off on long treks to school and studying late into the night.\n\n\u201cYou are role models to the world,\u201d said Mrs. Obama, seated on a wooden school chair beside the students and Cambodia\u2019s first lady. Education brings empowerment, she added, and urged the teens to \u201cfinish your education and then follow your dreams.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse your voices to advocate for good things \u2014 whether it\u2019s more education, better health care, more freedoms, more equality,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just here in Cambodia, not just here in Siem Reap, but in the world. I hope that you all will feel empowered to do that.\u201d\n\nAs Mrs. Obama spoke, Bun Rany smiled and made no comment. However, she expressed Cambodia\u2019s \u201cfull support\u201d for the education initiative, and said the government was giving priority to female students for state scholarships.", "article_metadata": {"description": "US first lady urges Cambodian students to seek more freedoms", "title": "US first lady urges Cambodian students to seek more freedoms", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "US first lady urges Cambodian students to seek more freedoms", "title": "US first lady urges Cambodian students to seek more freedoms", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/us_first_lady_urges_cambodian_students_to_seek_more_freedoms_2/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/cambodia-us-michelle-obama.jpeg7-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US first lady urges Cambodian students to seek more freedoms", "title": "US first lady urges Cambodian students to seek more freedoms", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/cambodia-us-michelle-obama.jpeg7-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jocelyn Gecker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd41b3\"", "article_summary": "I hope that you all will feel empowered to do that.\u201dAs Mrs. Obama spoke, Bun Rany smiled and made no comment.\n\u201cYou are role models to the world,\u201d said Mrs. Obama, seated on a wooden school chair beside the students and Cambodia\u2019s first lady.\nAt a high school outside of Siem Reap, Mrs. Obama greeted students with a traditional gesture of hands pressed together and a head bow.\nHowever, she expressed Cambodia\u2019s \u201cfull support\u201d for the education initiative, and said the government was giving priority to female students for state scholarships.\nHuman rights groups praised the remarks as a rare foray into foreign affairs for a first lady."}
