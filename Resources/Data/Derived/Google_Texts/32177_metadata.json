But that doesn\u2019t work for same-sex couples reporting combined incomes, deductions and exemptions on their federal tax returns. These couples must untangle their finances on their state returns, where they are still considered single.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re adults, we\u2019re contributing to the welfare of society and yet, here\u2019s this one thing that just reaches up every year and kind of slaps us in the face,\u201d said Brian Wilbert, an Episcopal priest who lives in Oberlin, a small college town in northern Ohio.\n\nWilbert married his husband, Yorki Encalada, in 2012, at a ceremony in upstate New York. He is filing a joint federal tax return for the second time this year. But Ohio, which doesn\u2019t recognize same-sex marriages, requires the couple to file their state tax returns as if they were single.\n\n\u201cIt may not be the most burning thing,\u201d Wilbert said. \u201cBut as we think about equality and marriage equality, this is an important thing because it\u2019s part of what couples do.\u201d\n\nThe number of states that recognize same-sex marriages has grown to 37, plus the District of Columbia, since the Supreme Court struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in 2013.\n\nAfter the ruling, the IRS announced that it would recognize same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes, even if couples lived in states that did not.\n\nThe Supreme Court is scheduled hear arguments in another same-sex marriage case April 28. Advocates hope the court will compel the remaining states to recognize gay and lesbian marriages.\n\nOpponents of same-sex marriage want the court to send the issue back to the states. They note that recognition of same-sex marriage has spread largely through court orders, rather than the ballot box.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the rights of a handful of people who want to change the institution of marriage,\u201d said Phil Burress of Citizens for Community Values, an Ohio group. \u201cIt\u2019s about the will of the people.\u201d\n\nThe benefits of marriage are a mixed bag when it comes to taxes. Some couples, especially those with disparate incomes, can lower their combined tax bills by getting married. Others pay a marriage penalty.\n\nThe vast majority of married couples in the U.S. file joint federal tax returns in which they combine their incomes, exemptions, deductions and credits to calculate their tax liability. But same-sex couples are not allowed to file joint tax returns in most states that don\u2019t recognize their marriages. Instead, they have to unravel their finances and file separate state returns.\n\n\u201cSo you have this one return that would normally give you the numbers to do your state tax return, but instead you have to split all your incomes again and pretend like you\u2019re not married,\u201d said Deb L. Kinney, a partner at the law firm of Johnston, Kinney & Zulaica in San Francisco.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tax Day extra difficult for many same-sex married couples", "title": "Tax Day extra difficult for many same-sex married couples", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Tax Day extra difficult for many same-sex married couples", "title": "Tax Day extra difficult for many same-sex married couples", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/11/tax_day_extra_difficult_for_many_same_sex_married_couples/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/gay-marriage-taxes.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tax Day extra difficult for many same-sex married couples", "title": "Tax Day extra difficult for many same-sex married couples", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/gay-marriage-taxes.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Stephen Ohlemacher", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb1e\"", "article_summary": "But that doesn\u2019t work for same-sex couples reporting combined incomes, deductions and exemptions on their federal tax returns.\nBut same-sex couples are not allowed to file joint tax returns in most states that don\u2019t recognize their marriages.\nBut Ohio, which doesn\u2019t recognize same-sex marriages, requires the couple to file their state tax returns as if they were single.\nThe vast majority of married couples in the U.S. file joint federal tax returns in which they combine their incomes, exemptions, deductions and credits to calculate their tax liability.\nAfter the ruling, the IRS announced that it would recognize same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes, even if couples lived in states that did not."}
