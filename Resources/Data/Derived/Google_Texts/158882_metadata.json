Jared Huffman, D-San Rafael, announced that the Health Resources and Services Administration has awarded more than $16 million in discretionary funds to 11 health centers throughout California\u2019s North Coast.\n\n\u201cThese funds will help thousands of people get the care they need,\u201d Huffman said in a statement.\n\nSteven Siegel, executive director of Coastal Health Alliance, said, \u201cAll these health centers have a base grant that is annualized. Because of the appropriations process, we\u2019re only confirmed that we get a quarter of the money at the beginning of the year. What has happened now is that we\u2019ve received confirmation that we get the other three quarters of our money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not new money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love another $1 million.\u201d\n\nLinda Tavaszi, Marin Community Clinics\u2019 CEO, said, \u201cThis grant is the federal government\u2019s contribution to caring for patients who are at the federal poverty level.\u201d\n\nExpanded Medi-Cal eligibility due to the Affordable Care Act has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of patients receiving care at the Marin Community Clinics. In 2015, Marin Community Clinics had approximately 35,000 patients and 161,128 patient visits, including both medical and dental treatments. In 2008, before MCC began treating large numbers of dental patients, it had 51,990 patient visits.\n\nMCC has five medical clinics: two in Novato, two in San Rafael\u2019s Canal neighborhood and one in Larkspur.
