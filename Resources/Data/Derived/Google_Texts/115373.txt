One organization is trying to help the community both inside and out.

2-Serve Community Outreach hosted its 2014 Community Health Fair on Saturday at the Free Gospel Temple. Those who showed up were offered check-ups and information on how to stay healthy. Director Paris Hearn says taking care of your body is important, not just for your sake, but for your loved ones, as well. Hearn says the health fair offers a unique opportunity for participants.

"I hear a lot of people doing different things like vacation Bible school, and I thought, 'what about their health?'" Hearn says. "We talk about outside activity, but what about their health? That's one thing that's killing a lot of us. Not just drugs and gangs, but not taking care of our bodies."

2-Serve Community Outreach will also be holding a suicide and bullying detection and prevention seminar in September.
