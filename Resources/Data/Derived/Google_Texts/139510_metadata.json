I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s too late to change seats.\n\nThe guy is wearing a camouflage jacket that doesn\u2019t quite hide the bulging middle-age belly straining at the faded Patriots T-shirt underneath. He\u2019s carrying a sign that reads \u201cLike a Cruz missile, Ted will destroy ISIS\u201d on one side and \u201cCruzin West\u201d on the other, a plea for the Texas senator to pick former Florida congressman Allen West as his vice-presidential candidate. He\u2019s loudly telling everyone within earshot that we need to start a Cruz/West chant at some point and is met with approving responses from some of the people around me.\n\nI decide not to move. If the Oath Keeper or anyone else spies my reporter\u2019s notebook and asks what outlet I\u2019m with, I\u2019ll say World Net Daily and hope no one pulls out an iPhone to check.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the carnival atmosphere of a Ted Cruz event being held at Elm Street Middle School, an imposing Gothic building that, as I drove up in the dark amidst a driving rain, made me think of an insane asylum in a movie, a comparison that felt more than appropriate once I was inside. Old men in baseball caps bearing the names of military units, moms holding babies in one hand and Ted Cruz signs in the other. Three people by the stage waving flags (from left to right: American, Israeli, Gadsden). Two flat-screen TVs on either side of the stage are showing a campaign film of more cheering crowds, backed by patriotic music and conservative activist Brent Bozell talking about all the reasons he loves Ted Cruz.\n\nThis is the New Hampshire I came to find. This is the polished and professional political rally of the true believers, ecstatic in their fervor and their belief in the rightness of their cause. It\u2019s exhilarating and terrifying. As the late great Hunter S. Thompson might have said, this is the belly of the beast.\n\nCruz is often described as \u201coily,\u201d but that word doesn\u2019t really do him justice. In fact, he\u2019s so oleaginous he reminds one of the puddles covering the stained cement floor of a Jiffy Lube. It\u2019s not just a physical characteristic \u2013 though there is that; the man has a sheen about him \u2013 but also one of affect. When he strides out to a rapturous greeting from the crowd and walks along the edge of the stage slapping hands with people in the front row, it feels so studied that I can picture college-age Ted Cruz practicing this move in his Princeton dorm room.\n\nThe speech is filled with the usual bullshit that no one will call him on, even in a GOP debate, because all the candidates are trying to appeal to a base that has gone beyond reason and Earth\u2019s orbit. But it\u2019s worth rebutting a few of the lies here, if only for the benefit of future archaeologists picking through the ruins of our civilization if Ted Cruz winds up leading it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's nothing quite like a middle school auditorium positively overflowing with Cruz supporters", "title": "The special hell of a Ted Cruz rally: What it\u2019s like to spend an evening with the GOP\u2019s oiliest operator", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "There's nothing quite like a middle school auditorium positively overflowing with Cruz supporters", "title": "The special hell of a Ted Cruz rally: What it\u2019s like to spend an evening with the GOP\u2019s oiliest operator", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/06/the_special_hell_of_a_ted_cruz_rally_what_its_like_to_spend_an_evening_with_the_gops_oiliest_operator/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/ted_cruz30.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's nothing quite like a middle school auditorium positively overflowing with Cruz supporters", "title": "The special hell of a Ted Cruz rally: What it\u2019s like to spend an evening with the GOP\u2019s oiliest operator", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/ted_cruz30.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Gary Legum", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Elections 2016, GOP primary, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Old men in baseball caps bearing the names of military units, moms holding babies in one hand and Ted Cruz signs in the other.\nBut it\u2019s worth rebutting a few of the lies here, if only for the benefit of future archaeologists picking through the ruins of our civilization if Ted Cruz winds up leading it.\nTopics: Elections 2016, GOP primary, Ted Cruz, News, Politics NewsThere is a boisterous Oath Keeper leaking alcohol from every pore sitting three seats away from me in a Nashua, New Hampshire, middle school auditorium hosting a Ted Cruz town hall.\nIf the Oath Keeper or anyone else spies my reporter\u2019s notebook and asks what outlet I\u2019m with, I\u2019ll say World Net Daily and hope no one pulls out an iPhone to check.\nTwo flat-screen TVs on either side of the stage are showing a campaign film of more cheering crowds, backed by patriotic music and conservative activist Brent Bozell talking about all the reasons he loves Ted Cruz."}
