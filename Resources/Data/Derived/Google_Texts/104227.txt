In the grand tradition of celebrities wishing they had just gone with “no comment,” Jack White apologized Saturday for comments made in his recent Rolling Stone profile, in which he revived his ongoing feud with the Black Keys –and took down large swaths of the music industry in the process.

White’s original insults, as they appeared in the profile, were rabid (responded Keys drummer Patrick Carney: “I actually feel embarassed for him”):

“There are kids at school who dress like everybody else, because they don’t know what to do, and there are musicians like that, too. I’ll hear TV commercials where the music’s ripping off sounds of mine, to the point I think it’s me. Half the time, it’s the Black Keys. The other half, it’s a sound-alike song because they couldn’t license one of mine. There’s a whole world that’s totally fine with the watered-down version of the original. “Some people will hear that and say ‘Oh, Jack White thinks he’s the first person to play the blues.’ But certain acts open up a market for a certain style. Amy Winehouse: Did she invent white soul? Wearing a beehive? No. But she did something brand new and fresh, altogether as a package, and you see who’s in her wake, from the Duffys to the Lana Del Reys. Adele selling 20 million records? That would not have happened if Amy Winehouse was alive. The White Stripes did the same thing, and in our absence, you’re gonna find someone to fill that. And you get a band like the Black Keys, who said they never heard of the White Stripes? Sure.”

Bemoaning the fact that “we live in a sound bite, sensationalized age,” and in the interest of wanting “to continue the activities I have planned for the rest of my year as a musician, and not be hounded by nonsense throughout those experiences,” White penned a lengthy apology and explanation for his comments on his personal website:
