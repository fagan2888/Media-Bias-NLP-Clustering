To be clear, this \u201cit\u201d is a penis, and it bears the characteristic gleam of a condom \u2014 except there is no visible lip. The latex sheen seamlessly transitions into the matte effect of unsheathed skin.\n\nThis is a scene from Falcon Studio\u2019s \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019,\u201d allegedly the first porn film to digitally remove condoms in post-production. The performers wore protection while shooting and, through a combination of lighting and editing tricks, the rubbers were erased \u2014 for the most part. Clearly, it is an imperfect art, but in some scenes the condom is undetectable. This technological trick seems like just the solution to the acrimonious debate over mandating condoms in porn. This way, performers are protected and viewers get the rubber-free porn they demand, right? If only it were that simple.\n\nSex educator and director Tristan Taormino says this technique is unlikely to take off. \u201cThe way the porn economy is right now, I just think it\u2019s not economically feasible for most people.\u201d Sure, there are \u201cbig web companies\u201d that appear to be rolling in money, she says, but their success is a result of having a constant stream of new content. That hamster-wheel business model leaves no time for advanced post-production techniques.\n\nAxel Braun, who was recently named best director by Adult Video New for the fourth year in a row, agrees. \u201cTo do it right is extremely difficult, time consuming, and impossibly expensive,\u201d he says. It would involve an animation technique called rotoscoping, and editors would have to \u201cmatch the color, texture and wetness of the genitals\u201d \u2014 for each and every frame. \u201cGiven that a sex scene is on average 20 minutes long, and even subtracting a generous 10 minutes between oral and climax which are always condom-less, you\u2019d still have 10 minutes left,\u201d he said. \u201cAt 30 frames per second, that\u2019s 18,000 unique frames per scene, times five scenes per movie.\u201d\n\nThat amounts to 90,000 frames. \u201cWe\u2019re talking easily about one hundred thousand dollars,\u201d he says.\n\nIt appears that a simpler approach than Braun recommended was used in \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019.\u201d Chris Ward, president of Falcon Studios, a gay porn company that relies on condoms rather than testing, declined to discuss the specifics of the technique \u2014 in order to maintain a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d \u2014 but emphasized that the lighting during filming was crucial. \u201cThe amount of time in post, for shots that require it and still photography is not huge, mainly because we work on the set itself to minimize the presence of condoms.\u201d It is possible, therefore, to minimize the appearance of condoms without dropping 100K.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A porn company attempts to edit rubbers out of its final product.
