The Daily Caller is reporting that CGI, the general contractor used by CMS to build the Obamacare website, has received six additional contracts from CMS after the failures were discovered.

The company that built the failed Obamacare website received six additional contracts from the Obama administration's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services after the website's disastrous launch, The Daily Caller has learned.

According to a company spokesman, CGI Federal was awarded six additional contracts from CMS worth approximately $37 million between October 1 -- when the over $600 million Obamacare website launched -- through January 2014.

CGI Federal is the U.S. arm of the Canadian company CGI Group, and was formed in 2009 to bring CGI into the federal contracting business. The company employs Michelle Obama's Princeton classmate, and 2010 White House Christmas guest, Toni T0wnes-Whitley as a top executive.

CGI, which received the Obamacare website contract in Obama's first term, was fired from its role as prime contractor on the website in January.

But the idea that CMS, a division of Kathleen Sebelius' Department of Health and Human Services, would cancel its other pending contracts with CGI "does not reflect the relationship that CGI has with CMS," a CGI spokesman told TheDC.

CGI has "actually been awarded additional contracts since October," the spokesman said.

"Some of those might have been modifications on existing contracts" or "change orders on existing contracts" the CGI spokesman said, citing internal company information.
