I did sign up for a plan this year but terminated it when my health insurance company informed me that we can keep our plans until September 2017. I’m thankful that the company that I’m with is choosing to fight so we can keep what we have instead of forcing us into a system we do not want to be in. Either way they are still collecting premiums and still making a profit.

So why don’t I want to purchase from the exchange? First if you purchase an exchange plan you cannot cancel it with most companies by making a simple phone call. Clicking the terminate button in your exchange account is not a guarantee that the insurance company will get the memo that you do not want your insurance plan anymore. In most cases when you call the company they will say that “We cannot cancel your plan. That can only be done through the Marketplace.” Once you call the Federal Marketplace they will do what they call an Escalation of the case to inform your insurance company that you want to cancel your plan. Like you can’t speak for yourself. Then they will inform you that the process can take up to 30 days. In the meantime you are being charged for something you do not want and there is nothing you can do about it. If the escalation is not successful you will need to keep repeating this step until your issue is resolved. Which means another 30 days of pain. Depending on how long they take to resolve your issue paying the tax penalty could be a better option. In my opinion this is an unfair penalty. Wouldn’t a phone call or an email be more effective?
