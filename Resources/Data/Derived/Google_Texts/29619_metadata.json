People who want coverage will soon have another opportunity to enroll to purchase health insurance policies through federal and state marketplaces.\n\nIn the first year of the new exchanges, the government reported more than seven million people bought private plans. Just yesterday, the Obama administration lowered its estimate of how many would sign up in the second round of enrollment, from 13 million down to nine million. That comes just days after the U.S. Supreme Court said that it would hear a crucial challenge on whether some federal subsidies for coverage are legal.\n\nWe know there are lots of questions people have. So we turn right now to two who know all this very well.\n\nThey\u2019re Mary Agnes Carey of Kaiser Health News and Susan Dentzer, a health analyst for the \u201cNewsHour.\u201d\n\nGreat to have you back on the program, both of you.\n\nSo let\u2019s start first, Mary Agnes, from this word yesterday from the Obama administration. They had said \u2014 projected 13 million would be signed up by the end of next year. Now they\u2019re saying nine or a little more than that, nine million or so. Why the change?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY, Kaiser Health News: This is the difference between estimates of different agencies. The Congressional Budget Office, which is sort of the unofficial scorekeeper for Congress, had estimated 13 million would be in the exchanges.\n\nThe administration is now saying, from their estimates, as you say, are down to about 9.9 million. They think that people will enroll on a more slower basis than the Congressional Budget Office estimated. And also you have to remember that there is a variance in income. Sometimes, people qualify for the exchanges vs. the Medicaid expansion if their states expanded Medicaid.\n\nSometimes, people don\u2019t pay their health insurance premiums. Sometimes they have citizenship or immigration issues that play with that number, but basically they think it will be a slower rollout of people enrolling.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susan Dentzer, what about this other development, the Supreme Court saying that they are going to look out whether these subsidies on the federal exchanges involving, what, 36 states, could be invalidated? How much worry, how much concern is there about what that could do to health care, the health care law?\n\nSUSAN DENTZER, Health Policy Analyst: Well, there\u2019s concern.\n\nThe law \u2014 the language of the law does tie the subsidies to exchanges \u2014 quote, unquote \u2014 \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d And now the question is, does that language literally just mean state-based exchanges, or does it pertain much more broadly to the overall notion that federal \u2014 the federal exchange could step in, as it has done, and back up the states that didn\u2019t set up their own exchanges?\n\nWe will have to see how the court rules. It\u2019s important to say though that there are probably some work-arounds. Even if the Supreme Court were ultimately to rule \u2014 and, by the way, this won\u2019t happen until next year \u2014 were to rule that for some reason the language applies only to state-based exchanges, there\u2019s really nothing in the law that would prevent a state from in effect kind of outsourcing it \u2014 that back to the federal marketplace.\n\nSo we will have to see what the court\u2019s decision actually is, but it really is this question of, does this language \u2014 is it literal language about state-based exchanges or is it really more the broader intent of the law to cover all \u2014 have subsidies apply to purchases across the exchanges?\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: OK.\n\nSo with this second round of enrollment coming, we asked people around the country to submit some questions they have about the process. We have \u2014 and we some of them on video. We talked to a woman from Washington, D.C., about enrollment. Here\u2019s what she asked.\n\nCHRISTINA STURDIVANT: I\u2019m Christina Sturdivant. I\u2019m from Washington, D.C.\n\nFor the last enrollment period, I waited too long to get insurance. So, I wanted to make sure I was on top of hit the time. So, I wanted to know, when does it open and how will I have to sign up?\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Mary Agnes, what would you say?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Enrollment opens on November the 15th. But you only have three months this year, until February 15, to enroll. That\u2019s three months shorter than the six-month period they had last year.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And so it\u2019s half the time, but it starts this weekend.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Right. You can get online. You can even shop right now. We did that when we were preparing for this segment. We got on the Web site. You can look at plans, look at prices, but enrollment does begin this Saturday.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: All right. We have another question now. This is a man from California who asked about the status of the Web site.\n\nNICHOLAS ZAMBRANO: My name is Nicholas Zambrano from Hemet, California. And I\u2019m just curious to know if the Web site is going to crash like last year. Everybody tried to sign up and nobody has access.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, that has to be the question on the minds of a lot of people.\n\nSUSAN DENTZER: Clearly.\n\nWell, the government says it\u2019s cautiously optimistic that things will go much better. And, in fact, it has said that the capacity on the first day will be able to handle as many as twice as many simultaneous users as tried to sign up on the first day a year ago. So the capacity should ensure that the Web site doesn\u2019t crash with regularity.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Is that your sense as well, Mary Agnes?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: That\u2019s certainly been the case. The officials are saying that.\n\nBut one thing to keep in mind is, they talk about improvement, but not perfection It\u2019s almost giving themselves a little bit of wiggle room, but certainly you can\u2019t have a repeat of what happened a year ago.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: All right, now, this is another question. This is from an uninsured man from Colorado who is asking about affordability.\n\nRON ZITO: My name\u2019s Ron Zito. I\u2019m from Denver.\n\nI\u2019m self-employed. And for many years, I was able to afford my own insurance. It wasn\u2019t exactly cheap, but I was able to afford it. And last year, what happened was, it doubled, and I just couldn\u2019t afford it anymore. So I now am actually going without insurance.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So I guess the question here is, Mary Agnes, are those people looking for insurance likely to keep seeing these rising costs? And why are the prices so much more after the ACA than before?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Well, a lot of what \u2014 what you pay will depend on where you live.\n\nAnd one thing I\u2019m thinking, if I listen to this gentleman, is maybe go back to the Web site. Federal officials have been talking about things may be different this year. Perhaps there are more plan options that were available for him than there were last year. It\u2019s unclear whether or not he went through the process. Could he have qualified for a subsidy to get some assistance?\n\nCould he go for a plan perhaps that has a higher deductible and a lower premium? So, it\u2019s \u2014 I think it\u2019s something that maybe he should check out again and see if it works for him.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, what else?\n\nSUSAN DENTZER: Well, in quite a number of states, actually, the premiums for even the silver plan, which is the second lowest-cost type of plan, are actually lower than they were last year.\n\nSome states, they are a little bit higher, 5 percent, in some states even more. I think, more broadly, people should keep in mind, especially if they\u2019re thinking not just comparing this year the last year, but this year to what they had before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, the coverage by and large is broader. The annual limits have been done away with of payout. The lifetime limits have been done away with. The essential benefits are now in place.\n\nSo people have to think about the whole breadth of their coverage, not just the premium.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: All right. Final question for today \u2014 and, by the, we\u2019re going to continue this segment tomorrow \u2014 but we talked to a woman from Delaware and it was \u2014 and her question was about employer-based coverage.\n\nCAROLINE MANUEL: My name is Carolyn Manuel. And I\u2019m from Delaware.\n\nMy question is \u2014 I have employer-based insurance, but why are many co-pays going up if this is the Affordable Care Act?\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Mary Agnes?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: The trend in the employer market has been to shift more of the cost to workers, to increase their share of the premium, their co-pays and deductibles. This was happening separately from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd I think a lot people that see a price \u2014 help with the price of health insurance, for example, are those on the individual market, people who are purchasing their own health insurance. So people in the employer market may not see the same sort of effect on their health insurance as you might as if you bought your own health insurance and maybe couldn\u2019t afford it before and can get it now.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, what would you add?\n\nSUSAN DENTZER: It\u2019s a big law, but, as Mary Agnes says, it doesn\u2019t pertain to every aspect of health insurance.\n\nAnd to the degree that employers can decide their level of coverage, they have a lot of latitude still to decide what it is they want in their health insurance plans, and specifically what share of that they want employees to pick up.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: All right, a lot of questions. And we are going to continue this conversation tomorrow as we count down the days to the actual beginning of the second enrollment period.\n\nSusan Dentzer, Mary Agnes Carey, thank you.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Thank you.\n\nSUSAN DENTZER: Great to be with you, Judy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans who don\u2019t have health care coverage will have another chance to sign up under open enrollment.
