Sometimes, that\u2019s because they got incorrect or incomplete information from their insurer or health-care provider. Sometimes, it\u2019s because a physician has multiple offices, and not all are in network, as in Durocher\u2019s case. Sometimes, it\u2019s because a participating hospital relies on out-of-network doctors, including emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists and radiologists.\n\nConsumer advocates say the sheer scope of such problems undermine promises made by proponents of the Affordable Care Act that the law would protect against medical bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair and probably not legal that consumers be left holding the bag when an out-of-network doctor treats them,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. Jost said it\u2019s a different matter if a consumer knowingly chooses an out-of-network doctor.\n\nDurocher learned only after getting her surgeon\u2019s bill that just one of his two offices participated in her plan and she had chosen the wrong one. She said the doctor\u2019s staff later insisted that they had raised the issue during her initial consultation, but she doesn\u2019t recall that, possibly because she was distracted by her cancer diagnosis.\n\nAdding insult to injury, insurers are not required to count out-of-network charges toward the federal health law\u2019s annual limit on how much of their medical costs patients can be asked to pay out of their own pockets.\n\nEfforts by doctors, hospitals and other health providers to charge patients for bills not covered by their insurers are called \u201cbalance billing.\u201d The problem predates the federal health law and has long been among the top complaints filed with state insurance regulators.\n\nBecause the issue is complex and pits powerful rivals against one another\u2014among them, hospitals, doctors and insurers\u2014relatively few states have addressed it. What laws do exist are generally limited to specific situations, such as emergency room care, or certain types of insurance plans, such as HMOs.\n\nThe federal health law largely sidesteps the issue as well. It says insurers must include coverage for emergency care and not charge policyholders higher copayments for ER services at non-network hospitals, because patients can\u2019t always choose where they go. While the insurer will pay a portion of the bill, in such cases, doctors or hospitals may still bill patients for the difference between that payment and their own charges.\n\nThat means that in spite of having insurance, a consumer involved in a car wreck and taken to a non-network hospital might receive additional bills, not just from the hospital, but from the radiologist who read his X-rays, the surgeon who repaired his broken leg and the laboratory that processed his blood tests.\n\nNetworks Get Narrower\n\nAdvocates believe a growing number of consumers are vulnerable to balance billing as insurance networks grow smaller in the bid to hold down costs.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Instead, the bills must be settled in arbitration between the providers and the insurance companies.\n\nCost Trade-Offs\n\nInsurers defend the move to smaller networks of doctors and hospitals as a way to provide the low-cost plans that consumers say they want. Since insurers can no longer reject enrollees with health problems or charge them more, the plans are using the tools left to them to reduce costs.\n\nIf regulators required them to fully cover charges by out-of-network doctors, that could reduce \u201cincentives for providers to participate in networks\u201d and make it harder to have adequate networks, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the insurers\u2019 trade group, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association wrote in a joint letter to the NAIC.\n\nIt would also raise premiums.\n\nInstead, AHIP says, states could require out-of-network doctors to accept a benchmark payment from insurers, perhaps what Medicare pays, rather than balance billing patients.\n\nPhysicians, meanwhile, blame insurers for inadequate networks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018free\u2019 anywhere,\u201d said Lee Spangler, vice president of medical economics with the Texas Medical Association. \u201cYou either pay for the coverage through premiums, or you pay for service when you receive it.\u201d\n\nDoctors choose whether to balance bill, he added\u2014and some don\u2019t.\n\nBut he noted that patients \u201chave received professional services in the expectation that they will get alleviation of what ailed them, and the physicians provided it in the expectation they would be paid. There\u2019s no in between,\u201d Spangler said.\n\nFor patients like Durocher, who got billed even after doing everything she was told, the only recourse is to negotiate with the physician or hospital to ask them to lower or drop the charges.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Google, Tech &amp; Health", "publicationDate": 201502171015, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/tech-and-health", "description": "Insurance companies are finding new ways to screw customers\u2014undermining promises made by Obamacare boosters that the law would protect against medical bankruptcy.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "How Insurers Can Hit You With $10,000 Health Care BillsEven When You're Covered", "tags": "syndication:syndication-google,topic:sci-tech/science", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"How Insurers Can Hit You With $10,000 Health Care Bills\u2014Even When You\\\\u0027re Covered\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/17/how-insurers-can-hit-you-with-10-000-health-care-bills-even-when-you-re-covered.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/17/how-insurers-can-hit-you-with-10-000-health-care-bills-even-when-you-re-covered/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47472270.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/17/how-insurers-can-hit-you-with-10-000-health-care-bills-even-when-you-re-covered\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-17T10:15:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Tech + Health\",\"author\":\"Kaiser Health News\",\"tags\":[\"syndication-google\",\"science\"]}", "news_keywords": "Google, Tech Health", "sectionTaxanomies": "tech-and-health", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Kaiser Health News", "article": {"section": "science", "published_time": "2015-02-17T10:15:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/kaiser-health-newshtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/17/how-insurers-can-hit-you-with-10-000-health-care-bills-even-when-you-re-covered", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Insurance companies are finding new ways to screw customers\u2014undermining promises made by Obamacare boosters that the law would protect against medical bankruptcy.", "title": "How Insurers Can Hit You With $10,000 Health Care Bills\u2014Even When You're Covered", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/17/how-insurers-can-hit-you-with-10-000-health-care-bills-even-when-you-re-covered.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/17/how-insurers-can-hit-you-with-10-000-health-care-bills-even-when-you-re-covered/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1424168117151.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/k/kaiser-health-news", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb9d1\"", "article_summary": "Sometimes, it\u2019s because a participating hospital relies on out-of-network doctors, including emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists and radiologists.\nBecause the issue is complex and pits powerful rivals against one another\u2014among them, hospitals, doctors and insurers\u2014relatively few states have addressed it.\nNAIC\u2019S current draft does not directly address the issue of balance billing and consumer efforts have drawn sharp opposition from insurers, hospitals and doctors.\nWhat laws do exist are generally limited to specific situations, such as emergency room care, or certain types of insurance plans, such as HMOs.\nInstead, AHIP says, states could require out-of-network doctors to accept a benchmark payment from insurers, perhaps what Medicare pays, rather than balance billing patients."}
