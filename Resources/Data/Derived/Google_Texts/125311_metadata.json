Its elusive leadership is flush with financial support from illicit donations and black-market oil sales.\n\n\u201cWe recognize the hard work that remains to be done,\u201d Kerry told the gathering at NATO headquarters, which hosted what was, to date, the largest meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the Islamic State. \u201cOur commitment will be measured most likely in years, but our efforts are already having a significant impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will engage in this campaign for as long as it takes to prevail,\u201d the top U.S. diplomat said.\n\nKerry also met privately with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who asked for \u201ca lot of support to be able to crush Daesh\u201d \u2014 the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re the only country in the Middle East who is really fighting Daesh on the ground,\u201d al-Abadi said.\n\nWhile at NATO, the Iraqi leader announced his country was submitting a formal request to the alliance to help improve its military capacities, NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu said. The request will have to be reviewed by representatives of NATO\u2019s 28 member nations, she said.\n\n\u201cAnything that NATO might do in support of Iraq\u2019s defense-capacity building would need to be complementary to the considerable efforts already undertaken by the U.S.-led coalition and individual NATO allies,\u201d Lungescu said.\n\nSince Aug. 8 \u2014 nearly two months after militants seized control of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city \u2014 the U.S. and allies have launched more than 1,000 airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Kerry said the attacks have greatly hampered the insurgency, and cited training missions and equipment being supplied by other nations that have joined the coalition since it was created less than three months ago.\n\nDiplomats acknowledged the effort was slow to start, and one senior U.S. official described Wednesday\u2019s meeting as the \u201cend of the beginning\u201d of the global coalition\u2019s push to degrade the militancy.\n\n\u201cWe have to build a very strong partnership,\u201d said European Union policy chief Federica Mogherini. \u201cThe challenge we are facing is not only a challenge for the Middle East but a challenge for the whole world.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the Pentagon said Iran had launched airstrikes against Islamic State forces in eastern Iraq. The U.S. has not invited Iran to join the coalition fighting the militants and Iran has said it would not join in any case.\n\nBut al-Abadi told reporters Wednesday, \u201cI\u2019m not aware there were Iranian airstrikes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid they have a role in that? That\u2019s news for me,\u201d al-Abadi said when asked if Iran coordinated with or notified officials in Baghdad before launching air attacks against militants in Iraq. He twice repeated that he was unaware of Iranian airstrikes in Iraq.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BRUSSELS \u2014 A global fight against Islamic State militants will likely take years to fully succeed, but nations are prepared to engage \"for as long as it takes\" to defeat the bloody insurgency, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday.", "pubdate": 20141203, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "BRUSSELS \u2014 A global fight against Islamic State militants will likely take years to fully succeed, but nations are prepared to engage \"for as long as it takes\" to defeat the bloody insurgency, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday.", "title": "Diplomats worldwide target Islamic State militants", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/459869584.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/diplomats-worldwide-target-islamic-state-militants/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "BRUSSELS \u2014 A global fight against Islamic State militants will likely take years to fully succeed, but nations are prepared to engage \"for as long as it takes\" to defeat the bloody insurgency, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday.", "title": "Diplomats worldwide target Islamic State militants", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/459869584.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "John Kerry"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "islamic state group, John Kerry"}, "article_summary": "BRUSSELS \u2014 A global fight against Islamic State militants will likely take years to fully succeed, but nations are prepared to engage \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d to defeat the bloody insurgency, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday.\nSince Aug. 8 \u2014 nearly two months after militants seized control of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city \u2014 the U.S. and allies have launched more than 1,000 airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\nKerry also met privately with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who asked for \u201ca lot of support to be able to crush Daesh\u201d \u2014 the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.\nThe U.S. has not invited Iran to join the coalition fighting the militants and Iran has said it would not join in any case.\nNearly a year after the Islamic State overran key cities in western Iraq, diplomats from more than 60 counties and international organizations gathered in Brussels to plot a way forward against what has since become one of the world\u2019s worst terror threats."}
