Insurance companies are sending their own letters to inform customers of any changes in their benefits. Open enrollment starts Nov. 15.\n\n\u201cThe great news is that most customers won\u2019t need to take further action if they like the health plan they had last year,\u201d said Richard Onizuka, chief executive officer for the exchange, in a press release.\n\nRoughly 100,000 of the exchange\u2019s 147,000 customers will potentially be eligible for automatic renewals.\n\nBut while auto-renewal is easy, it might not be the best option for everyone. The number of plans available is almost doubling to 90 health plans from 10 insurers sold on the exchange for next year. That compares with 46 plans from eight insurance companies for coverage in 2014.\n\nConsumers need to carefully consider their health-insurance options. In the first round of sign-ups, some people may have chosen plans with the lowest monthly premiums, but been surprised that they had to pay high deductibles out of their own pockets before insurance coverage kicked in for many services.\n\n\u201cThe cost is not just what you pay each month for your premium,\u201d warned Michael Marchand, spokesman for the exchange.\n\nThe exchange will try to do more to educate consumers about health-care terminology and the cost tradeoffs, Marchand said.\n\nCriteria for auto-renewal include:\n\n\u2014 The customer\u2019s plan must be renewed for 2015.\n\n\u2014 They need to have given the exchange permission to check their eligibility for tax credits.\n\n\u2014 They must still qualify for coverage based on income level, household size, residency and citizenship status.\n\nLast year some consumers around the country were upset over notices that their insurance was being canceled because it didn\u2019t provide a minimum level of benefits required by the Affordable Care Act. They protested the cancellations, noting that President Obama, when he was promoting the ACA, said that people who liked their insurance could keep it.\n\nIn response, some states allowed insurance companies to resuscitate canceled plans, even those with benefits that were too skimpy to meet ACA rules.\n\nWashington Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler decided not to revive the discontinued plans. That means that other than exempt \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans that predate the ACA, individual plans providing coverage in 2014 met the new rules so they won\u2019t need to be canceled.\n\n\u201cWe will not have that issue this year,\u201d said Stephanie Marquis, spokeswoman for the Office of the Insurance Commissioner.\n\nInsurance carriers can decide to change or discontinue plans for other reasons.\n\nPlans sold through the Washington Healthplanfinder exchange are eligible for tax benefits based on one\u2019s income. Plans that are rated at the \u201csilver\u201d level, meaning they have roughly mid-level benefits, can also qualify for lower charges for deductibles and other medical costs that are passed along to consumers.\n\nWhile Healthplanfinder has been more successful than many other U.S. marketplaces, the site has been plagued by glitches where consumers pay their premiums to the exchange, but the money isn\u2019t transferred to the insurance companies and it appears they don\u2019t have coverage. That has created problems for patients, doctors and insurance companies.\n\nSince the exchange launched in October last year, some 24,000 accounts have had payment issues. The number of accounts with problems shrank to 1,300 earlier this month.\n\n\u201cWe have made substantial progress on resolving these issues,\u201d said Brad Finnegan, associate director of operations with the exchange. State officials said they intend to fix the remaining problem accounts before the Nov. 15 launch of the next enrollment period.\n\nCustomers have the option of signing up for their insurance through Healthplanfinder, but rather than making their premium payments to the exchange, they can send them directly to their insurance company.\n\nThey can also bypass the exchange and shop for insurance directly through brokers or insurance companies, but only plans bought through the exchange are eligible for tax benefits.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "Most Washington residents who bought individual health insurance through the state's marketplace will be able to automatically renew their coverage for 2105 without taking any additional steps.
