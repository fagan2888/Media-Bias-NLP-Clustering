However, the plan is contingent upon the results of a traffic study being conducted by the developer.\n\nCommissioners expressed concerns about an egress from the property leading traffic onto Highway 31, especially since it is the same area where a fatal motorcycle accident occurred several years ago.\n\nCity Engineer Jerome Dempsey also said the developer should have a lane that allows right turns into the property from Highway 31 but not right turns out of the property onto Highway 31 on the final plats.\n\nTheo Stone with LaCrew Engineering said he expects the traffic study to be complete before the next phase of the development comes before the planning commission. He said the issue is Highway 31 is \u201cnot functioning now\u201d as it should traffic-wise.\n\nAlderman Jonathan Duda said if traffic on the road is a \u201cpreexisting condition,\u201d the question is whether the city or the developer is responsible for alleviating traffic issues around the Wilkes property.\n\nThe plan is to start construction in August on the development, Stone said.\n\nThe board also voted unanimously to approve the site plan for a new Taco Bell on Port Royal Road, and then voted 4-0-1, with Alderman Jonathan Duda abstaining, on the building design for the property. Duda abstained against the vote because he doesn\u2019t feel the clematis purple proposed for the facade of the building fits in with the city\u2019s \u201ccommunity character.\u201d\n\nHarold Thompson, who represented the developer, said the developer approached Taco Bell corporate regarding the color, but corporate officials would not change the plan because they felt the purple color is consistent with their brand. He said the building currently proposed already deviates from the stucco structure and elevation Taco Bell is requiring of all new storefronts.\n\n\u201cWe believe we have made changes to comply with the city,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt is not an option to change the color.\u201d\n\nThompson said the purple color may also not appear as strongly in real life as it has on renderings of the structure.\n\nIN OTHER BUSINESS\n\nThe planning commission voted unanimously to accept the dedication of two rights-of-way in the Cherry Grove Addition and Autumn Ridge subdivisions and to reduce the performance agreement for the Crossings South.\n\nAssistant City Administrator Dan Allen said the city has inspected the water, sewer and stormwater lines installed by the Crossings South developers. The release of funds from the city is needed by the developer to pay contractors and so further work on the site can proceed, Allen said. Crossings South is the planned home to the new Carmike Cinemas and Longhorn Steakhouse.\n\nThe board voted 4-0-1, with Duda abstaining because he is a church member, to approve a minor change to the site plan for the Church of the Nativity to be constructed on Buckner Lane.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new fast food restaurant and a new commercial development featuring a Marshalls and Aldi are one step closer to calling Spring Hill their new home.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "KATE COIL kcoil@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "A new fast food restaurant and a new commercial development featuring a Marshalls and Aldi are one step closer to calling Spring Hill their new home.", "title": "Commission approves fast food restaurant, commercial complex", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/commission-approves-fast-food-restaurant-commercial-complex", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_tacobell_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/commission-approves-fast-food-restaurant-commercial-complex", "title": "Commission approves fast food restaurant, commercial complex", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=885786", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=885786", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,Local News,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-11T18:41:17-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7e9\"", "article_summary": "He said the issue is Highway 31 is \u201cnot functioning now\u201d as it should traffic-wise.\nA new fast food restaurant and a new commercial development featuring a Marshalls and Aldi are one step closer to calling Spring Hill their new home.\nCommissioners expressed concerns about an egress from the property leading traffic onto Highway 31, especially since it is the same area where a fatal motorcycle accident occurred several years ago.\nHowever, the plan is contingent upon the results of a traffic study being conducted by the developer.\nCity Engineer Jerome Dempsey also said the developer should have a lane that allows right turns into the property from Highway 31 but not right turns out of the property onto Highway 31 on the final plats."}
