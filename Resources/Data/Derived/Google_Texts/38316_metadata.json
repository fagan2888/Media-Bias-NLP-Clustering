The young were alienated, the campuses aflame.\n\nLippmann endorsed Richard Nixon.\n\nFor 40 years, no unabashed liberal would be elected president.\n\nJimmy Carter won one term by presenting himself as a born-again Christian from Georgia, a peanut farmer, Naval Academy graduate and nuclear engineer. Bill Clinton ran as a centrist.\n\nSo toxic had the term \u201cliberal\u201d become that liberals dropped it and had themselves rebaptized as \u201cprogressives.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama, however, ran unapologetically as a man of the left. An opponent of the Iraq war, he had compiled a voting record to the left of Bernie Sanders, the socialist senator from Vermont.\n\nAnd Obama proudly placed his signature achievement, Obamacare, right alongside, and in the tradition of, liberal giants FDR and LBJ.\n\nThis is the new progressivism of the 21st century, Obama was saying, and I the transformational figure who will usher in the post-Reagan era. Where Clinton failed, I will succeed.\n\nBut now that Obamacare is coming to be perceived as a political catastrophe, not only does it threaten Obama\u2019s place in history, it could invalidate, indeed, eviscerate the defining idea of the Democratic Party itself.\n\nFor Democrats are the Party of Government. They believe that government is more nobly motivated than a private sector that runs on self-interest and the profit motive, and that government can achieve goals private enterprise could never accomplish.\n\nTo liberals, government is us, the personification of the nation.\n\nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicare and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are monuments to this belief. So, too, are the world wars fought and won under liberal presidents Woodrow Wilson and FDR.\n\nIt was 1968, the Tet Offensive, the assassinations, the urban riots, the campus anarchy, the smash-up of the Democratic Party in the streets of Chicago that caused the national recoil from liberalism that lasted for 40 years.\n\nNow consider what the rollout of Obamacare is doing, not only to this president and his administration, but also to the idea that government has the solution to America\u2019s problems.\n\nThough they had as long as World War II to get it done, Obama\u2019s crowd could not even produce a working website. Now we learn the White House was alerted to the website problems in March but plunged ahead.\n\nObama\u2019s reputation for competence has been shredded and, so, too, has his reputation for truthfulness.\n\nWith millions losing their health insurance because of Obamacare mandates, we learn that Obama and his team knew this was inevitable, even as they reassured us, \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan. Period.\u201d\n\nThe brutal truth: Our president got his legacy program passed by deceiving the American people in a giant swindle.\n\nHillarycare cost the Democrats the House in 1994. Obamacare, the love child of Hillarycare, could cost Democrats the Senate in 2014.\n\nBut what makes this a disaster not just for a party but a philosophy is that Obamacare is liberalism incarnate. It is premised on the idea that progressives, starting from scratch, can redesign a health care system, 16 percent of the economy, and make it more fair, more just and more efficient for us all.\n\nObamacare was an act of hubris by an administration of talking heads most of whom never ran anything in their lives.
