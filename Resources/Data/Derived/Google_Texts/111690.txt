This 18 minute long video deconstructs nearly every single lie told about President Obama's signature piece of legislation from the time Obamacare was signed into law in 2010 until now. Everything from doctors "supporting" the Affordable Care Act to the false promise of keeping health insurance plans under the law is covered. It's a must watch and worth every minute of your time.

As this video makes clear, nearly every part of Obamacare was sold on a lie.
