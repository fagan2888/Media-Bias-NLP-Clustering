Security Council, requested by Russia, was the first focusing on the humanitarian crisis sparked by the country\u2019s civil war.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nYemen\u2019s conflict pits the government, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, against Shiite rebels known as Houthis, allied with a former president. The Houthis took over the capital Sanaa in September 2014, and the Saudi-led coalition began airstrikes against the Houthis in March 2015. Al-Qaida militants, southern separatists, and other militants have capitalized on the chaos of the civil war.\n\nO\u2019Brien said he is \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about increasing restrictions on humanitarian access and deliveries, and he blamed all parties.\n\nHe said the Houthis and their allies are inconsistent in allowing access to areas they control, noting that over the past week some U.N. agencies were given approvals but others were denied for missions to Ibb, Taiz and Saada. He said aid deliveries are continuing in areas where Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula is present, but movement \u201cis extremely challenging and dangerous.\u201d He said access to northern governorates, where needs are among the most severe, is challenging because of coalition airstrikes and fighting, especially along the Saudi border.\n\nO\u2019Brien said recent communications from Saudi Arabia on the safety of humanitarian workers in Houthi-controlled areas have \u201cimpacted the humanitarian community\u2019s planning, causing delays to important missions over the past two weeks.\u201d\n\nThis follows Saudi Arabia\u2019s denial of entry to the U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator on Jan. 17, and the diversion of a ship chartered by the U.N. World Food Program to bring humanitarian supplies from Djibouti to the Yemen port of Hodeidah to the Saudi port of Jizan on Feb. 11 by coalition forces.\n\nA Saudi note dated Feb. 5 and obtained by The Associated Press advised international organizations and aid agencies \u201cto move any offices and staff they may have in regions where the Houthi militia and their supporters are active and in areas where there are military operations.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien responded on Feb. 7 that the humanitarian community was delivering life-saving assistance and would continue to do so across Yemen, \u201cimpartially and on the basis of need.\u201d\n\nThe Saudis responded the following day saying the coalition\u2019s request \u201cis consistent with its obligations under international humanitarian law and, in no way, can be misinterpreted to indicate any hindrance to humanitarian access and the delivery of humanitarian assistance in Yemen.\u201d\n\nPhilippe Bolopion, deputy director for global advocacy at Human Rights Watch, said the Saudi warning, \u201cgiven the coalition\u2019s track record of violations of the laws of war,\u201d could be constructed as a threat to humanitarian workers in Houthi areas.\n\n\u201cCoalition members should be under no illusion that this warning absolves them of their obligation to distinguish between civilian and military objects, and to protect humanitarian personnel and facilities from attack,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Brien urged the Security Council to demand that all combatants facilitate unconditional humanitarian access to all parts of Yemen and to take greater measures to protect civilians.\n\nHe also urged donors to urgently support an appeal to be launched in two days for $1.8 billion for critical needs in Yemen.\n\nThe Security Council urged donors to be generous and urged all parties to fulfill their obligations under international humanitarian law, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and commercial goods including fuel for civilian purpose to all parts of Yemen, and \u201censure rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 35,000 casualties since March 2015 including over 6,000 deaths;
