But where there is discipline, there is hope.\n\nChef Huda, a personal chef and CEO/executive chef of culinary company Pretty and Delicious, says, \u201cEating healthy isn\u2019t about giving up everything that you love, but about making better decisions.\u201d As an ambassador for the American Heart Association, she offers a few of her tips for making delicious, health-conscious meals during the holidays and beyond:\n\nUse low-fat cheese and milk for that savory macaroni and cheese. Or use whole-grain, multigrain, gluten-free or vegetable noodles.\n\nInstead of the brown sugar and marshmallows for the yams, roast a sweet potato.\n\nSeason greens with smoked turkey, herbs, garlic or onions.\n\nTeach children wise eating habits. Take them to the grocery store or the farmer\u2019s market to help select foods. Google types of veggies with them to include in meals. Also, let them help with preparation by tearing lettuce or snapping the green beans.\n\nTeach children how to cook healthy. Chef Huda\u2019s 7-year-old nephew, Dest\u2019n Montague, is often by her side. One of his favorites? Crispy kale, a substitute for chips. Just break kale leaves into chip-size pieces, drizzle with olive oil and bake at 425 degrees until crispy (10-15 minutes). You can even use dip with them!\n\nFor holiday parties and receptions, choose chicken breast and veggie skewers for appetizers. Fresh fruit with dark chocolate is a healthy favorite for the sweet tooth.\n\nLimit the alcohol and choose low-calorie drinks such as sparkling water, unsweetened tea or diet beverages.\n\n>> Get discounts on health services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nThere are so many easy ways to make food healthier, Chef Huda says. \u201cJust use your imagination and you don\u2019t have to give up the flavors that you love.\u201d\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Fritz Photographics\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Macaroni and cheese, candied yams, salty hams and tons of sugary desserts.
