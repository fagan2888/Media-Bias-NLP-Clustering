Beat the Chargers in San Diego and the Broncos win their fourth AFC West Division title in four years.

Never mind four division titles during the four-year reign of John Elway and John Fox. It also would be 4-of-4 for Chris Harris, Von Miller, Orlando Franklin, Rahim Moore, Julius Thomas, Nate Irving, Quinton Carter, Virgil Green, Tony Carter and Manny Ramirez.

All were picked up by the Broncos in 2011. Beat San Diego and the class of 2011 — headed by Elway the general manager and Fox the head coach — will have known nothing short of a division title.

“It would be a great accomplishment,” Moore said. “But we’ve got to get ready for San Diego. The Chargers almost won the division from us last year. If you’re not ready, the Chargers can embarrass you.”

Beat San Diego and the Broncos would be 11-3 with two games to go. San Diego would be 8-6. Kansas City will be either 8-6 or 7-7.

“Any time you get an accomplishment,” Moore said, “the first thing you want to do is accomplish more.”
