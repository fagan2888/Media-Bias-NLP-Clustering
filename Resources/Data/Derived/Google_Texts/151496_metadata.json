This drives no shortage of talk of just where the next generation of drivers will come from. While the answer of why the population is getting older may do well to include a recognition of the maturity that comes with age and the risk-aversion businesses are feeling more and more of these days, suffice it to say the whole question of how to attract the younger folks to the work of driving truck is one people are talking about \u2014 a lot.\n\nFollowing the Conversion Interactive/Truckload Carriers Association recruiting and retention conference a couple weeks back now, an attendee of the conference wrote me with some observations he\u2019d made talking to the twenty-somethings at the carrier he works for.\n\nThe source is a longtime driver now working in retention at a carrier of size \u2014 not the biggest by far, but not the smallest, either. After he returned from the conference, he says, he and colleagues engaged in a little bit of head-scratching over the difficulties the industry writ large has had bringing the next generation into the business of driving truck. He put the question of why twenty-somethings seemingly weren\u2019t interested in being truck drivers to a twenty-something in a nondriving role at the company, Bruce Jenkins. Though you run into problems of validity when making broad generalizations about any \u201cgeneration\u201d of people, Jenkins\u2019 response was thorough, to say the least, candid, and touched on a myriad of issues. You can read it for yourself below. And: What do you think? Is the writer on to something?\n\nWhy aren\u2019t twenty-somethings interested in truck driving?\n\nWe are a generation of leisure. Not just leisure, but laziness. There is no piece of information we can\u2019t access in the palm of our hands, and there is no product we can\u2019t acquire by going to a single building that has every single product we could need on a regular basis. Most of us have no idea how these products reach their destination and do not care. Everything is done for us. No one my age knows about trucking. We are a generation of consumers \u2014 not suppliers. We have no idea what it takes to make our leisurely lives possible.\n\nAn occupation in truck driving is not generally considered a successful achievement and has a lot of bad stigma. We grew up with stories of truck driving being dangerous and dirty. We grew up being told to go to college before we even knew the word education. If you don\u2019t continue your education you cannot be successful. This is the idea we grew up with. And it\u2019s partially true \u2014 300 million people is a lot of competition, and even the most basic jobs now require post-grade-school education.\n\nTruck driving is associated with long, lonely days and poor hygiene and health.\n\nOur parents grew up knowing local police, while we avoid law enforcement whenever possible. This makes driving a vehicle that requires this type of interaction unappealing.\n\nDriving sucks. When have you ever made it through a day without hearing about traffic, accidents, or commutes?\n\nWe are over-sheltered and spoiled and that doesn\u2019t end when we leave the nest. Our parents were out of the house at 18 and struggled to make life work for them\u2013 they don\u2019t want to do that to their kids.\n\nTrucking is hard and we don\u2019t have to work hard. We have parents and a government that will give us everything we claim we can\u2019t achieve on our own. Don\u2019t want to work? Unemployment. Can\u2019t afford an apartment? Your parents want you to stay home. Can\u2019t pay your phone bill? That\u2019s OK because your parents are probably paying it anyway. Don\u2019t want to work to raise your kids? Government support literally pays out more money than you could make at a 40-hour job, covers your child care, and they will actually tell you that at the office where you get it.\n\nWhat would it take to get our generation to want to be truck drivers?\n\nCompete. You are not just competing with other trucking companies; you are competing with every job obtainable by a potential employee with the same skill level. Retail, fast food, beverage/hospitality, maintenance, admin. Why is driving a truck better than working in a climate-controlled environment where I can be clean and sociable, while working fewer hours?\n\nAdvertising. Our generation does not know anything at all about truck driving. Not its requirements, lifestyle, or importance. Advertising that you need truck drivers with CDLA or military experience will make anyone under 30 years old pass by. My generation does not know what \u201cdedicated miles\u201d and \u201chome time\u201d mean. Most ads cater to drivers that are already drivers. If I didn\u2019t have the confidence that I have, I would look at these signs and ads and see \u201cyou cannot do this.\u201d Advertise in malls, on light rail, at sports events, entertainment venues \u2014 places our generation frequents. Advertise in color, with real incentives that matter to a generation that generally doesn\u2019t believe it can accomplish anything without college experience.\n\nRecruiting. It looks to me like the industry is just sitting around waiting for drivers to show up. When they do go out and seek drivers, they are looking for veterans and old-school drivers. I don\u2019t see young people being actively recruited.\n\nTechnology. No one today has to go without current tech. We live in an age where there is a new iPhone every six months and the idea that old tech is taboo. To an extent, it is. Technology today becomes outdated almost as soon as it is introduced to the public. Up-to-date technology not only shows, but is required, for success. Show off what we have and why it matters to them and not just to the industry.\n\nMoney. We are all in debt. Or just flat-out poor. Cents per mile doesn\u2019t mean anything to us. If I see \u201c50 cents per mile,\u201d all I can think is how much I have to drive and the equation I have to do in my head to know how much money I can make. If I see $1,000 a week, I\u2019m ready to get dirty. Seeing a new-hire bonus is a good incentive, but seeing a scheduled payout over several months (for a job I\u2019m not even sure I can do) is not attractive.\n\nPrograms to acquire a CDL. There are affordable programs and trade schools that actively advertise how easy it can be for young people to become nurses, practitioners, and technicians (granted they care little for the success of their students and more about bringing in money). My generation cannot even afford to get a class C license, let alone purchase a dependable vehicle. We can\u2019t afford the money or the time. Acquiring the skills for a new profession means taking time away from when you need to be working to pay your bills. No one wants to study for tests, especially on their own. It would be a good idea to provide financial support or reimbursements for licensing. In-house prep classes with a low student-teacher ratio. The equipment to accommodate the number of students in each class.\n\nIf the industry is losing our generation, it should invest in education. Take responsibility and guide them to become what is needed. Mentoring and training dependable drivers from the beginning is a lot easier than teaching old dogs new tricks.\n\nBenefits. I never see or hear anything about the benefits, rewards, or positive aspects of truck driving. Four out of five people I know haven\u2019t had insurance for years and are doing everything they can to avoid the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Insurance policies are hard to understand, acquire and pay for. Let people know that we offer benefits and a team that can help them understand and process them. Let people know what\u2019s good about the industry and why they want to be a part of it.\n\nImage. Show your target group something that is relatable. I don\u2019t see anyone my age driving a truck. I don\u2019t see anyone my age in trucking ads. I don\u2019t see anyone my age in trucking news or politics. I don\u2019t see anyone my age involved in this industry, anywhere, except in an office. Our generation either went to college and doesn\u2019t want a truck-driving career, or they didn\u2019t go to college and don\u2019t see truck driving as something they can do. Show interest, don\u2019t just expect it. I don\u2019t know how many times I have mentioned an interest in obtaining a CDL or just learning about driving and expanding my knowledge \u2014 even those of us who are interested are passed by.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A twenty-something attempts a (well-considered, lengthy) answers to the question of why his generation seemingly isn't interested in truck driving, by and large.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Overdrive", "og": {"site_name": "Overdrive", "description": "A twenty-something attempts a (well-considered, lengthy) answers to the question of why his generation seemingly isn\u2019t interested in truck driving, by and large.", "title": "Trucking \u2014 or not \u2014 with the twenty-somethings", "url": "http://www.overdriveonline.com/trucking-or-not-with-the-twenty-somethings/", "image": "http://blogsdir.cms.rrcdn.com/8/files/2015/02/DSC_0057-800x455-420x239.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OverdriveUpdate", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.4.3", "fb": {"pages": 201594073189}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-17T20:48:04-06:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-19T18:12:36-06:00"}, "google-site-verification": "WW2QzrYsbQWBq40KQCalege4Ob8OQq4Xr9lN_5tT-ng", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "advertising, age, demographics, next generation, recruiting, retention, twenty-somethings, young people"}, "article_summary": "He put the question of why twenty-somethings seemingly weren\u2019t interested in being truck drivers to a twenty-something in a nondriving role at the company, Bruce Jenkins.\nWhy aren\u2019t twenty-somethings interested in truck driving?\nAn occupation in truck driving is not generally considered a successful achievement and has a lot of bad stigma.\nAdvertising that you need truck drivers with CDLA or military experience will make anyone under 30 years old pass by.\nI don\u2019t see anyone my age in trucking news or politics."}
