I find it deeply disturbing that we are going in that direction.\u201d\n\nAt that, the audience in a packed Benedict Music Tent on the Aspen Institute campus applauded Clinton, who was interviewed by Aspen Institute President and CEO Walter Isaacson.\n\nHe mainly steered the discussion to parts of Clinton\u2019s best-selling book, \u201cHard Choices,\u201d and only pressed her gently on her presidential ambitions.\n\nClinton offered no fresh insights on the 2016 race, but the Aspen crowd was buzzing after her interview, in which her multiple references to \u201chard choices\u201d sounded like a campaign theme. And her remarks in Aspen were fresh fodder for the instant Washington D.C. news cycle, and quickly posted by numerous media outlets.\n\nClinton said she made women and girls a central issue of her foreign policy work as secretary of state because in many repressive countries around the world, women\u2019s rights and rules about their bodies are used by men for political reasons.\n\n\u201cIt is a disturbing trend that you see in a lot of societies that are very unstable, anti-democratic and frankly, prone to extremism, where women, and women\u2019s bodies, are used as the defining and unifying issue to bring together people \u2014 men \u2014 to get them to behave in ways that are disadvantageous to women but which prop them up because of their religion, their sect, tribe, whatever,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nShe said America was still far from that, but she said the court\u2019s decision raises \u201cserious questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there should be a real outcry against this kind of decision,\u201d Clinton said, adding that many more companies will now likely claim religious beliefs. \u201cThis is a really bad slippery slope.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore, who served under President Clinton, also spoke on Monday. He called for people to accept the reality of climate change and expressed optimism in the increase of sustainable energy sources.\n\nCourtesy photo / Aspen Institute\n\nChange in Iraq\n\nAsked about her vote in support of invading Iraq, Clinton conceded she\u2019d done a lot of \u201crhetorical distancing\u201d in the past about her decision and described how she resisted pressure on the campaign trail in 2008 to publicly admit it had been a mistake.\n\n\u201cIn part, it was because I didn\u2019t want to say to the young men and women who were serving in the United States military in Iraq, fighting and dying and being injured, \u2018Yeah, one more person is saying it is a mistake you are there,\u2019\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI did resist saying I made a mistake, but not for the usual purposes \u2026 for me it was much more personal and obviously it was a mistake.\u201d\n\nIn regard to the current situation in Iraq, where the country is under siege by the fast-moving Islamic ISIS army, Clinton said it was brought on in part by sectarian decisions made by Iraq Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in favor of Shias over Sunnis.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do now is to really persuade, and in effect, force some political change on the Maliki government, including the possibility that there would be a different prime minister, something that I have concluded is probably necessary,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton said, however, that could be difficult given that Maliki has been twice democratically elected.\n\nIsaacson then asked Clinton if it should be U.S. policy to always follow elections and electoral democracy.\n\n\u201cWell, we should certainly promote it, but we have many examples where we haven\u2019t followed it,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton was not the only speaker at the Ideas Festival on Monday who blamed the current situation in Iraq on Maliki.\n\n\u201cWe got to where we are because of two-and-a-half years of increasingly sectarian and increasingly authoritarian actions by the Iraqi government,\u201d said David Petraeus, the former director of the CIA and commander of U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq, who spoke with Bob Schieffer of CBS News.\n\nOnce U.S. fighting forces left Iraq, Petraeus said agreements reached with Sunni leaders in Iraq during \u201cthe surge\u201d phase of the Iraq war were not honored by Maliki.\n\nAnd he said the new coalition government now forming in Iraq \u201cneeds to be an inclusive government, i.e., one that can be trusted by Sunni and Kurd, as well as Shia.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t get a government that is trusted by all three of those communities, you cannot make progress in re-establishing the territorial integrity of Iraq, so that\u2019s a must,\u201d he said.\n\nCourtesy photo / Aspen Institute\n\nEmbrace modernity?\n\nTony Blair, former British prime minister who has been serving for the last seven years as an envoy to the Middle East, also called for a change in Iraqi leadership.\n\n\u201cCan this Iraqi government survive and lead an effort and push back these insurgents under Maliki, or does he have to go?\u201d Blair was asked by Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t change, then he should be changed,\u201d Blair said. \u201cThis cannot turn into a Sunni-Shia fight.\u201d\n\nBlair, who also once supported the Iraq war, said he still feels the world is better off without Saddam Hussein and his sons, but he also conceded he made a mistake.\n\n\u201cOf course, there were mistakes made and I\u2019ve accepted full responsibility for those,\u201d Blair said.\n\nBlair said a larger, longer battle was now underway in the broader Middle East region and that citizens there are facing a choice.\n\n\u201cYou can either have a society based on a reactionary view of politics and religion, where you are trying to return these societies to a kind of seventh-century view of the world, or you can embrace modernity,\u201d Blair said. \u201cAnd what does that mean? It means understanding that democracy is a way of thinking and not just a way of voting. And the only society that works in the modern world is one in which you are tolerant and respectful of people who have a different faith than yourself.\u201d\n\nBlair also said U.S. citizens should not expect a quick end to the strife in the Middle East, especially given the young population there.\n\n\u201cThe American strategy, in my view, should be to recognize this is going to be complex [and] it\u2019s going to be long \u2014 the next president after President Obama is going to be dealing with it and probably the next president after that,\u201d Blair said. \u201cWe may be weary of war, but they\u2019re not. And part of their fight, I\u2019m afraid, is with us. With us, and our way of life. And so, whether we like it or not, we\u2019re going to be involved in it.\u201d\n\nThe Ideas Festival continues through midday on Thursday. Today, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is slated to talk with Katie Couric of Yahoo! News on the topic, \u201cThe Dope on Pot,\u201d and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is to speak on the future of the economy. Also speaking Tuesday are Newt Gingrich, Arianna Huffington and Grover Norquist.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Aspen Journalism is collaborating with the Aspen Daily News on coverage of the 2014 Aspen Ideas Festival.
