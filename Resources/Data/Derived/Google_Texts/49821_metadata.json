The same goes for my SuperCoach centres, Greg Inglis and Darius Boyd.\n\nGiven the tough salary cap constraints however, I had to make changes to my backline and dropped Billy Slater, Brent Tate and Justin Hodges for Ben Barba, Justin O\u2019Neill and Dane Gagai.\n\nThat\u2019s just how lucky we are up in Queensland though.\n\nYou can drop some of the biggest and best names in the state and it doesn\u2019t matter. You just replace them with some other talented blokes.\n\nSupercoach: Fullback 3:29 Play video Lara Pitt and Tom Sangster check out who are the best options when it comes to Fullback.\n\nSee, as I was creating this Queensland side, that\u2019s what I was so impressed with \u2014 the guys we have waiting in the wings.\n\nIn my eyes Gagai is the next Hodges, and even if Mal Meninga has banned him from the real Origin team, he can still have a place in mine.\n\nI am also happy to have been able to make room for Chris McQueen on the bench as he\u2019s a definite smoky for 2014.\n\nBut the reserve I picked first wasn\u2019t McQueen. It was Rooster Dylan Napa.\n\nThat kid is going to be a star I reckon, and I think if he gets plenty of game time for the Roosters this year, it won\u2019t be long until we see him in the maroon jumper too.\n\nTALLIS\u2019 SUPERCOACH TEAM:", "article_metadata": {"description": "WE all know who the champion state is when it comes to the beautiful game of rugby league.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "CourierMail", "description": "WE all know who the champion state is when it comes to the beautiful game of rugby league.", "title": "League legend Gorden Tallis reveals his Queensland based NRL Supercoach side", "url": "http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/league-legend-gorden-tallis-reveals-his-queensland-based-nrl-supercoach-side/story-fniabjcr-1226842459202", "image": "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2014/03/01/1226842/459086-bb797dc4-a125-11e3-b163-d60ea6e39be3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2014/03/01/1226842/459086-bb797dc4-a125-11e3-b163-d60ea6e39be3.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@couriermail", "id": "@couriermail"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 134856659877884}, "articleid": 1226842459202, "keywords": "champion state, mighty front-row combination, maroon jumper, single player, starting side, tough salary, Greg Inglis, Nate Myles, Brent Tate, Cameron Smith, Anthony Mitchell, Matt Gillett, Jo Ofahengaue, Johnathan Thurston, Korbin Sims, Moses Mbye, Dylan Napa, Dane Gagai, Corey Parker, Javid Bowen, Rooster Dylan Napa, game time, ,,Queensland,Australia, Chris McQueen, Darius Boyd, Ben Barba, Sam Thaiday, Matt Scott, Curtis Rona, Hymel Hunt, Cooper Cronk, Ben Hunt, Billy Slater, Christian Hazard, Tom Sangster, Zac Santo, winning magic, rugby league", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Mar 01 22:26:04 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sat Mar 01 22:26:04 EST 2014", "author": "Gorden Tallis"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd54d\"", "article_summary": "When I put together the best Queensland SuperCoach team I could afford, I did not base my side around a single player.\nTALLIS\u2019 SUPERCOACH TEAM:\nWe could also win it in a SuperCoach State of Origin showdown.\nSupercoach: Centres 3:18 Play video Lara Pitt and Tom Sangster analyse where the value is in the centres.\nSupercoach: Fullback 3:29 Play video Lara Pitt and Tom Sangster check out who are the best options when it comes to Fullback."}
