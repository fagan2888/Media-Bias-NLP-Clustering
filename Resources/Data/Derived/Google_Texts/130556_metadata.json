Inside, Ramzi Aburedwan, a Palestinian musician, prepares his documents for the Israeli soldier standing guard. On the other side of this West Bank military checkpoint lies the young man\u2019s destination, the ancient Palestinian town of Sebastia. Fellow musicians are gathering there that afternoon to perform in the ruins of an amphitheater built during Roman times. In the back seat, his wife, Celine, tends their one-year-old son, Hussein, his blond locks curling over the collar of his soccer jersey.\n\nRamzi is in a hurry to set up for the concert, but it doesn\u2019t matter. The soldier promptly informs him that he cannot pass. \u201cThose are the orders,\u201d he adds without further explanation, directing him to another entrance 45 minutes away. Turning the car around, Ramzi then drives beneath Shavei Shomron, a red-roofed Israeli settlement perched high on a hill, and then an \u201coutpost\u201d of hilltop trailers planted by a new wave of settlers. Finally, he passes through a series of barriers and looping barbed wire, reaching the designated entrance, where another soldier waves him through. He arrives in time for the concert.\n\nI witnessed the checkpoint incident, one of thousands of small daily indignities suffered by Palestinians, from the front seat of Ramzi\u2019s SUV in 2010. We had met 12 years earlier when posters of Ramzi, pasted all over Ramallah, had captured my imagination. In a photo taken in 1988 during the first Palestinian intifada, eight-year-old Ramzi was hurling a stone at an unseen Israeli soldier. Juxtaposed behind it, on the same poster, was another photo taken 10 years later of 18-year-old Ramzi pulling a bow across viola strings.\n\nThe poster was an advertisement for the National Conservatory of Music in Palestine and a metaphor for the hopes of many Palestinians at the time: that the era of the Oslo Peace Accords would bring an independent Palestinian state. In the story I produced at the time for National Public Radio, Ramzi expressed a double wish: to perform in the first national symphony orchestra of Palestine and someday to open music schools for Palestinian children.\n\n\u201cI want to see many conservatories opening up in all of Palestine,\u201d he told me. A lovely dream, I thought, though an unlikely one for a teenager from a refugee camp who had been raised by his impoverished grandparents. Still, shortly thereafter, a determined Ramzi landed a scholarship to study the viola in France. A year or two later, we lost touch.\n\nThen, in late 2009, in a chance encounter at a West Bank Italian restaurant, I saw Ramzi again. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked him. \u201cI thought you were still in France.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m back,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019ve opened a music school here in Palestine.\u201d (It also has branches across the West Bank and in refugee camps in Lebanon.) In other words, exactly what he had told me he wanted to do as a teenager in the al-Amari refugee camp. Six months later, in June 2010, I began to document his dream \u2014 now a reality \u2014 to build a music school in occupied Palestine.\n\nNow, his SUV bound for Sebastia is cutting through the West Bank, a land smaller than the state of Delaware but dotted with more than 600 checkpoints, earthen barriers, and other obstacles to normal travel. His detour and the incident that accompanied it are part of a system that hems Palestinians into ever more confined enclaves surrounded by Jewish settlements over which looms Israel\u2019s military presence. Yet this kind of everyday humiliation and confinement remains unknown to most Americans. Despite the torrents of press coverage here about Israel and its relationship with the United States, the daily reality of half the people in a century-old conflict is essentially off the American radar screen.\n\nThe reasons for this are rooted in culture, politics, and money. Millions of Americans were raised on the Leon Uris version of Israeli history, as told in his novel Exodus. In that story, the focus was on the heroic birth of the Jewish state out of the ashes of the Holocaust. \u201cArabs\u201d \u2014 that is, Palestinians \u2014 remained on the sidelines of the tale, pathetic, obstructionist, and violent. That long ago became the American media\u2019s basic narrative of the struggle in the region: that Israel, surrounded by a sea of enemies, must be secure. But like the narrative that dominated media discourse before the U.S. invasion of Iraq \u2014 that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction \u2014 the facts on the ground are often ignored.\n\nMoney clouds the picture even more. Millions of dollars from billionaire casino magnate and Israeli settlement advocate Sheldon Adelson (who has also advocated using nuclear weapons against Iran) and billionaire Paul Singer, on the board of the Republican Jewish Coalition, as well as from the bankrollers of neocon William Kristol\u2019s Emergency Committee for Israel,have further distorted the conversation. In the process, such funders have helped elevate war hawks like Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton to prominence.\n\nThe money and political leverage of backers of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has had a similar effect on some Democrats. It helps explain, for instance, the growing challenges from New York Senator Charles Schumer and New Jersey\u2019s recently indicted Senator Robert Menendez to the Obama administration\u2019s framework nuclear agreement with Iran. But the problem has been around for so much longer. For years, as journalist Connie Bruck revealed last September in the New Yorker, AIPAC has strong-armed elected officials, the recipients of the lavish campaign donations it facilitates, into drafting legislation favorable to Israel. Such bills are often written by AIPAC staff and then introduced under the name of some member of Congress.\n\nAll of this has had a ruinous effect on debate in this country about Israel and Palestine. Almost invariably left out of any discussion here is the devastating impact on Palestinian lives of Israel\u2019s military occupation, which goes hand-in-hand with relentless settlement expansion that undermines any prospect of a just and lasting peace in the region.\n\nBeing Confined\n\nAmerican politicians frequently declare that \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself.\u201d Seldom does anyone ask if Palestinians have that same right, or even the right to enjoy freedom of movement in their own homeland.\n\nI have spent the last five years documenting both the harsh realities of Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank and Ramzi Aburedwan\u2019s dream of building a music school that could provide Palestinian children with an alternative to the violence and humiliation that is their everyday lives. I sat with children in the South Hebron hills, who had been stoned by Israeli settlers and set upon by German shepherds as they walked two miles to school. I met a 14-year-old girl who was forced to play a song for a soldier at a checkpoint, supposedly to prove her flute was not a weapon.\n\nFarmers in villages shared their anguish with me over their lost livelihoods, because the 430-mile-long separation barrier Israel has built on Palestinian land, essentially confiscating nearly 10% of the West Bank, cuts them off from their beloved olive groves. I\u2019ve seen men crammed into metal holding pens before being taken to minimum-wage jobs in Israel, and women squeezed between seven-foot-high concrete blocks, waiting to pray at Jerusalem\u2019s Al Aqsa Mosque. I\u2019ve spoken with countless families who have been subject to night raids by the Israeli military, including one young mother, home alone with her one-year-old boy, who woke up to the sight of 10 Israeli soldiers breaking down her door and pointing guns at her. They had, it turned out, raided the wrong apartment. The baby slept through it all.\n\nRamzi and the teachers at his school, Al Kamandjati (Arabic for \u201cThe Violinist\u201d), see it as an antidote to the sense of oppression and confinement that pervades Palestinian life. And it\u2019s true that the students I talked to there regularly reported that playing music gave them a transformative sense of calm and protection \u2014 and not only in the moments when they picked up their instruments and disappeared into Bach, Beethoven, or Fairuz.\n\nRasha, the young flute player detained and forced to perform at an Israeli checkpoint, told me that music enabled her to face previously overwhelming difficulties. \u201cI felt like I was in a forest, all by myself in a little cottage with no people, no noise, nothing,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMountains, sea, something pure blue, not like the Dead Sea. It was an escape to another world, a better world. I owned that world.\u201d Her teachers reported that an angry, traumatized girl was growing into a self-aware, self-respecting, and assertive young musician.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our government's unbending allegiance to Israel has blinded us to the horrors of its military occupation in Gaza", "title": "America\u2019s dangerous \u201cExodus\u201d fantasy: What\u2019s lost in the Israel-Palestine debate", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Our government's unbending allegiance to Israel has blinded us to the horrors of its military occupation in Gaza", "title": "America\u2019s dangerous \u201cExodus\u201d fantasy: What\u2019s lost in the Israel-Palestine debate", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/10/a_sliced_and_diced_occupied_land_americas_foolish_one_state_solution_in_the_middle_east_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/exodus-5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our government's unbending allegiance to Israel has blinded us to the horrors of its military occupation in Gaza", "title": "America\u2019s dangerous \u201cExodus\u201d fantasy: What\u2019s lost in the Israel-Palestine debate", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/exodus-5.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sandy Tolan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Foreign policy, Israel, Israel-Palestine, Middle East, TomDispatch.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve opened a music school here in Palestine.\u201d (It also has branches across the West Bank and in refugee camps in Lebanon.)\nSix months later, in June 2010, I began to document his dream \u2014 now a reality \u2014 to build a music school in occupied Palestine.\nOn the other side of this West Bank military checkpoint lies the young man\u2019s destination, the ancient Palestinian town of Sebastia.\nThen, in late 2009, in a chance encounter at a West Bank Italian restaurant, I saw Ramzi again.\nIn a photo taken in 1988 during the first Palestinian intifada, eight-year-old Ramzi was hurling a stone at an unseen Israeli soldier."}
