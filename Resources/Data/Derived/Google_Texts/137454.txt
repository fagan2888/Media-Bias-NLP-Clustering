Craig Gordon with the Utah Avalanche Center was in studio Sunday morning talking about avalanche conditions in Utah's mountains.

Gordon said there is low danger but that doesn't mean there's no danger.

Gordon added while there's haze in the valley, the weather is great in the mountains.

"What a diverse state we live in," he said. "It'd be great to get out of the valley gunk and up in the amazing weather in the mountains, or go over to Sundance where you can party with the drunks and the drones."
