There were no reports of any casualties or damage.\n\nGaza residents said missiles struck several locations throughout the Gaza Strip, including places used as training camps by Islamic Jihad militants on sites that had been Israeli settlements before Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.\n\nTuesday\u2019s rocket landed near Ashdod some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the Gaza border and security forces were searching for remnants. It was the longest-range militant rocket strike since a truce that ended the 50-day war last year.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility in Gaza for the rocket launching.\n\n\u201cThese strikes are a direct response to Hamas and the aggression against Israeli civilians originating from the Gaza Strip,\u201d military spokesman Lieutenant-Coloner Peter Lerner said in a statement. \u201cThe reality that Hamas\u2019 territory is used as a staging ground to attack Israel is unacceptable and intolerable and will bear consequences.\u201d\n\nLast year, militants in Gaza launched thousands of rockets and mortar bombs into Israel during a July-August war in which Israeli shelling and air strikes battered the small, coastal Palestinian enclave.\n\nThe region has been largely quiet since the August ceasefire.\n\nIsraeli media speculated that infighting among Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza Strip may have precipitated the rocket firing without the permission of Gaza\u2019s Islamist Hamas rulers.\n\nRival militant factions in Gaza are angry that months after the end of the war, no progress has been made to improve the isolated enclave\u2019s plight and pledges for funding to reconstruct buildings devastated during the war have not been honored.\n\nReconciliation efforts between Hamas and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority led by President Mahmoud Abbas have faltered, adding to hardships and hampering foreign aid donations and the import of building materials.\n\nIsrael maintains a partial blockade on the territory and Egypt largely keeps the Rafah border crossing closed. Hamas has imposed a \u201csolidarity tax\u201d and salaries for workers not aligned with the Palestinian Authority are not being paid in full.\n\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi; Writing by Ori Lewis; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli aircraft struck a number of sites in the Gaza Strip from the air early on Wednesday, residents and the Israeli military said, after a rocket that Palestinian militants fired f", "title": "Israel Strikes Gaza After Rocket Lands Near Israeli Port Ashdod", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/israel-strikes-gaza-after-rocket-lands-near-israeli-port-ashdod/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Isrsael-airstrike-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Isrsael-airstrike-150x150.jpg", "description": "GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli aircraft struck a number of sites in the Gaza Strip from the air early on W", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "title": "Israel Strikes Gaza After Rocket Lands Near Israeli Port Ashdod"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Israeli military said it struck four \u201cterror infrastructures\u201d in the southern Gaza Strip and that hits were confirmed.\nBY:GAZA (Reuters) \u2013 Israeli aircraft struck a number of sites in the Gaza Strip from the air early on Wednesday, residents and the Israeli military said, after a rocket that Palestinian militants fired from the enclave landed near the Israeli port city of Ashdod.\n\u201cThese strikes are a direct response to Hamas and the aggression against Israeli civilians originating from the Gaza Strip,\u201d military spokesman Lieutenant-Coloner Peter Lerner said in a statement.\nTuesday\u2019s rocket landed near Ashdod some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the Gaza border and security forces were searching for remnants.\nIsraeli media speculated that infighting among Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza Strip may have precipitated the rocket firing without the permission of Gaza\u2019s Islamist Hamas rulers."}
