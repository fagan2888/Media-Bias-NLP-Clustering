She\u2019ll lead San Antonio\u2019s entry in the Las Vegas league \u2014 the biggest of the three NBA summer showcases \u2014 starting next weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still seeing what kind of head coach I\u2019m going to be,\u201d Hammon told reporters in San Antonio, with the video of the interview posted to the team\u2019s web site.\n\nShe\u2019ll have a better idea of that in a couple weeks.\n\nThe Spurs will first play in a summer league at Utah starting Monday, when they\u2019ll be led by video coordinator Will Hardy. When they shift to Las Vegas for the league\u2019s biggest of its three summer showcases, Hammon \u2014 given the assignment by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who made her the NBA\u2019s first paid full-time female assistant coach before last season \u2014 will be in charge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just thankful that Pop trusted me enough to give me this opportunity, because it is a big opportunity,\u201d Hammon said.\n\nThe Spurs will play at least five games in Las Vegas, starting on July 11. An All-Star in the WNBA, she played eight seasons each with the New York Liberty and San Antonio Stars and she was at times the sort of player who didn\u2019t mind jawing with officials.\n\nWill that carry over into her role as coach?\n\n\u201cI was pretty fiery as a player,\u201d Hammon said. \u201cI racked up a few (technicals) as a player. As a head coach you have less control, so I don\u2019t know if that means more T\u2019s or less T\u2019s. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHammon, who graduated from Colorado State, said she equates coaching with teaching, and teaching seems especially important in the summer league \u2014 where most of the players don\u2019t have any NBA experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because I\u2019ve never really coached, but yet I\u2019ve been coaching my whole career,\u201d Hammon said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting mix for me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Becky Hammon thankful for chance to coach summer Spurs", "title": "Becky Hammon thankful for chance to coach summer Spurs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/04/becky-hammon-thankful-for-chance-to-coach-summer-spurs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150704_021319_becky-hammon.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150704_021319_becky-hammon.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-04T14:12:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T14:52:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce58d\"", "article_summary": "Becky Hammon had known for some time that she was going to be coaching San Antonio\u2019s summer league team in Las Vegas.\nShe\u2019ll lead San Antonio\u2019s entry in the Las Vegas league \u2014 the biggest of the three NBA summer showcases \u2014 starting next weekend.\nThe Spurs will play at least five games in Las Vegas, starting on July 11.\nThe Spurs will first play in a summer league at Utah starting Monday, when they\u2019ll be led by video coordinator Will Hardy.\n\u201cI was pretty fiery as a player,\u201d Hammon said."}
