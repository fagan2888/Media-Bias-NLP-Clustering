Hansley scored two touchdowns on punt returns, becoming just the second Ram to do so in a game. ( GARY KAZANJIAN / The Associated Press )\n\nFRESNO, Calif. \u2014 They were special, all right.\n\nColorado State became the first team in the last 10 seasons to score on three kick returns in the same game Saturday night, the key element in the Rams rallying to beat Fresno State 34-31 at Bulldog Stadium.\n\nAnd Joe Hansley was the highlight performer.\n\nThe senior's two punt returns for scores \u2014 the first for 75 yards to open the scoring, the second one covering 61 yards in an even more impressive highlight reel \u2014 where Colorado State's only scores of the first half, a 30-minute run where the offense was stagnant and the team was looking for a spark.\n\nHansley had the right formula.\n\n\"We're sputtering, but Joe just kept playing football,\" CSU coach Mike Bobo said. \"Some of the other guys were looking around, what's wrong coach, what's wrong? Ain't nothing wrong. Guys are making plays on the other side of the ball and we don't have good field position. You've got to give those other guys credit, but Joe just kept playing. When he had the opportunity to make a play, he did.\"\n\nOn the first one, Hansley admitted it was nice to hit the end zone and not have to look back and see a flag on the field to negate it, as has happened earlier this season. In classic form, he made people miss early, made the right cuts and sprinted down the far sideline for the score.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second was even more impressive. He was hit hard enough to knock loose his chin strap, but bounced off that hit to the right, rolled back to his left \u2014 all while trying to re-snap his helmet \u2014 and hit the sideline for the score.\n\n\"I was trying to buckle it up again because I didn't want to get hit and have my helmet fly off or something,\" Hansley said. \"I know it probably looked a little goofy, but I was trying to get it buckled again.\"\n\nNaturally, they were plays that energized his teammates. As defensive lineman Martavius Foster put it, \"he went off tonight.\"\n\nIt even inspired Kevin Nutt to put in his own good work. His night didn't start as well, as his first kick return led to him losing a shoe and falling down on the 3-yard line.\n\nHis second, to open the second half, was good for a 96-yard score, making Colorado State the only team the past 10 seasons to score on three kick returns in the same game.\n\n\"I loved seeing Joe run,\" Nutt said. \"He's just elusive and fast, and he's got moves to put on people. I was just right there blocking for him.\"\n\nAs for his scoring return, he said the key difference was having somebody tie his shoes tighter.\n\nBobo said a few weeks back the special teams made some changes, putting Rashard Higgins and Jordon Vaden on punt return as blockers. Bobo was frustrated by the fact that he felt CSU had the most dangerous returner in the conference in Hansley and they weren't creating opportunities for him.\n\nSaturday, they did.\n\n\"The punt return team did a great job,\" Hansley said. \"Guys like Rashard out there, he's busting his butt out there every play trying to get me loose. It was a good team effort by everyone.\n\n\"I mean, they go 100 percent on very play on punt return, because one of their guys is back there as a wideout. They definitely help me out. More stuff has opened up, so it was a good move.\"\n\nIt gives the senior three career punt returns for scores. He became just the second Ram to have two punt returns for scores in a game, the first being Dallas Davis against Utah in 1999.\n\nHe was more than your average Joe on Saturday, but he'd like to think it was really nothing special.\n\n\"You know, I'd like to expect to make those plays, so I'll leave it at that,\" he said.\n\nNot that all was perfect on the night for the units, as Wyatt Bryan missed a 43-yard field goal, had a extra point blocked and the coverage units gave up 200 yards on punt and kickoff returns. Yet the CSU return game turned the tide in the Rams' favor.\n\n\"Special teams played a big part in this game,\" Nutt said. \"We had three touchdowns off of special teams that really led us to the victory tonight.\"\n\nHitting 50 \u2014 Senior Trent Matthews started his 50th game Saturday night for Colorado State, tying Weston Richburg for the school record for career starts. In the bowl game, Matthews can break the record.\n\nMatthews had started all 39 of his collegiate games until the season opener this season. He has started every game since.\n\nMatthews had 265 career tackles entering the game, and his 10 interceptions in four years tied him for 10th on the program's all-time list. He's been playing hurt most of the year and he went down late in the game and was on crutches afterward. Bobo said he didn't think it was serious, and hoped that to be true.\n\n\"I don't know yet. I saw the replay and he's just running and it looked like his legs just gave out on him,\" Bobo said. \"I don't think it's anything major. I think he's just old. It's been a tough season for the safeties.\"\n\nHere and there \u2014 CSU captains for the game were Nu'uvali Fa'apito, Kevin Nutt, Deonte Clyburn and Joe Kawulok. Fa'apito was not suited up and didn't play. ... Trae Moxley started at left tackle in place of Nick Callender. It is Moxley's second start this season, the first coming at left guard against Utah State. Callender did enter later. ... Rashard Higgins extended his consecutive games streak to 37 with a reception. ... In addition to Matthews, the Rams lost cornerback DeAndre Elliott early in the game, and safety Nick Januska played hurt. ... Punter Hayden Hunt, a Ray Guy Award finalist, hit seven punts for an average of 46.6 with two inside the 20, but the Rams finished with a net of just 35.9.\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/mbrohard", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29179142/colorado-state-football-gets-return-investment", "modificationDate": "2015-11-29T00:45:25-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1129/20151129__29rhscsufbnotesw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Brohard \n \n  Sports Editor", "description": "FRESNO, Calif. \u2014 They were special, all right.\nColorado State became the first team in the last 10 seasons to score on three kick returns in the same game Saturday night, the key element in the Rams rallying to beat Fresno State 34-31 at Bulldog Stadium.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:29179142:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-29T00:44:26-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29179142/colorado-state-football-gets-return-investment", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1129/20151129__29rhscsufbnotesw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FRESNO, Calif. \u2014 They were special, all right.\nColorado State became the first team in the last 10 seasons to score on three kick returns in the same game Saturday night, the key element in the Rams rallying to beat Fresno State 34-31 at Bulldog Stadium.", "title": "Colorado State football gets return on investment"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "FRESNO, Calif. \u2014 They were special, all right.\nColorado State became the first team in the last 10 seasons to score on three kick returns in the same game Saturday night, the key element in the Rams rallying to beat Fresno State 34-31 at Bulldog Stadium.", "title": "Colorado State football gets return on investment", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29179142/colorado-state-football-gets-return-investment", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1129/20151129__29rhscsufbnotesw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-29T00:44:26-0700", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2025-11-29T00:44:26-0700", "sailthru.title": "Colorado State football gets return on investment", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Mike BrohardSports", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1129/20151129__29rhscsufbnotesw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-11-29T00:46:30-0700", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sports news, Loveland Colorado Sports news, Loveland Colorado news, Sports Loveland news, Sports Colorado news, US Sports news, world Sports news."}, "article_summary": "Bobo said a few weeks back the special teams made some changes, putting Rashard Higgins and Jordon Vaden on punt return as blockers.\n\"I mean, they go 100 percent on very play on punt return, because one of their guys is back there as a wideout.\nYet the CSU return game turned the tide in the Rams' favor.\nRams' return three kicks for touchdowns in winColorado State's Joe Hansley hits the end zone for a 24-yard scoring pass in Saturday's 34-31 win over Fresno State.\nAnd Joe Hansley was the highlight performer."}
