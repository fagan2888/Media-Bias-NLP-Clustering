Each time, Granillo stayed for less than an hour before leaving without being seen by a doctor.\n\n\"I was in so much pain I wanted to be taken care of now,\" said Granillo, who lives in Reseda and runs a hot dog cart business. \"I didn\u2019t want to sit and wait.\"\n\nThen one morning he woke up feeling even worse. This time, Granillo\u2019s wife, Sonya, tried something different: Using a new service offered by the hospital, she made an ER appointment online, using her mobile phone.\n\nWhen they arrived at the hospital, Michael was seen almost immediately.\n\n\"That was my last resort and it worked,\" said Sonya. \"He would have probably been at home in pain if not for the service.\"\n\nIn an era of increased competition driven by the nation\u2019s health law, hospitals in California and around the country are hoping online ER appointments will help attract patients anxious to avoid long waits in a crowded and often chaotic environment.\n\n\"It makes for a happier camper,\" said Susan Dubuque, a national expert in hospital marketing. \"When it comes to health care, consumers want more control over everything.\"\n\nThe system, adopted by Northridge and other hospitals in the Dignity Health chain about a year ago, is only for patients with emergencies that are not life threatening or debilitating, such as an ankle sprain or a fever. People with serious emergencies, such as chest pain or trouble breathing, are instructed to call 911 or go directly to an ER.\n\nTo make an appointment online, patients must explain the reason for their visit and confirm that they can wait for treatment.\n\nWhen patients get to the hospital, they still may be bumped by more seriously ill patients.\n\nThe approach makes business sense for hospitals because it lets medical staff know who may be coming through the door, and it makes patients more comfortable, hospital executives say.\n\nPatients want to access health care the same way they do services in other industries, such as retail or travel, said Chris Song, a spokesman for InQuicker, a Nashville-based company that offers the online scheduling in California and 25 other states.\n\n\"When is the last time someone bought plane tickets at the gate?\" he said.\n\nSome critics say the online check-in system may be convenient but is not necessarily cost effective. If the country wants to decrease health care costs, patients need to be treated at the right place at the right time, said Dr. Del Morris, president of the California Academy of Family Physicians. Patients who can make appointments should do so at their doctors\u2019 offices, he said.\n\n\"Emergency rooms are there to take care of people who have emergencies,\" said Morris, medical director of the Stanislaus County Health Services Agency.\n\nSome patients who come in through the appointment service probably should be seen by a primary care doctor but either don\u2019t have one or can\u2019t get a timely appointment, said Dr. Stephen Jones, medical director for Northridge's emergency department. Others, like Granillo, shouldn\u2019t wait for care, he said.\n\nThe Dignity chain says roughly 12,000 patients have scheduled visits for emergency rooms at hospitals in California, Arizona and Nevada. Recently, Dignity stepped up marketing, with billboards and ads online, on TV and radio, and in print. One TV spot features a woman sitting in a hospital waiting room chair \u2013 and then cuts to her on a living room couch with a dog, as the words on the screen read, \"Wait for the ER from home.\"\n\nDignity Health, which is also offering the online reservations at urgent care centers and doctors\u2019 offices, hopes that the new service will minimize wait times and boost patient satisfaction scores, said Page West, chief nursing officer. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare reimbursements for hospitals are partly tied to results on the patient surveys.\n\nOn the day of his appointment at Northridge, Granillo winced and shifted uncomfortably in the ER exam room.\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" asked Jones. \"Do you need more pain medicine?\"\n\nGranillo nodded and told him that his back and stomach both hurt.\n\nAfter a CT scan, doctors told the couple that Granillo, as it turned out, had a very serious condition: lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system.\n\nHis treatment began immediately. Sonya said if she had not made the ER appointment, Michael might still not know about his cancer.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service.
