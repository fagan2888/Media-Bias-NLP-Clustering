The four-year contract calls for incremental increases, said Bruce Tidwell, director of human resources for the county.\n\nAs part of the Affordable Care Act, the county could be hit with a 40 percent excise tax starting in 2018 on health plan premiums that exceed $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage.\n\n\u201cMost employers are going to get hit with this tax at some point,\u201d Soto said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of when.\u201d\n\nThe tax could amount to $944,932 for the county in 2018. The bulk of the cost \u2013 $637,000 \u2013 stems from the county\u2019s health plan for retirees under 65, according to projections by Aon Hewitt.\n\nThe county offers free health coverage for retirees under 65, but County Board Chairman Jim Moustis said he\u2019d like to revisit that policy in an effort to bring costs down.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have to offer anything until they are 65. We\u2019re under no contractual agreement. It\u2019s just something we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said.\n\nOther county health news\n\nThe county\u2019s Wellness Program, in its second year, has a 93 percent participation rate, up from 86 percent in 2014.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really unheard of,\u201d Tidwell said.\n\nThe program was developed using a custom model that was endorsed by ASFCME, the county\u2019s largest union, in 2013, he said.\n\nThe program offers employees biometric screening and health risk assessments, but those who opt out are hit with premium hikes. The county offers incentives for participating and reaching health and fitness goals.\n\nThe program is projected to cost the county about $244,965 in 2016, with costs offset by premium surcharges paid by employees who opted out.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 The Herald-News", "og": {"url": "http://www.theherald-news.com/2015/08/06/will-county-officials-talk-health-insurance-costs-pending-aca-excise-tax/aaeijiu/", "image": "http://www.theherald-news.com/images/avatar-facebook.png", "site_name": "The Herald-News", "description": "JOLIET \u2013 Will County can expect an increase on its health insurance premiums next year, but it\u2019s an anticipated 2018 excise tax that has County Board members worried about ballooning costs.", "title": "Will County officials talk health insurance costs, pending ACA excise tax"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.theherald-news.com/images/avatar-twitter.png", "title": "Will County officials talk health insurance costs, pending ACA excise tax", "description": "JOLIET \u2013 Will County can expect an increase on its health insurance premiums next year, but it\u2019s an anticipated 2018 excise tax that has County Board members worried about ballooning costs.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Joliet_HN"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1092756832", "fb": {"pages": 255829231119332}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "5e5894de-43a2-4aa7-bc4e-45c97a64d4ed"}}, "keywords": "#WillCoBoard, will county board, health insurance premiums, aon hewitt, kathy soto, bruce tidwell, affordable care act, excise tax, aca, asfcme, will county union, wellness program", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "County employees will pay more for health insurance in 2016 as part of the union contract agreement reached in 2013 after a 16-day strike.\nJOLIET \u2013 Will County can expect an increase on its health insurance premiums next year, but it\u2019s an anticipated 2018 excise tax that has County Board members worried about ballooning costs.\nThe program offers employees biometric screening and health risk assessments, but those who opt out are hit with premium hikes.\nOther county health newsThe county\u2019s Wellness Program, in its second year, has a 93 percent participation rate, up from 86 percent in 2014.\nThe county offers free health coverage for retirees under 65, but County Board Chairman Jim Moustis said he\u2019d like to revisit that policy in an effort to bring costs down."}
