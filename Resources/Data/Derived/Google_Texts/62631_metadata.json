Louisiana, Oklahoma and Rhode Island were the only other states to improve on more indicators.\n\nKentucky\u2019s top rankings were in access and affordability (28th) and prevention and treatment (20th), but it remained near the bottom for avoidable use of hospitals and cost of care (49th), health status (44th) and equity (45th).\n\nAlthough states such as Kentucky have a long way to go, \u201cthey also have more to gain from improvement,\u201d Douglas McCarthy, senior research director for the Commonwealth Fund, told Laura Ungar of The Courier-Journal.\n\nSome measures in which Kentucky saw substantial improvement were:\n\n\u2023 Adults who went without care because of cost in the previous year;\n\n\u2023 Adults 50 and older who got recommended screenings and preventive care;\n\n\u2023 High-risk nursing home residents with pressure sores;\n\n\u2023 Readmissions to the hospital in 30 days among Medicare patients;\n\n\u2023 Breast cancer deaths;\n\n\u2023 Infant mortality\n\nThe percentage of insured adults. David Radley, the senior scientist tracking health system improvement for The Commonwealth Fund, told Ungar that Kentucky led the nation in declines among uninsured adults. Other research has found likewise.\n\nThis year\u2019s scorecard is the fourth in a series, and the first to measure the effects of the Affordable Care Act, looking at changes during 2013 and 2014 to assess the early effects of the law\u2019s 2014 health insurance expansions. It also measures payment reforms and incentives to reduce re-admissions to the hospital.\n\n\u201cThe effects of the ACA are not yet full reflected in the 2015 Scorecard results,\u201d says the report. \u201cIt may take many years to see the resulting changes.\u201d\n\nUngar writes, \u201cDr. David Blumenthal, president of The Commonwealth Fund, said he \u201ccan\u2019t with scientific precision\u201d attribute all the gains in his organization\u2019s report to the ACA, but several positive trends do coincide with the implementation of the law.\u201d\n\nVisit the U.S. Health System Data Center for interactive maps, state profiles,and comparisons of state performance.\n\nMelissa Patrick writes for Kentucky Health News, an independent news service of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues, based in the School of Journalism and Telecommunications at the University of Kentucky, with support from the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7f2\"", "article_summary": "By Melissa PatrickSpecial to KyForwardKentucky remains in the bottom fourth of a states\u2019 health ranking released Dec. 8, but it was one of the states that saw the greatest improvements of individual health indicators in the first year of full federal health reform.\nDavid Radley, the senior scientist tracking health system improvement for The Commonwealth Fund, told Ungar that Kentucky led the nation in declines among uninsured adults.\nMelissa Patrick writes for Kentucky Health News, an independent news service of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues, based in the School of Journalism and Telecommunications at the University of Kentucky, with support from the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky.\nThe Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on State Health System Performance looks at five areas: medical-care access and affordability, prevention and treatment of disease, avoidable hospital use and hospital cost, health status and \u201chealth equity.\u201dKentucky ranked 40th overall, but improved on 13 indicators and worsened on only three.\nAlthough states such as Kentucky have a long way to go, \u201cthey also have more to gain from improvement,\u201d Douglas McCarthy, senior research director for the Commonwealth Fund, told Laura Ungar of The Courier-Journal."}
