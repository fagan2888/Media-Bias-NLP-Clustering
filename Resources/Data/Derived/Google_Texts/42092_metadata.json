Photo: AP\n\nJakarta: Gay sex and sex outside marriage in the Indonesian province of Aceh will be punishable by 100 lashes of the cane under new laws passed by the local parliament.\n\nEven non-Muslim tourists to Indonesia's westernmost province are subject to the sharia penalty in a step that human rights groups have described as an \"enormous step backwards\".\n\nA masked and hooded official canes an Acehnese man for gambling. Photo: AFP\n\nThe Aceh Islamic Criminal Code is a bylaw of the provincial parliament \u2013 the only district of Indonesia with authority to enact sharia provisions in the criminal law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt now explicitly makes it a criminal act for men to have anal sex with each other, and for women to \"rub together body parts for stimulation\".\n\nBeing alone with someone of the opposite sex who is neither a marriage partner nor a relative is also punishable by caning.\n\nParty Aceh, the dominant political movement that sprang from the former separatist army of Aceh, backed the law, saying ordinary people in the province were calling for it.\n\nSuaidi Sulaiman, the party's deputy spokesman said the law had been passed \"because Aceh is the 'verandah of Mecca'.\n\n\"Aceh people have been the followers of Islam since the 13th century \u2026 in Aceh everything is linked to religion.\"\n\nHomosexuality is not a criminal offence in the rest of Indonesia.\n\n\"Aceh gays are free to be themselves outside of Aceh because Jakarta doesn't implement Islamic sharia,\" Mr Suaidi said. \"But they know there is no opportunity for gays in Aceh.\"\n\nWomen's rights activist Samsidar said the new law had also increased the difficulty of proving rape, and opened the door for child victims of sexual assault to be considered as adulterers.\n\n\"The legal wording puts a child or a minor in the same position as adults in adultery cases, while, in our view, the children are the victims,\" she said.\n\nAceh is the province in which women can be punished for not wearing headscarves, and where, in some areas, they are required to ride side-saddle on motorcycles.\n\nIt is also the province where a vigilante group of eight local men and boys this year allegedly gang-raped a woman they accused of having sex with a married man, then presented her to the sharia police for further punishment.\n\nThe sharia police investigated her \"crime\" before dropping the charges.\n\nThe alleged rapists will face criminal sanction through the secular courts for their actions.\n\nAmnesty International's Asia-Pacific Director Richard Bennett said Aceh's new laws, passed on Saturday, would be used \"disproportionately to police and punish women's choices\".\n\n\"They also act as a deterrent to women reporting rape and sexual violence who may fear being accused of sex outside marriage,\" he said.\n\nIndonesia more broadly does not criminalise homosexuality, he said, but Aceh's new law was a \"huge blow for equality\" and would \"add to the climate of homophobia, fear and harassment many in Aceh are already facing\".\n\nAceh has caned 156 people in public ceremonies \u2013 usually after Friday prayers \u2013 since 2010.\n\nMost are punished for gambling and drinking, but others have been punished for \"khalwat\", or consorting with members of the opposite sex.\n\nSharia was introduced in Aceh in 2001, as the central government tried to co-opt religious leaders in the fight against the separatist insurgency. That insurgency only ended in a 2005 agreement, the year after the Boxing Day tsunami devastated the region.\n\n\u2013 with Karuni Rompies", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "World", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Gay sex and sex outside marriage in the Indonesian province of Aceh will be punishable by 100 lashes of the cane under new laws passed by the local parliament.", "title": "New Aceh law punishes gay and extramarital sex with 100 lashes", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/world/new-aceh-law-punishes-gay-and-extramarital-sex-with-100-lashes-20140928-10n6xd.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/g/t/c/i/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.10n6xd.png/1412121128277.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/g/t/c/i/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.10n6xd.png/1412121128277.jpg"}, "description": "Gay sex and sex outside marriage in the Indonesian province of Aceh will be punishable by 100 lashes of the cane under new laws passed by the local parliament.", "site": "@smh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New Aceh law punishes gay and extramarital sex with 100 lashes"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Gay sex and sex outside marriage in the Indonesian province of Aceh will be punishable by 100 lashes of the cane under new laws passed by the local parliament."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb28d\"", "article_summary": "Photo: APJakarta: Gay sex and sex outside marriage in the Indonesian province of Aceh will be punishable by 100 lashes of the cane under new laws passed by the local parliament.\nPhoto: AFPThe Aceh Islamic Criminal Code is a bylaw of the provincial parliament \u2013 the only district of Indonesia with authority to enact sharia provisions in the criminal law.\nSuaidi Sulaiman, the party's deputy spokesman said the law had been passed \"because Aceh is the 'verandah of Mecca'.\n\"Aceh gays are free to be themselves outside of Aceh because Jakarta doesn't implement Islamic sharia,\" Mr Suaidi said.\n\"They also act as a deterrent to women reporting rape and sexual violence who may fear being accused of sex outside marriage,\" he said."}
