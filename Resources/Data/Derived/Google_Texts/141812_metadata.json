The self-employed, underemployed, or otherwise ineligible for employer group insurance took advantage of the state and federal exchanges last year, and their participation drove the nationwide uninsured rate to its lowest ever. Insurance companies posted all-time high share prices in the third quarter last year thanks in part to an increased subscriber base provided by the law\u2019s mandate. Healthcare.gov\u2019s Marketplace is not as bad as you\u2019ve heard. In fact, it\u2019s pretty darn good. But the velvet rope is closing soon: The open enrollment deadline is Sunday (Feb. 15).\n\nThe Basics\n\nIf you\u2019re not quite sure what all the insurance industry-specific terms mean, don\u2019t feel bad: My parents don\u2019t know, secretaries at the doctor\u2019s office don\u2019t know, and the president probably doesn\u2019t know. There\u2019s really no reason to unless you\u2019re in the process of shopping for insurance, which, ahem, you are, so right now you have to cram the information into your brain and push out some other stuff about Top Gun or your grandparents. But! It\u2019s only temporary, so don\u2019t worry. Hey, which guy is Goose again?\n\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for a plan, there are six basic factors that, when considered together, determine how valuable your plan is. They aren\u2019t the only factors, unfortunately, but they\u2019re the easiest things to sort by. Here they are in no particular order.\n\n1. Premium\n\nThe premium is what you pay each month for the privilege of saying, snootily, \u201cI am an insured person now, and I will have the hash browns and hot cakes at 10:31 a.m., protocol be damned.\u201d Your premium, if you\u2019re the head of a household like I am, is anywhere from a couple hundred to several hundred dollars a month. (Is any of this getting through? Look, it\u2019s like\u2026if you had 50 Netflix subscriptions. That make sense?) The premium is a fixed cost, meaning it\u2019s the same every month for the whole year, so it\u2019s tempting to make it your sole budget consideration, but you really can\u2019t\u2026.\n\n2. Deductible\n\n\u2026because of the deductible. The deductible is complicated, but people are probably familiar with how it works in the context of car insurance. Do you remember when you had that fender-bender in college and the body shop said it would cost $5,000 to put your Bondo-covered Buick Skylark back to (what you could imagine a Buick Skylark approximating, in its sad, puttery way) tip-top shape? Do you remember learning the hard way that having insurance isn\u2019t like having a meal plan at the dorms? There are still out-of-pocket expenses for insured people, and the deductible is the big one. If your auto insurance deductible were, say, $2,500, then you\u2019d pay every penny of that until the insurance company took over, right? And since $2,500 might as well have been the ark of the covenant for how available it was to the college-aged version of yourself, you decided to let the Skylark rot in a ditch.\n\nIn this analogy, your body is the Skylark. Sorry. But since you only have one body (some exclusions may apply), you can\u2019t just let it rot! What you have to do instead is determine what a good deductible for you would be. It should be a number of dollars that you could conceivably dig up if you absolutely had to, but not so low that it makes your premium out of reach. Yes, if you want a $0 deductible, your premium is going to be very high. Keep that in mind.\n\nGenerally, the health insurance deductible is similar to the auto insurance version, but there are a few differences. In your favor is that you aren\u2019t typically going to be swallowing the whole thing all at once like you would in the example of a car accident. Almost all of your out-of-pocket costs will go toward the deductible in a given year \u2014 excluding, notably, your premium payments and co-pays, which we\u2019ll cover in a bit. On the other side of the ledger, if you are insuring multiple people, you\u2019re going to have multiple deductibles to juggle: one for the family and one for each individual. In my search, the deductible was somewhat less important than other factors because I knew I could pay it if an emergency arose, and because my family is relatively young/healthy. Unfortunately, there is one more key way in which health insurance differs from auto insurance.\n\nGet Your Free Credit Score & Monitoring Plus Weekly Updates From Our 50+ Experts Get It Now\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n3. Co-Insurance\n\nAnd it\u2019s called co-insurance. The name is bad, and doesn\u2019t tell you much. Co-insurance? What is that? I\u2019m already buying insurance. That should be enough. Why, God, is one insurance not enough?!\n\nBut co-insurance is actually the number that describes the percentage split between the insurance company and the insured (you) paid on covered services after the deductible is met. Yes, you will probably be paying money to doctors in the event that you pay enough money to reach an arbitrary limit, which does not include all the money you spent on a recurring monthly basis, and which will reset at the beginning of a new year. You will always be paying money to doctors, forever, until the earth is finally flung out of orbit and we freeze instantly in the vacuum of space. Bummerville.\n\nAs an example, here\u2019s how you might see co-insurance explained in a summary of benefits:\n\nTo the uninitiated, it may look like your insurance company is offering to pay 80% of the costs of a test (the number on the right is for out-of-network providers, which we\u2019ll get to later), and that\u2019s true to an extent. But that comes after the deductible is met, even if the summary doesn\u2019t spell that out in every instance. If your individual deductible is $2,000, you\u2019ve paid $1,500 in qualified costs so far, and your doctor has ordered $1,000 worth of blood work, you\u2019ll be staring down the barrel of a $600 bill ($500 of remaining deductible + 20% of $500 remaining of $1,000 bill). Generally your portion will fall between 0% and 35%, but plans vary.\n\n4. Co-Pay\n\nIf co-insurance is a brutal gut punch, then the co-pay is an ice cream sundae and a tummy rub. If you want to just pay a flat fee of $10, $20, or such and such every time you see a provider, then look for a co-pay plan. Insurance companies offer them, so far as I can tell, because they don\u2019t disincentivize office visits the way big fat $200 bills do, meaning their customers stay healthier and catch problems sooner. In addition to being healthier because you don\u2019t feel guilty every time you want to go see a doc, there are no surprises because you pay your way upfront. Co-pays can be a boon for people who have regular appointments with therapists or counselors, especially since all new plans must treat mental and behavioral health the same as primary care doctors.

Just kidding. Well, sort of. If you\u2019re already on a regular prescription, you know what to look for: Is it generic, is it name brand? Unless it\u2019s incredibly cheap, you might aim to get a co-pay here as well. On the other hand, if you aren\u2019t filling something regularly, it\u2019s probably pointless to concentrate too hard on this aspect of your benefits. There isn\u2019t enough time in the world to figure out which brands are preferred by your insurer, and how much they\u2019ll cost you if you ever need them. My advice is to get your prescription, check out how much it costs at the pharmacy, and decide then if you will be changing plans in the next year. Remember: the Affordable Care Act also made pre-existing conditions a thing of the past when it comes to your insurance eligibility, so you can always switch if your medicine becomes too expensive. But in the meantime, don\u2019t pay (in the form of higher premiums) for something you rarely use.\n\n6. Out-Of-Pocket Maximum\n\nThis one\u2019s for all the marbles. The Big Kahuna. The OOPM (no one calls it this, and you shouldn\u2019t either) functions a lot like the deductible, in that your premium doesn\u2019t count toward it, most of the other stuff does, and after you hit it, something happens. Except, instead of paying some small percentage of the tab like the least popular friend at Bennigan\u2019s, after you hit the out-of-pocket maximum, you\u2019re done for the year. You can get as sick as you want, with no financial repercussions! Nice. Most of the time, these numbers are big for reasons related to the insurance companies\u2019 wanting your money to become their money, but it makes a lot more sense to use them instead of deductibles when you\u2019re calculating your \u201cworst-case scenarios\u201d and whether you\u2019d be able to pay any other bills in the case of emergency. Hopefully, you never think about your maximums, but if you ever do, you\u2019ll be glad they\u2019re low. They also cost less to \u201cbuy\u201d down than deductibles, so they\u2019re a good value, too.\n\nWhat Insurance DO You Have?\n\nHere is the insurance plan I have. I won\u2019t just explain it to you, I\u2019ll even link you to it! Bam.\n\nIt may not be the \u201cCadillac\u201d of insurance plans, but it works for my family. It\u2019s new this year because the insurer, Community Health Alliance, was new to my exchange this year. We have a $10 co-pay, which makes us a lot less resistant to visiting the doctor if someone has a sniffle, but should we ever forget what it\u2019s like to step on a Lego at 5 a.m. and decide to have another child, we could actually afford to leave the hospital without nurses waving invoices at us.\n\nLast year, I had a plan from BlueCross BlueShield that was more than triple the co-pay and deductible of my current plan. It cost me $505.06/mo throughout 2014. Near the end of my term, BCBS let me know they would be raising my premium by about $200. So I decided to move on. My current plan runs me $379.10. Competition is a good thing.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect; my wait time on the phone is longer now, and some of the places I used to go for healthcare are no longer in network. But the months of research, I think, were worth it. Hopefully you won\u2019t need that much time, because the deadline for open enrollment is Sunday. If you move, or lose your job, you may be eligible for enrollment after that date, but don\u2019t tempt fate.\n\nThis story is an Op/Ed contribution and does not necessarily represent the views of the company or its partners.
