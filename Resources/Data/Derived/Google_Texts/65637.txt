The passage this month of Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act highlighted the debate surrounding government restrictions of religious expression.

Just this week, stories like this one at Stanford University in California, and this one at Clarion University in Pennsylvania, have revealed social hostilities against certain religious faiths, at least to some extent.

A new report sheds some light on the status quo in America – especially as compared to other nations.

The Pew Research Center has released its sixth annual report on the “Latest Trends in Religious Restrictions and Hostilities” around the globe. The center looked at almost 200 nations and ranked each country using two metrics:

The level of government-mandated restriction on religious freedom The level of social hostility displayed toward religious faiths

These two factors are expressed in indices between 0 and 10, with zero being a complete absence of either condition.

The 2013 edition of the Pew study places the U.S. at the high end of the “moderate” range in both metrics, with a government restrictions index (GRI) of 3 and a social hostilities index (SHI) of 3.1.

Here’s a visual representation of where these number put the U.S., when considered against the other two dozen most populous nations:

The U.S. exhibits less religious freedom than nations like Japan and South Africa, but much more than India, China, and Indonesia.

The U.S. ranks 82nd in the level of government restrictions. The five most restrictive governments with regard to religious freedom (with GRIs of 6.6 or higher) are:

China Indonesia Uzbekistan Iran Egypt

As for social hostilities, the U.S. is 68th in the study. The five nations with the greatest level of social hostility regarding religious faiths (with SHIs of 7.2 or higher) are:

Israel India Palestinian territories Pakistan Nigeria

Given all of the information revealed by this study, what should we make of the state of religious freedom in the U.S.? The chances of an American being physically harmed or killed for his or her religious beliefs (either by the government or hostile fellow citizens) is very low, especially when compared to other nations.
