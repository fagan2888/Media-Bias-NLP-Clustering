Sam may not even have the talent to play in the NFL, but if the Rams cut him, they may receive a call from President Obama, who, incredibly, called Sam to congratulate him upon his selection. The President did not call any other player selected in the 7th round and probably called few, if any, of the other 250+ players selected in the entire draft. He called for one reason, to show his politically correct support for gay rights.\n\nThe latest incident occurred just this week with Dolphins safety Don Jones. He had the audacity to object to ESPN promoting gay football player Michael Sam and his boyfriend. The network hyped the 7th round selection of Sam by the St. Louis Rams and showed him kissing his boyfriend in celebration after the pick. Of course, the other 7th round selections were ignored by ESPN, who decided to focus on Sam only due to his sexual orientation.\n\nThose brutal examples of communist treachery should be relegated to the dustbin of history. Instead, in the supposedly free country of the United States, re-education camps are used to enlighten our citizens about the evils of racism, homophobia and sexism.\n\nIt seems the politically correct liberals in charge of the NFL are admirers of communism. In Red China, Cambodia, Vietnam and other countries communist tyrants forced citizens into re-education camps to \u201cenlighten\u201d their subjects about the wonderful \u201cbenefits\u201d of totalitarianism.\n\nYears ago, such a kiss would have never been broadcast on television, but today, passionate displays from same sex partners are commonplace. Even though millions of Americans have strong religious views in opposition to homosexuality, our media and political establishment have identified gay rights as a cause that merits strong support and plenty of attention.\n\nAfter witnessing ESPN\u2019s coverage of Sam kissing his partner, Jones posted on his Twitter account \u201cOMG\u2026horrible.\u201d For that expression of his opinion, a 1st Amendment right guaranteed by our U.S. Constitution, Jones was suspended, fined and forced to apologize to Sam. In his apology, Jones expressed his \u201cregret\u201d for \u201cthe inappropriate comments that I made last night on social media.\u201d He was even blasted by his head coach, Joe Philbin, who called the comments \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nWhile some may view the penalties leveled at Jones for sharing an opinion as unduly harsh, the NFL believed they were insufficient. As a result, Jones will also be sent to \u201ceducational training,\u201d to learn about the merits of the homosexual agenda and become more sensitive to the gay and lesbian lifestyle.\n\nThis type of \u201ctraining\u201d is an American styled re-education camp for Jones. He will undoubtedly emerge with a new and enlightened view of homosexuality. If not, he will no longer be playing football in the NFL. Today, in the NFL, and in the other professional sports leagues, players must subscribe to a politically correct agenda or their careers will be over.\n\nThis type of mandated political correctness is also occurring throughout our society, not just the NFL. Promotion of the gay agenda will soon be prevalent across the nation, regardless of the views of Americans. An elite group of celebrities and politicians are demanding that all Americans accept this agenda or face serious repercussions.\n\nIt is quite sad that in a country with such robust constitutional protections, we are forcing our citizens to accept certain viewpoints and agendas. If Americans don\u2019t agree, they better keep quiet or they will have to undergo the type of punishment that Don Jones is now enduring.\n\nWith this toxic environment, imagine what our Founding Fathers would think about their country today.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Welcome to the Gay Agenda Re-Education Camp, Dolphins safety Don Jones, Michael Sams, mandated political correctness is also occurring throughout our society, not just the NFL", "og": {"description": "Welcome to the Gay Agenda Re-Education Camp, Dolphins safety Don Jones, Michael Sams, mandated political correctness is also occurring throughout our society, not just the NFL", "title": "Welcome to the Gay Agenda Re-Education Camp"}, "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "7 days", "keywords": "Welcome to the Gay Agenda Re-Education Camp, Dolphins safety Don Jones, Michael Sams, mandated political correctness is also occurring throughout our society, not just the NFL", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda694\"", "article_summary": "Promotion of the gay agenda will soon be prevalent across the nation, regardless of the views of Americans.\nAn elite group of celebrities and politicians are demanding that all Americans accept this agenda or face serious repercussions.\nSam is now a celebrity, just as journeyman NBA center Jason Collins, who also announced he is gay.\nHe had the audacity to object to ESPN promoting gay football player Michael Sam and his boyfriend.\nThis type of \u201ctraining\u201d is an American styled re-education camp for Jones."}
