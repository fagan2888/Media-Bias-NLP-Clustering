Another area features multiple drums and various xylophones with tones as pure and soothing as a fairy godmother's fanfare.\n\n\"Kids come here when every intervention related to their (maladaptive) social and emotional behaviors has been tried at their neighborhood schools, and those behaviors continue to keep them from making educational progress,\" Heidi Weekley, the Main Street School's administrative coordinator, said. \"... This playground's special features give kids the sensory stimulation their brain needs to help it switch gears. It kind of allows them to go to a different place to better self regulate.\"\n\nJosh Whalen, 8, plays with the musical tubes in the new ADA accessible playground Tuesday morning at Main Street School, 820 Main St. in Longmont.

Main Street School's playground includes one metal slide to allow hearing impaired children with cochlear implants to slide without generating static electricity that builds up on plastic slides and can damage implants.\n\nAs for blind and low vision students, they can let their fingers do the walking to multiple panels stamped with Braille over letters, numbers and puzzles.\n\nThe playground goes so far beyond ADA's minimum standards that it is on par with only a few other public school playgrounds statewide, according to the district's website.\n\n\"This is a fun physical place,\" said Christina Tillery, an instructional coach on staff with the Serious Emotional Disability Program since the Main Street School that houses it opened seven years ago. \"But it is also a social experience where our students can practice how to take turns and resolve peer conflicts.\"\n\nThe transitional program's teachers support students who struggle emotionally and socially to recognize what triggers their disruptive behavior and what coping skills, such as self awareness and self advocacy, they can tap instead of acting out.\n\nBraille lettering is seen at the new ADA-compliant playground at Main Street School. (Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer)\n\n\"For most kids, playground time is one of the most unstructured times in their school day,\" Tillery said. \"So, this playground gives them a place to practice the prosocial behaviors they will need to transition back to their neighborhood school.\"\n\nBuilding from scratch\n\nPerhaps the best part about the new playground is that Main Street School students got to weigh in on its design with Jerry Crumpton, the district's in-house architect.\n\n\"It was designed almost 100 percent by students who all have unique needs,\" Brian Lamer, the district's assistant superintendent of operations, said.\n\nHe added that district superintendent Don Haddad brought up the playground project at Main Street School in 2014 because of the special student population there and the substandard outdoor activity area.\n\nThen, students in the kindergarten through 12-grade program needed to cross a school parking lot on the building's south side to play in an open field.\n\n\"The superintendent wanted to know how we could better embrace that child in the program, how we could get that child to go outside, have fun on the playground and just forget their woes for a little while,\" Lamer said.\n\nBecause the district saved money completing other projects originally underwritten by bond funding passed in the 2008 election, it could afford to invest in the Main Street School's new playground.\n\nCrumpton wove student ideas into his design, and the district contracted with Denver-based landscape architect Norris Design to complete the blueprints. Centennial-based Designscapes Colorado then built out the infrastructure.\n\nDemolition on the existing parking lot began in June. Playground buildout, which includes wildlife footprints sandblasted on the new sidewalks, wrapped up in October.\n\nThe project cost $334,000, Lamer said.\n\n\"Money is so tight,\" he continued. \"But I would say that it was fun and rewarding to build that playground because it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nPam Mellskog can be reached at p.mellskog@gmail.com or at 303-746-0942.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/ci_29114520/svvsd-opening-one-colorados-most-fully-ada-playground", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1113/20151113__15TCCLIF~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Pam Mellskog  \n  For the Times-Call", "description": "Kids transferred temporarily from their neighborhood schools to Longmont's Main Street School due to behavioral problems might view it as a Siberia until they set foot on the playground.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29114520:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-15T04:55:50-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/ci_29114520/svvsd-opening-one-colorados-most-fully-ada-playground", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1113/20151113__15TCCLIF~2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Kids transferred temporarily from their neighborhood schools to Longmont's Main Street School due to behavioral problems might view it as a Siberia until they set foot on the playground.", "title": "SVVSD celebrates opening one of Colorado's most fully ADA-compliant playgrounds"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Kids transferred temporarily from their neighborhood schools to Longmont's Main Street School due to behavioral problems might view it as a Siberia until they set foot on the playground.", "title": "SVVSD celebrates opening one of Colorado's most fully ADA-compliant playgrounds", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/ci_29114520/svvsd-opening-one-colorados-most-fully-ada-playground", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1113/20151113__15TCCLIF~2.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-15T04:55:50-0700", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "SVVSD celebrates opening one of Colorado's most fully ADA-compliant playgrounds", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1113/20151113__15TCCLIF~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Lifestyles", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2015-11-16T12:25:01-0700", "endDate": "2025-11-14T16:55:50-0700", "byline": "By Pam Mellskog", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-11-14T17:00:32-0700", "news_keywords": "Lifestyles, Lifestyles news, Longmont Colorado Lifestyles news, Longmont Colorado news, Lifestyles Longmont news, Lifestyles Colorado news, US Lifestyles news, world Lifestyles news."}, "article_summary": "Braille lettering is seen at the new ADA-compliant playground at Main Street School.\nJosh Whalen, 8, plays with the musical tubes in the new ADA accessible playground Tuesday morning at Main Street School, 820 Main St. in Longmont.\nMain Street School second-grader Aiden Borrell, 7, said to describe how he felt taking a break from school to stand and whirl on the playground's tall, tilted spinner.\nThis playground includes a pirate ship that sways when students shift their weight on the deck.\nThis playground's special features give kids the sensory stimulation their brain needs to help it switch gears."}
