General Michael Flynn, openly told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that Obama\u2019s White House purposefully ignored alarming intelligence reports about the rise of ISIS. \u201cI think that [the intelligence reports] did not meet a narrative the White House needed,\u201d said Flynn. \u201cI\u2019ll be very candid with you\u2026 I think the narrative was that \u2018Al Qaeda was on the run, and [Osama] bin Laden was dead\u2026 They\u2019re dead and these guys are, we\u2019ve beaten them.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an incredible admission. It lends credence to everything conservatives have said about the Obama administration\u2019s manipulation of the Benghazi terrorist attacks, as well as their refusal to take stock of terrorist gains in Libya leading up to those attacks. It also demonstrates that the Obama administration was willing to allow terrorism to rise, to allow thousands of American allies to be slaughtered by ISIS, just so that President Obama could maintain the fiction that he had put Islamic terrorists on the defensive.\n\nIn short: Obama lied, people died, Obama got re-elected.\n\nAnd Obama is still manipulating national security information to defend his narrative of victory in the Middle East.\n\nThree weeks ago, the day before ISIS shot 130 people to death in Paris, Obama said that the terrorist group had been contained. But yesterday, Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a congressional committee that ISIS was \u201cnot contained.\u201d Yet Obama continues to go with his original story and suggest that climate change presents a graver risk to the world than ISIS, because to do otherwise would be to recognize his own failures \u2013 and by extension, the failures of his hoped-for Democratic successor.\n\nWho, it turns out, is quite happy to manipulate information herself for political gain.\n\nThe rip on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Benghazi was simple: she initiated an invasion of Libya; she then ignored the consequences of that invasion to prevent political blowback. She ignored requests for more security for Ambassador Chris Stevens \u2013 and then she covered all of that up by lying about the source of the attacks.\n\nIt turns out that all of that was essentially true. Her emails show that she knew right away what was happening in Benghazi, and informed Chelsea Clinton about it; the emails also show that she passed classified material across her server, and that she met with UN Ambassador Susan Rice before Rice went on national television to pretend that a YouTube video had driven the attacks.\n\nThe narrative had to be preserved in order to preserve Hillary\u2019s shot at the presidency.\n\nAnd power must be preserved in Chicago, too, where Obama former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel reigns as mayor.\n\nEmanuel reportedly covered up a dashcam video of Officer Jason Van Dyke\u2019s October 2014 alleged murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. The release of the tape appears to show that Van Dyke shot McDonald unjustifiably, so Emanuel fired police Superintendent Garry McCarthy yesterday. But Emanuel himself refuses to accept responsibility for stonewalling a tape that would have collapsed his early 2015 re-election effort. Now, he says that he won\u2019t resign, because \u201cWe have a process. It\u2019s called the election. The voters spoke. I\u2019ll be held responsible for my actions and the decisions I made.\u201d\n\nOf course, that\u2019s a lie. The whole purpose of the coverup was reportedly to keep the voters from holding Emanuel accountable. Claiming that he will be held accountable after his re-election is like Richard Nixon claiming after his 1972 re-election that he\u2019d been held accountable for Watergate, and that the people had spoken.\n\nAnd so it continues. The media cover for leftists\u2019 consistent lies in order to protect their power grabs. And leftists continue to lie. Hell, why not? So far, it\u2019s been working just fine. What are a few lost lives when leftist power is at stake?\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News, Editor-in-Chief of DailyWire.com, and The New York Times bestselling author, most recently, of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
