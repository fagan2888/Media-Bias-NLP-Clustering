The D.A. said Taylor and two friends he was with were \u201cmaking a scene\u201d before approached by cops, according to the SaltLake Tribune, which reports:\n\nConfronted by officers, the two men with Taylor held up their hands, while Taylor alone was \"noncompliant.\" Body-cam video shows that Taylor turned toward officers with his hands in his pants before hoisting his shirt \u2014 a gesture officers are trained to recognize as a possible weapon-draw. \"Nothing that Mr. Taylor did assisted in de-escalating the situation,\" [the district attorney Sim] Gill said. \"If anything, it escalated things.\" Taylor\u2019s shooting was justified, Gill said, not because he posed an actual threat, but because Cruz reasonably perceived a threat. \"Officer Cruz\u2019s belief that Dillon Taylor was armed with a gun and intended to use it against the officers was reinforced by Dillon\u2019s actions and the acts of others,\" Gill wrote in a letter to Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank. \"By the time Dillon drew his hands from his waistband, Officer Cruz\u2019s belief that Dillon was presenting a weapon [and ... would use the weapon against officers] was reasonable.\"\n\nAbout that video, it was released with the D.A.\u2019s announcement that the shooting was justified. You can watch that below:\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune cuts the video off after the shooting, so it doesn\u2019t show cops handcuffing their \u201csuspect,\u201d who died shortly after, or waiting for medical assistance to arrive.\n\nGill used the video to explain cops already had a plan for the group of men Taylor was in and why the shooting as it went down was justified:\n\nI\u2019d like him as my defense attorney, I think. He\u2019s a prosecutor.\n\nThere were some protests for Dillon Taylor after the fatal August 11 shooting, but they were not sustained in the way protests after the August 9 shooting of the unarmed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Local protests over that shooting, and the police\u2019s heavy handed response, helped propel the story into the national news cycle. The parade of shootings since that have gone unnoticed certainly highlight the importance of community engagement on issues of police brutality.\n\nh/t Scott F.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "On August 11, Officer Bron Cruz of Salt Lake City, Utah, shot and killed 20-year-old Dillon Taylor, who was unarmed, because Taylor fit the description", "title": "D.A.
