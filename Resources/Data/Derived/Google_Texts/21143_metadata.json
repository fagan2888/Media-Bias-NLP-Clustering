It\u2019s not the only one on that path (Washington state likely will do so later this year), but it is definitely breaking ground. We\u2019ve all seen the images of buyers queued up to make their purchases, read impassioned commentary on both sides of the issue, and endured lame jokes about late-night munchies and Rocky Mountain highs. But this is serious stuff. Colorado\u2019s experiment is worth trying, and it should teach us a lot.\n\nMassachusetts itself has a long history as a laboratory for democracy. The Affordable Care Act was patterned on Romneycare. The Bay State was the first to legalize same-sex marriage; its example led to a wave of other states taking the same steps. Massachusetts was also well ahead of the curve on education reform, inspiring national efforts to require standards in all schools.\n\nBut when it comes to pot we\u2019re laggards. Voters in 2008 decriminalized possession of small amounts, well after many other states. We\u2019re just about to launch medical marijuana dispensaries, making us the 20th state to do so. And while a group called Bay State Repeal is pushing for a referendum to make pot legal, any ballot measure is at least two or more years off. (Meanwhile, we have in place a mishmash of rules. My favorite: In Boston, the fine for smoking weed on a crowded sidewalk is $100, while the fine for smoking a cigarette in an empty park is $250.)\n\nThe pro-marijuana folks believe there will be few negative effects of legalization. Indeed, they argue there will be much benefit, including a reduction in organized crime and a significant savings in police resources. They don\u2019t think use will climb among kids, nor do they foresee any increase in auto accidents as a result of folks driving while high. They point as well to public opinion; an October Gallup poll found 58 percent of Americans supporting legalization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is stiff opposition, however, some coming from credible organizations such as Smart Approaches to Marijuana, founded by former US representative Patrick Kennedy. They fear that legal pot will become simply another product for a big tobacco-like industry that will vigorously promote the use of weed among adults as well as kids (from Marlboro Man to Marijuana Man?). They are uneasy about the effects on work and society from a generation consistently using a psychoactive drug and worry too that pot is a gateway to harder drugs.\n\nThe arguments on both sides are largely hypothetical, however. The beauty of the Colorado experiment is that eventually we\u2019ll know the answers, and, once we do, Colorado will become a model for the rest of us.\n\nThe various state experiments rarely stay in the lab forever. They either catch on (as did Romneycare, gay marriage, and education reform) or they fall flat (as did Nevada\u2019s legalization of prostitution). We\u2019re one country, after all, and in the long run it doesn\u2019t make sense to have different rules apply to residents of different states. That\u2019s especially the case when criminal law is involved \u2014 where something done in one state can mean jail time while in another it\u2019s perfectly permissible.\n\nIf pot\u2019s proponents are right and Colorado\u2019s experiment succeeds, then marijuana will evenutally be legal across the country. On the other hand, if its opponents are correct, Colorado may rue the day it made the stuff legal \u2014 and other states will breathe a sigh of relief that it was someone else who took the risk.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.1692992751", "eomportal-id": 34035, "description": "Colorado\u2019s experiment with legalizing marijuana for recreational use shows the genius of the Founding Fathers \u2014 and no, I\u2019m not kidding.
