I had never fallen behind on my taxes, and a supposed tax lien was on a house I no longer owned.\n\nThe lien was highly publicized and used as political ammunition by my political opponents. The IRS later withdrew the lien and blamed it on a computer glitch but, at that point, the damage \u2014 and the invasion of my privacy \u2014 was done.\n\nI wasn\u2019t the only one preyed upon by the IRS, of course. The agency admits to targeting conservative nonprofits, asking them for membership lists and other data not required while delaying their tax-exempt status. And opponents of President Obama have been subjected to audits soon after criticizing the administration.\n\nWhat we all have in common: no answers.\n\nIn January 2013, a US Treasury Department special agent told me that my tax records were compromised and misused. That was three years after my campaign. Now, in the 12 months since, no one has been called to testify, no more answers given.\n\nHow did Smith\u2019s curiosity become an erroneous tax lien? How did the material end up in the hands of a journalist? Neither Smith, nor anyone else in the Delaware Department of Revenue, nor anyone at the IRS has never been placed under oath to explain this.\n\nFortunately, two congressional committees are working hard to break the stonewall and get answers. The House Ways and Means Committee has joined the Senate Judiciary Committee in an investigation into what happened and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has publicly raised questions about this case.\n\nIn a brutal irony, even if Congress does track down answers, they may not be able to share what they discover with me.\n\nThis is because the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), the agency looking into my case alongside Congress, cannot publicly disclose any information about what it finds in this investigation.\n\nThat\u2019s supposedly according to Section 6103 of the US code which is intended to protect the privacy of personal tax information.\n\nToo bad it didn\u2019t protect mine.\n\nWhat was written as a well-meaning law to protect taxpayers has inexplicably transformed into a shield for the perpetrators. Unless the law is changed, there will be no public accountability for those who committed this crime, no one will be brought to justice and there will be no deterrent preventing such crimes from being committed again.\n\nWhile there has been bipartisan support for resolving these cases, Congressmen Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) and Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.) are attempting to further impede investigations into my case as well as others. Shortly after the Ways and Means Committee confirmed it was investigating my case, these congressmen attacked TIGTA, accused that agency of being pro-Republican and called for an ethics investigation.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine if the situation was reversed. What if, while a Republican was president, the IRS leaked the tax records of Democratic candidates to the press? What would the reaction look like then?\n\nWould journalists be dismissing this as \u201cnot a scandal\u201d?\n\nYou may not agree with my politics, but is this the kind of precedent Democrats really want to set \u2014 that leaking private information is no big deal?\n\nSurely if either of Connolly or Cartwright had a family member, neighbor, friend or constituent who was targeted by the IRS this way, they would be doing everything in their power to get justice.\n\nOne would think they realize if they don\u2019t use their power in Congress to stop these illegal activities, the same crimes could be committed to smear them.\n\nPresident Obama recently said there was \u201cnot a smidgen of corruption\u201d at the IRS, even though evidence continues to mount and investigations continue to be pursued. It has already been 10 months since Sen. Grassley and I were told by Treasury Department officials that we would be given information about my case. What is taking so long?\n\nThe only way people will be confident the government is truly on their side is if these cases are resolved with the perpetrators held accountable and brought to justice.
