But he used his seven-plus minutes in the fourth quarter to do something that had been eluding him most of the season: Make shots.\n\nHe knocked in 3-of-4 attempts, including a 3-pointer, and scored 11 points in the quarter. Afterward, he wore a confident grin. He had figured things out, he said.\n\nFoye\u2019s next step was to put back-to-back satisfying performances together.\n\nCheck.\n\nAgainst the Miami Heat on Monday night, only Ty Lawson, Wilson Chandler and J.J. Hickson among the Nuggets played more minutes than Foye, who finished with 11 points, seven assists and two rebounds. He played on the ball, giving Lawson a chance to roam off of it, and he played off the ball.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the last game, against Memphis we had our young guys in there but we left Randy in there because we kind of wanted him to get his swag back,\u201d Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said. \u201cHe got to see some shots go in for him, and I think that carried over. It looks like he\u2019s got his confidence back.\u201d\n\nWhether Foye gets his starting gig back at off guard is another matter altogether, but that\u2019s not a big issue if he\u2019s going to be playing 34 minutes, and in crunch time, the way he did against the Heat. Foye didn\u2019t whine when he was benched. He redoubled his effort to get himself back on the right track.\n\nThe result has been improved field-goal percentage (7-for-11 combined the last two games), but there\u2019s been a more subtle development as well. Only one of those field goals was a 3-pointer, and Foye is known for his long-range prowess. But he attempted only one 3-pointer in the Nuggets\u2019 loss to Miami.\n\nOf his overall game Monday, Shaw said Foye \u201cdefended fairly well. He made plays. \u2026 So that\u2019s what we need out of him and out of that position.\u201d\n\nFoye\u2019s shooting struggles resulted in Shaw inserting Jordan Hamilton in the starting lineup at shooting guard at New Orleans last Friday. Hamilton has started ever since.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about the team and what\u2019s going to help the team,\u201d Foye said. \u201cJ-Ham, he\u2019s been shooting the ball real well. (Monday) I played really well. We have so many guys. I can\u2019t worry about how many points I score or how many touches I\u2019m getting. Your main focus should be, \u2018Am I doing my assignments on defense?\u2019 And if you do that, like coach said, you\u2019re going to be in the game a lot.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost\n\nPHILADELPHIA AT DENVER 7 p.m., ALT; 104.3 FM/950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Michael Carter-Williams: The sensational rookie did not play in the first game between the two teams in Philadelphia on Dec. 7 because of an injury. But now the Nuggets get an up-close look at the early front-runner for the NBA rookie of the year, who comes in averaging 17.8 points, 7.5 assists, 5.5 rebounds and 3.1 steals per game.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nSixers: Defensively, Philadelphia has had its problems this season, but offensively it is averaging 102.7 points per game. The 76ers have five players averaging double figures in scoring. \u2026 Leading scorer Evan Turner has had a bit of a rocky December, averaging just 16.5 points per game and shooting 40.2 percent from the field. Both are well under his season averages of 19.4 points and 44.1 percent shooting.\n\nNuggets: Ty Lawson\u2019s 26 points against Miami was his 13th game of 20 or more points this season. \u2026 J.J. Hickson registered his seventh double-double of the season in the loss to the Heat, with 12 points and 11 rebounds. \u2026 The Nuggets seven-game losing streak is the team\u2019s longest since they lost the final eight games of the 2002-03 season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Randy Foye finding form coming off Denver Nuggets bench", "title": "Randy Foye finding form coming off Denver Nuggets bench", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/31/randy-foye-finding-form-coming-off-denver-nuggets-bench/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140101_012013_randy-foye-denver-nuggets.jpg", "height": 516}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140101_012013_randy-foye-denver-nuggets.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-31T21:31:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T08:41:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce2d\"", "article_summary": "Nuggets: Ty Lawson\u2019s 26 points against Miami was his 13th game of 20 or more points this season.\nRandy Foye was in the game in an unusual position for him, when it was already out of hand.\n\u2026 The Nuggets seven-game losing streak is the team\u2019s longest since they lost the final eight games of the 2002-03 season.\nNOTEBOOKSixers: Defensively, Philadelphia has had its problems this season, but offensively it is averaging 102.7 points per game.\n\u2026 J.J.
