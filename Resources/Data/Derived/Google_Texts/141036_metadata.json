On his Facebook page, Mr. Nadler has been called a kapo: a Jew who collaborated with Nazis in the World War II death camps. One writer said he had \u201cblood on his hands.\u201d Another said he had \u201cfacilitated Obama\u2019s holocaust.\u201d\n\nDov Hikind, a New York State assemblyman, rented a double-decker bus this week; plastered the smiling face of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on it; and parked it in front of Mr. Nadler\u2019s office. On Wednesday, he took six Auschwitz survivors to the office to condemn Mr. Nadler. Then, when groups including the Anti-Defamation League, which opposes the Iran deal, told him to back off, he delivered a mocking sympathy card and teddy bear on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis immature, babyish, childish whining? Stop,\u201d Mr. Hikind said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m just getting started.\u201d\n\nMr. Nadler said it pained him both to have his pro-Israel credentials questioned and to see Jewish lawmakers who oppose the deal face questions about their patriotism.\n\nHe cited a cartoon on the liberal website Daily Kos, which lampooned Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, as a traitorous rodent for opposing the pact, as an example of blunt anti-Semitism from the left. (Mr. Schumer made a statement of his own, defending Mr. Nadler as \u201cone of the most steadfast supporters of Israel\u2019s security.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been accused of being treacherous, treasonous, even disloyal to the United States,\u201d said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, one of a half-dozen Jewish Democrats who have come out against the Iran deal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAndy Bachman \u2014 a prominent progressive rabbi who until recently led Congregation Beth Elohim in Brooklyn \u2014 called the discourse \u201chorribly gut-wrenching.\u201d\n\nFirst Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n\n\u201cMost Jews I know cringe at these very public battles and the ways in which we can be quite cruel toward each other,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an open letter this week, Ms. Lowey, Eliot L. Engel and Steve Israel, all Jewish Democrats from New York opposed to the deal, wrote, \u201cNo matter where you stand on the Iran deal, comparisons to the Holocaust, the darkest chapter in human history; questioning the credentials of longstanding advocates for Israel; and accusations of dual loyalty are inappropriate.\u201d\n\nDavid G. Greenfield, a Brooklyn city councilman who represents part of Mr. Nadler\u2019s district, was unapologetic. An Orthodox Jew, he said he had received \u201cmany calls\u201d from supporters urging him to run against Mr. Nadler, which he has declined to do.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just another vote,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said before a rally against the deal Wednesday evening. \u201cI actually believe, and my constituency believes, that this is a matter of life and death.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just simply say, \u2018O.K., we\u2019re going to agree to disagree,\u2019 and move on,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond the name-calling is real concern about geopolitical implications. With momentum on Mr. Obama\u2019s side, the chances that Congress can scuttle the deal appear remote, and Mr. Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said leaders in both parties needed to look at new security policies for Israel and the Middle East if the accord goes into force.\n\nThe agreement is likely to foreclose Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear weapon for at least 15 years, even many opponents say, but the lifting of economic sanctions will give Iran more cash that it could use to destabilize the region, support terrorism and assert its authority.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhether this passes, whether this fails, we always have to be looking at next steps,\u201d Mr. Engel said. \u201cAnd there has to be a rapprochement between the United States and Israel. There just has to be.\u201d\n\nBut the bitterness of the current debate will make that difficult. Mr. Israel said that Republican leaders had begun exploiting the rift among American Jews when Speaker John A. Boehner invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to address Congress in March, and that \u201cpartisan Republicans will continue to squeeze the sponge.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublicans who barely knew where Israel was on a map are the new David Ben-Gurions,\u201d he said, referring to Israel\u2019s first prime minister.\n\nThe Jewish left can be equally unforgiving. Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a Jewish political advocacy group that backs the Iran deal, spoke of a fundamental break between Democratic Party leaders inclined toward diplomacy and the worldview of a conservative Israeli government that has more in common with Dick Cheney than the former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. That will not change even if congressional efforts to kill the accord fail, Mr. Ben-Ami said.\n\n\u201cThis is a clash of epic proportions reflecting fundamentally different worldviews,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t paper over that difference anymore.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama took pains on Friday to say the virulence of the debate \u2014 and Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s outspoken opposition \u2014 will not interfere with United States-Israeli cooperation to counter Iranian aggression in the Middle East. In his webcast with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and the Jewish Federations of North America, he pledged to maintain Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge in the region and defended his administration\u2019s military support for the Jewish state.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what true friendship affords: you know that you can mix it up, and the next day we will be the best of friends,\u201d the president said.\n\nMr. Israel agreed that such concerns were overstated.\n\nDuring Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency, a battle broke out over the administration\u2019s plans to sell advanced airplane-based radar called airborne warning and control systems to Saudi Arabia. At that time, Mr. Israel was a pro-Israel activist working against those plans and warning of a fundamental shift of American allegiance from Israel to the Persian Gulf states.\n\n\u201cPeople said this was a breach that would never be repaired, and within a year, no one remembered what Awacs stood for,\u201d he said, laughing.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150828050004,
