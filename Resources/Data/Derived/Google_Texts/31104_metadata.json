The Kansas and Kansas State games weren't too far off from that.\n\n\"It was just one of those muddle through games. Two and a half hours we banged back and forth-- well you can't bang,\" smirked WSU Head Coach Gregg Marshall. \"That's the wrong terminology. We danced with Charleston Southern.\"\n\nThe high quantity of foul calls did make the games difficult to watch. The irony, though, is that the emphasis on fouls is actually intended to help speed up the game. The goal in calling more fouls is to improve upon freedom of movement and, ultimately, create higher scoring games.\n\nThe 2015-16 NCAA Rule Book states:\n\nThe rules committee has embarked on an officiating initiative with the intent of reducing the amount of physical play and allowing more freedom of movement by requiring enforcement which is closer to the intent of the rules book.\n\n\"I guess they're not new rules, they're just calling the rule book is what they're telling us,\" explained Marshall. \"So a lot of fouls and a lot of free throws so we've gotta adjust.\"\n\nThe hope of the NCAA Men's Basketball Rules Committee is that the players will do just that: adjust so that the games will eventually flow at a much better pace. But changing the way the game is played is easier said than done.\n\n\"You can't press as much. You can't trap as much because generally there's some body contact there,\" Marshall said. \"You're just going to see a lot of zone and a lot of free throw shooting.\"\n\nA total of 71 free throws were attempted in Wichita State's game against Charleston Southern.\n\n\"It's gonna be, that's what I told the referees. It's not their fault. They're doing what they're told to do and what they're supposed to do. But their edict is we will adjust. That's what the powers that be are telling the referees so we've gotta adjust.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The NCAA Men's Basketball Rules Committee has placed an emphasis on certain types of fouls being called this season, causing an increase in the number of fouls called on opening weekend.", "language": "english", "author": "Rachel Kilmer", "og": {"description": "The NCAA Men's Basketball Rules Committee has placed an emphasis on certain types of fouls being called this season, causing an increase in the number of fouls called on opening weekend.", "title": "Area NCAA Basketball Teams Struggle to Adapt to New Officiating Style", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Area-NCAA-Basketball-Teams-Struggle-to-Adapt-to-New-Officiating-Style-350281661.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/B61/E5F/B61E5FFCA13248AD8C6923915640FABC", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/465/F2F/465F2FF3F8E843788062AAC29045F7A4.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The NCAA Men's Basketball Rules Committee has placed an emphasis on certain types of fouls being called this season, causing an increase in the number of fouls called on opening weekend.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Area-NCAA-Basketball-Teams-Struggle-to-Adapt-to-New-Officiating-Style-350281661.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/NCAA41.jpg", "title": "Area NCAA Basketball Teams Struggle to Adapt to New Officiating Style", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Area NCAA Basketball Teams Struggle to Adapt to New Officiating Style", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Area NCAA Basketball Teams Struggle, to Adapt to New Officiating"}, "article_summary": "\"I guess they're not new rules, they're just calling the rule book is what they're telling us,\" explained Marshall.\nThe Kansas and Kansas State games weren't too far off from that.\n\"So a lot of fouls and a lot of free throws so we've gotta adjust.\"\nThey're doing what they're told to do and what they're supposed to do.\n\"You're just going to see a lot of zone and a lot of free throw shooting.\""}
