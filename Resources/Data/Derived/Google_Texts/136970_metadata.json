In 2014, which held the previous record, 1,318 deals were announced across 13 health care sectors. Spending in 2015 reached $563.1 billion, another new record. That total represents a 45% increase over the $387.7 billion spent in all of 2014, according to Health Care M&A News.\n\nThe Health Care M&A Market \u2013 Deal Volume by Sector 2015\n\nDeals 2014\n\nDeals Change,\n\nY-o-Y Services Behavioral Health Care 38 24 58% Home Health & Hospice 47 70 -33% Hospitals 102 99 3% Labs, MRI & Dialysis 52 33 58% Long-Term Care 356 302 18% Managed Care 45 22 105% Physician Medical Groups 88 60 47% Rehabilitation 30 19 58% Other 177 136 30% Services subtotal 935 765 22% Technology Biotechnology 158 136 16% eHealth 123 118 4% Medical Devices 113 111 2% Pharmaceuticals 169 188 -10% Technology subtotal 563 553 2% Grand Total 1,498 1,318 14%\n\nSource: Health Care M&A News, January 2016\n\nHealth care services made up 62% of 2015\u2019s deal volume, due to increased investor interest in post-acute health care sectors such as Long-Term Care and Rehabilitation. The Behavioral Health Care sector also gained more attention. Physician medical groups, both primary care and specialty physicians, were back in the limelight, as hospitals and health systems moved closer to a value-based reimbursement system.\n\nThe health care technology sectors were dominated once again by deal volume and spending in the Pharmaceutical sector, even though deal volume declined 10% in 2015. Spending in the Pharma sector was $297.4 billion, thanks in large part to the $160 billion pending acquisition of Allergan plc by Pfizer Inc., announced in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\n\u201cHealth care mergers and acquisitions benefited from a perfect storm of low interest rates and the building effects of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Lisa E. Phillips, editor of Health Care M&A News. \u201cThree years into the ACA, more consumers have health insurance and the shift to bundled payments is under way. Health care providers, health insurers and pharmaceutical companies are all looking for greater scale and cost efficiencies. We\u2019ll see if 2016 can deliver the same level of growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter of 2015 helped those full-year results,\u201d Phillips noted. Although deal volume declined about 10%, to 370 transactions, compared with the third quarter\u2019s 409 transactions, Q3:15 was a record-breaker. Deal volume was also higher than Q4:14, up 4%. Spending in Q4:15 grew 1%, to $202 billion, compared with $199.5 billion in the third quarter, and was 46% higher than the same quarter in 2014, which posted $138.5 billion.\n\nFor more information on The Health Care M&A Information Source or Health Care M&A News, or for a membership to any of Irving Levin Associates\u2019 services, please call 800-248-1668.
