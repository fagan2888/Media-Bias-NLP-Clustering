Saturday night, the Marina Civic Center traveled to Italy for the Panama City POPS Orchestra's 20th season.

The POPS Orchestra kicked off their second decade by giving their audience "A Taste of Vienna."

The 65-piece local orchestra performed classic works from Mozart, Strauss and Schubert.

Michael Dickey, the President of POPS, says the orchestra attracts audiences from across the country.

"We have the local community that supports us, but now we have this audience that's not just from the panhandle, but really from all over the country, Dickey explained. "It's one thing to fold in and make them want to come and experience Bay County and that's a great thing for Bay County and for us."
