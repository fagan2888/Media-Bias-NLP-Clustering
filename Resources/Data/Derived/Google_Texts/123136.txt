Uber will provide free rides to people who want help signing up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act this weekend before the open-enrollment period ends Sunday.

The offer applies only to new Uber customers. They can receive a coupon for a ride up to $20 by using the promo code "MKEHEATLH" on the Uber app for smart phones. Among the enrollment events planned for this weekend are events from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at Community Advocates, 728 N. James Lovell St., Milwaukee.

Information is available at HealthCare.gov or CuidadoDeSalud.gov. Call center representatives also are available to help all day at 1-800-318-2596. And local help can be found at Localhelp.healthcare.gov.

People who do not get coverage this year will face a fine of $695 or more.

As of Jan. 23, approximately 224,719 people in Wisconsin, including 82,131 in Milwaukee and southeastern Wisconsin, had enrolled in health plans sold on the federal marketplace set up through the Affordable Care Act.
