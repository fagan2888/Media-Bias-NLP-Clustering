That reflected the difference of 21 turnovers gained and 24 lost.\n\nFor the two previous years under coach Jon Embree, Colorado ranked 12th (last) among Pac-12 teams in turnover margin in 2012 with minus-19 and was eighth in the Pac-12 in 2011 with minus-4.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we work on every day,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cI feel that we\u2019re better at trying to cause turnovers. I think we\u2019re better at taking care of the ball.\u201d\n\nPractices are now closed to the public, including the media. MacIntyre said he was impressed with Tuesday\u2019s session.\n\n\u201cI really thought today\u2019s practice went better than (on Monday),\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThey had a little more pep in their step.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny that way,\u201d he added. \u201cYou get a day off (Sunday) and then you\u2019re not as good. It\u2019s like running \u2014 you take a day off and it\u2019s two or three days later when you\u2019re supposed to be tired but you run better. I thought the guys did a good job today.\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Turnover margin always a concern for Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre", "title": "Turnover margin always a concern for Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/19/turnover-margin-always-a-concern-for-colorado-coach-mike-macintyre/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140819_015628_colorado-football.jpg", "height": 482}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140819_015628_colorado-football.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-19T13:52:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:19:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaab3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s an area we need to see an increase in.\u201dIn 2013, Colorado ranked ninth in the Pac-12 in turnover margin with minus-3.\nBOULDER \u2014 Turnover ratio is a focus of Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre and apparently always will be.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we work on every day,\u201d MacIntyre said.\nFor the two previous years under coach Jon Embree, Colorado ranked 12th (last) among Pac-12 teams in turnover margin in 2012 with minus-19 and was eighth in the Pac-12 in 2011 with minus-4.\n\u201c(Getting turnovers) is a huge ability to make up ground,\u201d MacIntyre said Tuesday following a morning practice."}
