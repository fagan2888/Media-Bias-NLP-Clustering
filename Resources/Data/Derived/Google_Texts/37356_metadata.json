He also granted an additional $17.5 million for fiscal year 2015-16 for a total of $2.03 billion, and $21 million more for fiscal year 2016-17 amounting to $2.06 billion.\n\nThe added funds, representing an increase of about 2 percent from the department\u2019s current budget, will go toward dozens of citywide initiatives with health components like housing, homelessness and reaching The City\u2019s Vision Zero goal of eliminating pedestrian fatalities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significantly positive budget for us,\u201d said the department\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Greg Wagner. \u201cI think it\u2019s really unprecedented and our job is to make sure we make good use of it and plan for the future.\u201d\n\nFiscal year 2015-16 is the first time community-based programs will be restored to their full funding levels since the leaner budget years from the recession, Wagner said.\n\nIn line with the Mayor\u2019s stated priorities to support The City\u2019s most vulnerable residents and address affordability challenges, the department will work on providing more integrated patient care to underserved populations. That includes a range of services, from a more streamlined system for connecting people with Obamacare through the Affordable Care Act, to access to the new San Francisco General Hospital trauma center.\n\nAmong the initiatives that received additional funding from the Mayor\u2019s budget is the expansion of medical respite \u2014 a program providing beds to homeless patients who need care and would otherwise be stranded on the streets. The $4.6 million to be allocated in fiscal year 2015-16 will go toward preparing a newly leased building adjacent to the existing respite center on Mission Street that will hold 30 more beds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important,\u201d Margot Antonetty, acting director of housing and urban health for the department, said of the additional funds. \u201cThis is the population that suffers the most out on the streets because even the shelters sometimes cannot keep them and even then, it takes a toll on other services they can provide.\u201d\n\nThe city budget must go through the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor is expected to sign it Aug. 1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely not taking it for granted,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit back and relax. We\u2019re going to focus on how the dollars that we have, how can we do a better job of giving people services. \u201d", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "Mayor Ed Lee\u2019s proposed $8.9 billion city budget announced Monday set aside a record $2 billion for the city department with the largest operating budget...", "title": "SF public health department sees record $2 billion budget | Government & Politics | San Francisco | San Francisco Examiner", "og": {"site_name": "The San Francisco Examiner", "description": "Mayor Ed Lee\u2019s proposed $8.9 billion city budget announced Monday set aside a record $2 billion for the city department with the largest operating budget...", "title": "SF public health department sees record $2 billion budget", "url": "http://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/sf-health-department-sees-record-2-billion-budget/Content?oid=2932383", "image": "http://archives.sfexaminer.com/binary/8de2/CA_SFE_20150605.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "SF public health department sees record $2 billion budget", "description": "Mayor Ed Lee\u2019s proposed $8.9 billion city budget announced Monday set aside a record $2 billion for the city department with the largest operating budget...", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JessicaGKwong"}, "oid": 2932383, "fb": {"app_id": 429095550477057}, "keywords": "Department of Public Health, Mayor Ed Lee, budget, Health Commission, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Breaking News, Bay Area", "thumbnail": "http://archives.sfexaminer.com/binary/8de2/CA_SFE_20150605.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "department of public health, mayor ed lee, budget, health commission, obamacare, affordable care act, breaking news, bay area"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdabb3\"", "article_summary": "Mayor Ed Lee\u2019s proposed $8.9 billion city budget announced Monday set aside a record $2 billion for the city department with the largest operating budget historically \u2014 the Department of Public Health.\nThe Mayor fulfilled the Health Commission\u2019s budget ask, which included restoring $8.8 million in previously planned reductions to community-based programs dealing with mental health, substance abuse and other issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important,\u201d Margot Antonetty, acting director of housing and urban health for the department, said of the additional funds.\nHe also granted an additional $17.5 million for fiscal year 2015-16 for a total of $2.03 billion, and $21 million more for fiscal year 2016-17 amounting to $2.06 billion.\nThe news, according to officials, comes at a time when the department is focusing on expanding services that are affordable, including Obamacare."}
