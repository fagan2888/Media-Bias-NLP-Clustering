Despite it being an election year, President Obama said in remarks Saturday afternoon at Rancho Mirage, California, that he will nominate a successor to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia following the justice’s death earlier in the day.

“I plan to fulfill my Constitutional responsibility to nominate a successor in due time,” the president said.

The leader of the Senate, Republican Mitch McConnell, says the nomination should fall to the next president. The Republican-led Senate would likely not confirm any nominee by Obama.

McConnell says the American people should have a voice in the selection of the next justice, and the vacancy should not be filled until after a new president takes office in January 2017.

Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio also say Obama should hold off on a nomination.

Democrats immediately raised objections. The Senate’s top Democrat, Harry Reid, says it would be “unprecedented in recent history” for the Supreme Court to go a year with a vacancy and urged Obama to send the Senate a nominee right away.

Leaders in both parties are likely to use the vacancy to implore voters to nominate presidential candidates with the best chance of winning in November’s general election.
