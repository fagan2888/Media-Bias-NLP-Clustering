Steve Remich for The Wall Street Journal\n\nNew York State reversed course Friday and said it would not take away funding from 16 city homeless shelters that investigators found to be in poor condition, ending a tiff over the city\u2019s near-record homelessness.\n\nOn Tuesday, state officials said that the shelters had an array of violations and that the city had not moved quickly enough to fix the problems. They vowed to withhold reimbursement funding until the city corrected the problems.\n\n\u201cThe violations range from severe electrical, gas, and plumbing issues that have gone uncorrected for a significant period of time and in direct violation of local building codes. Further, several buildings are housing individuals and families despite serious structural issues that could endanger the health of those individuals and families,\u201d the state\u2019s letter said.\n\nThe state\u2019s Office of Temporary Disability Assistance said Friday it was in talks with the city, and the mayor\u2019s administration had promised to submit a plan by next Tuesday for correcting the shelters. Therefore, the state would no longer withhold funding.\n\n\u201cThroughout this process, OTDA\u2019s ultimate goal was not to withhold funding, but rather to ensure that \u200eegregious issues at City homeless shelters that put the health and safety of New York\u2019s most vulnerable citizens at risk are resolved,\u201d Sharon Devine, the office\u2019s executive deputy commissioner, said in a statement.\n\nBefore the state\u2019s decision was announced, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city was already working to fix the shelters, which had dozens of violations, by sending in emergency teams to address violations. City Hall mobilized elected officials and advocates across the city to pressure the state into not withholding the money.\n\nHomelessness has risen under Mr. de Blasio\u2019s administration to about 57,000 people in shelters, up about 4,000 from when Mayor Michael Bloomberg left office. The mayor said earlier this month he would dedicate an additional $100 million in the upcoming budget to homelessness.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to see the State reverse their decision to withhold funding from shelters housing thousands of children, and we thank the dedicated elected officials and advocates who stood up to protect these vulnerable New Yorkers,\u201d said Ishanee Parikh, a spokeswoman for the mayor.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New York State reversed course Friday and said it would not take away funding from 16 city homeless shelters that investigators found to be in poor condition, ending a tiff over the city's near-record homelessness.", "title": "State Will Not Withhold Funding from 16 NYC Homeless Shelters", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/05/15/state-will-not-withhold-funding-from-16-nyc-homeless-shelters/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IL336_NYHOME_P_20150515155227.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "State Will Not Withhold Funding from 16 NYC Homeless Shelters", "description": "New York State reversed course Friday and said it would not take away funding from 16 city homeless shelters that investigators found to be in poor condition, ending a tiff over the city's near-record homelessness.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Josh Dawsey", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "New York State reversed course Friday and said it would not take away funding from 16 city homeless shelters that investigators found to be in poor condition, ending a tiff over the city's near-record homelessness.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-05-15T19:29:47-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/05/15/state-will-not-withhold-funding-from-16-nyc-homeless-shelters/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-23087", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "New York State reversed course Friday and said it would not take away funding from 16 city homeless shelters that investigators found to be in poor condition, ending a tiff over the city's near-record homelessness.", "title": "State Will Not Withhold Funding from 16 NYC Homeless Shelters", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/05/15/state-will-not-withhold-funding-from-16-nyc-homeless-shelters/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IL336_NYHOME_P_20150515155227.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-23087", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-05-15T20:30:20-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01fe\"", "article_summary": "Therefore, the state would no longer withhold funding.\nOn Tuesday, state officials said that the shelters had an array of violations and that the city had not moved quickly enough to fix the problems.\nThey vowed to withhold reimbursement funding until the city corrected the problems.\nCity Hall mobilized elected officials and advocates across the city to pressure the state into not withholding the money.\nSteve Remich for The Wall Street JournalNew York State reversed course Friday and said it would not take away funding from 16 city homeless shelters that investigators found to be in poor condition, ending a tiff over the city\u2019s near-record homelessness."}
