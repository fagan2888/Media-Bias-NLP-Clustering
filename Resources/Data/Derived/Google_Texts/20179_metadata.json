Thad Cochran (R-MS) and Chris McDaniel has piqued the interest of national Democrats, who think they have an opportunity to compete in the Magnolia State this fall.\n\nDemocrats have been sending money to former Rep. Travis Childers (D-MS), who was elected in a 2008 special election and subsequently defeated in 2010, to boost campaign war chest. Childers reported a mere $82,175 in campaign contributions since he became a candidate in March.\n\nThis has been one of the Cochran campaign\u2019s biggest arguments for his renomination. Cochran surrogates are telling Republican voters that Democrats, whom they\u2019re actively courting to vote in the runoff, could swoop into Mississippi and pickoff the seat, potentially putting GOP prospects of taking the Senate in jeopardy.\n\nBut this is wishful thinking. Mississippi isn\u2019t likely to be competitive, regardless of whom wins the Republican nomination:\n\n[T]here is no state more polarized than Mississippi. Eighty percent of voters are black or white evangelical Christian. And the problem for Democrats is that they\u2019re on the wrong side of the ledger. In 2012, 50 percent of voters were white evangelical Christians, and they voted 95 percent for Mitt Romney. They form a nearly unbreakable bloc, and they\u2019re augmented by the state\u2019s deeply conservative non-evangelical white voters. Overall, Mr. Obama barely exceeded 10 percent of white voters, if at all. The complete absence of persuadable voters was on display in 2008. Then, Democrats believed they had a shot in an exceptional Democratic year, when a former Democratic governor, Ronnie Musgrove, fought for an open seat against Roger Wicker. Yet in defeat, Mr. Musgrove inched only two percentage points ahead of Mr. Obama, to 45 percent of the vote. There just might not be a road to victory for Democrats in Mississippi. Nor is there a serious third-party challenge to split the G.O.P. vote. The filing deadline was March 1, and the only third-party candidate appears to be Shawn O\u2019Hara, a reform party candidate who runs for office just about every year. He received 1 percent of the vote in the 2012 Senate race.\n\nSo why the fuss? Party operatives often put out the notion that a state is competitive, hoping that it\u2019ll coax the other party to spend resources that could be used elsewhere. And in this cycle, Democrats, facing the very real prospect of losing the Senate, are trying to distract Republicans.\n\nClub for Growth Action, a super PAC that has invested heavily on behalf of McDaniel, fired a shot across the bow of national Democrats and Childers\u2019 campaign yesterday, listing some of the positions he\u2019s taken and deeming his record to be \u201ctoo liberal for Mississippi\u201d:\n\nThe Travis Childers Record \u2013 Too Liberal For Mississippi Travis Childers opposes repeal of ObamaCare.\n\nTravis Childers voted to make Nancy Pelosi the Speaker of The House, and said he didn\u2019t regret the vote.\n\nTravis Childers has been late on his property taxes 221 times, paying thousands of dollars in penalties.\n\nTravis Childers asked for leniency for Joey Langston, a lawyer for notorious trial lawyer and convicted felon Dickie Scruggs.
