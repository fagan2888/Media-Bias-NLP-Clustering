In addition, she is developing a similar program for the hospital's pediatrics department to give women access to mental health care during pediatric visits (Aguilera, \"KPCC News,\" KPCC, 3/30).\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital\n\nStakeholders say the Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital is set to open in June with a renewed focus on preventive treatment, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nThe original hospital closed in 2007 after reports of inadequate care, and its reopening was stalled by money- and bureaucratic-related setbacks, according to the Times.\n\nExperts say the new medical center has been built to align with best practices for providing preventive care under the Affordable Care Act. For example, the hospital will have a new urgent-care center, as well as outpatient and public health clinics (Karlamangla, Los Angeles Times, 3/28).\n\nSaddleback Memorial Medical Center, San Clemente\n\nMemorialCare Health System will continue conducting a feasibility study on replacing Saddleback Memorial Medical Center's San Clemente campus with an outpatient facility as a way to maintain emergency department services during an overhaul of the campus, the Orange County Register reports (Swegles, Orange County Register, 3/26).\n\nIn November 2014, a committee tasked with researching how to maintain ED access in the area asked the health system to keep SMMC-San Clemente open through 2015 as it considers how to prevent the campus' closure or maintain other ED services, possibly through legislation (California Healthline, 11/14/14).\n\nAccording to Tony Struthers, the hospital's administrator, the hospital's board of directors decided to continue the feasibility study -- which began in August 2014 -- because new legislation has been introduced, making a free-standing ED a possibility (Orange County Register, 3/26).\n\nUC-San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital, Oakland\n\nUC-San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital at a recent fundraising event raised more than $215,000 for childhood cancer research, according to a hospital release.\n\nThe funding was raised by teams of 242 participants during the hospital's eighth annual St. Baldrick's Foundation head-shaving event (Hospital release, 3/30).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sutter Health has agreed to pay a $71,275 fine following an investigation that found safety violations at the health system's Alta Bates Summit Medical Center over the way it handles patients with suspected airborne diseases.
