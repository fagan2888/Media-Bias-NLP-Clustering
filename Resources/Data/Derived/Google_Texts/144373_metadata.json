It also leaves states vulnerable when economic downturns occur and allows long-term obligations to mount.\u201d\n\nThe report, \u201cTruth and Integrity in State Budgeting,\u201d was produced by a task force headed by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and former New York Lieutenant Governor Richard Ravitch, who advised then-Governor Hugh Carey during New York City\u2019s fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s.\n\n\u201cDespite economic recovery we have some very real problems in finance at the state and local level,\u201d Volcker told reporters in New York in releasing the report.\n\nThe report builds on the work of the State Budget Crisis Task Force between 2011 and 2014. This time, the study focused on three of the six states originally targeted for research, including California, Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nRelated: Why States Are Rushing to Give Tax Breaks to Military Retirees\n\nThe report concluded that California under Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown has adopted a number of improved budget practices that have helped the state win four upgrades of its general obligation bonds from Moody\u2019s Investor Service, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings since 2013. Virginia, whose current governor is Democrat Terry McAuliffe, has enacted substantial pension reforms but has struggled with underperforming revenues.\n\nRepublican Gov. Chris Christie and the New Jersey state legislature received the lowest ratings of three states in light of the \u201clarge gaps\u201d in its pension and other programs. Christie has struggled with a number of state fiscal crises, including shortfalls in the pension that have weighed on his popularity in New Jersey and hindered his efforts to seek the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cThe Garden State\u2019s budget practices under both Republican and Democratic administrations dating back at least to the 1990s have produced repeated structural imbalances and deterioration in fiscal flexibility and credit quality,\u201d the report noted. \u201cRatings agencies have downgraded its general obligation bonds nine times since 2010.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, New Jersey has counted on shifting resources intended for other programs to the general fund and has increased its reliance on borrowing, the study asserted. The repeated use of overly optimistic revenue estimates have resulted in mid-year adjustments that are not subject regular-order budget reviews and analysis.\n\nRelated: States Are Spending More as Economy Improves\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, the need to catch up with the state\u2019s $90 billion in unfunded pension and other retirement liabilities weighs heavily on spending decisions,\u201d the report states. \u201cUnless it is reversed by a state court, the 2014 decision of Gov. Chris Christie to block a pension-funding schedule agreed to with the legislature means retirement liabilities will keep rising.\u201d\n\nThe study was prepared in the sixth year of the economic recovery \u2014 a time when many states are still grappling with major funding shortfalls and gaps in their budgets that have pitted governors against their state legislatures.\n\nThe New York Times reported yesterday on a series of protracted state financial battles, including in Illinois, where fights over the state budget and its $3 billion shortfall have hit such an impasse that Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner issued a dire warning that a \u201cmajor, major restructuring of the government\u201d may be imminent.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kansas, centrist Republicans and Democrats have joined in criticizing Gov. Sam Brownback, a conservative Republican, for driving the state into a $400 million budget shortfall with tax cuts passed in 2012 and 2013.\n\nRelated: Gov. Jerry Brown Uses Surplus to Prevent Bankruptcies\n\nSo far, only 25 of the 50 states have passed new budgets, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.\n\nIn every state but Vermont, \u201cbalanced budgets are required by state constitution or statute. However, in reality, there is no common definition of a balanced budget, which leaves open the opportunities for accounting gimmickry,\u201d according to the new Volcker Alliance study.\n\nBy shining a spotlight on the wide range of current practices for achieving a technical \u2013 if not real \u2013 balance, the authors of the report hope to make it more difficult for elected officials to make expedient moves that \u201cobfuscate in the short term and impose long-term costs that fall especially hard on younger citizens.\u201d\n\nThe report recommends, among other things:\n\nThat states be totally transparent about their budget and fiscal data\n\nThat short-term revenue forecasts should be supportable by historic growth trends, while past projections should be assessed for accuracy\n\nThat recurring costs should be covered by recurring revenue. States shouldn\u2019t balance general fund budgets with proceeds from debt or asset sales or one-time transfers or loans, for example\n\nThat states must build \u201crainy day funds\u201d to safeguard essential services during economic downturns.\n\nTop Reads From the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Despite a generally improved revenue picture since the end of the Great Recession, man", "title": "States Keep Using Gimmicks to \u2018Balance\u2019 Their Budgets", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/09/States-Keep-Using-Gimmicks-Balance-Their-Budgets", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Chris%20Christie_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/09/States-Keep-Using-Gimmicks-Balance-Their-Budgets", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Chris%20Christie_0.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Despite a generally improved revenue picture since the end of the Great Recession, man", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6288\"", "article_summary": "Related: States Are Spending More as Economy Improves\u201cAgainst this backdrop, the need to catch up with the state\u2019s $90 billion in unfunded pension and other retirement liabilities weighs heavily on spending decisions,\u201d the report states.\nStates shouldn\u2019t balance general fund budgets with proceeds from debt or asset sales or one-time transfers or loans, for exampleThat states must build \u201crainy day funds\u201d to safeguard essential services during economic downturns.\nJerry Brown Uses Surplus to Prevent BankruptciesSo far, only 25 of the 50 states have passed new budgets, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.\nThe report builds on the work of the State Budget Crisis Task Force between 2011 and 2014.\nRelated: Why States Are Rushing to Give Tax Breaks to Military RetireesThe report concluded that California under Democratic Gov."}
