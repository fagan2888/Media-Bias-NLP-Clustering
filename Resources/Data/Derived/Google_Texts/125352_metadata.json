Recall that CGI was replaced as the primary contractor of Healthcare.gov, and several state contracts for local healthcare exchanges remain under review. We are not overly concerned with the financial impact this will have on CGI\u2019s total annual revenue of [$10-billion plus], and maintain that the greatest risk will be to CGI\u2019s reputation and to its ability to win new business and prevent the ending of more government contracts.\u201d\n\nCGI\u2019s backlog of signed orders at the end of last year stood at $19.3-billion, up $972-million.\n\nFirst-quarter profit was $189.8-million or 60 cents per share, up from $22.4-million or 7 cents in the year-earlier period.\n\nExcluding integration costs of $22.6-million related to the 2012 acquisition of Logica PLC, net earnings in the first quarter were $207.9-million or 65 cents per share, compared with $137.8-million or 44 cents.\n\nEarnings per share of 65 cents missed the analysts\u2019 estimate of 70 cents.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $2.64-billion, up 4.4 per cent from $2.53-billion in the year-earlier period.\n\nMr. Roach said on the call that the federal website for U.S. health care enrollment has been \u201csignificantly improved.\n\n\u201cThe system we contracted to build works,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also emphasized that CGI was not fired by the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cCGI\u2019s contract was not terminated. Our current contract is ending on schedule\u201d next month, he said.\n\nMr. Roach also said CGI is poised for strong growth after booking $2.8-billion in contract awards in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cWe are well positioned to grow as the market gradually improves as demonstrated by our strong bookings of $2.8-billion in the quarter, which was balanced across all geographies and was composed of 45 per cent new business,\u201d Mr. Roach said in a news release.\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.333", "description": "Montreal-based IT giant said first-quarter profit was $189.8-million or 60 cents per share, up from $22.4-million or 7 cents in the year-earlier period", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "Montreal-based IT giant said first-quarter profit was $189.8-million or 60 cents per share, up from $22.4-million or 7 cents in the year-earlier period", "title": "CGI chief says reputation intact despite \u2018Obamacare\u2019 woes", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/cgi-profit-soars-despite-obamacare-woes/article16567250/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/8e7/report-on-business/article16567249.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/cgi-web.jpg", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Montreal-based IT giant said first-quarter profit was $189.8-million or 60 cents per share, up from $22.4-million or 7 cents in the year-earlier period", "creator": "@globeandmail", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/16567250", "iphone": "tgam://article/16567250"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "site": "@globeandmail", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512948019}, "robots": "noarchive", "last-modified": "2014-01-29 12:09:37 EST", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "Michael Roach;Logica PLC;CGI Group Inc.;period;quarter;year-earlier period;first-quarter profit;United States of America;Montreal, Quebec;earnings;obamacare;IT;information technology;Technology;GIB.A-T;GIB-N;", "article": {"engagement": "true", "type": "news", "id": 16567250, "comments": "false", "pages": 1}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bd5\"", "article_summary": "CGI Group Inc.\u2019s role in building the problem-plagued U.S. health-insurance website known as Obamacare has not had any impact on the company\u2019s reputation, says the company\u2019s chief.\nMr. Roach also said CGI is poised for strong growth after booking $2.8-billion in contract awards in the first quarter.\n\u201cDuring the quarter, CGI continued to experience political fallout.\nCGI said it booked $2.8-billion worth of contracts in the first quarter, 45 per cent of it new business.\nFirst-quarter profit was $189.8-million or 60 cents per share, up from $22.4-million or 7 cents in the year-earlier period."}
