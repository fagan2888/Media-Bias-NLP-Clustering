When it comes to teaching Americans how government really works, the Netflix series House of Cards teaches us more about politics than all the Schoolhouse Rock songs and West Wing reruns put together, times 100.

With the debut of its third season, House of Cards remains the perfect antidote to decades of glamorous and nausea-inducing depictions of officials, activists, journalists, and public crusaders as embodiments of selfless idealism and public service.

And this minute-long commercial is the perfect antidote to political ads in which a politician's every minor victory over adversity and minimum-wage job held as a teenager is depicted as a triumph of light over dark and good over evil.

Written and Produced by Austin Bragg.
