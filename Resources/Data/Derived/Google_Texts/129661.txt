A report done by Climate Central shows that the United States can not continue to reduce emissions at nine percent if energy consumption does not change.

The recent decline in CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions is partly thanks to the recession, increase in cleaner gas production and a decrease in coal production. With the recession being the largest contributor to the decline in pollutants in the atmosphere over the United States.

Since 2005 we have reduced emission by nine percent each year but without a change in how we produce and use energy this number will likely start to get smaller or possibly once again grow.
