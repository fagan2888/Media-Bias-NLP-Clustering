BROOKLYN, N.Y., Oct. 5 (UPI) -- A second body, that of a woman, was discovered in the rubble of a New York City apartment building that was destroyed by an explosion over the weekend, authorities said Monday.

The blast occurred Saturday in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn. Investigators suspect the explosion was caused by a gas leak.

Initially, one person was found dead under the building's rubble and a woman was listed as missing. The woman, Francisca Figueroa, was still listed as missing, as authorities have not yet determined whether it was her body found Monday.

Fire officials said 14 people were injured in the blast, which was captured on video.

Furthering speculation about the possible cause of the explosion are reports that Figueroa, 48, may have made a social media post expressing suicidal thoughts. However, officials have not yet found any evidence to suggest any gas lines in the area were tampered with.

Officials said a gas leak was reported at the building in June, and it was repaired. Gas, though, was never restored to the second floor, where Figueroa lived.
