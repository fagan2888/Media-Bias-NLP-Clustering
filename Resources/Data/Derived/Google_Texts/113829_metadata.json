Still, the sophomore proved almost as adept at running the Midshipmen\u2019s triple-option attack as the three-year starter.\n\nSmith rushed for 117 yards and two touchdowns and passed for 85 yards and two more scores, including a 67-yarder \u2014 the longest for Navy since 2010.\n\nHis only hiccup came on an underthrown pass a few minutes into the third quarter that was intercepted by Germond Williams. Navy\u2019s defense softened the blow, forcing a punt on fourth-and-28 on Texas State\u2019s drive following the turnover.\n\nNoah Copeland, from nearby San Antonio, rushed for a game-high 116 yards on 11 carries for Navy.\n\nTexas State quarterback Tyler Jones completed 24 of 36 passes for 231 yards and a touchdown and also rushed for 82 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries. Robert Lowe added 92 yards and a touchdown for the Bobcats (1-1).\n\nSmith led the Midshipmen to touchdowns on their first four possessions of the game, averaging just under 4 minutes and 60 yards on each drive.\n\n\u201cI think the most important part was just being focused,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI had to realize I had one job, and I needed to get it done. Of course you have nerves, but after that first play they go away. I had confidence in myself, and the coaches had confidence in me; that made me play better.\u201d\n\nChris Swain opened the scoring with a 14-yard run with 4 minutes, 2 seconds left in the first quarter, capping a seven-play, 59-yard drive for the Midshipmen. Smith rushed for 19 yards on three carries and completed his only passing attempt in the drive for three yards.\n\nBrendan Dudeck then slipped behind the defense after Navy stormed the middle on its previous two plays, leaving him wide open in the right corner of the end zone for a six-yard reception from Smith. It was Dudeck\u2019s first touchdown reception and Smith\u2019s first touchdown pass.\n\nSmith\u2019s first rushing touchdown of the season came on a 1-yard run early in the second quarter. Geoffrey Whiteside accounted for 57 yards in the drive, cutting back at Texas State\u2019s and Navy\u2019s 45-yard lines on a 38-yard run. He also had a step on two defenders and appeared heading for a touchdown but stumbled after having to twist backwards and fell for a 19-yard reception.\n\nSmith followed with his second rushing touchdown on the next possession, scoring again on a 1-yard run.\n\nTexas State took advantage of a late hit on a punt return to cut Navy\u2019s lead in half at 28-14 with 13:36 remaining. Robert Lowe scored on a 1-yard run, nine plays after a 15-yard penalty set up the Bobcats at the 29-yard line.\n\n\u201cI feel like the defense was playing pretty good in the second half,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cThey were getting us the ball back, we just have to maximize our opportunities when we have the ball and we didn\u2019t do that a couple of times when we had the ball.\u201d\n\nNavy regained its momentum quickly as Smith found Jamir Tillman wide open along the left sideline for a 67-yard touchdown pass.\n\n\u201cThey are heavy on run support,\u201d Midshipmen offensive coordinator Ivin Jasper said. \u201cWe had to throw a couple of balls deep, something game plan wise we didn\u2019t call it any differently because he\u2019s that type of player.\u201d\n\nNavy did not punt until there were about 7 minutes left in the third quarter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Smith amassed 202 total yards and scored four touchdowns in place of injured starter Keenan Reynolds as the Midshipmen rolled to a 35-21 victory over Texas State Saturday night.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Smith amassed 202 total yards and scored four touchdowns in place of injured starter Keenan Reynolds as the Midshipmen rolled to a 35-21 victory over Texas State Saturday night.", "title": "Tago Smith leads Navy past North Texas", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/14/tago-smith-leads-navy-past-north-texas/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/14/navy-texas-st-footbal_lanc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/14/navy-texas-st-footbal_lanc.jpg", "description": "Smith amassed 202 total yards and scored four touchdowns in place of injured starter Keenan Reynolds as the Midshipmen rolled to a 35-21 victory over Texas State Saturday night.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Tago Smith leads Navy past North Texas"}, "Author": "Raul Dominguez", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Ken Niumatalolo"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2efb\"", "article_summary": "Smith rushed for 19 yards on three carries and completed his only passing attempt in the drive for three yards.\nSmith rushed for 117 yards and two touchdowns and passed for 85 yards and two more scores, including a 67-yarder \u2014 the longest for Navy since 2010.\nSmith followed with his second rushing touchdown on the next possession, scoring again on a 1-yard run.\n\u201cHe came in and played well against a very aggressive defense.\u201dThe Midshipmen (2-1) had 469 total yards, including 352 rushing yards, before the second-largest crowd in Texas State\u2019s history.\nSAN MARCOS, Texas \u2014 Playing without the leader of its offense put a scare in Navy, but Tago Smith quickly put those fears to rest with a stellar outing in his first career start."}
