The NRCC has a new ad today against Gwen Graham that features a Tallahassee doctor who declares, "I put my heart and soul into helping people get better, but Obamacare just keeps getting in the way."

Graham has said the Affordable Care Act is flawed and need to be fixed but she does not want to scrap it all together. Republicans say she's been cagey about where she stands while Rep. Steve Southerland wants to get rid of the law. The doctor is Andrew H. Borom of Tallahassee Orthopedic Clinic. He's a frequent critic of the law and has appeared on local radio.

"What the NRCC left out of their new ad is that their “concerned” orthopedic surgeon turns out to be a political action committee operative who has given nearly $70,000 to Steve Southerland, Tea Party groups and other Republican politicians," said Florida Democratic spokesman Max Steele.

UPDATE: Graham today released her own ad, continuing the "North Florida way" theme.
