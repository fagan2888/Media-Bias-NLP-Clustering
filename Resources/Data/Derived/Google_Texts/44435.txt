America's opposition to the Obamacare individual mandate has reached an all-time 2014 high, according to a Rasmussen Report survey published Monday.

More than 50 percent of Americans oppose Obama’s statute, which mandates every individual obtain health insurance coverage. This is an increase of six percentage points from April.

The fine for non-compliance is initially fairly low: just $95 per person or one percent of yearly household income (whichever is higher). The penalty, however, increases every year until it climaxes at either 2.5 percent of a person’s income or $695 per person.

It is little wonder only 39 percent support Obama’s individual mandate. The Internal Revenue Service tactfully described the mandate as the “individual shared responsibility provision.”

The individual shared responsibility provision requires you and each member of your family to either: Have minimum essential coverage, or

Have an exemption from the responsibility to have minimum essential coverage, or

Make a shared responsibility payment when you file your 2014 federal income tax return in 2015.

The report noted that only 23 percent believe Obamacare is working and more than 80 percent wish Congress would either change the law or repeal it all together.
