On the economics side (also known as the benefits side) of things, you have health care, and on the culture side of things, you have diversity.\n\nCulturally speaking, one of the biggest challenges Snead is hearing about from senior HR people at large West Michigan employers is the challenge to attract and retain a diverse talent pool, he said.\n\n\u201cWest Michigan has made a lot of changes and strides when it comes to diversity, but it\u2019s still behind in many other areas. (For senior management), really, the drive is to attract a more diverse population in West Michigan, and that\u2019s been a challenge for a lot of our employers here, especially the larger ones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think West Michigan, despite its efforts, is still a little bit behind if you compare it to another larger city, even compared to Detroit or Chicago, cities like that. And trying to attract folks here \u2026 a lot of employers are really focusing on how can we create a culture where people want to come and stay here. \u2026\n\n\u201cA lot of the issues are: looking for peers. Say somebody is coming here of an ethnic background or a gender background; they want to see their peers in similar roles within other employers, and that\u2019s really been a focus.\u201d\n\nHe said the second major HR issue, the economic issue, is the same as it been for years: health care costs.\n\n\u201cThe other side, and it has been a challenge for several years, is the whole health care cost and the control of that. This is even before the ACA (Affordable Care Act) passed in 2010. This is something employers have been challenged with for several years. And pretty much every year, they\u2019re looking to do something different with their health care plan,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe cost of health care and the need to continue to provide it is the number one issue on the benefits side of the house for HR.\u201d\n\nAside from the complexity of the ever-changing health care question, Grand Rapids is still a great city economically, Snead said. The cost of living isn\u2019t nearly as high as in larger cities, and there\u2019s an opportunity to attract and retain talent through the local colleges, he said.\n\nBut diversity is still a pressing issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived here my whole life and I\u2019ve seen lots and lots of changes, but I think people can still see it as a small town \u2014 kind of cliquish. If you\u2019re a senior manager looking at a large house, a lot of those suburbs with larger homes maybe aren\u2019t as diverse as they would like to see,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInternally, they\u2019re all trying to develop taskforces and policies to begin that conversation or advance that conversation: How do we make our workforce match what\u2019s out there in the world? How do we become a more diverse workforce? How do we change the culture of our companies?\u201d\n\nAon, which got its start in Chicago and is now headquartered in London, has offices all over the world. Its downtown Grand Rapids office, 50 Louis St. NW, has about 40 employees and 60 clients in West Michigan.\n\nAon Risk Solutions works with employers to help design, deliver and administer employee benefit programs and other human resource-related practices and programs for themselves and their employees, Snead said, adding, \u201cWe touch pretty much everything that touches employees.\u201d\n\nAs for Snead, he\u2019s going to keep working to answer those questions about diversity and health care.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised here. I love this area. I\u2019m not going anywhere. And it\u2019s been exciting to see the success and the growth in this area,\u201d he said. \u201cMy goal as I work with these different employers is to meet their needs wherever they are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jon Snead sees two main challenges facing human resources professionals in Grand Rapids.
