The expansion population is comprised of able-bodied (non-disabled) adults with no children. This population is reimbursed from the federal government through 2016 at 100 percent then falling to 90 percent by 2020. States that have enacted expansion and then experienced budget trouble have cut their existing Medicaid program and kept expansion intact -- reducing benefits to the truly vulnerable and preserving services for the able-bodied. Again, we have seen this in the states mentioned above, but Rhode Island is probably the purest example as it expanded Medicaid after the Affordable Care Act. Rhode Island's Medicaid cost overrun issues have been well-covered and can be explored with a simple Internet search. This is a perverse outcome, but since the expansion population is reimbursed at 100 percent, it is difficult for states to cut these programs. Instead states opt to cut programs to the existing Medicaid populations: women with children, children, the elderly, and the disabled.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OPINION: Medicaid expansion is a bad idea and a distraction from the real issue -- Medicaid reform.", "og": {"url": "http://adn-pb.internal.arc2.nile.works/pb/commentary/article/medicaid-expansion-ticket-disaster-medicaid-reform-essential/2015/05/23/", "site_name": "Alaska Dispatch News", "description": "OPINION: Medicaid expansion is a bad idea and a distraction from the real issue -- Medicaid reform.", "title": "Medicaid expansion is bad for Alaska; Medicaid reform is essential"}, "twitter": {"site": "@alaskadispatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "bb45485406c9d670397d6aa46b9c295a"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/akdispatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "Instead states opt to cut programs to the existing Medicaid populations: women with children, children, the elderly, and the disabled.\nThe expansion population is comprised of able-bodied (non-disabled) adults with no children.\nThis is a perverse outcome, but since the expansion population is reimbursed at 100 percent, it is difficult for states to cut these programs.\nStates that have enacted expansion and then experienced budget trouble have cut their existing Medicaid program and kept expansion intact -- reducing benefits to the truly vulnerable and preserving services for the able-bodied.\nRhode Island's Medicaid cost overrun issues have been well-covered and can be explored with a simple Internet search."}
