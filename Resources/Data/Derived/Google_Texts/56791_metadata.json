McWilliams said the results of the data review show that healthcare providers are targeting the services and procedures they need the least.\n\n\"Doctors are in the best position to know what care is wasteful,\" said Dr. Aaron Schwartz, a medical student at Brigham and Women's Hospital. \"The ACO program provides broad incentives to reduce spending rather than targeted incentives to cut any specific treatments,and doctors appear to have responded by delivering less wasteful care.\"\n\nThe study is published in JAMA Internal Medicine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers found that goals to lower Medicare costs by reducing the use of low-benefit medical services have been successful, while care has not suffered.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Researchers found that goals to lower Medicare costs by reducing the use of low-benefit medical services have been successful, while care has not suffered.", "title": "Affordable Care Act hospital initiative reduces Medicare spending", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/09/21/Affordable-Care-Act-hospital-initiative-reduces-Medicare-spending/1261442859799/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/1261442859799/2015/1/14428634701668/v2.1/Affordable-Care-Act-hospital-initiative-reduces-Medicare-spending.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1261442859799/2015/i/14428634701668/v2.1/Affordable-Care-Act-hospital-initiative-reduces-Medicare-spending.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Researchers found that goals to lower Medicare costs by reducing the use of low-benefit medical services have been successful, while care has not suffered.", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Affordable Care Act hospital initiative reduces Medicare spending"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8c2\"", "article_summary": "The Medicare Pioneer Accountable Care Organization, the creation of which was required by the Affordable Care Act, financially rewards health care providers that keep spending below a specified budget while also achieving high performance measures for quality of care.\nCutting the rate of unnecessary services is one of the key ways the Affordable Care Act is expected to lower costs of healthcare nationally.\n\"The ACO program provides broad incentives to reduce spending rather than targeted incentives to cut any specific treatments,and doctors appear to have responded by delivering less wasteful care.\"\n\"Doctors are in the best position to know what care is wasteful,\" said Dr. Aaron Schwartz, a medical student at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\"Our findings from this study suggest that Pioneer ACOs are responding to broad incentives to lower spending by cutting back on wasteful services in particular-an important and encouraging response.\""}
