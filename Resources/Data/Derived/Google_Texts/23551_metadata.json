Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, at today\u2019s Conversations with Conservatives event on Capitol Hill.\n\nWe\u2019re not disagreeing on tactics. We are disagreeing on strategy. In fact we\u2019re disagreeing on the fact if there even is a strategy. I think that\u2019s really important. Because in order for us to win in 2016, to win the White House, to keep the House and keep the Senate, we have to have a strategic vision for America. What are the four, five, six things that we are going to do that are going to be different from when Harry Reid was in control, and from when President Obama is in the White House? So far the only answer has been the Keystone Pipeline. If that\u2019s our vision for America, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re screwed.\n\n\u201cSo far the only answer has been the Keystone Pipeline,\u201d says @Raul_Labrador of GOP leadership\u2019s strategy. \u201cIf that\u2019s our vision for America, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re screwed.\u201d\n\nConservatives say they will especially judge how Republican leadership addresses the pending fight over the debt ceiling.\n\nIn October or November, the Treasury Department is expected to run out of \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to keep paying the government\u2019s bills.\n\n\u201cWe should not raise the debt ceiling without major structural reforms to government,\u201d said Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich. \u201cOur leadership has indicated the last several years that they are not interested in those reforms. They are interested in patching up the debt ceiling problem. We should not accept that as Americans, and certainly, not as conservatives.\u201d\n\nRep. Curt Clawson, R-Fla., a freshman lawmaker, argued that conservatives will have to be more accepting of compromise in order to see any meaningful change.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in calling out people on the same side because we do too much of that and we will lose the White House the next time around,\u201d Clawson said. \u201cI am a conservative vote but I like to look at financial matters in a rational way. What I would like to see on the debt ceiling, on the budget, is for our group to have a seat at the table, to be a part of the solution. Not everybody gets what they want, and as a party we can win again.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing Clawson\u2019s perspective\u2014and acknowledging he agreed with the Florida lawmaker\u2014Labrador took a more subtle position, emphasizing he would \u201cfight\u201d for leadership if it embraced bolder reforms.\n\n\u201cShow me a vision of where you want to go,\u201d Labrador said. \u201cIt might be a different tactic, it might be a different way of doing it than I would do it, but if we can actually get to raise the debt ceiling\u2014because we have to, because if you look at the financial situation, we have to raise the debt ceiling\u2014and you can actually get some structural changes, whatever those structural changes are that leadership wants to fight for, I am willing to fight for those as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Congress faces contentious upcoming decisions, conservatives say they will continue to be combative until GOP leadership shows it has a \u201cstrategy.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As Congress faces contentious upcoming decisions, conservatives say they will continue to be combative until GOP leadership shows it has a \u201cstrategy.\"", "title": "Conservatives to Boehner: Show a 'Strategy' and We'll Fight", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Leadership.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-17T23:35:31+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GT0Q5h"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As Congress faces contentious upcoming decisions, conservatives say they will continue to be combative until GOP leadership shows it has a \u201cstrategy.\"", "title": "Conservatives to Boehner: Show a 'Strategy' and We'll Fight", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Leadership.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-03-17T18:16:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-17T23:35:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "John Boehner, Raul Labrador, fiscal cliff, debt ceiling, Harry Reid, Export-Import Bank, Highway Trust Fund, Curt Clawson, immigration"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf that\u2019s our vision for America, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re screwed.\u201dConservatives say they will especially judge how Republican leadership addresses the pending fight over the debt ceiling.\nWe are disagreeing on strategy.\nIn fact we\u2019re disagreeing on the fact if there even is a strategy.\n\u201cSo far the only answer has been the Keystone Pipeline,\u201d says @Raul_Labrador of GOP leadership\u2019s strategy.\nThey are interested in patching up the debt ceiling problem."}
