Oblivious to its dangers, we soak up the sun and feel pretty good about it.\n\nBut what\u2019s really happening to our skin when it\u2019s hit by the sun\u2019s ultraviolent (UV) rays? The changes our skin goes through isn\u2019t visible unless your face is placed under an ultraviolet camera, which can show what your skin really looks like at this very moment \u2014 covered in dark freckles and blemishes caused by sun exposure.\n\nIn the below video, you\u2019ll see what normal people\u2019s skin looks like underneath the surface, and be able to view changes that occur from years of UV ray exposure. Ultimately, the video urges everyone to wear sunscreen: glasses, sunglasses, and sunscreen all block UV rays, rendering your skin black where these items act as a shield against the sun. The video shows what exactly you look like under a UV camera when you have sunscreen on.\n\nDecreasing your exposure to UV radiation from the sun could lower your chances of developing skin cancer, such as melanoma. Your skin can be permanently damaged from blistering sunburns, even if it appears that your skin recovers. This is because UV radiation goes beneath the epidermis, or outer layer of skin, and affects your dermis and deeper levels. UVA and UVB rays \u2014 both of which are two types of UV rays \u2014 can cause changes to your skin\u2019s DNA and increase your chances of developing skin cancer.\n\nSo before you go outside for even a little bit, don\u2019t forget to wear hats, sunglasses, protective clothing, and most importantly, lather on the sunscreen, especially if you\u2019re outside during the hottest times of the day, when UV rays have a shorter distance to the Earth's atmosphere (between 10a.m. and 3p.m.).
