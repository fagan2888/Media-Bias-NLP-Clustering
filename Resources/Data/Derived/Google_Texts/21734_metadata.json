He was pronounced dead at the scene, Mitchell said.\n\nLMPD's traffic unit is investigating the crash, Mitchell said. He said alcohol and drugs have not been ruled out and said speed may also have been a factor in the crash.\n\nMitchell said the department's Public Integrity Unit is also looking into the situation because the off-duty officer was \"trying to affect a traffic stop\" at the time of the crash.\n\nReporter Allison Ross can be reached at (502) 582-4241.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1p8J8br", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Officials say a man was killed in an early morning crash Sunday in east Louisville after the car he was driving slammed into a tree.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Officials say a man was killed in an early morning crash Sunday in east Louisville after the car he was driving slammed into a tree.", "title": "Man killed in early morning crash Sunday", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/traffic/2016/03/06/man-killed-early-morning-crash-sunday/81402980/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Officials say a man was killed in an early morning crash Sunday in east Louisville after the car he was driving slammed into a tree.", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/22943d3706142b72b33ac5fafa6e3da288fbb29f/c=270-0-2070-1800&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg", "title": "Man killed in early morning crash Sunday", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/Chevrolet", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Companies/Chevrolet", "title": "Man killed in early morning crash Sunday", "author": "Allison Ross", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/traffic", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67e08e819316be0b0613ee360f1f38dd4676dd97/c=912-0-2262-1800/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a516b6984b90fa2846d187e0f484deb793b19473/c=270-0-2070-1800/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fb7f606117e15dc4d8f066be7d1b86be505bcd02/c=0-21-2339-1780/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/86ab9c11f6ddcba05d30d8e702a47c636e657602/c=0-239-2339-1560&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-06T12:20:38.093000-05:00", "shorthed": "Man killed in early morning crash Sunday", "articleid": 81402980, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c233ae9fc8cc752c9313df8fb42bb057c8613e74/c=0-239-2339-1560/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/517d67d82a641bd3510fa80fd1ba159ebf38a4b7/c=1139-0-2147-1800/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Louisville/Louisville/635850086231849714-broken-windshield-generic-accident-photo.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Louisville, Fisherman's Park, car crash, fatality, Allison Ross, Old Heady Road"}, "article_summary": "Illustration (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)Officials say a man was killed in an early morning crash Sunday in east Louisville after the car he was driving slammed into a tree.\nLMPD's traffic unit is investigating the crash, Mitchell said.\nMitchell said the department's Public Integrity Unit is also looking into the situation because the off-duty officer was \"trying to affect a traffic stop\" at the time of the crash.\nHe said alcohol and drugs have not been ruled out and said speed may also have been a factor in the crash.\nMitchell said the man, a white male in his 40s, continued driving eastbound before striking a tree in the 5800 block of Old Heady Road near the cross street of Hopewell Road and close to Fisherman's Park."}
