We will lift our sights again, make opportunity common again, get events in the world moving our way again.\n\nBush, the son and brother of past presidents, has spent the past six months in early primary states and elsewhere making the case that he is his \u201cown man\u201d while asserting he loves and honors both the former, George H.W. Bush, and the latter, George W. Bush.\n\nIn this speech he called it \u201cmy own path.\u201d Although his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, was present in the hall, his father and his brother were not. (\u201cMom, could you ask them to sit down, please?\u201d Bush quipped, as cheers greeted his entrance just after 4 p.m.)\n\n\u201cI know we can fix this. Because I\u2019ve done it,\u201d @JebBush says.\n\nTelling his life story, Bush reserved his most personal remarks for his love for wife Columba, whom he met in her native Mexico (\u201cI was ahead of my time in cross-border outreach\u201d), their three children and his own parents. His mother got an uproarious reception.\n\nI'm honored to be in this position, and I'm gonna give it my all. https://t.co/wV9LPH7uLv \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) June 15, 2015\n\n\u201cI know we can fix this. Because I\u2019ve done it,\u201d Bush said in his 27-minute speech, going on to make his case by recapping his conservative record as governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007.\n\nHe then invoked his vetoes of spending and other measures passed by Florida legislators, a practice that prompted the nickname \u201cVeto Corleone,\u201d a play on the name of Vito Corleone, the fictional mafia \u201cGodfather.\u201d Bush said he wielded that veto power \u201cto protect our taxpayers from needless spending.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I\u2019m elected president, I\u2019ll show Congress how that\u2019s done,\u201d he said, prompting the first of several extended chants of \u201cLet\u2019s go, Jeb.\u201d\n\nBush sought to cast himself as having an upbeat, positive perspective. He pointedly criticized Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent suggestion that religious beliefs and right of conscience \u201cmust be changed\u201d to suit progressive policies such as same-sex marriage and mandatory insurance coverage for abortion drugs under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what she said,\u201d Bush went on, as the crowd booed, \u201cand I guess we should at least thank her for the warning.\u201d\n\nHe also tried to distinguish himself from Obama and Clinton on defense and foreign policy, vowing to \u201crebuild our armed forces,\u201d stand by Israel and advance human rights for those repressed by dictators such as the Castro brothers in Cuba.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d Bush said, \u201cour president and his foreign-policy team have been so eager to be the history makers that they have failed to be the peacemakers. With their phone-it-in foreign policy, the Obama-Clinton-[John] Kerry team is leaving a legacy of crises uncontained, violence unopposed, enemies unnamed, friends undefended, and alliances unraveling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any language, my message will be an optimistic one,\u201d @JebBush says.\n\nToward the end, Bush delivered several lines about opportunity and freedom in Spanish.\n\n\u201cIn any language, my message will be an optimistic one because I am certain that we can make the decades just ahead in America the greatest time ever to be alive in this world,\u201d he added. \u201cThat chance, that hope requires the best that is in us, and I will give it my all.\u201d\n\nBush also made a point of pledging to stick to his guns and reach out to those not normally inside the Republican tent\u2014many of them black, Hispanic, young or poor:\n\nI will campaign as I would serve, going everywhere, speaking to everyone, keeping my word, facing the issues without flinching, and staying true to what I believe. I will take nothing and no one for granted. I will run with heart. And I will run to win.\n\nTwo of Bush\u2019s persistent stances are his advocacy of a path to legal status for many illegal immigrants and his support for Common Core education standards.\n\nCiting recent riots and unrest in Baltimore, Bush made a pitch for expanding school choice based on what he did in Florida:\n\nWhen a school is just another dead end, every parent should have the right to send their child to a better school\u2014public, private or charter. Every school should have high standards, and the federal government should have nothing to do with setting them.\n\n\u201cI know that there are a lot of good people running for president. Quite a few, in fact,\u201d Bush said, adding:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former Florida governor seeks to reassure conservatives, stress his executive experience and distinguish himself from Obama, Clinton.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The former Florida governor seeks to reassure conservatives, stress his executive experience and distinguish himself from Obama, Clinton.", "title": "Entering Race, Jeb Bush Pledges 19 Million Jobs, 4% Growth", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/615jeb.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-15T22:28:35+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QzrBoz"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The former Florida governor seeks to reassure conservatives, stress his executive experience and distinguish himself from Obama, Clinton.", "title": "Entering Race, Jeb Bush Pledges 19 Million Jobs, 4% Growth", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/615jeb.jpg"}, "creator": "@KenMac55", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-06-15T18:16:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-15T22:28:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Jeb Bush 2016, Jeb Bush president, Jeb Bush immigration, Jeb Bush amnesty, Jeb Bush Republican, Jeb Bush Common Core, Jeb Bush Hillary Clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d92\"", "article_summary": "https://t.co/wV9LPH7uLv \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) June 15, 2015\u201cI know we can fix this.\n\u201cWe will get back on the side of free enterprise and freedom for all Americans,\u201d @JebBush says.\nBush, and the latter, George W.
