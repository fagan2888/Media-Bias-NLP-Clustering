The U.S. Secret Service is putting out an all call for design ideas for the next generation of presidential limousine.

The new wheels will reportedly be ready by the time the next president takes office in 2017, just another perk of the job.

The current presidential vehicle, sometimes dubbed Limo One, was delivered to the White House in 2009. The price tag for the car was not made public.

The administration plans to award a new contract by late August to a major domestic U.S. automobile manufacturer "based on the best value to the government."

"The government intends to award a competitive commercial firm fixed priced type contract for development of a new design armored limousine in accordance with government provided specifications," according to a notice posted on the Secret Service website last week.

The project to develop the next "Beast," the nickname for President Obama's heavily armored Cadillac, is occurring in four phases.

"Phase 1, armor development, is currently underway. Phase 2 work will include integration of the armor design developed during Phase 1 of the program. Phase 2 requirements will include selection and integration of final automotive components, chassis, interior, exterior, and test vehicle fabrication and automotive component testing. Phase 3 will be focused on automotive validation and Phase 4 production of vehicles," the proposal stated.

General Motors unveiled the current specifically designed, heavily armored Cadillac presidential limo during Obama's inauguration in 2009.
