Right now President Obama must feel like Noah, disdain, anger and disappointment raining down on him with every day\u2019s headlines. Or maybe it\u2019s more like Rodney Dangerfield \u2014 who was famous for declaring he got no respect.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama pauses during comments to reporters on the situation in Ukraine on Monday. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nForget affection \u2014 once-loyal constituencies now pin his ears back on TV. Hispanics attack him for failing to deliver on immigration reform. The Post reports:\n\nObama was appearing at a town hall-style event at the Newseum to encourage the Latino community to sign up for health-insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act. But the hosts, Jose Diaz-Balart of Telemundo and Enrique Acevedo of Univision, turned their sights on another issue: immigration. \u201cYour reputation has been tarnished among Latinos over deportations,\u201d Acevedo said, referring to the administration\u2019s removal of nearly 2 million immigrants who were in the country illegally. \u201cHow can you ask the Latino community to trust you?\u201d . . . The sharp exchange \u2014 one of several contentious moments at Thursday\u2019s event \u2014 illustrated how far some Latinos have drifted from Obama since the heady days after his November 2012 reelection, in which 71 percent of Hispanic voters supported the president over Republican challenger Mitt Romney.\n\nObama\u2019s historic legislation isn\u2019t really doing what it would say; it\u2019s neither affordable nor expanding greatly the universe of insured people. Republicans now gleefully scan the headlines looking for the latest bad-news story about Obamacare\u2019s flaws. The Post notes the latest problem. \u201cOnly one in 10 uninsured people who qualify for private plans through the new marketplaces enrolled as of last month, one of the surveys shows. The other found that about half of uninsured adults have looked for information on the online exchanges or planned to look.\u201d All that trouble, all those taxes and that\u2019s all the help it gives to the uninsured? It would be easier and cheaper just to send them tax credits to pay for their own, modest-priced insurance if they want it. (Now there\u2019s an idea!)\n\nThe stream of Obamacare delays, flaws, inconveniences, unintended consequences and burdens render Obama\u2019s declaration that everything is \u201cworking the way it should\u201d laughable. And in ads, press releases and speeches, the president is coming under a torrent of derision these days. Obamacare has become the equivalent of a house that turns into an uninhabitable money pit.\n\nIt is worse on foreign policy, where Republicans now openly acknowledge they are trying to help a hobbled and inept president. After passing Ukraine loan guarantees, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor stated, \u201cTime is of the essence, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this bill swiftly so we can provide the president with the tools he needs to help stabilize Ukraine.\u201d Even more cringe-worthy than the House having to goad the president into action is the series of pathetic calls, first 90 minutes on Saturday and then 60 minutes on Thursday, to Vladimir Putin. Putin evidently remains unmoved (maybe even encouraged) by the president\u2019s naive pleas for compliance with international law. (You can just imagine Putin cupping the receiver and smirking to his aides, \u201cI told ya \u2014 he\u2019s still harping on international law! International law, my . . . .) The longer Obama talks, the less effective he is, which must come as a shock to the man who was convinced his mere presence on the international stage was sufficient to resolve centuries-old conflicts. Every time he picks up the phone, one worries Putin becomes ever more convinced to annex a chunk of Ukraine.\n\nThe president\u2019s evaporating aura of authority leaves congressional allies more likely to abandon him, as they did on his controversial assistant attorney general nomination. He sets up his fellow Democrats for a pummeling in November. But more ominous is what may occur as foes around the globe conclude he is weak and even foolish. During the 2008 campaign, Vice President Joe Biden foretold that the young president would be tested by foreign powers early in his presidency; Obama regrettably failed to impress his adversaries and now the United States, its allies and free peoples are paying the price.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama doesn't get any respect.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Obama doesn't get any respect.", "title": "The Rodney Dangerfield president", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/03/07/the-rodney-dangerfield-president/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/06/Editorial-Opinion/Images/2014-03-03T194449Z_01_WAS917_RTRIDSP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-OBAMA-1966.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/03/07/the-rodney-dangerfield-president/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obama and putin calls, Obamacare working, Obama lose respect,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obama and putin calls, Obamacare working, Obama lose respect,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd08\"", "article_summary": "Right now President Obama must feel like Noah, disdain, anger and disappointment raining down on him with every day\u2019s headlines.\nOr maybe it\u2019s more like Rodney Dangerfield \u2014 who was famous for declaring he got no respect.\nU.S. President Barack Obama pauses during comments to reporters on the situation in Ukraine on Monday.\nInternational law, my .\nIt is worse on foreign policy, where Republicans now openly acknowledge they are trying to help a hobbled and inept president."}
