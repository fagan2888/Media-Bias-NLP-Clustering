The Berkeley County Sheriff's Office says a Summerville man wanted for murder has been shot and killed by a U.S. Marshal in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Police say Lonnie Powers Jr. of Summerville was wanted for the December 13th murder of 55 year-old James Anthony Hill of Ridgeville.

The Berkeley County Sheriff’s Office and the US Marshals Violent Fugitive Task Force worked to apprehend Powers since December 13th. Berkeley County Sheriff’s detectives, who had worked with the Marshals in South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee over the past few weeks, received a tip last night that Powers was in Sioux Falls. After receiving the tip, the detectives contacted the Marshals in South Dakota.

A Marshall with the help of local police found Powers. And while law enforcement was trying to get powers out of his car, police say he pulled out a gun.

The U-S Marshal fired once at powers killing him.

The FBI is investigating his death.
