The hearings officer who says her bosses at the state Office of Insurance Commissioner tried to pressure her into ruling in their favor? The office has finally released its report on the matter, and it looks like it ought to be filed with the Department of Told-You-So.\n\nIt is hard to imagine a vindication for a state agency as complete as this one. Not only does the report find the agency blameless, it also finds much to fault in Petersen\u2019s behavior. So much fault, in fact, that the Office of Insurance Commissioner is using the findings as the basis for formal disciplinary proceedings, and termination seems one likely outcome. Not to mention a lawsuit from Petersen, and recriminations before the Legislature.\n\nCommissioner Mike Kreidler and his crew should have known better. An investigation like this was bound to satisfy no one.\n\nLink to OIC report: OIC Investigation of Allegations of Ex Parte Contact\n\nLink to public response from Petersen\u2019s attorneys: Concerned Citizens memorandum\n\nThough the Office of Insurance Commissioner hired an independent attorney to write the report and notes that it had no control over his findings, even the most rigorous self-examination by a state agency would be suspect unless it reached damning conclusions about itself. Phil Talmadge, the former Supreme Court justice who is representing Petersen in the case, says he has filed a public-records request to find out exactly what the agency directed attorney Patrick Pearce to investigate. Was Petersen pressured by her superiors? Randi Becker, R-Eatonville, chairwoman of the Senate Health Care Committee, thinks so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of trust at this point,\u201d Becker says. \u201cTrust is a hard thing to gain and an easy thing to lose, and a lot of people have lost trust because of what is going on in that office, including this investigation.\u201d\n\nFor the last 19 years Petersen has presided over administrative hearings whenever insurance regulations or rulings are challenged, serving in a judicial role that is supposed to be every bit as fair and impartial as a judge in a courtroom. But starting late last year, when a spate of cases involving the Affordable Care Act began coming before her, she says a new deputy commissioner, James Odiorne, began pressuring her to rule in the agency\u2019s favor. The Insurance Commissioner\u2019s office maintains that it merely was trying to tighten up procedures and ensure that rulings reflected the latest thinking from the agency\u2019s management. Matters came to a head when Odiorne dropped an unscheduled evaluation on Petersen in May, just as a critical case involving Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital was coming before her.\n\nPearce\u2019s report quickly dismisses the charge of pressure. He says Petersen had an \u201cextremely strict\u201d view that all matters concerning insurance regulatory policy needed to be aired during hearings, and he says it was proper for Odiorne to raise general issues outside of court, because he was not directly involved in prosecuting or defending cases. \u201cThe actions by Mr. Odiorne did not constitute improper ex parte communication,\u201d he writes.\n\nInstead, Pearce\u2019s report finds grevious fault with Petersen, for, among other things, sending a copy of her whistleblower complaint to one of the attorneys in the Children\u2019s Hospital case \u2013 something Talmadge calls inadvertent as she sought legal help \u2014 and for failing to disclose that her husband, a pediatrician had been a resident at the hospital more than 30 years ago, and occasionally supervises interns as a volunteer.\n\nTalmadge says the report measures Petersen against a code of ethics for administrative law judges at the independent Office of Administrative Hearings, which doesn\u2019t apply to a judge working for the OIC. Yet if the code did apply, he says it would be clear that Odiorne\u2019s communications were improper. And Talmadge points to the strangest thing about the report: Though it says Odiorne did nothing wrong, it faults Petersen for not reporting him soon enough.\n\nThe Office of Insurance Commissioner says the report did the best job it could: \u201cWhile it is understandable that some will disagree with the findings and conclusions of the independent investigator, the report represented the best option to get an unbiased and impartial accounting of the issues at hand,\u201d says spokeswoman Stephanie Marquis in an email.\n\n\u201cThe independent investigator, who has a background in law and who was selected through the contracting process that is available to state agencies, conducted several interviews and examined almost 2,000 pages of related documents to reach his conclusions.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to imagine the report settling anything. Already Becker says she plans to launch an investigation of her own, using the powers of her committee. And one of the questions she will ask is why on earth the Office of Insurance Commissioner controls its own judges in the first place, rather than hearing cases at the Office of Administrative Hearings. More and more it is sounding like a case for true independence.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|editorialsopinion|opinionnorthwest|front|article", "description": "Remember the Patricia Petersen case?
