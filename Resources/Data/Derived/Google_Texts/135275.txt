Family members and friends of Julius Jones marked his birthday by cooking out and having cake.

“We are just here to celebrate our son’s 30th birthday. He was a joyous person and we know he would want to be out here laughing and having a good time on this birthday,” Julius’ father Jimmy Whitehead says.

Jones' mother says she is excited to see so many people in support of her missing son. She says it gives them hope that someone will come forward with information that will lead them to Julius.

“We keep these events going on as a tribute for Julius. Just for that occasion to let people know that he is still missing and we love him. We want to know what has happened to him,” Julius’ mother Tabitha Jones says.

Jones' sister says she hopes Julius sees how much they miss him and hope by continuing to celebrate his life, people will come forward that might know of his whereabouts.

“We do need closure. Stuff like this is kind of hope for my family. We also want the public to know that we do need closure and we’re never giving up until we find out what happened or where he is,” Jones’ sister Jatoria Jones says.

“We love you and we haven’t forgotten that you’re our 30-year-old boy. We love you and just want to celebrate with you today. You may not be here in person but know that you are here in spirit,” Whitehead says.
