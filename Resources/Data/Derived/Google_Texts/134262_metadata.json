( STEVE STONER )\n\nEverything was set up Saturday in Berthoud's favor.\n\nHosting the Spartan Classic at Barnes Complex, the Spartans cruised their way into the championship game, putting up double-digit runs in all but one game.\n\nBut something just wasn't clicking in the final and most important game against Class 3A power Strasburg, which handled Berthoud in six innings, 9-3.\n\n\"We just weren't focused I guess for this game. Our defense wasn't playing to what we had been playing all weekend, and neither was our offense,\" BHS coach Teresa Alba said. \"We just needed to pick it up a notch to play at that level. We'll hopefully reboot from the last time we lost and hopefully accomplish the same things we did last time.\"\n\nBerthoud's last lost, to Roosevelt, got a fire started under the Spartans that had burned all the way through Saturday morning, a 12-0 win over Sterling, but the flame got extinguished by outstanding pitching from Strasburg's Logan Losh.\n\nLosh had the Spartans off balance from the beginning, striking out five of the first eight batters she faced. BHS managed to scratch across a run in the first inning on a single from first baseman Kenzi Villareal, but couldn't get enough traffic to do serious damage the rest of the day.\n\n\"We were kind of tired and I think we just needed to come out with more intensity and keep ourselves up,\" outfielder Jessica Boruff said. \"I was kind of surprised because we are usually ready to go when we warm up. When you have a pitcher that throws that hard, you have to go up there and the first good pitch you see you gotta hit it.\"\n\nThe Indians tied the game up in the second and then pulled away for good in the third. Strasburg scored four runs, two of which were unearned, and seemed to put the Spartans in a hole they couldn't quite overcome.\n\nThey would draw closer with another run in their half of the third, but then gave up two more in the fourth. After only four hits and 12 punchouts, Losh simply had Berthoud's number.\n\nBerthoud baserunner Kendall Baker dives back to first base ahead of the pickoff attempt by Strasburg's Victoria Turnbull in the bottom of the fifth inning Saturday at Barnes Park. ( STEVE STONER )\n\n\"When we can't hit, we have to make it up on defense and then when we don't play defense, we have to make up for hit with hitting,\" Boruff said. \"We can't have both of them going bad. We just need to hit it hard at practice and throw that in the trash.\"\n\nCris Tiller can be reached at 669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or on Twitter @cristiller.\n\nIndians 9, Spartans 3 0\n\nAt Barnes Complex\n\nStrasburg (9-0, 2-0) 014 220 X -- 9 10 0\n\nBerthoud (7-2, 4-1) 101 010 X -- 3 4 2\n\nW -- Logan Losh.
