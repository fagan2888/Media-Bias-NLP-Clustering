Mitchell, SD

A former Dakota Wesleyan University basketball player accused of raping a female student has been found not guilty.



Jurors in Mitchell acquitted 24-year-old Kristopher Wilson, of Lawrence, Kan., after deliberating for about 1 Â½ hours Friday afternoon. The trial began Wednesday.



Wilson was accused of having sex with the 19-year-old woman in January 2013 while she was passed out drunk. Wilson told jurors he had consensual sex with the woman and that she was awake through the encounter and never asked him to stop or tried to push him away.



Defense attorney Phil Carlson said after the verdict that "justice has been done."
