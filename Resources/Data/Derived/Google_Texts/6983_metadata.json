The new bipartisan measures could sweeten the administration on the whole package.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOne bill would give legs to President Barack Obama\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative, by codifying it into law. http://politico.pro/1UHoiLQ\n\nAnother aims to help FDA and NIH recruit and retain staff by quadrupling the number of people eligible for the Senior Biomedical Service from 500 to 2,000. Those employees, most now at NIH, can take home salaries well above the normal government pay scale. http://1.usa.gov/1Z5Eyqv\n\nDespite the sweeteners, the final markup is likely to be tense as Democrats press to include mandatory NIH and FDA funding before the package hits the Senate floor. Republican Susan Collins is also expected to put forth her legislation with Sen. Claire McCaskill to address drug pricing. Other amendments could further complicate the picture.\n\nMeanwhile, the House and Senate \u2018Cures\u2019 leadership met with Vice President Joe Biden late Wednesday. House architect Fred Upton is hoping the cancer moon shot will help propel his legacy legislation to the president\u2019s desk and HELP Chairman Lamar Alexander has said that the biomedical innovation legislation is the best chance for funding Biden\u2019s moon shot. But nothing came out of that meeting suggesting the two initiatives were joining forces yet.\n\nIt\u2019s Monday, welcome back to Prescription PULSE. This week in 1999, Dr. Jack Kevorkian was convicted of second-degree murder for giving a lethal injection to a man who was terminally ill with Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease. He was sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison. He was released in 2007 and died in 2011. Four states now have laws allowing physician-assisted suicide, though all have safeguards and a legal framework different than Kevorkian's actions.\n\nDISPATCH FROM THE PART B WARS \u2014 Update: more than 300 groups are urging House and Senate leadership to press CMS to \u201cpermanently withdraw\u201d the Innovation Center experiment to overhaul payments for Part B drugs. The letter last week came from many of the same groups that appealed to CMS before it formally proposed the rule. Now they\u2019re trying their luck with lawmakers, where indications are they\u2019ll find a more receptive audience.\n\n\u2026 The American Society of Clinical Oncologists weighed in separately, calling the Part B proposal a \u201csignificant, independent threat\u201d in comments to the House Energy and Commerce Committee mainly focused on MACRA. \u201cThis new demonstration not only continues to erode practice resources necessary for the care of patients with cancer, it imposes additional administrative burdens by making participation in this experiment mandatory,\u201d ASCO President Julie Vose wrote.\n\n\u2026 The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review published a white paper on different models for indications-based pricing,which CMS wants to test in Part B. The paper.\n\nFDA PRIORITIES MISSING FROM DEVICE LOBBIES\u2019 MDUFA PROPOSAL \u2014 New notes from industry and FDA private medical device user fee discussions show that AdvaMed, the Medical Device Manufacturers Association and the Medical Imaging and Technology Alliance want a deal that looks very similar to MDUFA III. The trade group proposals say that FDA can improve its device reviews without new revenue. But they suggest providing $4.5 million to develop a portal for electronically tracking device submissions and $6 million to continue an independent assessment of FDA\u2019s device review process for four years. The groups also say they want to provide resources to support patient engagement activities and a quality management system at FDA, but the agency objected that the proposal left out high priorities for FDA including support for supervisory oversight and recruitment.

With that change FDA says that any unexpired period of exclusivity for a transitional product \u2013those approved as drugs that will convert to biologics in 2020 \u2013would cease to have any effect except for orphan drug exclusivity. These transitional products would not be eligible for the 12 years of marketing exclusivity normally given to new biologics. The exclusivity provisions are likely ripe for controversy, since FDA is interpreting the law so that these \u201ctransitional\u201d products may get less market protection than traditional drugs or biologics, Hyman, Phelps & McNamara attorneys explain in a blog post. The draft guidance: http://1.usa.gov/1RTTGBU.

HHS released the strategy Friday, following Tuesday's publication of final CDC guidelines to rein in primary care doctors' use of opioid medications to treat chronic pain. The strategy was largely drafted by the same interagency committee that tried to block the CDC guidelines in December. The document: http://1.usa.gov/1Fdzdag\n\nPHARMA IN THE STATES: WISCONSIN BEEFS UP PDMP, OREGON PASSES BIOSIMILAR BILL AND MORE\n\n\u2014 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker signed a pair of laws last week that mandate that providers check the state prescription drug monitoring database before first prescribing an opioid and periodically after that. Just seven states now require mandatory PDMP checks, according to Shatterproof CEO Gary Mendell, who cheered the new Wisconsin laws. \u201cI call on state legislatures across the country to follow Wisconsin\u2019s lead,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014Oregon became the 16th state to pass a bill allowing the substitution of \u2018interchangeable\u2019 biosimilars for biologics at the pharmacy, the Generics and Biosimilars Initiative notes.\n\n\u2014 The New York Senate and Assembly aren\u2019t going along with Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s proposals to control drug costs, our POLITICO New York colleagues report.. Cuomo wants to require a minimum Medicaid rebate for a list of key drugs. Legislators in the Senate instead want to require prior authorization for any drug for which the wholesale cost doubles in one year. The Assembly wants to expand the preferred drug program so it negotiates on behalf of all Medicaid recipients, including managed care providers.\n\nTEVA-ALLERGAN DEAL DELAYED, IMPACTING PFIZER-ALLERGAN INVERSION \u2014 Teva pushed back the timeline for when it expects to complete its acquisition of Allergan\u2019s generic drug business (the old Actavis) because of how long it thinks FTC will take to clear the deal. Teva had hoped the deal could close in the first quarter but now predicts it could take until June. Financial analysts\u2019 said the delay may indicate the divestitures FTC will require could be more significant than they had thought. But they don\u2019t think the deal will fall through.\n\n\u2026 The delay also may hold up the Pfizer merger with the rest of the Allergan business, which is contingent on Teva-Allergan first going through. Meanwhile, on Friday Bernie Sanders added to the pressure on the Treasury to block Pfizer\u2019s merger and \u201csimilar tax scams.\u201d Our Pro Tax colleague Katy O\u2019Donnell has more.\n\nFTC: PAY-FOR-DELAY DEALS MAY VIOLATE ANTITRUST LAWS EVEN IF COURT CASE CONTINUES \u2014 Pay-for-delay deals between brand and generic pharma companies should still be subject to antitrust scrutiny under the 2013 Supreme Court ruling in FTC v. Actavis even if the reverse payment wasn\u2019t made in the context of a settlement, the FTC argues in an amicus brief submitted to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit late last week.\n\n\u2026 The case involves a GlaxoSmithKline payment to Teva to keep a generic version of antidepressant Wellbutrin off the market while their patent litigation was pending. FTC said the court made several errors, including ruling that plaintiffs must show the payment resulted in delayed entry of the generic. Since the 2013 Supreme Court case, FTC has been pushing lower courts to take a wide view of the types of reverse payment deals that may violate antitrust laws.

It's designed for investigators writing phase II or phase III trials that require an application for an investigational new drug or investigational device exemption. Comments are due by April 17. http://1.usa.gov/1SZ8HHH\n\nICYMI: SIMON WILL LEAD CANCER MOON SHOT - Vice President Joe Biden appointed Greg Simon, a former pharma executive, Clinton administration official and Hill staffer as executive director of the cancer moon shot task force. A recent cancer patient, Simon was most recently CEO of Poliwogg, a financial services company focused on life science investment. He was VP for patient engagement at Pfizer from 2009 to 2012.

That\u2019s about the same as CVS Health\u2019s pharmacy benefits manager reported recently. The PBMs saw less than half of the country\u2019s 12-plus percent spike in 2014. The figures bolster industry claims that 2014 was an \u201canomaly,\u201d in the words of PhRMA CEO Steve Ubl, who also cites government projections that spending will stabilize over the next few years. Drug spending is still expected to grow faster than overall health spending and it remains to be seen what the nationwide figures will be for last year. But the two giant PBMs are a strong indicator of a slowdown. Whether that will take any political pressure off the industry is another question. Hearings on drug prices continue, though focused almost exclusively on industry \u201cbad actors,\u201d and the topic remains hot on the 2016 campaign trail.\n\nMcCASKILL TO DRUG PRICE GOUGERS: \u201cBETTER GRAB WHILE THE GRABBING\u2019S GOOD\u201d \u2014 The Senate Aging Committee hearing on drug price spikes Thursday produced a grilling for a new slate of Turing executives. There was lots of outrage but little news. \u201cWe\u2019re not done,\u201d ranking member Claire McCaskill said near the end of the hearing \u2013 her first since leaving the Hill last month for breast cancer treatment. \u201cSo better grab while the grabbing\u2019s good, because something\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\n\u2026 Nearly all of the discussion focused on the so-called \u201cbad actors,\u201d but Sen. Elizabeth Warren cited a string of headlines about price increases by prominent drug companies and pledged to address the broader problem. \u201cIt happens again and again,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pharmaceutical market may be producing giant profits for drug companies but it is not working for the American people.\u201d\n\n\u2026 McCaskill and committee chair Susan Collins have introduced a bill meant to accelerate competition for off-patent drugs that are made by just one company, like Turing\u2019s Daraprim. It\u2019s likely to be considered at HELP\u2019s final \u201cCures\u201d markup.\n\nPEOPLE ON THE MOVE: WITTY LEAVING GSK, SCHNEDAR LEAVES FDA\n\n\u2014 GlaxoSmithKline CEO Sir Andrew Witty plans to retire early next year; a search for his replacement is underway.\n\n\u2014 FDA said its Office of Compliance Director Cynthia Schnedar left the agency on Friday to pursue opportunities in the private sector. This follows a January announcement that Schnedar had to recuse herself from all substantive compliance enforcement and policy issues due to conflicts of interest because of her husband\u2019s job.\n\n\u2014 The American Clinical Laboratory Association announced that Quest Diagnostics CEO Stephen Rusckowski would serve as board chair for the third year in a row. See the rest of the board announcement here.\n\n\u2014 AdvaMed named Cohera Medical CEO Patrick Daly as chairman of the board for the trade group\u2019s Accel division, which serves smaller companies.\n\n\u2014 ICER announced eight new members of its New England Comparative Effectiveness Public Advisory Council.\n\n\u2014 Vernessa Pollard has joined McDermott Will & Emery as co-head of its FDA practice from Arnold and Palmer.\n\nHELP ADVANCES OPIOIDS BILLS \u2014 HELP approved a package of mental health and opioid- related bills, including the TREAT Act, which would expand medication-assisted treatment for addiction. More from Pro\u2019s Brianna Ehley here.\n\nCOLE WANTS TO BOOST NIH FUNDING ABOVE WHITE HOUSE REQUEST \u2014 Rep. Tom Cole last week pledged that the House Appropriations Committee will protect the $2 billion funding boost NIH got for 2016 \"and perhaps do a little bit better than what the president proposed\" for 2017. The Labor-HHS subcommittee chairman said that the White House proposal to cut NIH\u2019s discretionary budget by $1 billion and offset with $1.8 billion in mandatory spending was \u201cdisappointing.\u201d Speaking for a lot of Republicans (and most research advocates to boot!), he said the best way to grow the NIH budget is through the appropriations process.\n\nFDA SIGNS OFF ON EMERGENCY ZIKA TEST \u2014 FDA issued an emergency use authorization Friday for a real-time diagnostic test for the Zika virus, CDC announced. The test can show whether an individual is infected with chikungunya, Zika or dengue, instead of requiring three separate tests.\n\nICYMI, DEMS WANT RECESS DELAY TO ADDRESS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES \u2014 Democrats want House Speaker Paul Ryan to postpone the two week congressional recess that's set to start Wednesday until the chamber takes action to address the Zika virus, opioid addiction and the Flint water disaster. More here. Hillary Clinton also blasted Congress for not acting on Zika in a scathing Medium post here.\n\nCATCHING OUR ATTENTION: PHARMA DOLLARS DRIVE PRESCRIPTIONS \u2014 Pharmaceutical company payments and perks for doctors do in fact mirror drug prescribing practices, a new ProPublica analysis finds. Doctors long denied it, but the research shows those who receive payments tend to prescribe a higher percentage of brand-name drugs compared to doctors who didn\u2019t. ProPublica has been tracking company payments to doctors since 2010, and found that 75 percent of doctors across five medical specialties received at least one payment from a company in 2014. Doctors who prescribe brand-name drugs say they are acting in their patients' best interest.\n\n** A message from The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association: PBMs are projected to save employers, unions, government programs, and consumers $654 billion - up to 30 percent - on drug benefit costs over the next decade. PBMs reduce drug costs by: \u00b7 Offering Amazon-style home delivery of medications and creating select networks of more affordable pharmacies; \u00b7 Encouraging the use of generics and more affordable brand medications; \u00b7 Negotiating rebates from drug manufacturers and discounts from drugstores; \u00b7 Managing high-cost specialty medications; and \u00b7 Reducing waste and improving adherence.
