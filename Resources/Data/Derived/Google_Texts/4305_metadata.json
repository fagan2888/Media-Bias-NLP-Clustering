He said he expects at least some weather-related flight delays, possibly some significant.\n\nWhile he said Philadelphia is unlikely to see more than a slushy inch or two of snow sticking, he predicts more accumulation to the north and west of the city, with mostly rain to the south in Delaware and along the Jersey Shore.\n\nProblems driving would mostly be expected to the north and west of Philadelphia on Wednesday, Dombek said. Thanksgiving is looking cold but dry, with some wind, but nothing significant enough to affect the parade, he said.\n\nThe swings in weather from cold to warm to snow are not unusual for this time of year. Fall is a transition season and a \"roller coaster ride in temperature\" is typical even late in the season, Dombek said.
