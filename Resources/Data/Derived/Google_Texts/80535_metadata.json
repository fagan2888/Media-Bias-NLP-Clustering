(Photo: torbakhopper/Flickr)\n\nFor many employers, wage theft makes good business sense. The probability of getting caught refusing to pay a worker overtime, shaving hours off their check or paying less than the minimum wage is low. And even in the small number of cases pursued by victims that see the inside of a courtroom, employees often only recover a fraction of what they\u2019re owed. A new law in Connecticut, however, aims to change this.\n\nThis Wednesday, Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy signed into law Senate Bill 914, a measure that will allow victims of wage theft to collect double the amount due them. By making the cost of breaking the law outweigh the cost of following it, business owners will be deterred from committing the crime in the first place.\n\n\u201cThis is going to mean the transfer of millions of dollars each year from cheating employers to low-wage workers,\u201d says James Bhandary-Alexander, a lawyer for New Haven Legal Assistance who represents victims of wage theft.\n\nAnd yet, as Bhandary-Alexander notes, SB-914 is only a \u201cmodest\u201d step in providing workers fair compensation. Passed after years of effort by workers, immigrant rights advocates and myriad grassroots organizations, SB-914 paradoxically illustrates how large the holes are in existing labor laws across the country\u2014and what an uphill struggle it will be to achieve what Bhandary-Alexander calls \u201cmajor\u201d progress: a $15 and hour minimum wage, fair scheduling legislation, the elimination of tip credit and other provisions.\n\n\u201cWe can see now how big a battle it is,\u201d he added.\n\nDouble Down, Triple to Go\n\nThe new law is intended to alleviate a number of gaping holes in state law that allowed bosses to get away with stealing workers\u2019 wages. Up until now, Connecticut employees had to prove \u201cbad faith, arbitrariness or unreasonableness\u201d on the employer\u2019s part in addition to wage theft, making it extremely difficult for victims to collect. Courts regularly construed \u201cbad faith\u201d so narrowly that the majority of wage theft charges couldn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nIn a 2010 case, for example, Ann Maratea was denied double damages because a Connecticut Superior Court held that her employer, Taylor Freezer, supposedly was \u201cunaware\u201d that it had to pay overtime for the entire 10-year period she worked there. According to the court, \u201calthough it was known to management personnel that Ann Maratea would arrive \u2026 well before the official 8 a.m. start of the work day,\u201d failure to pay a single cent for the 10 extra hours Maratea put in every week for a decade didn\u2019t amount to proof of employer \u201cbad faith.\u201d And so the judge ruled that Taylor Freezer didn\u2019t have to pay Maratea the full amount she would seemingly be legally entitled to.\n\nNow, in order to avoid paying double damages, employers who commit wage theft must demonstrate that they undertook specific investigation into how much constitutes a legal wage, and then somehow made a mistake. SB-914 lifts the burden of proof from the employee to the employer.\n\nThis is crucial because provisions under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act for double damages only apply to workers who are part of \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d and those whose employers make over $500,000 a year. This means that, for millions of workers around the country, federal wage law simply doesn\u2019t apply\u2014making legislation at the state level, including SB-914, their only recourse.\n\nStill, even advocates who pushed for the law say it\u2019s far from ideal.\n\n\u201cTo be honest,\u201d said Megan Fountain, an organizer with Unidad Latina en Acci\u00f3n (ULA), a grassroots workers\u2019 and immigrants\u2019 rights organization whose members lobbied hard for the law, \u201cSB-914 is nowhere close to the best wage theft laws in the country. Ten states make an employer liable for triple damages.\u201d\n\nBut even among those states that provide for treble damages (Arizona, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska North Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia), few make the grade in wage theft prevention. According to one 2012 study which gave states a letter grade based on the strength of their wage theft prevention laws, the two highest-ranking states, New York and Massachusetts, only got a C+ and a C. Connecticut brought home a D\u2014and 18 states scored effectively zero.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say wage theft is the biggest crime wave in the country,\u201d Bhandary-Alexander added.\n\nOrganize, Organize, Organize\n\nIn 1938, Congress passed the nation\u2019s first-ever wage law, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which made double damages a federal requirement. Yet nearly a century later, the gap between actual practice and national paper provisions is enormous.\n\nIn protests that continue to ripple across the country, workers have attested to the variety of ways by which they are deprived of their due pay: Employers regularly pay below minimum wage, withhold overtime pay or tips, misclassify their employees as independent contractors and engage in a whole host of other tactics to pay workers less than what they are legally owed. In many industries, wage theft is endemic.\n\nNational studies find that over 60 percent of workers in low-wage industries suffer wage violations each week, and that wage theft costs workers $50 billion a year. In 2013, the Connecticut Department of Labor recovered $6.5 million in unpaid wages. But many workers use civil suits instead of going through the DOL, and one can safely assume that many did not file complaints because of language barriers or fear of retaliation. The way the legal odds are stacked\u2014and thanks to years of budget cuts that have reduced DOL Wage and Hour investigators to only about 20 percent their number in the 1970s\u2014there are few incentives for an employer to not steal wages.\n\nIn her testimony in front of the Connecticut state senate in support of the new law, Karim Calle, a full-time student and worker from East Haven who said that in years past she had made as little as $30 a day waitressing, told the court what can happen to a worker trying to get back stolen wages. Calle spoke about two nail salons in Darien and New Canaan where manicurists were discriminated against, sexually harassed by their boss and paid neither minimum wage nor overtime. In addition, workers developed health problems because of the toxic chemicals they came into contact with daily.\n\nIn 2008, six of the women who worked in the salons filed a lawsuit for $370,000 in stolen wages. As the case wound its way through the courts, the employer\u2019s three houses suddenly went into foreclosure, and he sold the two salons to his niece before disappearing. \u201cFraudulent employers use these practices frequently,\u201d Calle said. Even though the court came to a judgment for $209,000, the employees had no way to collect it.\n\nCalle is a member of ULA, and fought hard for SB-914 as part of a package of laws, including one that would have brought wage liens to Connecticut. Wage liens enable workers to put a legal hold on an employer\u2019s property when filing a wage theft claim and ensure that an employer can\u2019t \u201cdisappear\u201d assets before being ordered to pay what they owe\u2014as the nail salon owner did.\n\nLiens have been used successfully in Wisconsin, Maryland, Alaska, Idaho and Washington, and are being fought for in states like New York, where it\u2019s known as the SWEAT bill (Securing Wages Earned Against Theft). Yet SB-914 is the only bill of the group that made it through the Connecticut Congress thus far.\n\nYet perhaps the most important advance to come out of SB-914 was the high level of community and worker organization that coalesced around the law. Groups like ULA joined forces with Legal Services lawyers, union members, local students, activists from the Connecticut Immigrants\u2019 Rights Alliance, the Fight for $15 campaign and others to secure the bill\u2019s passage. According to Calle, this coalition is what made the bill\u2019s passage successful.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a legal problem,\u201d said Bhandary-Alexander, \u201cit\u2019s a political problem and a cultural problem, too. We need to keep fighting the legal battles, yes, and keep increasing the cost of wage theft, but, on the bottom end, it\u2019s organizing, organizing, organizing\u2026 SB-914 shows you both what you can do with not a ton of resources but a lot of patience and energy,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut the question is, how do we accomplish more?\u201d\n\nThe law becomes effective October 1, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "In protests that continue to ripple across the country, workers have attested to the variety of ways by which they are deprived of their due pay.", "title": "Connecticut Just Passed a Law Requiring Bosses Who Steal Workers' Wages to Pay Them Back Double", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "In protests that continue to ripple across the country, workers have attested to the variety of ways by which they are deprived of their due pay.", "title": "Connecticut Just Passed a Law Requiring Bosses Who Steal Workers' Wages to Pay Them Back Double", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/31680-connecticut-just-passed-a-law-requiring-bosses-who-steal-workers-wages-to-pay-them-back-double", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2015_07/2015_0703wg_.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "twitter": {"description": "In protests that continue to ripple across the country, workers have attested to the variety of ways by which they are deprived of their due pay.", "title": "Connecticut Just Passed a Law Requiring Bosses Who Steal Workers&#039; Wages to Pay Them Back Double", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2015_07/2015_0703wg_.jpg", "creator": "@truthout", "site": "@truthout", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "author": "Ava Tomasula y Garcia", "keywords": "Activism, labor, labor laws, living wage, minimum wage, wage theft, economy and labor, wages, Activism, Economy and Labor, Labor, Living Wage, Minimum Wage, wage theft, wages", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16ed\"", "article_summary": "Organize, Organize, OrganizeIn 1938, Congress passed the nation\u2019s first-ever wage law, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which made double damages a federal requirement.\n(Photo: torbakhopper/Flickr)For many employers, wage theft makes good business sense.\nCourts regularly construed \u201cbad faith\u201d so narrowly that the majority of wage theft charges couldn\u2019t pass muster.\nNational studies find that over 60 percent of workers in low-wage industries suffer wage violations each week, and that wage theft costs workers $50 billion a year.\nThis Wednesday, Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy signed into law Senate Bill 914, a measure that will allow victims of wage theft to collect double the amount due them."}
