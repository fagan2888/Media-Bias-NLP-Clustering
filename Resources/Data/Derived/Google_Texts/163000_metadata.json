Ted Cruz (R-TX) defended his decision to sign a letter penned by his colleague Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and signed by 46 other Republicans senators warning the Iranian regime that any deal that doesn\u2019t receive approval from the U.S. Senate stands the chance of being negated by a future administrations.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAccording to Cruz, the intent of the letter was to ensure that the United States\u2019 national security were preserved. However, co-host Mika Brzezinski suggested otherwise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still stuck on the fact that you are saying to me that what\u2019s happening now in terms of the hardliners using the letter to stall on these negotiations was actually a part of your intention,\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cIt just seems extremely destructive.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not inappropriate for Congress to have a say and to have a voice and that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut to interfere with a negotiation with Iran, and to actually possibly even undermine a deal in the making \u2014 basically the next step to that is to just get right down the road to war.\u201d\n\nCo-host Joe Scarborough pushed back against Brzezinski\u2019s charges, suggesting her analysis mentioning the possibility of war wasn\u2019t necessarily the case and noted there is a past precedent of members of Congress challenging a commander-in-chief\u2019s foreign policy abroad.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz, Mika Brzezinski Spar Over Iran Letter", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ted Cruz, Mika Brzezinski Spar Over Iran Letter", "title": "Ted Cruz, Mika Brzezinski Spar Over Iran Letter - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 720, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/Cruz317a.jpg", "height": 540}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/03/17/ted-cruz-mika-brzezinski-spar-over-iran-letter/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz, Mika Brzezinski Spar Over Iran Letter", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/Cruz317a.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz, Mika Brzezinski Spar Over Iran Letter - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "iran letter, Mika Brzezinski, Morning Joe, Ted Cruz,Breitbart TV, Middle East,Ted Cruz Mika Brzezinski", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-03-17T07:04:16-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Middle East"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7bc7\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAccording to Cruz, the intent of the letter was to ensure that the United States\u2019 national security were preserved.\nHowever, co-host Mika Brzezinski suggested otherwise.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not inappropriate for Congress to have a say and to have a voice and that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for,\u201d she continued.\n\u201cI\u2019m still stuck on the fact that you are saying to me that what\u2019s happening now in terms of the hardliners using the letter to stall on these negotiations was actually a part of your intention,\u201d Brzezinski said.\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"}
