MIAMI - Michelle Obama arrived at the Jessie Trice Community Health Center in Miami for a brief but memorable visit Wednesday afternoon.

"We've got 4 million people who have signed up for health care, and that is a milestone," Obama said. "That's a very good thing."

The first lady moved from table to table where health care navigators were signing up people for health insurance.

"We have seen a tremendous amount of individuals enrolling in this last month," Annie Neaseman, president and CEO of the Jessie Trice Community Health Center, told Local 10. "We're averaging about 89-90 patients a day. â€¦ I think individuals are understanding that this a tremendous opportunity for them."

Florida has led enrollment efforts among the states relying on the federal exchange with nearly 300,000. Her visit was one of several around the country this month to bolster enrollment figures that will, in part, determine the success of President Barack Obama's administration.

About 4 million in the U.S. have enrolled in health plans under the Affordable Care Act so far, but that's still far away from the White House's unofficial goal of having 7 million by the end of March.
