GENEVA – U.S. Senator Deb Fischer hosted a public forum Wednesday in Geneva at the local VFW.

Beginning on Tuesday, Sen. Fischer held a series of “community coffee” forums in North Platte, Kearney, Hastings and Crete.

Sen. Fischer says these forums are a convenient way for her to speak with Nebraskans in an informal setting.

“It’s just so important to be out and listen to people, hear their concerns, hear their ideas and I learn so much about what’s going on in the communities so it’s always fun to be out across Nebraska and it’s also informative for me.”

Many topics were explored, including social security, the 2016 Presidential Election, the Trans Canada Pipeline and Obamacare.

“I hope that we will come back and address health care and work together and look at things like carrying your insurance across state lines. To be able to cut back on lawsuits. In Nebraska, we cap liability. We should be doing it at the federal level as well.”
