The seat is currently held by Rep. Vicky Hartzler. He recently retired from the University of Missouri Health System.\n\n\u201cRetirement gave me an opportunity to do something, to address some of the problems I perceived,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cI have my health and the vitality to do that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. I\u2019m a first-time political candidate \u2014 I turned 67 in September \u2014 but I have familiarity with the political process, which is part of the background for this campaign.\u201d\n\nDuring his time as associate chief of staff for research and academia at the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital in Columbia, he was asked by his superior to investigate allegations a nurse was killing patients. He said he anticipated finding nothing, but his investigation proved the allegations were true. Christensen said VA officials stalled and \u201ccovered up\u201d what was going on. He said eventually the claims were substantiated and published.\n\nDuring the long process, Christensen testified before Congress on several occasions, and he said that familiarity with government and his willingness to speak his mind make him a good political candidate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s water under the bridge, but what it taught me was the oversight was actually Congress and whether it was Republican or Democrat, they were dropping the ball and it could be because they were unfamiliar with science, medicine, hospitals, or distracted by having to campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what, but it was very clear to me Congress was a major role in doing all this (with the VA). I wanted to run for office in part to address those issues but also to show this could be done in a better way.\u201d\n\nChristensen retired earlier this year from the University of Missouri Heath System where he served as Chief of Staff from 2008-09 and was a professor and physician for 27 years. Before his time at MU, Christensen was credited with the discovery of \u201can overlooked skin bacteria that caused often fatal infections in intravenous (IV) lines and other medical implants,\u201d according to his campaign website.\n\nHe and his wife Alice, who is a clinical psychologist, have two daughters; one is a professor at Grenell College in Iowa, her father\u2019s alma mater, and the other works in a think tank at Google in California.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surrounded by intelligent women,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cI\u2019m very much a feminist and I\u2019m a very comfortable supporter of strong women.\u201d\n\nHis strongest viewpoints are health-related issues, such as affordable health care and a woman\u2019s right to choose to have an abortion.\n\n\u201cRight now there are major concerns regarding the cost of health care, access to health care, and who should pay for these things?\u201d Christensen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a gross misunderstanding about what actually the Affordable Care Act is and is hoping to achieve. I wanted to campaign to both address that issue but at the same time work with physicians and health care providers to address issues making it difficult to work in the current environment.\n\n\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s making it very difficult for hospitals and physicians to work in rural settings. I want to work to address those issues so people in rural Missouri have access to the health care they need. \u2026 (As a physician) I\u2019ve seen people struggle with these problems. There\u2019s many ways to approach the high cost of drugs.\u201d\n\nChristensen is also pro-choice, as evidenced by the column he wrote for the Columbia Daily-Tribune about the \u201cmisconception often used by people saying life begins at the time of conception,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 The issue here is not about logic of when does life begin, it\u2019a actually a religious, political and philosophical issue. I believe women have the right to make those decisions themselves based on their beliefs. I think (the decisions) should be made safely, legally. \u2026 The government has no role in those decisions, just as they have no say in life-saving medical care.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what he thought were other big issues facing the 4th District, he said poverty is an \u201coverwhelming\u201d one.\n\nChristensen said he hopes to make several campaign stops in Sedalia. While Pettis and surrounding counties have voted largely Republican in recent years, Christensen said he is hopeful to overcome party lines. He said many of the issues, such as women\u2019s rights and taking care of veterans, are not partisan issues, but rather fundamental beliefs or a basic function of government, respectively.\n\n\u201cEven though the district has a Republican reputation, it has historically been Democrat and I think it can vote Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cMissourians are fundamentally thoughtful people and labels are not as important of an issue to them; that\u2019s what I hope to communicate to them.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I hope the people in Missouri, particularly the 4th District, will separate their view of me as a Democrat and see more of what I can say and appreciate someone who\u2019s not a career politician but someone running on the basis of principle and at the same time has views of issues that benefit people of both parties. My orientation is toward people.\u201d\n\nNicole Cooke can be reached at 660-826-1000 ext. 1482 or @NicoleRCooke.\n\nNicole Cooke can be reached at 660-826-1000 ext. 1482 or @NicoleRCooke.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-MO", "DC.language": "en_US", "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "geo.placename": "Sedalia", "og": {"site_name": "Sedalia Democrat", "description": "By Nicole Cookencooke@civitasmedia.com .neFileBlock { margin-bottom: 20px; } .neFileBlock p { margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; } .neFileBlock .neFile { border-bottom: 1px dotted #aaa; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; } .neFileBlock .neCaption { font-size: 85%; } Christensen http://sedaliademocrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/web1_Christensen-Gordon.jpgChristensen Another Democrat has entered the 2016 political race in Missouri, and this time it\u2019s for the congressional 4th [...]", "locality": "Sedalia", "url": "http://sedaliademocrat.com/news/6705/christensen-to-run-for-4th-congressional-district", "image": "http://sedaliademocrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/web1_Christensen-Gordon-250x300.jpg", "title": "Christensen to run for 4th Congressional District", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "region": "US-MO"}, "DC.type": "Text", "twitter": {"image": "http://sedaliademocrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/web1_Christensen-Gordon.jpg", "site": "@SedaliaDemocrat", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "- Sedalia Democrat - sedaliademocrat.com"}, "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.contributor": "Sedalia Democrat", "DC.publisher": "Sedalia Democrat", "DC.identifier": "http://sedaliademocrat.com", "DC.relation": "http://dublincore.org/", "theme-color": "#006400", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-12-02T11:18:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-02T11:18:23+00:00", "author": "http://sedaliademocrat.com/author/englewoodindependent-2"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "DC.title": "Sedalia Democrat, Sedalia MO - www.sedaliademocrat.com"}, "article_summary": "\u201cRight now there are major concerns regarding the cost of health care, access to health care, and who should pay for these things?\u201d Christensen said.\nDr. Gordon Christensen, of Columbia, has announced his candidacy for the 4th District, which includes 26 counties in west central Missouri.\nBy Nicole Cooke [email protected]Christensen http://sedaliademocrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/web1_Christensen-Gordon.jpg ChristensenAnother Democrat has entered the 2016 political race in Missouri, and this time it\u2019s for the congressional 4th District.\nHe recently retired from the University of Missouri Health System.\nI want to work to address those issues so people in rural Missouri have access to the health care they need."}
