Bishop American Legion Post 301 in Connellsville. And David Keefer, the new post commander, is trying to get the word out to the city's residents.\n\nAccording to Keefer, a five-year Air Force veteran, District Commander Richard Zipfel told Post 301 members on Aug. 14 that changes would have to be made or the post would close.\n\n\u201cSo we had a meeting, and (almost) all of the old officers resigned,\u201d Keefer said. \u201cWe had to hold new elections. Nobody wanted to be elected to office. They were going to close the post down, so I stepped up.\u201d\n\nKeefer, 26, with three tours of duty in Iraq between 2005 and 2010, became \u201cthe youngest or one of the youngest post commanders in the United States.\u201d He has a full-time job as a bartender at the Mile Marker.\n\nNow he finds himself with little free time.\n\n\u201cIf I'm not there (at his full-time job), I'm here,\u201d he chuckled.\n\n\u201cRight now, we're going month to month,\u201d said Keefer when asked about the condition of the organization. \u201cWe're paying our bills, all our utility bills.\n\n\u201cA good thing we've been doing, we have a DJ (disc jockey) every Saturday evening, and we don't have to pay our DJs. We have veterans coming in, volunteering. They have all of their DJ equipment, so that helps us out, now that we have entertainment.\u201d\n\nPost 301 had been cited for illegal slot machines in a raid by state police.\n\n\u201cThat's something that we're not going to bring back, in that a lot of people are gossiping about,\u201d Keefer said. \u201cWe could bring them back in, but I don't think it's a good idea. That's something I don't want to put myself in or my bartenders in, where they're going to get fines. That's something that will stay with them the rest of their lives on their permanent record.\u201d\n\nPost 301 officers, in addition to Keefer, are Mike Darrell, club adjutant; Roger Adams, first vice commander; Tom Miller, chaplain; Emerson Long, finance officer; and Chuck Echard, second vice commander.\n\nKeefer said the new officers are a little younger than the previous group. Miller, the chaplain, is a holdover. He has been a member for years and was chaplain under the former group of officers.\n\nPost 301 is seeing a lot of new members, Keefer said.\n\n\u201cAnd a lot of people still do not realize that we're still open,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to get it out to the community that we're not closing down. We lost a few people from the changes, but we're also getting back a lot of members that we haven't seen here for a while.\n\n\u201cWe have a real nice kitchen back there. That hasn't been used. But we're having a grand reopening (from 6 to 11 p.m. Friday). We're starting off small \u2014 wings and french fries (cheese fries and loaded fries). Then we'll build out our menu from there.\u201d\n\nKeefer said they will start renting out their banquet hall to the community.\n\n\u201cWe're working on finalizing the prices for all of that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe'll also start doing monthly dinners through the kitchen \u2014 spaghetti dinner, meat loaf dinner. Things like that, which will also be open to the public. If they want to come in and get a dinner, they're more than welcome to do that. You don't have to be a member.\u201d\n\nWord around town after the meeting with the district commander was that Post 301 was shut down, he said, but that is not the case. The new officers are planning ways to raise funds to restore the health of the organization. They are getting a new jukebox. Bike runs have been coming in, according to Keefer.\n\n\u201cWe're going to work on getting bingo back in,\u201d he added. \u201cI'm going to get up to the courthouse, hopefully by October, and get a bingo license.\u201d\n\nThey are bringing back small games of chance, pull tabs, and they are going to change up the amounts \u2014 make them bigger and better.\n\n\u201cWe're getting a bowling machine in here, a pool league, and a dart board machine is being donated,\u201d Keefer said. \u201cWe need your (the community's) help. We're a nonprofit organization. We try to do as much as we can throughout the community with the American Legion baseball teams. That's something we want to get involved with \u2014 the baseball team \u2014 as much as possible.\u201d\n\nKeefer said the post also will do fundraising for the homeless veterans. \u201cI plan to go around to all the homeless shelters between now and Christmas,\u201d Keefer said. \u201cI like to go out there and sit down with them and talk. We want to get a certificate with a little pin (to present to them). I love sitting down and talking to a World War II veteran.\u201d\n\nThere is one change that post members, present and past, should not forget: Meetings will be held on the first Sunday of the month.\n\nKarl Polacek is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
