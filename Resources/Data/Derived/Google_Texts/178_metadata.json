In March, the Obama administration announced a three-part plan that includes the expansion of drug treatment and Food and Drug Administration-approved medication that\u2019s estimated to cost $133 million in new spending. Congressmembers on both sides of the aisle also introduced legislation that aims to better educate doctors about safely prescribing opiates.\n\nLargely left out of the conversation, however, is access \u2014 or the lack thereof \u2014 to addiction treatment. Even though American overdose deaths surpass deaths from car accidents and other injuries, only 11 percent of the 22.7 million Americans who needed drug or alcohol treatment in 2013 actually received it, according to data compiled by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\n\u201cWe know addiction treatment saves lives, reduces drug use, reduces criminal activity and improves employment,\u201d Paul Samuels, president and director of the Legal Action Center, which advocates on behalf of people with HIV or addiction, told USA Today. \u201cThe data is there, the evidence is in, but our public policy has not caught up with the science.\u201d\n\nSubstance abuse costs the nation more than $600 billion annually, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Right now, two cents of every dollar spent to combat abuse goes to treatment, with the rest paying for hospital care, jails and courts, according to a report from a Columbia University addiction center.\n\nExperts say that preventing addiction, rather than simply reacting to it, could have great social and health benefits that translate into cost savings, specifically when it comes to the criminal justice system. Estimates show that every dollar invested into an addiction program yields between $4 and $7 in reduced drug-related crime, criminal justice costs, and theft. Ultimately, savings will eclipse initial costs by a 12 to 1 ratio, mainly through the reduction of interpersonal conflicts, overdoses, and death.\n\nFor years, the philosophy of prevention hasn\u2019t gained much popularity, due in part to the stigma around addiction. While scientists define addiction as a brain disorder, one in three Americans thinks it\u2019s caused by a lack of willpower. These views about people reeling with drug use often cause social service providers and other actors to cut off resources that may aid them in kicking their habit. Lawmakers who support drug tests for welfare recipients, for example, have based their policy priorities in misconceptions about drug abusers\u2019 work ethic, rather than addressing the factors that may have caused them to initially form their drug habit.\n\nThe drug addicts who seek treatment face similar hurdles in financing their therapy, depending on the type of insurance they hold, if any. For example, those with private insurance are six times less likely to get timely and consistent treatment than their counterparts who have Medicaid. But Medicaid holders aren\u2019t out of water just yet. Programs in 17 states don\u2019t pay for long-term methadone treatment under what\u2019s called the Essential Health Benefits framework, which defines benchmark plans for each state, often leaving some medications off the list of Medicaid plans cover.\n\nEven health care reform hasn\u2019t sufficed in linking addicts to sustainable treatment. While the Affordable Care Act mandates that insurance holders receive coverage for substance abuse and mental health treatment, a recent National Alliance on Mental Illness report found that patients are denied substance abuse treatment with plans that limit their doses of medication or the length of time they can receive help. High out-of-pocket costs often keep patients from maintaining a treatment regimen. The report also found that more than half of the medications examined weren\u2019t covered by insurance providers. These coverage issues also affect doctors, many of whom remain reluctant to treat addicts out of fear that they won\u2019t be reimbursed.\n\nWhile most doctors can\u2019t tend to patients, an increasing number have done their part to ensure that addictive medication doesn\u2019t end up in the wrong hands. A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine last year found that 9 out of 10 doctors expressed concern about opioid addiction, with half of them cutting back on the painkillers they prescribed. Before this change in the tide, painkiller prescriptions nearly tripled over the last two decades, even as addictions rose across the country.\n\nSome municipalities have also decided to take matters into their own hands, recognizing that preventing addiction and overdose deaths is an interdepartmental goal. A $100,000 grant awarded to a Massachusetts town will allow health officials to prevent the opioid addiction problem among teenagers with a program that tackles underage drinking \u2013 an activity known to precede painkiller abuse \u2014 and expand prevention materials. Other strategies in the program include prescription take-back days, social marketing campaigns targeted toward youth to help them make the right decisions, and the dissemination of information about where to find Narcan, a substance that has been proven to prevent overdose deaths.\n\n\u201cWith our communities on the front lines of prevention and treatment, these grants will offer additional tools to educate and respond to substance abuse, including our growing opioid epidemic,\u201d Masschusetts Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito told MassLive.com. \u201cStarting as early as possible to educate on the risks and responsibilities our young people have is just one step in the road we have ahead in preventing substance abuse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"The data is there, the evidence is in, but our public policy has not caught up with the science.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"The data is there, the evidence is in, but our public policy has not caught up with the science.\"", "title": "Drug Abuse Is Soaring, But Addiction Treatment Is Hard To Find", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/05/26/3662873/addiction-treatment-hard-to-find/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_204221125.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"The data is there, the evidence is in, but our public policy has not caught up with the science.\"", "title": "Drug Abuse Is Soaring, But Addiction Treatment Is Hard To Find", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_204221125-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_204221125.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_204221125.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-26T16:47:10+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Largely left out of the conversation, however, is access \u2014 or the lack thereof \u2014 to addiction treatment.\nIn March, the Obama administration announced a three-part plan that includes the expansion of drug treatment and Food and Drug Administration-approved medication that\u2019s estimated to cost $133 million in new spending.\n\u201cThe data is there, the evidence is in, but our public policy has not caught up with the science.\u201dSubstance abuse costs the nation more than $600 billion annually, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\nHealth Drug Abuse Is Soaring, But Addiction Treatment Is Hard To Find CREDIT: ShutterstockDrug addiction dominated the news cycle in recent months and years, with the prescription painkiller and heroin epidemics gaining coverage and much of the nation\u2019s attention turning to Indiana amid an HIV outbreak spawned by the use of intravenous drugs.\n\u201cWe know addiction treatment saves lives, reduces drug use, reduces criminal activity and improves employment,\u201d Paul Samuels, president and director of the Legal Action Center, which advocates on behalf of people with HIV or addiction, told USA Today."}
