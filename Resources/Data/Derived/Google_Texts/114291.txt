President Obama's job performance had always been average, but he's helped himself and the country lately, showing outstanding leadership on Iran, Russia, children at the border, Ebola, economy-stock market and energy production. Plus, his executive orders on minimum wage, prosecutorial discretion for people here illegally, and normalizing relations with Cuba were great, if overdue. That's a lot of success in a short amount of time.

During the 2012 presidential campaign Newt Gingrich warned that re-electing Obama would bring us $10 a gallon gas and Mitt Romney claimed his economic policies would "get the unemployment rate down to 6%, perhaps a little lower" by January 2017, if elected. I just filled up at $1.99, and three months ago the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the unemployment rate had dropped to 5.9 percent.

But fear and complaining have proven more contagious than the Ebola virus. The yips and yawps continue each day, no matter how much our lot has been improved.
