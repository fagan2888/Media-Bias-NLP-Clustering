Furman contrasted the high-productivity-growth years of the 1950s and 1960s with the present day, noting that massive public works projects, such as the Interstate Highway System, allowed the economy to make full use of technological innovations, such as improvements in vehicle design and the invention of synthetic rubber.\n\nToday, he said, \u201cPublic investment and innovation could be supplementing technological innovations and increasing productivity growth.\u201d The productivity growth that would result, he suggested, would lead to higher wages for workers, and help reduce income inequality.\n\nAFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, who spoke on a different panel, took issue with the connection between productivity growth and wages, noting that in recent decades, \u201cproductivity has doubled and wages have stayed flat. The compact that used to exist between working people and capitalism has been shredded.\u201d\n\nRelated: Excise Tax on Big Banks Blasted by GOP\n\nBetween Trumka and another speaker, former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chair Sheila Bair, there was a strong populist tone to the afternoon session of the Atlantic event. Bair, who ran the FDIC during the financial crisis, and who has become one of the loudest advocates for tougher supervision \u2013 and in some cases the break up of large financial institutions \u2013 urged the Obama administration to take concrete steps toward reducing the \u201cpublic cynicism\u201d that she said is rampant in the aftermath of the financial crisis.\n\nNoting that there is still a vacancy on the Federal Reserve Board, Bair said that the White House has \u201ca really prime opportunity\u201d to appoint a dedicated reformer who believes in reining in large financial institutions. Doing so, she said, \u201cwould add diversity to the Fed and would also bolster public confidence.\u201d\n\nTo strengthen her case, Bair pointed to the financial services industry\u2019s recent reaction to a plan by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp to overhaul the tax code \u2013 a plan that includes an excise tax on financial institutions with assets over $500 billion.\n\nRelated: Liberals\u2019 New Goal \u2013 Boost Social Security Benefits\n\n\n\nCamp has been subject to blistering criticism from the industry, as well as from fellow politicians, many of whom receive substantial campaign contributions from the industry.\n\n\u201cThey have tremendous political power,\u201d Bair said. \u201cLook what they are doing to poor Dave Camp. You can agree with that tax or not, but this is unseemly, all these bullies piling on him\u2026At least he stepped up.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A top White House advisor on Tuesday defended the administration\u2019s response to the financial crisis and great recession, and argued that the failure to adopt new infrastructure spending has helped worsen economic inequality.", "title": "Infrastructure Investment Would Help Workers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/18/Financial-Crisis-Was-Worse-Great-Depression-Furman", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11042013_Furman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/18/Financial-Crisis-Was-Worse-Great-Depression-Furman", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11042013_Furman.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A top White House advisor on Tuesday defended the administration\u2019s response to the financial crisis and great recession, and argued that the failure to adopt new infrastructure spending has helped worsen economic inequality.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc969f\"", "article_summary": "Today, he said, \u201cPublic investment and innovation could be supplementing technological innovations and increasing productivity growth.\u201d The productivity growth that would result, he suggested, would lead to higher wages for workers, and help reduce income inequality.\nSpeaking at the Atlantic Economy Summit in Washington, Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman said that the Obama administration\u2019s initial response to the financial crisis was effective at preventing much more serious damage.\nPresident Obama\u2019s top economic adviser said Tuesday that the administration\u2019s response to the financial crisis had averted an outcome worse that the Great Depression, and suggested that lawmakers\u2019 ongoing resistance to investing in infrastructure has helped intensify the increasing economic inequality in the U.S.\nAFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, who spoke on a different panel, took issue with the connection between productivity growth and wages, noting that in recent decades, \u201cproductivity has doubled and wages have stayed flat.\n\u201cBut the outcome was completely different.\u201dHowever, he said, slower-than-usual growth in worker productivity has continued to be one of the challenges holding back the economy."}
