Abbott (ABT) announced the medical device company will voluntarily recall 20 lots of FreeStyle and FreeStyle Lite Blood Glucose Test Strips in the U.S. The company said in a statement the test strips may give low glucose readings when used with the FreeStyle Blood Glucose Meter, the FreeStyle Flash Blood Glucose Meter and the OmniPod Insulin Management System.

According to the company statement:

When the test strips are used with the newer FreeStyle brand meters including FreeStyle Freedom Blood Glucose Meter, FreeStyle Lite Blood Glucose Meter* and FreeStyle Freedom Lite Blood Glucose Meter*, the blood glucose test results are not affected. Testing with the FreeStyle InsuLinxÂ® Blood Glucose Meter is not affected by this action, as FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood Glucose Meter uses FreeStyle InsuLinx test strips.
