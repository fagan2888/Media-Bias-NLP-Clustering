In her opinion, Kagan noted the principle of stare decisis, which holds that court\u2019s should hesitate to overturn their own precedents.\n\nWhat we can decide, we can undecide. But stare decisis teaches that we should exercise that authority sparingly. Cf. S. Lee and S. Ditko, Amazing Fantasy No. 15: \u201cSpider- Man,\u201d p. 13 (1962) (\u201c[I]n this world, with great power there must also come\u2014great responsibility\u201d).\n\nThe quote comes not from a legal expert, of course, but from Uncle Ben, who is trying to guide a young Peter Parker to use his superpowers wisely in Amazing Fantasy No. 15, the comic which features the first appearance of Spider-Man. Supreme Court justices also have superpowers, but they come from a Senate confirmation vote, not a radioactive spider bite.\n\nIn her opinion, Kagan also quoted the 1967 Spider-Man TV show theme song: \u201cThe parties set no end date for royalties, apparently contemplating that they would continue for as long as kids want to imitate Spider-Man (by doing whatever a spider can).\u201d\n\nRead the full opinion here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan quoted Spider-Man's Uncle Ben and his TV theme song in a decision Monday.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "\"With great power comes great responsibility.\"", "title": "The Supreme Court Just Quoted Spider-Man", "url": "http://time.com/3930115/supreme-court-spiderman/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/spider-man-supreme-court.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/spider-man-supreme-court.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594"}, "description": "\"With great power comes great responsibility.\"", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Supreme Court Just Quoted Spider-Man"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "spiderman, kimble v. marvel, elena kagan, supreme court, spider-man", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Spiderman, Kimble v.
