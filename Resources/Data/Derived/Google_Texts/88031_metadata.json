But the increases affect children whose families pay the full amount for coverage.\n\n\u201cDespite the federal government\u2019s assurances that rates would drop and access would improve \u2013 insurance rates increased, many providers canceled coverage and the makeup of our coverage was forced to change,\u201d Healthy Kids CEO Rebecca Matthews wrote last week to families that are affected. \u201cI assure you that we at FHK were as shocked and upset as each of you when we learned how much the coverage costs increased.\u201d\n\nThose families currently pay $153 per child for monthly health-care coverage, according to the Healthy Kids website. But as of October 1st, their options will range from $299 per month with dental care to $205 per month without if they stay enrolled in Healthy Kids.\n\nWhen the full-pay families were notified of the Healthy Kids rate hike in July, they were also advised of other options \u2014 including private insurance and what\u2019s known as the Federally Facilitated Marketplace, where they could shop for lower rates under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. They could also revisit the option of coverage with their parents\u2019 employers to see if it was available.\n\n\u201cWe understand that it\u2019s a lot to process right now for them,\u201d Matthews said of the full-pay parents. \u201cBut in order to comply with the ACA, we needed to offer a different type of a plan, and we did. In fact, we offered two.\u201d\n\nWhen the parents started calling the federal exchange, however, they were told there was no special enrollment period for them if they chose coverage through that program. Their children\u2019s Healthy Kids coverage would run out on Sept. 30, but they\u2019d have to wait until January 2016 to qualify for the federal program.\n\nLast week, though, Healthy Kids and federal officials agreed that the increase in Health Kids premiums was a \u201cqualifying event,\u201d meaning that it qualified the full-pay families for a special enrollment period in the federal exchange starting Oct. 1.\n\nKaren Woodall, a health-care activist and member of the state KidCare Coordinating Council, said Healthy Kids didn\u2019t notify federal officials of the need for the special enrollment period in a timely manner. The federal government had approved the Healthy Kids\u2019 replacement full-pay program in May.\n\n\u201cThe families that applied and were turned down \u2014 that could have been avoided,\u201d Woodall said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it was intentional. I think somebody just didn\u2019t think about checking on that.\u201d\n\nWoodall also noted that the changes under Obamacare could provide many full-pay families with better benefits.\n\n\u201cThe other good news is, now they can\u2019t be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions, or because they\u2019ve used their lifetime benefits,\u201d she said. \u201cA number of families were in full-pay because of that. They were able to pay for insurance, but they couldn\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nAaron Albright, a spokesman for the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service, confirmed the special enrollment period and additional benefits. Albright also noted that \u201cthe vast majority of consumers receive tax credits to make coverage more affordable.\u201d\n\nMost families with children enrolled in Healthy Kids get subsidized coverage, for which they pay $15 to $20 a month for all their children. They have incomes between 133 percent and 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Currently, 144,124 Florida children get subsidized coverage, and 34,749 children are full-pay.\n\nThe families that pay the full amount for Healthy Kids coverage make more than 200 percent of the federal poverty line, but Woodall said those that earn between 200 percent and 300 percent are likely to qualify for subsidies under Obamacare.\n\nThe News Service of Florida\u2019s Margie Menzel contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of children in the Florida Healthy Kids health-insurance program will see their rates jump as of October 1st and state officials are blaming the federal Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://miami.cbslocal.com/2015/09/01/floridas-healthy-kids-insurance-rates-to-rise/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/beach_with_family_-_thinkstock3.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/beach_with_family_-_thinkstock3.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "Thousands of children in the Florida Healthy Kids health-insurance program will see their rates jump as of October 1st and state officials are blaming the federal Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Florida's \"Healthy Kids\" Insurance Rates To Rise"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/beach_with_family_-_thinkstock3.jpg?w=625", "description": "Thousands of children in the Florida Healthy Kids health-insurance program will see their rates jump as of October 1st and state officials are blaming the federal Affordable Care Act.", "site": "CBSmiami", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Florida's \"Healthy Kids\" Insurance Rates To Rise"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Miami's Best", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Miami", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbsmiami", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbsmiami"}, "keywords": "consumer, florida news, health, local, news, affordable care act, florida healthy kids, healthy kids insurance, insurance, obamacare, rebecca matthews", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://miami.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0984ebcee75feff1a6ce7f3d00419048?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, florida healthy kids, healthy kids insurance, insurance, obamacare, rebecca matthews"}, "article_summary": "The increases don\u2019t affect all children covered by the Florida Healthy Kids Corp., most of whom get subsidized insurance.\nBut as of October 1st, their options will range from $299 per month with dental care to $205 per month without if they stay enrolled in Healthy Kids.\nTheir children\u2019s Healthy Kids coverage would run out on Sept. 30, but they\u2019d have to wait until January 2016 to qualify for the federal program.\nThe federal government had approved the Healthy Kids\u2019 replacement full-pay program in May.\nI think somebody just didn\u2019t think about checking on that.\u201dWoodall also noted that the changes under Obamacare could provide many full-pay families with better benefits."}
