Matt Bevin sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell late last month informing her of his plans to close down Kynect and transition residents to the federal site, HealthCare.gov, for health coverage.\n\nThe changes will not affect anyone shopping for insurance for the current enrollment period, which ends Jan. 31. Nor will it affect anyone who signed up for Medicaid through Kynect.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Bevin\u2019s office said he had taken steps to eliminate the \u201credundancy\u201d of Kynect. He previously had pledged to shut down the exchange because \u201cit adds no value\u201d given the existence of HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe former Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, had urged Bevin to maintain the exchange, noting that it is financed through a surcharge on insurance plans. Shutting Kynect would cost at least $23 million in state money, Beshear said.\n\nWonkblog's Sarah Kliff breaks down the policy you need to understand about the Affordable Care Act, from politics to premiums. (Kate M. Tobey/(In Play))\n\nKentucky\u2019s health exchange has been one of the most successful state marketplaces, and advocates said Monday that Bevin\u2019s move will set back efforts to reach the uninsured. As of Sept. 30, about 87,000 Kentuckians had health coverage through Kynect.\n\nHHS spokesman Ben Wakana said that the federal agency is committed to a \u201cseamless transition\u201d but that it \u201cwill require strong cooperation and commitment\u201d from the state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bevin wants residents to transition to federal HealthCare.gov by the end of 2016.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Bevin wants residents to transition to federal HealthCare.gov by the end of 2016.", "title": "Kentucky governor moves to shut down state\u2019s ACA insurance exchange", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/kentucky-governor-moves-to-shut-down-states-aca-insurance-exchange/2016/01/11/a236f670-b8b6-11e5-829c-26ffb874a18d_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/11/Health-Environment-Science/Images/Bevin_Speech-080e6-992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bylenasun"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/kentucky-governor-moves-to-shut-down-states-aca-insurance-exchange/2016/01/11/a236f670-b8b6-11e5-829c-26ffb874a18d_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Kentucky, Bevin, kynect, health insurance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90"}, "eomportal-uuid": "a236f670-b8b6-11e5-829c-26ffb874a18d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Kentucky, Bevin, kynect, health insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2459\"", "article_summary": "Kentucky\u2019s Republican governor is following through on a campaign pledge and dismantling the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe former Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, had urged Bevin to maintain the exchange, noting that it is financed through a surcharge on insurance plans.\nHe previously had pledged to shut down the exchange because \u201cit adds no value\u201d given the existence of HealthCare.gov.\n(Kate M.
