In religion, our souls survive after death; they\u2019re the only part of us that\u2019s immortal. Populations from around the world have believed in the existence of a soul for centuries, from Plato and Aristotle to Buddhists and Christians. These ideologies have been passed down through generations. In the U.S., 73 percent of adults identify themselves as Christian, and although this number is dropping, a new study finds that those who say they\u2019re unaffiliated may be more into religion than they think.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, the number of Americans identifying themselves as unaffiliated from religion climbed from 15 percent in 2007 to just under 20 percent in 2012. But even 14 percent of those who identified themselves as atheist (believing God doesn\u2019t exist) said they believed in God or a universal spirit. There\u2019s a disconnect, and it\u2019s likely that these people grew up with religion and then stopped practicing \u2014 though they may have left church for good, their beliefs stuck.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Rutgers University doctoral student Stephanie Anglin found in her study, published in the British Journal of Social Psychology. Though her participants may not currently follow a religion, they still believe in the concepts of a soul and the afterlife. \u201cMy starting point was, assuming that people have these automatic \u2014 that is, implicit or ingrained \u2014 beliefs about the soul and afterlife, how can we measure those implicit beliefs,\u201d she said in a press release.\n\nFor the study, Anglin asked 348 Rutgers psychology students to recall their beliefs about the soul and afterlife at the age of 10, as well as their current beliefs (their average age was 18). These answers were considered explicit beliefs. To measure their implicit beliefs, which they might not have consciously reported, she used the Implicit Association Test, which paired concept words like \u201csoul\u201d and \u201creal\u201d or \u201cfake.\u201d Participants were then given a series of words underneath (such as \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cexisting\u201d), and told to push a key to indicate whether it fit with the paired words.\n\nAnglin found that the students\u2019 current beliefs were a long shot from what they thought when they were 10 years old. However, many of them had implicit beliefs that aligned closely with their 10-year-old selves, suggesting that their belief system carried over, even if religious practice didn\u2019t.\n\nThe study shows just how powerful religion is when it\u2019s instilled at an early age, even as more people grow up questioning the validity of religion as it pertains to worshipping a God. A study from earlier this year found that children who were exposed to religion were more likely to view characters from religious stories as real, even if the events that occurred in the story were supernatural or magical \u2014 in later life, this belief may emerge as openness to paranormal activity. Going back to that Pew study, 26 percent of self-proclaimed atheists said they still thought of themselves as spiritual people, while 41 percent said they often thought about the meaning and purpose of life.\n\nReligion as it was may be falling in popularity, but the way it helps people find tranquility may still be prevalent. In an interview with NPR last year, 29-year-old Miriam Nissly, who was raised Jewish, considers herself Jewish with an \u201cagnostic bent,\u201d and still attends synagogue, said: \u201cI realize maybe there\u2019s a disconnect there \u2014 why are you doing it if you don\u2019t necessarily have a belief in God? But I think there\u2019s a cultural aspect, there\u2019s a spiritual aspect, I suppose. I find the practice of sitting and being quiet and being alone with your thoughts to be helpful, but I don\u2019t think I need to answer that question [about God] in order to participate in traditions I was brought up with.\u201d\n\nThough the students in Anglin\u2019s study may no longer participate in these traditions, the idea of having a soul or that there\u2019s an afterlife must certainly bring some form of reassurance.\n\nSource: Anglin S.
