Its first step is securing the lease renewals, a measure it has previously called uncontroversial.\n\nBut in its letter, the Office of the Solicitor said regulators have the right to conduct environmental and other assessments before renewing the leases. The original term of the leases \u2014 issued in 1966 \u2014 required production to begin within a certain period of time, and Twin Metals is still only \u201cconducting exploration activities\u201d on the leased land.\n\n\u201cThe leases provided that if there was no production at the end of the primary term, the leases would end unless the Secretary granted a lease renewal to extend the time to commence production.\u201d\n\nTwin Metals is a major proposal for Minnesota\u2019s mining industry, promising 850 mining jobs and 30 years of precious metal production in the state.\n\nIt is, however, highly controversial, with environmentalists warning about the impact copper and nickel mining will have on the federal Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW), which is near the Twin Metals site.\n\nRep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) has filed a bill to effectively block mining there. Activists have asked the BLM to block Twin Metals\u2019 lease renewal and requested the Obama administration unilaterally prevent mining in the region.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Mark Dayton (D), in a letter this week, told the company he has \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the risks mining poses to the Boundary Waters watershed, news website MinnPost reported.\n\n\u201cI am not questioning the qualifications of either Twin Metals or its parent company Antofagasta PLC,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cRather my concern is for the inherent risks associated with any mining operation in close proximity to the BWCAW and my concern about the State of Minnesota's actively promoting advancement of such operations by permitting access to state lands.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Interior Department says it has the right to review the terms of mining leases.", "description": "The Interior Department says it has the right to review the terms of mining leases.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Devin Henry", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Interior Department says it has the right to review the terms of mining leases.", "title": "Feds hint at tough review for Minn. mining project", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/272393-feds-hint-at-tough-review-for-minn-mining-project", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-09T14:14:24-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-09T14:14-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/272393-feds-hint-at-tough-review-for-minn-mining-project", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-09T13:56-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Devin Henry", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-09T13:56:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-09T14:14:24-05:00"}, "keywords": "precious metal mining,Mark Dayton,Bureau of Land Management, Department of Interior", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/272393-feds-hint-at-tough-review-for-minn-mining-project", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Interior Department says it has the right to review the terms of mining leases.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds hint at tough review for Minn. mining project"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds hint at tough review for Minn. mining project"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI am not questioning the qualifications of either Twin Metals or its parent company Antofagasta PLC,\u201d he wrote.\nTwin Metals is years away from securing the permits necessary to open its mine.\nActivists have asked the BLM to block Twin Metals\u2019 lease renewal and requested the Obama administration unilaterally prevent mining in the region.\nTwin Metals Minnesota is looking to construct a major copper and nickel mine near a federal wilderness area in the state.\nFederal officials indicated this week they\u2019re not inclined to automatically renew mineral leases for a major and controversial mining project in northern Minnesota."}
