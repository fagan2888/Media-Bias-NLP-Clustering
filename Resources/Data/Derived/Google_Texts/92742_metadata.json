The doctor was concerned enough that he came to Shandling's home and checked him out.\n\nGarry complained he was achy and short of breath. He did not complain of chest pains. The doctor told Garry if he was not feeling well the next day he should go to the ER to check it out. Garry said if he wasn't feeling better he'd probably go sometime Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn a recent appearance on Jerry Seinfeld's \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,\" Shandling cracked a joke about having hyperparathyroidism ... which, according to the Mayo Clinic, can lead to cardiovascular disease.\n\nTMZ broke the story, Garry called 911 Thursday at around 10:30 AM and fell unconscious during the call.
