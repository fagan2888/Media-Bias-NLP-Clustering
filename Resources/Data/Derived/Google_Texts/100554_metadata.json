If they can do so by offering a unifying vision along with a set of policies that can solve our nation\u2019s problems, even better. For the sake of both their ambition and the good of the Republic, they need to read this book and let its wisdom reorder what they think they know.\n\nThe president\u2019s masterful State of the Union address had a dual purpose: cement his legacy to date, but more ambitiously, to place his stamp on the 2016 election by framing liberalism as the caretaker of a new middle-class economics. This level of rhetorical generality allows for a range of democratic expressions. Hillary Clinton\u2019s challenge will be to triangulate \u2014 a term familiar from her husband\u2019s tenure and a nod to their shared political DNA. She will have to go left early and enough to keep the Obama-Warren wing satisfied but not so far left that she can\u2019t retain enough wiggle room to move to the center in the general election. The president also set the terrain on which the Republican rivals to his legacy must compete. For those exploring a run, Mr. Voegeli\u2019s \u201cThe Pity Party\u201d offers a philosophic and rhetorical pathway for an ascendant conservatism. \u201cThe Pity Party\u201d is made for this middle-class economics moment.\n\nInterestingly, it is also a boon to Democrats who might be forced by political necessity to speak honestly about the products of their party\u2019s labors, and in so doing, counter the charge of malpractice that will soon be coming their way. Any speechwriter or strategic consultant that doesn\u2019t read \u201cThe Pity Party\u201d and share its wealth with his or her principal is committing dereliction of duty.\n\nMr. Voegeli starts his \u201cPity Party\u201d with the promise of showing \u201chow conservatives could explain their reservations and objections more persuasively.\u201d It\u2019s an enlightening read throughout, but the author is cruel and makes the reader wait for the last chapter before revealing the unifying strategy on how conservatism can win persuasively against liberalism: \u201cParadoxically conservatism would oppose liberalism more effectively if they opposed it less fundamentally.\u201d This sentence puts the philosophic and cultural brilliance of his book directly into political play. It\u2019s worth noting that Mr. Voegeli is not a consultant or messaging guru, but a political theorist at the Claremont Institute. He is one of the best at asking and answering big questions about first principles.\n\nThen why not a tete-a-tete? The Republican disadvantage is that Democrats convincingly make a claim to be the party of greater human equality and compassion, making them the electoral scissors to the Republican paper. The claim of equality on the heartstrings of a democratic people is naturally stronger and resonates more than the claim of liberty. The democratic pitch \u2014 the promise of free stuff and fairness \u2014 is near impossible to beat head on, so Mr. Voegeli\u2019s advice is not to do so. Where liberalism is weak is with delivering the promised goods. This failure to deliver is the less fundamental, more effective route to check liberalism\u2019s march.\n\nIn many ways, Mr. Voegeli is using Saul Alinsky\u2019s cornerstone rule for radicals by making the opposition live up to their own book of values. Mr. Voegeli is also more radical in his use of political language. Whereas liberals like to play the race, class and gender cards to close down the conversation, he provides conservatism a new trump card that will threaten liberalism\u2019s chip count and can be expressed in one populist word: \u201cBull[expletive].\u201d Liberalism as it turns out, is full of it in the author\u2019s accounting.\n\nBut conservatives do not speak in such demotic ways. I think our culture has imbibed enough \u201cSouth Park\u201d and \u201cFamily Guy\u201d to survive bull\u2019s entrance into polite political parlance. In the effort to help conservatives get over it, the author shows bull[expletive]\u2019s serious academic pedigree. Princeton professor Harry G. Frankfurt wrote a small pithy tract titled, \u201cOn Bull[expletive],\u201d outlining what he saw as being new to modern sensibility with regards to an orientation to the truth. One enters the world of bull when truth matters much less than our commitments and our feelings. Liberal bull, writes Mr. Voegeli \u2014 in a sentence sized for campaigning \u2014 is \u201cpreferring to feel good than to do good.\u201d This is a distinction that can make a huge political difference. MIT professor and Obamacare architect and salesman Jonathan Gruber is a central casting example of a liberal bull weaver.\n\nWhile conservatives are not immune to the charge of bull, the Democrats\u2019 focus on \u201ccompassion\u201d and \u201cempathy\u201d as paramount political virtues make them more susceptible to stepping into it. It turns out that compassion is a modern doctrine with a selfish-center. Christ didn\u2019t coin the word compassion, Rousseau did, and it reflects an interest in the \u201csufferer for the love of myself.\u201d The emphasis is on the \u201cI\u201d in \u201cI feel your pain.\u201d The bull card, when applied to the legacy of liberal compassion, has the capacity to decouple the \u201creactor core\u201d of liberalism, the \u201calliance of experts and victims.\u201d\n\nLet the final word be the author\u2019s: \u201cAny political cause that has arrived at the determination that the truth will set you back needs to consider its predicament carefully.\u201d\n\n\u2022 David DesRosiers is president of Revere Advisors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "William Voegeli's \"The Pity Party: A Mean-Spirited Diatribe Against Liberal Compassion\" is required reading for all political animals.", "Author": "David DesRosiers", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "William Voegeli\u2019s \u201cThe Pity Party: A Mean-Spirited Diatribe Against Liberal Compassion\u201d is required reading for all political animals.", "title": "BOOK REVIEW: \u2018The Pity Party: A Mean-Spirited Diatribe Against Liberal Compassion\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/15/book-review-the-pity-party-a-mean-spirited-diatrib/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/15/2_152015_the-pity-party-cove8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/15/2_152015_the-pity-party-cove8201.jpg", "title": "BOOK REVIEW: \u2018The Pity Party: A Mean-Spirited Diatribe Against L", "description": "William Voegeli's \"The Pity Party: A Mean-Spirited Diatribe Against Liberal Compassion\" is required reading for all political animals.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, William Voegeli, Pity Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17b0\"", "article_summary": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:THE PITY PARTY: A MEAN-SPIRITED DIATRIBE AGAINST LIBERAL COMPASSIONBy William VoegeliBroadside Books, $26.99, 320 pagesWilliam Voegeli\u2019s \u201cThe Pity Party: A Mean-Spirited Diatribe Against Liberal Compassion\u201d is required reading for all political animals.\nMIT professor and Obamacare architect and salesman Jonathan Gruber is a central casting example of a liberal bull weaver.\nFor those exploring a run, Mr. Voegeli\u2019s \u201cThe Pity Party\u201d offers a philosophic and rhetorical pathway for an ascendant conservatism.\nAny speechwriter or strategic consultant that doesn\u2019t read \u201cThe Pity Party\u201d and share its wealth with his or her principal is committing dereliction of duty.\n\u201cThe Pity Party\u201d is made for this middle-class economics moment."}
