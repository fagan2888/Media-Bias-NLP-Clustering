A 10th grader at Richland High School was killed in a crash Saturday night.

Kendall Clark, 15, of North Richland Hills, was being driven by her mother when their northbound car was struck by a southbound SUV about 7 p.m. in the 5500 block of Rufe Snow Drive, near Glenview Drive, said police spokesman Jeff Williams.

Witnesses told police that Clark’s mother was attempting to make a left turn when the car was struck.

Kendall was pronounced dead at the scene. Her mother was transported to an area hospital, Williams said.

Her condition has not been released.

Alcohol, drugs and speed were not a factor, Williams said.

“There was no distracted driver, just a tragic incident,” he said.

Richland High will have additional guidance counselors at the school on Tuesday, said Birdville ISD spokesman Mark Thomas.
