Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia behaves in many respects \u2026 as an antagonist. That is new. That is something, therefore, that we need to adjust to and counter.\u201d\n\nCarter would only say that Russia poses a \u201cvery significant threat\u201d to the U.S.\n\nYet a string of military leaders have recently put Russia atop their threat list, including Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, who will take over as Joint Chiefs of Staff chair later this year, newly installed Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, and incoming Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller.\n\nAll three warned lawmakers of the danger posed by the former Cold War adversary during their Capitol Hill confirmation hearings this summer.\n\nThe reason for the daylight between Carter and the service chief can be chalked up to Washington and Moscow continuing to work together on a number of security issues, like trying to curb Iran\u2019s illicit nuclear program or dealing with North Korea, as he alluded to during his press conference.\n\nRelated: Eyeing Russia, the Air Force Sends More A-10 Warthogs to Europe\n\nIn that way, Carter\u2019s stance more closely resembles that of Secretary of State John Kerry, who has declined to dub Russia an existential threat because of ongoing, joint diplomatic efforts.\n\n\u201cSo where Russia sees its interests as aligned with ours, we can work with them and will continue to do that,\u201d Carter told reporters.\n\nHe said, The U.S. will \u201ccontinue to hold open the door so that if either under Vladimir Putin or some successor of his in the future there's a leadership that wants to take Russia in the direction that I believe is best for Russia [and] not one of confrontation with the rest of the world and self- isolation, which is the path they're on now, but better economic and political integration with the rest of the world in a way that still keeps the wonderful history and culture and so forth and greatness of Russia in tact that that leadership do so.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There seems to be a slight difference of opinion between Defense Secretary Ash Carter and an incoming class of service leaders over just how much of a threat Russia poses to the United States.", "title": "Pentagon Chief: Putin\u2019s Russia a \u2018Significant\u2019 Threat but Not Top of the List", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/20/Pentagon-Chief-Putin-s-Russia-Significant-Threat-Not-Top-List", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12032014_Carter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/20/Pentagon-Chief-Putin-s-Russia-Significant-Threat-Not-Top-List", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12032014_Carter.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There seems to be a slight difference of opinion between Defense Secretary Ash Carter and an incoming class of service leaders over just how much of a threat Russia poses to the United States.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "That is something, therefore, that we need to adjust to and counter.\u201dCarter would only say that Russia poses a \u201cvery significant threat\u201d to the U.S.\nAll three warned lawmakers of the danger posed by the former Cold War adversary during their Capitol Hill confirmation hearings this summer.\n\u201cWhat's new \u2026 is that for a quarter century or so, since the end of the Cold War, we have not regarded Russia as an antagonist.\nThere seems to be a slight difference of opinion between Defense Secretary Ash Carter and an incoming class of service leaders over just how much of a threat Russia poses to the United States.\n\u201cSo where Russia sees its interests as aligned with ours, we can work with them and will continue to do that,\u201d Carter told reporters."}
