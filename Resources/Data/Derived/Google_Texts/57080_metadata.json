Shopping centres have duty of care to protect children on premises.\u201d\n\nThe Santa debate came to light on social media, with Queensland mothers at odds as to whether the practice should end \u2013 provoking a strong reaction from Ms Johnston. Many mothers back her stand.\n\n\u201cWe teach kids ... it\u2019s okay to say no if they don\u2019t feel safe,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis means not having to sit on anyone\u2019s lap, including family members, if they don\u2019t want to. So why should we make them sit on the lap of a person they don\u2019t know dressed as Santa?\u201d\n\nMs Johnston emphasises that she does not want to be a grinch and said the simple changes would not spoil the experience for children.\n\nQueensland\u2019s Mark Overell has been a Santa for 24 years and is a Santa trainer for Promoworks, which supplies hundreds of Santas to shopping centres across the state, including mega precincts such as Indooroopilly, Carindale and Garden City. He says all job applicants go through stringent background checks.\n\n\u201cI understand where the fear is coming from but the idea that Santa should be lumped in with everyone else is extreme,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur Santas are trained to do everything by the book. The hands with white gloves are only allowed on the children\u2019s shoulder or around the tummy, nowhere else. We are very proud of how we have conducted ourselves over the years and have had very few complaints.\u201d\n\nJenna McCarthy, who is mum to two-year-old Aaliyah said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t force her to be held by a random stranger so Santa is no different to me. I can understand the fear. We hype up Christmas so much and we give kids the idea that Santa isn\u2019t a stranger. What if they come across someone outside the shopping centre dressed as a Santa?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal to make a small change with kids just sitting beside Santa or standing beside him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that ruins the excitement.\u201d\n\nSocial commentator David Chalke believes the debate is ludicrous.\n\n\u201cWhile I recognise the fine work that Bravehearts does, this is another symptom of our hyper-vigilant, risk adverse society,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSurely it\u2019s better to teach children to recognise and report inappropriate behaviour if it occurs than to issue a needlessly draconian blanket ban on any human contact \u2014 just in case.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "THE traditional Christmas family souvenir is under threat with parents and child protection advocates arguing Santas lap should be off limits to kids.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/parents-warned-of-dangers-of-santas-lap/news-story/83e4ee47e02b2a57b366bc701a7ea84f", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0891b203d3f64175677ce834cc72e878", "type": "article", "description": "THE traditional Christmas family souvenir is under threat with parents and child protection advocates arguing Santa\u2019s lap should be off limits to kids.", "title": "Kids banned from sitting on Santa\u2019s lap"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0891b203d3f64175677ce834cc72e878", "description": "THE traditional Christmas family souvenir is under threat with parents and child protection advocates arguing Santa\u2019s lap should be off limits to kids.", "site": "@couriermail", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kids banned from sitting on Santa\u2019s lap"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/83e4ee47e02b2a57b366bc701a7ea84f?domain=couriermail.com.au"}, "articleid": "83e4ee47e02b2a57b366bc701a7ea84f", "keywords": "child protection, shopping centres, family souvenir, Child protection activist, child protection advocates, stringent background checks, child protection policies, centre owners, job applicants, family members, young children, human contact, random stranger, Queensland, Australia, David Chalke, Hetty Johnston, Jenna McCarthy, Mark Overell, Aaliyah", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-06T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-12-06T22:34:17.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdfc8\"", "article_summary": "THE traditional Christmas family souvenir is under threat with parents and child protection advocates arguing Santa\u2019s lap should be off limits to kids.\nChild protection activist Hetty Johnston this week backed the concerns of Queensland parents worried the time had come to stop their children sitting on the lap of shopping centre Santas for Christmas photos.\n\u201cThe directive would be for children to stand beside Santa, unless parents or children request to sit on his knee.\n\u201cThis means not having to sit on anyone\u2019s lap, including family members, if they don\u2019t want to.\n\u201cWhat we would like to see is shopping centre owners updating their child protection policies,\u201d Ms Johnston said."}
