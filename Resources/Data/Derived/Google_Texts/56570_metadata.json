Mike Doyle \u2014 or \u201cCoach Doyle,\u201d as he\u2019s deferentially called by colleagues \u2014 doesn\u2019t want to see anybody get hurt at the 53rd Annual Roll Call Congressional Baseball Game .\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing for a team of amateur athletes with an average age far past that of a professional ballplayer in his prime, and perhaps especially good for Rep. Joseph Crowley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hurt twice in the last three seasons,\u201d the New York Democrat readily admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve been hurt at the game. Typically, it\u2019s pulling a muscle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so psyched,\u201d Crowley explained. \u201cThe adrenaline\u2019s pumping. You\u2019re running from votes, you\u2019re changing in the car, you\u2019re running into the stadium. There\u2019s no time to warm up, the game starts. You\u2019re just, like, pumping. All those people there!\u201d\n\nHe paused and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a really, really cool thing.\u201d\n\nCrowley, the vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus when he\u2019s not manning first base, played in his first Roll Call Congressional Baseball Game in 1999, as a freshman lawmaker. He\u2019s seen a lot and has a humble idea of his place in the scheme of things. \u201cThe second year, I remember I was out in the outfield, and I didn\u2019t have my cleats that morning, and I was shagging a fly ball,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe field was so wet and dewy, I just lost my feet completely. Bang! Right smack on my back. And I got up and I said, \u2018Why am I doing this? I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m doing this.\u2019\u201d\n\nCrowley uses the word \u201chate\u201d for anyone who\u2019s a standout player, and \u201cjealous\u201d for anyone who competes to play first base. The latter point has been the source of a rivalry between him and Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio.\n\nBut despite his somewhat imposing stature and gruff baritone, Crowley is quick with a laugh and his eyes twinkle when he\u2019s talking trash \u2014 a sign he takes it all in stride.\n\nSome of Crowley\u2019s favorite memories? \u201cI enjoyed watching the Weiner years,\u201d said Crowley of former Rep. Anthony Weiner, a fellow New York Democrat and Mets fan.\n\nCrowley\u2019s nicknamed the Democrats\u2019 star pitcher, Cedric L. Richmond of Louisiana, \u201cFranchise\u201d and calls freshman Rep. Patrick Murphy of Florida, \u201cFranchise 2.\u201d Murphy, Crowley said, is \u201clike a gazelle\u201d on the field.\n\nHe says his favorite moment inside the diamond was in 2012, the same day the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cFolks made signs out in the field,\u201d Crowley said. \u201c\u2018Supreme Court 1, Republicans Nothing.\u2019 Something like that.\u201d\n\nWas there ever a low-point in his congressional baseball career?\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Crowley said, trying to deadpan but ultimately bursting out laughing. \u201cThe day Steve Largent struck me out my only time at bat. I said, \u2018I\u2019m never gonna be here again!\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Oklahoma Republican who\u2019s in two halls of fame \u2014 pro football\u2019s and the Roll Call Congressional Baseball Game\u2019s \u2014 made him look silly. \u201cI was there at the plate, and he threw a ball, and I fouled it off. And he threw another ball, and it was a ball. And he threw another ball, it was a strike, and I knew it was coming, and all I could do was look at it. And I watched it. It was a beautiful pitch, it was a curveball over the plate, and I remember thinking: \u2018That guy is such a great athlete. I hate him.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut that was 15, 16 years ago,\u201d Crowley shrugged. \u201cEvery year is a new beginning. I\u2019m hoping to hit it out soon.\u201d\n\nGet your tickets to the 53rd Annual Roll Call Congressional Baseball Game.\n\nRelated: Republican and Democratic team rosters for the 53rd Annual Roll Call Congressional Baseball Game Congressional Baseball Game Helps D.C.
