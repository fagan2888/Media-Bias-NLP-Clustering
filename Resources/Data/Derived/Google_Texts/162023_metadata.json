The GOP's Obama obsession\n\nIt\u2019s just two weeks into 2014, but House Republicans are already convinced that the key to winning November\u2019s elections is to talk about President Barack Obama as much as possible.\n\nIn public and private discussions, Obama remains the single-minded obsession of all top House Republicans. They can\u2019t get through a sentence without mentioning Obama or Obamacare. When top Republican leaders gathered last weekend at a boutique inn outside Washington for their annual planning retreat, the bulk of the conversation centered on Obamacare and presenting alternatives to what they consider Democrats\u2019 failed economic policies.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRepublicans believe there is plenty of evidence that the midterm campaign will pivot on the president. Obama\u2019s approval ratings are sagging, his health care law is widely unpopular and, for the first time in years, GOP polls show that voters blame Obama \u2014 not them \u2014 for the country\u2019s economic woes. In the Capitol, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has finally figured out a way to squelch internal GOP warfare to remove the threat of a government shutdown \u2014 for now.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Holder: Obama NSA plans 'smart')\n\nAnd the tradition of a \u201csix-year itch\u201d for sitting presidents \u2014 with the president\u2019s party losing dozens of House and Senate seats \u2014 is one that both parties are closely watching.\n\nSo, as House Republican leaders begin to eye the contours of their 2014 agenda, they are increasingly convinced that Obama and his policies will be productive ground for them to target when voters head to the ballot box in November.\n\nYet the GOP\u2019s single-minded focus on Obama could backfire if voters blame them for bashing the president instead of producing their own legislative agenda. And when asked, none of the Republican leaders bring up the budget deficit or $17 trillion-plus national debt, although fears over out-of-control government spending helped ignite the tea party movement in 2010.\n\nOn Tuesday, POLITICO asked several of the Republican Party\u2019s top leaders how they see 2014 shaping up \u2014 and the answer was remarkably consistent.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama's pen-and-phone strategy)\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said that Republicans\u2019 main reason for coming to work each day on Capitol Hill is to \u201ctry to respond to the hurt being caused by Obama\u2019s policies.\u201d\n\nBoehner agrees.\n\n\u201cI think this election \u2026 it\u2019s about two issues,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about the issue of jobs. And when you look at it, the American people have a right to continue to ask the question, \u2018Where are the jobs?\u2019 The president\u2019s been in office now for over five years. It\u2019s time for the president to admit that his policies are not working. In addition to that, and also part of that, is the issue of Obamacare. Obamacare is part of the \u2018no jobs\u2019 problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just Obamacare,\u201d Cantor said. \u201cIt is so many of the policies they\u2019re putting in place. On energy, on regulation, on education, you just run the gamut. We feel that the policies coming out [of the White House] are very harmful to the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shelf life of Obamacare being a continuing disappointment is going to be significant,\u201d added Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), the party\u2019s chief deputy whip. \u201cI think Democrats, from a political point of view, are going to be running away from it.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: State fights creating two Obamacares)\n\nThere are increasing signs that House Democrats are thinking along the same lines, too. Democrats are seeking political cover from Obamacare\u2019s woes, questioning whether the White House can ever successfully implement the landmark health care overhaul. Some moderate House Democrats are also retiring, giving Republicans an opportunity to widen their majority.\n\nRepublicans won\u2019t officially unveil their 2014 agenda until after meeting with all 233 House GOP lawmakers at the Republican Conference retreat, which will take place Jan. 29-31 at the Hyatt Regency resort in Cambridge, Md.\n\nThe focus on Obama and the momentum the GOP hopes that it will generate is a major reversal from the party\u2019s political fortunes late last year. Internal GOP polling from October \u2014 amid the government shutdown \u2014 showed Republicans underwater with voters. Almost 60 percent of voters then said what they were hearing about Republicans made them less favorable toward the party. Now, voters have roughly an even view of Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"description": "They think it's the key to winning elections.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "They think it's the key to winning elections.", "title": "The GOP's Obama obsession", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/gop-president-obama-obsession-102178.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/14/140114_obama_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Republicans,GOP", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Jakeshermanpolitico"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In public and private discussions, Obama remains the single-minded obsession of all top House Republicans.\nThe GOP's Obama obsessionIt\u2019s just two weeks into 2014, but House Republicans are already convinced that the key to winning November\u2019s elections is to talk about President Barack Obama as much as possible.\nYet the GOP\u2019s single-minded focus on Obama could backfire if voters blame them for bashing the president instead of producing their own legislative agenda.\nThey can\u2019t get through a sentence without mentioning Obama or Obamacare.\nGOP lawmakers can\u2019t get through a sentence without mentioning 'Obama' or 'Obamacare.'"}
