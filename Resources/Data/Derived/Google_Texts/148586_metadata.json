Of the 14 states who had more than 20 percent of their residents uninsured going into open enrollment (that started Oct. 1, 2013 and ended on March 30, 2014), Nevada ranked fifth among the 14 in the reducing its rolls of the uninsured (dropping from over 26 percent uninsured to about 19 percent uninsured).\n\nNationally, more than 8 million were signed up, while the Obama administration predicted 7 million would sign up.\n\nAs a broker on the Nevada Health Link, I have experienced ObamaCare first hand and can honestly say it has helped a lot of people -- many who never have been able to afford healthcare before, but can now.\n\nI have personally written more than 400 policies on the Health Link and deal with the Health Link on a daily basis, working out problems on policies.\n\nUnfortunately, some people didn\u2019t know where to go and listened to rumors of the health insurance being unaffordable and did not check on getting a policy on the Health Link until it was too late for the current year.\n\nIn fact, it is very affordable for some of those who thought they could not afford it. I did a policy for one lady in Elko who pays $15 per month for a policy that has a $250 deductible. The policy then pays 95 percent until she has paid $750 out of pocket and 100 percent after that. The government pays $681 a month for her as a tax credit.\n\nBut it also helps middle-class families -- like a family of five I wrote in Elko. Their cost was $750 per month, but the government is paying $1250 toward the premium, which is $2000 per month. They make just short of $100,000 a year.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act came about as a result of skyrocketing healthcare premiums set off by the economic turmoil in 2008 that caused many to lose their health insurance. Those who lost it didn\u2019t stop going to the doctor or the hospital. Instead, their costs got pushed off onto those who had insurance and they saw their health care premiums rise dramatically. As they went up, even more had to drop health insurance because they couldn\u2019t afford it.\n\nThe costs were spiraling out of control and something had to be done to put them in check. The Affordable Care Act was the government\u2019s answer and was based on a program developed by Mitt Romney when he was the Republican governor of Massachusetts.\n\nRebecca Montero, our owner, and I are still signing up people on the Health Link daily -- even though Open Enrollment ended on March 31 and the Special Enrollment period in Nevada ended on May 30.\n\nIf someone has a Qualifying Life Event -- loss of creditable insurance in the last 60 days, marriage, birth of a child or death of a family member, return from military service, moving into the state in the last 60 days, dramatic change in income or change in citizenship, among others, they can get a policy on the Health Link without having to wait on the next enrollment period -- which runs from Nov. 15, 2014 until Feb. 15, 2015. Plans for 2015 begin on Jan. 1, 2015, but someone who qualifies can get coverage for the remaining months of 2014.\n\nThe penalty for not being insured at least nine months in 2014 is $95 for an individual, $47.50 per child or 1 percent of your gross income, whichever is larger.\n\nBut that increases to $325 per adult, $162.50 per child or 2 percent in 2015 and jumps to $695 per adult, $347.50 per child or 2.5 percent of your income in 2016.\n\nAnyone who needs help on the Nevada Health Link is encouraged to contact us at our office at 2307 N.
