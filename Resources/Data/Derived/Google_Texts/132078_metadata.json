They knew they were racing the clock, but they didn\u2019t know when what they feared would strike.\n\n\u201cIt was sort of a nightmare waiting to happen,\u201d said seismologist James Jackson, head of the earth sciences department at the University of Cambridge in England. \u201cPhysically and geologically what happened is exactly what we thought would happen.\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t expect the massive quake that struck Saturday to happen so soon. The magnitude 7.8 earthquake killed at least 1,180 people and caused widespread destruction.\n\n\u201cI was walking through that very area where that earthquake was and I thought at the very time that the area was heading for trouble,\u201d said Jackson, lead scientist for Earthquakes Without Frontiers, a group that tries to make Asia more able to bounce back from these disasters and was having the meeting.\n\nA Kathmandu earthquake has long been feared, not just because of the natural seismic fault, but because of the local, more human conditions that make it worse.\n\nThe same size shaking can have bigger effects on different parts of the globe because of building construction and population and that\u2019s something the U.S. Geological Survey calculates ahead of time. So the same level of severe shaking would cause 10 to 30 people to die per million residents in California, but 1,000 maybe more in Nepal, and up to 10,000 in parts of Pakistan, India, Iran and China, said USGS seismologist David Wald.\n\nWhile the trigger of the disaster is natural \u2014 an earthquake \u2014 \u201cthe consequences are very much man-made,\u201d Jackson said. Except for landslides, which in this case are a serious problem, \u201cit\u2019s buildings that kill people not earthquakes,\u201d Jackson said. If you lived in a flat desert with no water, an earthquake wouldn\u2019t harm you, but then few people want to live there.\n\n\u201cThe real problem in Asia is how people have concentrated in dangerous places,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nKathmandu was warned, first by the Earth itself: this is the fifth significant quake there in the last 205 years, including the massive 1934 one.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Experts gathered in Nepal a week ago to ready for earthquake", "title": "Experts gathered in Nepal a week ago to ready for earthquake", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Experts gathered in Nepal a week ago to ready for earthquake", "title": "Experts gathered in Nepal a week ago to ready for earthquake", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/25/experts_gathered_in_nepal_a_week_ago_to_ready_for_earthquake/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/print.jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Experts gathered in Nepal a week ago to ready for earthquake", "title": "Experts gathered in Nepal a week ago to ready for earthquake", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/print.jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Seth Borenstein", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsNepal\u2019s devastating earthquake was the disaster experts knew was coming.\nWhile the trigger of the disaster is natural \u2014 an earthquake \u2014 \u201cthe consequences are very much man-made,\u201d Jackson said.\nExcept for landslides, which in this case are a serious problem, \u201cit\u2019s buildings that kill people not earthquakes,\u201d Jackson said.\nIf you lived in a flat desert with no water, an earthquake wouldn\u2019t harm you, but then few people want to live there.\n\u201cIt was sort of a nightmare waiting to happen,\u201d said seismologist James Jackson, head of the earth sciences department at the University of Cambridge in England."}
