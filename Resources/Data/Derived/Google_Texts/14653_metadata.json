But these technologies also have some incredibly valuable uses. Satellites, for example, can help map the ocean and search for lost planes, while drones are proving useful in the fight against poaching. And now, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science\u2019s annual meeting in San Jose, California, researchers revealed another fascinating use: archaeology.\n\nOne researcher, David Mattingly, works on Saharan civilizations, particularly the Garamante culture, which was active around 1000 BCE. Their culture is difficult to study because it\u2019s in hot, remote, arid regions of the Sahara where sites are extremely difficult to identify and they\u2019re hard to work in \u2014 though rest assured, at the time people inhabited them they were likely lush, fertile regions. Still, today\u2019s arid conditions presented the problem of how to find sites and learn more about them. To do that, Mattingly started harnessing satellites. This led to a wealth of sites being discovered, including settlements and cemeteries, which would help his team identify places on the ground to conduct excavations and related research.\n\nTaking a large-scale overhead view also provided fascinating information about the layout of communities and their movements, something that wouldn\u2019t have been possible from the ground. Thus, Mattingly turned what could have been a disadvantage into a serious advantage for his work, creating perspective that would enrich his understanding of the Garamante civilization.\n\nAnother researcher, Jos\u00e9 Iriarte, works in an area that might seem like the Sahara\u2019s polar opposite: the Amazonian rainforest. However, the region actually presents challenges similar to those seen in the Sahara. The landscape can be quite forbidding, it\u2019s difficult to mount expeditions to search for evidence of lost civilizations, and getting perspective on the environment is nearly impossible because of the thick tree cover. In fact, the dense Amazon canopy makes satellites functionally useless, but drones can fill in, scanning the ground for signs of civilization where a casual glance might not reveal any. For example, numerous Amerindian cultures dedicated significant energy to building up the soil, creating a nutrient-rich, highly fertile mix known as \u201cblack soil\u201d \u2014 and it remains active in the rainforest to this day, betraying the presence of former human inhabitants. Likewise, scanning with tools like LIDAR can reveal buried structures.\n\nThese fascinating applications of technologies people often associate with surveillance and warfare raise some uncomfortable questions. Even as the FAA finally starts to regulate the use of drones on US soil, recognizing that they\u2019re an issue that won\u2019t go away any time soon, many people are expressing concerns about the use of drones and satellites here and abroad. The fact that they have benign and even critically important civilian uses illustrates that sometimes questionable technologies can be used for good \u2014 and it might not be advisable to throw the baby out with the bathwater. However, it\u2019s clear that responsible and well-informed uses of drones, satellites, and related surveillance tools are critical to retain civil rights while still taking advantage of their benefits.\n\nPhoto credit: Don McCullough", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some surprising things are popping up on drone flight data: Historic civilizations.
