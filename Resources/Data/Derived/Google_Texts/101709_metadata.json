Look for the top ten Republican highlights next week in this space.\n\nIn the spirit of the holiday season,\n\nLet\u2019s review 2015 and the number one reason,\n\nThe Democrats believe this was a banner year,\n\nBecause instead of spreading good nature and cheer,\n\nThe GOP did nothing but instill fear,\n\nIn an electorate that is seeking leaders who lead,\n\nNot war-mongers who feed,\n\nOn the American people\u2019s angst and worry,\n\nFor their own political gain and glory.\n\nSo let\u2019s review the Top Ten Most Memorable People and Moments for Democrats in 2015:\n\n\n\nBusiness mogul Donald Trump\u2019s previews the tenor of his candidacy when he formally announces at Trump Tower on June 16, 2015 in New York City, calling some Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists.

Trump has delivered some unbelievable doozies, starting with his annoucement speech broadside, in which he said Mexican immigrants were criminals and rapists. Reference to a \u201cgreat wall\u201d was there from the start, along with the mandate that Mexico must pay for it. Then, there was the declaration that he would create a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to remove all 11 million undocumented immigrants if he becomes president. Gracias Se\u00f1or Trump!!\n\n\n\nThe White House was bathed in rainbow colors to celebrate the June ruling by the Supreme Court legalizing gay marriage.\n\nNumber 9 \u2013 The Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage:\n\nThe June SCOTUS ruling declaring the right to marry is protected for all Americans under the U.S. constitution made history and was a huge win for the country. It was also a win for the LGBT community, for American values, for President Obama, and for Democrats who had embraced this issue as one of freedom and equality for all under the law.\n\nNumber 8 \u2013 The Supreme Court decision upholding the Affordable Care Act, and the 18 million Americans now covered by Obamacare:\n\nOver the summer, the Supreme Court upheld a critical part of the Affordable Care Act that provides federal health insurance subsidies to Americans who qualify, solidifying President Obama\u2019s legacy-making domestic achievement and handing him and the Democrats a huge political win. Proving good policy is good politics, more important than the political win are the millions of Americans now covered by Obamacare who can sleep soundly knowing they will not go broke if someone in their family gets sick.\n\nNumber 7 \u2013 Continued record job growth:\n\nThe country has seen 69 straight months of private-sector job growth \u2013 a record \u2013 and the unemployment rate is down to 5 percent. Wages are starting to go up and more people are jumping into the job market.\n\n\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry, and other dignitaries watch as U.S. Marines raise the U.S. flag over the newly reopened embassy in Havana, Cuba.

Over the summer, in a beautiful, solemn ceremony that opened up the U.S. embassy in Cuba, there was a feeling of renewed optimism and hope for the Cuban people, the majority of whom support the new policy. A majority of Americans, including majorities of Latinos, also support this new policy. Gracias Presidente Obama!\n\n\n\nDonald Trump defends his plan to bar all Muslims from entering the country during a rally in South Carolina.\n\nNumber 5 \u2013 Donald Trump:\n\nTurns out Trump was just getting started when he insulted a whole country and demonized Latinos and immigrants. As The Donald got warmed up at campaign rallies, at GOP debates, and in innumerable interviews he can\u2019t say no to, we experienced diatribes that insulted whole swaths of voters including women, nursing mothers, POWs and veterans, and in the most recent and egregious pronouncement, all Muslims in the country and around the world by supporting a policy that would deny entry into the U.S. to any Muslim from abroad.\n\n\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testifies, and reacts to Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) arguing, during the House Select Committee on Benghazi hearing on Oct. 22, 2015.

Kevin McCarthy\u2019s (R-Calif.) short-lived House speaker campaign:\n\nWhen Kevin McCarthy, House Majority Leader, uttered the words that proved the Benghazi Committee was set up solely to bring down Hillary Clinton\u2019s poll numbers, a political tsunami ensued clearing the way for Secretary Clinton \u2014 and the Democrats \u2014 to put the Benghazi issue to rest. Clinton\u2019s 11-hour testimony before the Benghazi Committee comes in as number 4a on this list because of her skill and aplomb in the face of bombastic and incessant badgering by her questioners. But McCarthy\u2019s comments no doubt set her up nicely as they exposed the real motives for the GOP Benghazi probe, of which the American people were already suspicious.\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidates take the stage during the CNN Republican presidential debate at the Venetian Hotel & Casino on Dec. 15, 2015, in Las Vegas.

Terrill)\n\nNumber 3 \u2013 The Republican debates:\n\nWith every passing GOP debate, the stark contrast becomes clearer between what has been a complete circus on the Republican side and the more serious candidates on the Democratic side. The American people are able, on national television, to witness the GOP\u2019s extreme move to the right, as candidates trailing Trump tried to embrace his hardline views in an effort to gain traction in the polls without alienating his supporters. That strategy has failed. Trump continues to lead by massive margins nationally and in most states, making the Republican Party look more and more out of touch with the American people (and with reality) with every passing day.\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls participate in the a debate hosted by ABC News at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 19, 2015.

The Democratic debates were the complete opposite. They were substantive, robust and passionate discussions about policies the Democratic candidates support to lift middle-class families, keep the economy surging for everyone, and keep Americans safe and secure without the fear and war-mongering. While the Democratic debates did not emanate as much heat, they projected much more light than their counterparts. And light is what we need most at this particular moment.\n\n\n\nTrump speaks at a campaign rally in Mesa, Arizona, Dec. 16, 2015.

When many Republicans say that if Trump becomes the nominee \u2013 and there is not much at the end of 2015, with just a few weeks left before the first votes are cast in Iowa and New Hampshire, to say that he won\u2019t \u2013 they will vote for Hillary, it\u2019s obvious that the ex-reality TV star is truly the best thing to have happened to Democrats this year.\n\nHere\u2019s to a terrific past year for Democrats and for millions of Americans and their families who benefited from the policies we fought for. And may 2016 bring even better tidings of comfort and Donald Trump! Er, I mean joy.
