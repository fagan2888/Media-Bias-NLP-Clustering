They lived together in one of the apartments damaged in the July 11 standoff with 24-year-old Jared Woosypiti, who was killed in a gunfight with police.\n\nThe city faces at least a dozen claims for a total of more than $100,000 for damages caused by police during the 32-hour standoff. Officers fired tear gas, detonated explosive devices and shot water into the apartments. Six apartments were damaged.\n\nThe city pays such claims out of its self-insurance fund.\n\nPrevious story:\n\nTuesday, September 10, 2013\n\nWichita city attorneys want to settle lawsuits stemming from the July police standoff with Jared Woosypiti. Hidden deep in Tuesday's City Council agenda are payments to residents affected by the confrontation.\n\nFour units at the Southlake Village Apartments were declared unfit for living, after the 32-hour standoff. Now the city legal team is recommending a lump sum payment of $20,000 dollars to settle any lawsuits filed by residents of building eight.\n\n\"Claimants allege that their personal property and contents of their apartment were destroyed by actions of the Wichita Police Department,\" says an attachment in the City Council \"consent agenda.\"\n\nIt's not clear from the agenda exactly how many people have filed claims or lawsuits.
