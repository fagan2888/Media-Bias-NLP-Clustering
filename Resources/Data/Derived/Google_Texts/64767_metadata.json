But new research presented at the 250th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) offers hope to those who wish to take medication to help treat the disorder. The new compounds developed by researchers out of the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, come with fewer side effects than current treatments.\n\n\u201cAlcoholism is a major problem in the U.S.,\u201d V. V. N. Phani Babu Tiruveedhula, an author of the study and a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, said in the press release. \u201cAlcohol abuse costs almost $220 billion to the U.S. economy every year. That\u2019s a shocking number. We need a better treatment right now.\u201d\n\nAlcoholism is typically treated through rehab or cognitive behavioral therapy \u2014 but over the years, scientists have developed various drugs that can combat an alcoholic\u2019s desire to drink. There are several medications that are approved by the FDA; the oldest one is called Antabuse and it inhibits the production of the enzyme that normally absorbs acetaldehyde, a product of alcohol breakdown. In short, Antabuse causes a buildup of acetaldehyde in the body, which induces nausea, vomiting, and an overall sick feeling. Another drug, Naltrexone, blocks out receptors for endorphins in the brain that are responsible for that happy feeling during drinking, reducing the pleasurable aspects of it.\n\nThese drugs, however, often cause depression \u2014 and they might become addictive themselves, which is why researchers wanted to develop a new medication that was effective but also safe.\n\n\u201c[Current drugs] dampen out the dopamine system a little bit, so you don\u2019t get so happy when you have an alcoholic beverage,\u201d James Cook, a chemist at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and an author of the study, said in the press release.\n\nThe researchers, including Cook and Tiruveedhula, focused on molecules that were related to the other medications, and made several beta-carboline compounds that didn\u2019t cause any adverse side effects. They simplified the compound production steps from eight to two, then tested them on rats that had been bred to crave alcohol. Rats that were given these compounds were far less likely to drink alcohol, and experienced fewer side effects than are normally associated with similar meds. And perhaps most interestingly, the rats also experienced lessened anxiety when taking the meds \u2014 hinting that these compounds could be a much more effective way to treat alcoholism as well as depression.\n\nIn addition, the compounds could be taken as a pill. \u201cWhat excites me is the compounds are orally active, and they don\u2019t cause depression like some drugs do,\u201d Cook said in the press release.\n\nThe researchers will need to further study the compounds, particularly in humans \u2014 then team up with drug makers to actually create medications. Cook believes that a medication could be available within the next five to six years.\n\nTo learn more about the study, watch the video below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alcohol, alcoholic", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers are developing a pill that could help alcoholics overcome their addiction without all the nasty side effects.", "title": "The New Pill That Could Reduce Cravings, Depression In Alcoholics", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-pill-might-reduce-cravings-depression-alcoholics-little-side-effects-348770", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/20/alcoholism.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers are developing a pill that could help alcoholics overcome their addiction without all the nasty side effects.", "title": "The New Pill That Could Reduce Cravings, Depression In Alcoholics", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-pill-might-reduce-cravings-depression-alcoholics-little-side-effects-348770", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/20/alcoholism.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/20/alcoholism.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-08-20T14:34:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T14:34:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers are developing a pill that could help alcoholics overcome their addiction without all the nasty side effects."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb2d\"", "article_summary": "The new compounds developed by researchers out of the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, come with fewer side effects than current treatments.\nThe researchers will need to further study the compounds, particularly in humans \u2014 then team up with drug makers to actually create medications.\n\u201cWhat excites me is the compounds are orally active, and they don\u2019t cause depression like some drugs do,\u201d Cook said in the press release.\nRats that were given these compounds were far less likely to drink alcohol, and experienced fewer side effects than are normally associated with similar meds.\nThe researchers, including Cook and Tiruveedhula, focused on molecules that were related to the other medications, and made several beta-carboline compounds that didn\u2019t cause any adverse side effects."}
