Vote 2016 (Photo: 3dfoto, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

EDITOR: I am asking the voters of Marathon County District 11 for their vote in the upcoming election.

Major concerns are access to health care especially Mental Health Care and treatment of Addictions, treatment instead of prison, transportation for those who cannot and do not drive. Water quality, roads, more jobs and better pay, having government spend the limited funds wisely.

I have been involved in activities at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, six years on church council, seven years as a confirmation guide and worship services with the choir.

In the community I have served on the Marathon County Literacy Board and worked with students. Coached softball with East, Edgar, and summer league. Member and board member of NAOMI and NAMI.

I have a diverse back ground in sales, construction, Coast Guard veteran, former police officer in Tempe. I am a retired special education teacher and math teacher in Glendale Union HS District, Arizona. Coached basketball, baseball, softball and Special Olympics.

I listen and I ask questions, I want to know what is the value as well as the cost!

John Enk,

Wausau
