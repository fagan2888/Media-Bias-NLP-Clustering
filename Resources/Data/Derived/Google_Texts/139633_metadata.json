Since, they've been inundated with interview request and online supporters who believe in the Kentucky feline's stance on social issues.\n\n\"Limberbutt McCubbins is a candidate we can all get behind. Meow is the time!\" said McCubbins and Weiss in speaking with the Louisville Courier-Journal. When it comes to liberal voters, they might not be wrong.\n\nLimberbutt advocates legalizing gay marriage, decriminalizing catnip, improving the country's space program, and passing legislation on the \"Affordable Cat Act,\" which - like President Obama's Affordable Care Act - covers veterinary costs for pets who need to be spayed or neutered.\n\n\"And it even includes dogs,\" Weiss said. \"We thought long and hard and said, 'You know what, this is not a country with discrimination anymore.\"\n\nEquipped with \"Limberbutt 2016\" apparel and a growing social media presence - which inspired an independent YouTube video that takes shots at Hillary Clinton and a Facebook post assuring followers he will \"beat Bernie Sanders in 2016\" - Limberbutt is ready to hit the campaign trail.\n\nFor those wondering whether he is eligible, Weis and McCubbins have already looked into that.\n\n\"The Constitution doesn't say it has to be human years,\" Weiss said, referring to an FEC rule requiring candidates to be at least 35 years of age. \"But it doesn't seem likely that he walked all the way to Louisville from Canada, or Mexico, or swam from Cuba.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Limberbutt, there is no proven scientific method for converting cat years into human years. Only time will tell if this portly house cat will claw his way to the White House.\n\n\u00a9 2015 Latinos Post. All rights reserved.
