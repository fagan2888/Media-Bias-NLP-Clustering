Health care reform will affect everyone and change the way health care services are delivered to our community.\n\n\u201cWe have a health care system that costs significantly more than health care in other parts of the world, and the statistics in terms of outcome do not support that additional cost by having better outcomes than other countries,\u201d explains Jeff Folick, a retired chairman and CEO of a Medicare health plan who also serves on Keiro Senior HealthCare\u2019s board of directors.\n\nReducing Costs, Improving Population Health\n\nHealth care costs are rising at a rate that is unsustainable under our current service and payment model. The Affordable Care Act, or ACA, seeks to reduce the per capita costs of health care and improve the overall health of the population by making preventive screenings (such as diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol, and cancer screenings) available with little or no co-payments.\n\nThe law also aims to reduce the number of uninsured Americans by making health care coverage more affordable and requiring most U.S. residents to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. (Cost-sharing subsidies and tax credits may be available to help reduce the costs to individuals and families.) It also strives to reduce costs and enhance the care experience by streamlining the delivery of health care through coordination of services among hospitals, physicians, nursing homes, and community-based health care providers.\n\nChanges Will Affect Everyone\n\nHealth care reform will affect different people in different ways. Already, young adults may obtain health care coverage through their parents\u2019 insurance plans, up until age 26. Insurers can no longer set lifetime caps on health benefits. Children with pre-existing conditions cannot be denied health benefits. The uninsured are able to purchase insurance through health exchanges such as Covered California, which began enrollment for Californians on Oct. 1, 2013.\n\nDual-eligible beneficiaries (those individuals who quality for both Medicare and Medicaid/Medi-Cal) will be enrolled into managed care plans as early as next April. And health care providers like hospitals and Keiro Senior HealthCare need to contract with health plans and develop relationships with other service providers in order to provide more coordinated care.\n\nAs a result of care coordination, the experience and delivery of health care will change. Care managers will oversee a person\u2019s care and coordinate health services from different providers.\n\nSimilar to a health maintenance organization (HMO), health plans will rely on a narrow network of providers for referrals, which may limit which doctors and service providers an individual will be able to see. Already, there is a movement away from using costly hospitals and nursing homes and a growing effort to care for people at home in their own communities.\n\nIncreased Focus on Wellness\n\nWhile health care reform is concerned about reducing costs to the federal government, it is also concerned about improving the overall health of the community.\n\n\u201cPart of the health care reform philosophy is focused on wellness, teaching people to take care of their own health,\u201d says Makoto Nakayama, PharmD, MBA, consultant and former hospital administrator, and chairman of the Keiro Nursing Home board of directors. \u201cKeiro\u2019s Institute for Healthy Aging is ahead of the game in that we\u2019ve been concentrating on wellness for many years now.\u201d\n\nThrough conferences and how-to videos for caregivers; online fact sheets at www.keiro.org and the Genki Woman blog at www.genkiwoman.org on healthy aging; wellness-focused walks and events; lifelong learning courses on memory, fall prevention, diabetes, and healthier living; and most recently, interactive sessions on Medicare and health care reform, Keiro has been supporting our community so that everyone can age with confidence, no matter where they live.\n\n\u201cKeiro provides peace of mind and resources to twice as many people through our healthy aging programming in the community than we do in our facilities,\u201d says Shawn Miyake, president and CEO of Keiro Senior HealthCare.\n\nThe changes accompanying health care reform are complex, but Keiro has free resources to help our community navigate through the evolving health care system. To help our community understand the changes and access the benefits available to us, Keiro has launched a Health Literacy Project (HeLP). With presentations at community centers and churches/temples, a dedicated health care reform section on Keiro\u2019s website (www.keiro.org/health-care-reform-2013), and MedCHAT, a hands-on learning experience about Medicare, Keiro is coming alongside the community to help individuals maintain their best resource \u2013 an informed and vital self.
