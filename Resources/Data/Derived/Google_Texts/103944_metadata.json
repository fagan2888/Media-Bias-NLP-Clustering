Of course, these worlds are the traditional bookends for attempting to answer big, abstract questions. For example: as considered below, why is there something rather than nothing? These bookends, however, are often no better at finding answers to a question like this than each of us are able to do individually. So shouldn't we each make a strong effort to find our own answers in this regard?\n\nHere are my \"say what\" thoughts on the subject of why there is something. The first step is to dispose of science and the next is to dispose of most religions. Science tells us how there is something but not why. Most religions provide the why but, in doing so, claim a personal God.\n\nI suggest an answer can be found in abstract painter Barnett Newman's comment: \"The subject matter of creation is chaos.\" I interpret Newman to make \"creation\" rather than order the opposing force to \"chaos.\" From this elevation, I think creation's purpose is to build and sustain an evolving harmony from the chaos in nature, which chaos includes: an unstable void in \"nothing\"; quantum uncertainty; and the violent energy embedded in mass. Perhaps, further, as a result of its dualistic strength, its purpose includes, progressively, to help frame a just, humane order. This last thought, reaching into moral philosophy, gets support from professor Harold Bloom's comment: \"Only dualism, the distinction between ideal forms and ordinary realities, is truth for Plato's Socrates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, now it is time for the \"say what\" and moving back to a traditional answer or, instead, moving onto something else.\n\nPaul G.
