All candidates were given the opportunity to speak with the Midweek Wire before the April 26 primary.\n\nMarc Duome views himself as the outsider candidate in the Republican primary for the 8th Congressional District.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a politician and I\u2019m not related to one,\u201d Duome said. \u201cI could continue what I\u2019m doing, but I\u2019m concerned with the direction of this country that I decided to run in this race.\u201d\n\nDuome, a Plumstead resident and clinical psychologist and neuropsychologist, points to the birth of his granddaughter, Amilia Rose, as the motivation to run for Congress. His concern for America\u2019s future amplified when he thought about hers.\n\n\u201cThe compass points are pointing toward an outside perspective, a business perspective \u2026 The other guys have done public sector work with nice resumes, but they\u2019ve never been in the private sector,\u201d Duome said. \u201cIf I ran my business like Washington is running, I wouldn\u2019t be here more than for six months.\u201d\n\nDuome believes his perspective is important, especially regarding health care. He said he would vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, believing it to be a \u201cbureaucratic monstrosity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an albatross around the nation\u2019s neck,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we went to a system where you had competition across state lines, where you went with a major medical-type plan, where you could pick what your plan was, premiums would be really tiny.\u201d\n\nDuome wants an overall more limited role of the federal government, instead allowing the states and the people to self-govern. The federal government, he said, should take care of the basic fundamentals, like national defense.\n\n\u201cThe kneejerk reflex of Congress is to be everything to everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s Congress\u2019 job to run our lives.\u201d\n\nDuome believes in supporting veterans, adhering to the Constitution and limiting terms for members of Congress. He pledged to serve no more than three terms if elected.\n\n\u201cI would not suggest building a concrete wall,\u201d Duome joked, though one of his priorities is securing U.S. borders. He does support \u201cvirtual walls,\u201d meaning increased attention to surveillance systems and security. \u201cWe have the manpower down there. Let them do their job.\u201d\n\nHe also suggests \u201ccutting out the incentives\u201d for illegal immigration. That means defunding sanctuary cities and cracking down on illegal immigrants benefiting from health care and education in the United States.\n\nDuome is a pro-life and Second Amendment advocate. He encourages private sector growth and \u201cpersonal responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt all comes down to common sense,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernment should be there to protect us. It should take care of the basic infrastructure. I really believe more power needs to be in the states\u2019 hands.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "The Midweek Wire", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Election preview: Duome wants more outsiders in | The Midweek Wire on WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Midweek Wire", "description": "This is the fourth in a series of interviews with candidates for Pennsylvania\u2019s 8th Congressional District.
