Those systems are designed to flag money-laundering schemes\u2014possible sources of terrorism financing\u2014and prevent banks from doing business with countries that are under sanction by the U.S., such as Iran and Sudan. But some banks have set up compliance systems that are too weak, or deliberately ineffective, Lawsky said.\n\nHis department is planning to conduct random audits of those compliance systems.\n\n\u201cSince we can\u2019t go in and audit every institution,\u201d Lawsky said, the office is weighing \u201cmaking some senior responsible executives personally attest to the adequacy and robustness of the compliance systems they have.\"\n\nBut Lawsky also said his office\u2019s biggest daily concern now is cybersecurity, and the possibility of a major attack on financial institutions that could wreak major havoc on world financial markets.\n\n\u201cA question I often get is \u2018What keeps you up at night?,\u2019\" Lawsky said. \u201cThe answer is a lot of things, but right at the top of the list is the cybersecurity at the firms we regulate. ... We worry that when that major cyber event happens we'll all look back and say how did we not do more to prevent it?\u201d\n\nD.F.S. is weighing requiring financial institutions to develop multi-step security systems for all of their employees, instead of the simple username and password access systems many companies employ now, which are too easy to hack.\n\n\u201cThe password system should have been dead years ago,\u201d Lawsky said.\n\nThe last experimental idea Lawsky announced could prove the most controversial in New York State.\n\nLawsky said his department, in coordination with the rest of Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s administration, is considering ways to use its regulatory authority to change how insurers pay doctors and health care providers.\n\nNew Yorker\u2019s health care costs are rising overall, in part because of a fee-for-service payment system in place that pays doctors more for more care, not necessarily better care, Lawsky said.\n\nD.F.S. is working with groups of \u201cstakeholders\u201d in the health care industry to determine possible alternate-payment methods that could move the state away from the fee-for-service model.\n\nIn short, Lawsky said his office, which regulates commercial health insurers, could require insurers to make payment reforms, changing how they reimburse providers, as part of D.F.S.\u2019s annual review of insurers requests for insurance premium rate increases. New York state has a \u201cprior approval\u201d policy which requires any increase in premium rates by insurers to be approved by D.F.S.\n\nCuomo\u2019s executive budget this year and the state\u2019s broader Medicaid reform program are aiming to move away from fee-for-service health care reimbursement toward a value-based payment system.\n\nBut both houses of the Legislature have signaled unwillingness to consider initiatives inside Cuomo\u2019s budget which would have given the state health department broad authority to negotiate how a \u201cvalue-based payment\u201d methodology would work here in New York. Both the Senate and Assembly removed Cuomo\u2019s value-based payment proposal from their one-house budget proposals.\n\nLawsky said any departmental action incentivizing payment reform would be at least a year away, and said his office would pursue alternative payment reform no matter what happens in this budget cycle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens and what the Legislature does but ... I think at D.F.S., because it all flows down from the governor, we\u2019re committed to trying to move towards alternative payment systems of payment reform, because thats how you're going to bend this cost curve,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re pretty creative and the governor\u2019s pretty creative, and if the Legislature doesn't want to go a certain direction, we\u2019ll figure out what we can do within the law and within our regulatory authority,\" he said. \"And we have a lot of authority through the prior approval process.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/03/8563991/lawsky-gets-creative-cybersecurity-health-care", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a-Lawsky_0.png", "type": "article", "title": "Lawsky gets 'creative' on cybersecurity, health care"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Financial superintendent outlines plans for cybersecurity, health care reforms"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd530d\"", "article_summary": "New Yorker\u2019s health care costs are rising overall, in part because of a fee-for-service payment system in place that pays doctors more for more care, not necessarily better care, Lawsky said.\nis working with groups of \u201cstakeholders\u201d in the health care industry to determine possible alternate-payment methods that could move the state away from the fee-for-service model.\nCuomo\u2019s executive budget this year and the state\u2019s broader Medicaid reform program are aiming to move away from fee-for-service health care reimbursement toward a value-based payment system.\nLawsky said his department, in coordination with the rest of Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s administration, is considering ways to use its regulatory authority to change how insurers pay doctors and health care providers.\nLawsky said his office has encountered problems at financial institutions with internal compliance systems set up to catch illegal or risky financial transactions."}
