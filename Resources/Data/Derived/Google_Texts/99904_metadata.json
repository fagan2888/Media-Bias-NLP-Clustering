For a week, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon had declared a state of emergency, calling out the National Guard to \u201cmaintain peace and protect those exercising their right to free speech.\u201d Today, he repeated the same message.\n\n\u201cTogether we are all focused to make sure that the necessary resources are at hand to protect lives, to protect business and to protect free speech.\u201d\n\nGiven the record of arrests by Ferguson police of protesters and reporters, Nixon\u2019s message was fairly simple to translate: He anticipated \u2014 correctly \u2014 that the grand jury would not indict Darren Wilson. Nixon\u2019s fear was that in such a case, black Americans\u2019 ire at that decision would explode in violence and potentially violate the lives, businesses and \u201cfree speech\u201d not of black protesters, but of white denizens. Nixon hadn\u2019t said it, but his assumption of violence reinscribed the assumption of black madness, of the lack of rationality. \u201cProtest\u201d could only be irrational, because it would challenge the \u201cnatural order of things,\u201d to paraphrase 17th century French economist Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay. In his very actions, he all but indicated, what most of us knew and feared \u2014 that the grand jury would not indict Darren Wilson. And for Nixon, the Ferguson police and the white residents of Ferguson that is as it should be.\n\nThe natural order, for Gov. Nixon, is one in which police violence will continue to be seen as \u201cstopping criminals,\u201d and preserving \u201cfreedom\u201d for the whites of Ferguson. In the meantime, the black citizens of Ferguson and their supporters across the globe will ascribe an enormous, though rather different, symbolism to the verdict: No indictment confirms the continued absence of legal and, indeed, moral justice.\n\nYet, it is hard to imagine that even had the grand jury indicted, that their decision would have much of an effect on the institutional, deeply embedded problem of state-endorsed, police-led racial violence in Ferguson, St. Louis or anywhere else in the U.S.\n\nThe indictment itself is supposed to be an indication of whether there appear to be sufficient grounds for putting Wilson on trial. In the event that the grand jury had indicted, a trial itself, guaranteed to be a long, arduous process, would most likely not have had a very satisfactory outcome. In the even more unlikely \u2014 and far away \u2014 case that the trial were to have found Wilson to be guilty of having killed Brown unjustly, at most, one police officer would have been convicted for one act. A guilty legal verdict, in effect, would have been just that: a lone legal verdict in one case involving one black teenager and one white police officer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With \"no indictment\" announced against Darren Wilson, a perverted natural order of things was affirmed.
