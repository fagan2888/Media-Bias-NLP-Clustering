The situation in the Buckeye State has been quietly unfolding over the past several months, as the national attention has largely remained focused on Texas; however, the announcement of yet another clinic closure this week highlights the fact that Ohio women are in trouble.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Lebanon Road Surgery Center \u2014 also known as \u201cWomen\u2019s Med\u201d \u2014 announced that it is no longer able to keep fighting state officials in court and will immediately halt its surgical abortion services. The Cincinnati-area clinic hasn\u2019t been able to get a so-called \u201cpatient-transfer agreement\u201d with a local hospital, a new requirement attached to a budget law approved by Gov. John Kasich (R) in 2013.\n\nA transfer agreement is essentially a bureaucratic obstacle that doesn\u2019t actually help ensure patients are receiving safe abortion care; the tactic fits into a larger strategy to over-regulate abortion providers that\u2019s playing out across the country. While this particular method of forcing clinics to close isn\u2019t specific to Ohio, state officials there have been particularly good at it.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s Med does strongly believe that the governor is targeting abortion clinics one-by-one throughout the state of Ohio to shut them down,\u201d Thea Langsam, the lawyer representing the clinic, told reporters. \u201cWe expect there will be an influx of patients who can no longer receive services there\u2026 This is a difficult day for those of us who care about a woman\u2019s right to make decisions about her own body.\u201d\n\nOhio has had strict abortion restrictions in place for several years. But now, thanks to the 2013 budget, state officials on the health board have more power to deny clinics\u2019 transfer agreements and yank their licenses. The Ohio Department of Health, which has been stacked with abortion opponents hand-picked by Kasich, has recently taken a much more aggressive approach to abortion clinics that fall outside the state\u2019s strict licensing requirements.\n\nWomen\u2019s Med is the fourth abortion facility to close since the new budget agreement was enacted last year. And according to the Cincinnati Enquirer, three of Ohio\u2019s remaining ten clinics are in danger of following suit because their transfer agreements are in dispute. The impending closures threaten to leave the entire western portion of the state without a single abortion provider.\n\n\u201cAbortion access is now severely endangered for Cincinnati area women with only one provider remaining,\u201d Val Haskell \u2014 who owns Women\u2019s Med along with her husband, Martin \u2014 said in a statement. \u201cThis sole provider is also soon to be closed if Governor Kasich has his way.\u201d\n\nAbortion restrictions attached to an unrelated state budget, political influence on supposedly nonpartisan health boards, and a growing health care crisis seem like all the necessary ingredients for an explosive news story. But Ohio has largely remained out of national headlines. As the New York Times reported in October, that\u2019s because the state has perfected an incremental strategy, \u201cpassing a web of rules designed to push the hazy boundaries of Supreme Court guidelines without flagrantly violating them.\u201d That gradual approach doesn\u2019t provoke the same kind of national drama as the more obviously restrictive laws in other states.\n\nReproductive rights supporters believe that the same strategy is continuing to play out now, with the gradual closing of clinics over the past several months. Picking off abortion providers slowly makes it harder to sue to state and block the new law.\n\n\u201cUnlike Texas, where all the clinics close in one fell swoop, in Ohio they\u2019re closing one by one. So it\u2019s difficult to make a case that this is a problem until it\u2019s too late, because each individual clinic has to stand or fall alone,\u201d Ren\u00e9e Paradis, an attorney for the ACLU, told The Huffington Post. \u201cThe \u2018death by a thousand cuts\u2019 model is what\u2019s going to happen to the women in Ohio.\u201d\n\nThe closure of the Haskells\u2019 Cincinnati-area clinic is a significant victory for the anti-abortion community, which has made Martin Haskell into the poster child for so-called \u201cpartial-birth abortion.\u201d Haskell once presented on that method of terminating a later pregnancy at a meeting of abortion providers in the 1990s, and since then, anti-choice groups have targeted him as a \u201cnotorious late term abortion doctor.\u201d His clinics \u2014 he owns a second one in another part of Ohio \u2014 are plagued with daily protesters.\n\nThose protesters are already celebrating this week\u2019s news. \u201cI am very glad that the Kasich administration is trying to protect life,\u201d Joanne Kemmerer, a member of the Cincinnati Pro-Life Committee who wants to see all abortion clinics shuttered, told local Cincinnati outlet WKRC. \u201cLife begins at conception. We all know that a butterfly is not growing inside the woman\u2019s stomach or uterus.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The biggest fight over reproductive rights you've never heard of.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The biggest fight over reproductive rights you've never heard of.", "title": "Abortion Access In Ohio Is Quietly Disappearing", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/08/21/3473995/abortion-access-ohio-disappearing/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_139263098-e1382473775762.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The biggest fight over reproductive rights you've never heard of.", "title": "Abortion Access In Ohio Is Quietly Disappearing", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_139263098-e1382473775762-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_139263098-e1382473775762.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_139263098-e1382473775762.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-21T10:46:01+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde527\"", "article_summary": "Health Abortion Access In Ohio Is Quietly Disappearing CREDIT: ShutterstockLawmakers in Ohio are abusing their regulatory authority to wage a war on abortion clinics, according to reproductive rights supporters in the state.\nWhile this particular method of forcing clinics to close isn\u2019t specific to Ohio, state officials there have been particularly good at it.\nThe Ohio Department of Health, which has been stacked with abortion opponents hand-picked by Kasich, has recently taken a much more aggressive approach to abortion clinics that fall outside the state\u2019s strict licensing requirements.\n\u201cWomen\u2019s Med does strongly believe that the governor is targeting abortion clinics one-by-one throughout the state of Ohio to shut them down,\u201d Thea Langsam, the lawyer representing the clinic, told reporters.\nWomen\u2019s Med is the fourth abortion facility to close since the new budget agreement was enacted last year."}
