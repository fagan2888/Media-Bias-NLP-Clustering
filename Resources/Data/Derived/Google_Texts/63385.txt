Despite the Affordable Care Act, more than 1 million Los Angeles residents remain uninsured, but a free three-day health care clinic is being offered to help those in need.Hundreds of Angelenos stood outside the Los Angeles Sports Arena for the free clinic."This is the 2015 edition of the Care Harbor L.A. Free Clinic where almost 4,000 individuals between Thursday and Sunday will be getting free medical, dental or vision care," said Francisco Oaxaca with Los Angeles Health Care Plan.Doctors, dentists, optometrists, nurses and many volunteers provided free medical services. The large clinic will assist about 4,000 patients, or about 1,000 each day over the course of three days. That makes it the largest free clinic in the U.S.In addition to the large number of people receiving care, mental health care services will also be provided.To keep the event organized, color coded wrist bands were worn by patients, which indicated the type of service they needed. Organizers said all the wrist bands for the year were given out.The health fair was scheduled through Sunday from 6:30 a.m. until 5 p.m.
