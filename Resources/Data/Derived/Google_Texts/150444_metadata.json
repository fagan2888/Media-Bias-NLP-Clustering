Trump is the product of a deliberate Republican strategy, adopted by Richard Nixon\u2019s people in 1968, to attract voters with an apocalyptic redemption story rather than reasoned argument. It has taken almost 50 years, but we have finally arrived at the culmination of postmodern politics in which Republican leaders use words to create their own reality.\n\nAfter World War II, President Dwight Eisenhower and men like New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller led the Republican Party with policies based in reasoned argument. They used the government to regulate the economy and to promote social welfare, much as Democrats did, although with a philosophy that emphasized social unity rather than class conflict. The policies of these \u201cMe Too\u201d Republicans infuriated Movement Conservatives on the far right, who insisted that all government activism was communism. In 1964, Movement Conservative spokesman Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater won the Republican nomination when Rockefeller\u2019s womanizing spectacularly imploded his candidacy. Movement Conservatives used their hero\u2019s nomination to advance a new kind of politics.\n\nAmerica\u2019s moderate consensus was enormously popular, but Phyllis Schlafly, the president of the Illinois Federation of Republican Women, flat-out denied that reality. In her famous book \u201cA Choice Not an Echo,\u201d she insisted that studies showing that voters opposed Goldwater\u2019s extremism were part of a \u201cpropaganda machine\u201d that used fake polls, radio and newspapers to destroy anyone but the chosen candidates of an elite cabal. She explained that all government activism outside of military buildup was a conspiracy to bankrupt regular Americans. Financiers and banking interests fed off expensive policies pushed by an educated Eastern elite, and together these men were dragging America into the web of communism.\n\nThe world was really quite simple, Schlafly insisted, and it could be understood without any fancy education. It was divided in two, black and white, Communism and Freedom. Eggheads complained that Goldwater \u201chad one-sentence solutions\u201d for complicated problems, she wrote, but simple solutions were the answer. What should America do about communism? Stop it! The very fact that establishment Republicans opposed Goldwater\u2019s nomination proved that he was the right man for the job. He was the \u201cgrass roots\u201d candidate, the candidate for the little guy who voted his principles, not because he wanted a payoff.\n\nGoldwater\u2019s candidacy crashed and burned, leaving Republicans in trouble in 1968. To candidate Richard Nixon was left the task of pulling together mainstream Eisenhower Republicans and upstart Movement Conservatives. How could his team attract support for an unlikable candidate who needed to bridge a fundamental ideological gulf? Nixon\u2019s handlers used new media to play to Schlafly\u2019s script. They ignored people\u2019s brains and went for their guts.\n\n\u201cVoters are basically lazy,\u201d one Nixon media adviser wrote. \u201cReason requires a high degree of discipline, of concentration; impression is easier. Reason pushes the viewer back, it assaults him, it demands that he agree or disagree; impression can envelop him, invite him in, without making an intellectual demand\u2026. When we argue with him, we\u2026 seek to engage his intellect\u2026. The emotions are more easily roused, closer to the surface, more malleable\u2026.\u201d Nixon\u2019s people hired advertising executive Harry Treleaven, who believed the new medium of television had changed the nature of politics. For him, politicians were no longer policy wonks; they were actors with a narrative.\n\nUnder Treleaven, Nixon\u2019s people ignored policy positions and instead used television to create a candidate with a simple message: America was on the brink of disaster, and only Nixon could save it. They hired a brilliant young photographer to put together a series of television ads from stock photographs strung together to create a sense of doom; at the end a voice intoned \u201cNixon\u201d over an iconic image of the nation. At the end of every ad ran the words: \u201cVote like your whole world depended on it.\u201d\n\nThe campaign also hired a young television producer named Roger Ailes to stage \u201ctown hall\u201d events for the candidate. Ailes hand-picked \u201cregular\u201d people to question Nixon in carefully managed shows from which the press was excluded. Ailes arranged applause, the set, Nixon\u2019s answers, the camera angles, the crowd cheering the candidate, the careful shading of Nixon\u2019s makeup. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people think Nixon is dull. Think he\u2019s a bore, a pain in the ass.\u201d But carefully managed television could \u201cmake them forget all that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump did not happen overnight.
