Big shrug.\n\nThis is being seen as a weird little victory, but, like, over what? Over conservative pundits? That\u2019s a pretty low bar to set. Besides, it\u2019s not like the Pope being able to be in the presence of LGBTQ people without the world ending is an accomplishment for the Church, which is still sexist and homophobic as all get-out.\n\nFor example, just look at what\u2019s happened in San Francisco over the last few weeks \u2013 a priest in the Castro district, Rev. Jack McClure, has been disallowed to continue his duties because he dared to go to a convention about the ordination of women. The man doesn\u2019t even support the ordination of women, he just was present at a conference that discussed an idea that is not in line with the policies of the Catholic Church. I mean, here\u2019s his just incredibly progressive stance on the issue: \u201cI don\u2019t think they would probably do a very good job of it. But I would be willing to give them 2,000 years to try it, because we really haven\u2019t done all that well all the time either.\u201d That\u2019s what got him fired, basically.\n\nSo don\u2019t worry, everyone: The Catholic Church still opposes women and gays. The world is still turning.\n\n[The Advocate]\n\n[SF Gate]\n\nImage via Getty\n\nSend me a line at rebecca@thefrisky.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative pundits were concerned that a reception for Pope Francis was intended to \u201cembarrass\u201d him because \u2013\u00a0oh no \u2013\u00a0there were religious leaders who were", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Frisky", "description": "Conservative pundits were concerned that a reception for Pope Francis was intended to \u201cembarrass\u201d him because \u2013\u00a0oh no \u2013\u00a0there were religious leaders who were gay, transgender, and supportive of the Affordable Care Act despite its birth control mandate.
