They voted to authorize a strike after the company ended talks on February 7.\n\nThe biggest issue is health insurance. The company\u2019s previous plan it offered drivers was canceled because it didn\u2019t meet the minimal standards of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, it was the worst I have ever seen,\u201d Gonzales says.\n\nThe company has offered a new medical plan to the drivers. But the union says it is exorbitantly expensive, with the company offering to pay just 50 percent of the cost.\n\n\u201cJust for a single person, it would have been about 18 percent of their weekly take home,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cAnd then for a family plan it actually would have been 52 percent. So what they\u2019re trying to do is drive those members away from company health care and drive them to the ACA and take those costs off the company,\u201d Gonzales says.\n\nThe union also criticizes First Union for asking drivers to waive their rights under the city of Seattle\u2019s sick-leave ordinance.\n\n\u201cWe can obviously negotiate that but I don\u2019t know why we would do that. They are based in the city of Seattle. Every other company in the city of Seattle lives under that ordinance unless there\u2019s a collective bargained agreement. It\u2019s pretty much unacceptable,\u201d Gonzales says.\n\nThe median wage for drivers is approximately $17.45 an hour, and drivers average 30 hours per week, Gonzales says. And he says the company\u2019s final offer fails to provide wage increases or bonuses to any but the drivers at the top of a 10-step pay scale.\n\nUnion negotiators and the company have tentatively scheduled another bargaining session for February 27.\n\nWhile the drivers could strike at any time, the union is trying to give ample warning to families that would be affected by a walkout. Students are out of school this week for mid-winter break.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that before any action is taken that the families of the Seattle School District is aptly notified so they can start making other arrangements ,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s some question whether a strike would actually impact students. First Student\u2019s agreement with the district requires the company to provide replacement drivers in the event of a strike, according to a statement by the Seattle School District.\n\n\u201cSeattle Public Schools is in regular communication with First Student about the progress of the company\u2019s labor negotiations with school bus drivers. We have not been notified that the Teamsters National has invoked a cooling-off period, which is the next step prior to any strike being called,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cIn the event of a strike, our contract with First Student requires the company to provide replacement drivers to minimize the impact on the yellow bus transportation services that we provide to our nearly 28,000 students every day.\u201d\n\nFirst Student would not comment but did issue a brief statement Tuesday:\n\n\u201cFirst Student is continuing to negotiate in good faith with Teamsters Local #174. We are confident we will reach an agreement that is in the best interest of all parties. Our next negotiation meeting is set for February 27.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seattle school bus drivers say they are ready to strike after the company that contracts with the Seattle School District cut off contract talks with its \"Last, Best and Final\" contract offer.", "og": {"site_name": "MyNorthwest.com", "description": "Seattle school bus drivers say they are ready to strike after the company that contracts with the Seattle School District cut off contract talks with its \"Last, Best and Final\" contract offer.", "title": "Seattle School District bus drivers vote to authorize strike", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/11/1175/117578.jpg", "height": 380}, "updated_time": "2014-02-18T22:19:10-07:00", "url": "http://mynorthwest.com/23314/seattle-school-district-bus-drivers-vote-to-authorize-strike/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/11/1175/117578.jpg", "creator": "@joshkerns38", "description": "Seattle school bus drivers say they are ready to strike after the company that contracts with the Seattle School District cut off contract talks with its \"Last, Best and Final\" contract offer.", "card": "summary", "title": "Seattle School District bus drivers vote to authorize strike"}, "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "MyNorthwest.com - Seattle news, sports, weather, traffic, talk and community., Home,MyNorthwest.com", "article": {"section": "Local News", "published_time": "2014-02-18T13:18:42-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-18T22:19:10-07:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/#!/973kirofm"}, "verify-v1": "XrJiQDsWmPaoqGKN0EHKs7ult0rBB0W9zj4cWkAPRVI=", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc633\"", "article_summary": "Seattle school bus drivers say they are ready to strike after the company that contracts with the Seattle School District cut off contract talks with its \u201cLast, Best and Final\u201d contract offer.\n\u201cSeattle Public Schools is in regular communication with First Student about the progress of the company\u2019s labor negotiations with school bus drivers.\nThe drivers are employed by First Student, an Ohio-based company that contracts with the district to provide bus service.\nFirst Student\u2019s agreement with the district requires the company to provide replacement drivers in the event of a strike, according to a statement by the Seattle School District.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that before any action is taken that the families of the Seattle School District is aptly notified so they can start making other arrangements ,\u201d he says."}
