CNN Anchor Don Lemon shocked viewers on Thursday when he brazenly told Kathy Griffin she had a “nice rack” during a live New Year’s Eve broadcast.

Earlier in the broadcast, Ms. Griffin, who was co-hosting with Anderson Cooper from New York, took off her top and walked around Times Square in a purple bra.

Mr. Cooper awkwardly pleaded with Ms. Griffin, telling her “there are children here” and asking if she wanted to put her coat back on.

But Mr. Lemon felt differently.

“I have to say, Kathy … nice rack. I didn’t know you had all of that going on up there, I applaud you for that,” Mr. Lemon said, while holding a drink in his hand. He and Brooke Baldwin were hosting New Year’s Eve coverage from New Orleans.

Ms. Griffin laughed off the comment, but Ms. Baldwin, eyes bulging, immediately grabbed Mr. Lemon’s drink saying she was “cutting him off!”

“Wow, what is in that cup?” Mr. Cooper asked, Jezebel reported.

Mr. Lemon had reportedly been sipping from various glasses all night, according to the New York Daily News.

Later, Mr. Lemon was coaxed into a hot tub with a group of people.

Viewers took to Twitter to joke about Mr. Lemon’s antics on the live broadcast.

“Don Lemon is straight up hammered on CNN right now, and it’s my new favorite show,” one user tweeted.

“CNN should seriously think about letting Don Lemon be drunk on air all the time,” another said.

Mr. Lemon seemed to be laughing along with the jokes, retweeting many of them.

The jokes continued in the morning when viewers tweeted a slew of hangover jokes.

“How’re you feeling this morning, @donlemon? Need a Bloody Mary? or 5?” one user asked, the Daily News reported.

Mr. Lemon simply replied “ouch.”
