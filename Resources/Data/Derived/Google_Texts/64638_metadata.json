Grassley (R-Iowa) has a major say on whether President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court will get a hearing. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nWhen President Obama sought bipartisan cooperation on his first major legislative endeavor \u2014 passing his signature health-care law \u2014 he set his sights on one man: Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, then the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nDespite months of entreaties, Grassley never came around on the Affordable Care Act, which ended up passing in the Senate on a series of party-line votes. Now, six years later, Grassley again occupies a central role in what is possibly Obama\u2019s last big fight with Congress.\n\nAs chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley wields the power to hold hearings and advance Obama\u2019s promised Supreme Court nominee through the confirmation process. He is in lock step with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who declared in the hours after the Feb. 13 announcement of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death that the next president, not Obama, would name his successor.\n\n[Republicans vow no hearings and no votes for Obama\u2019s Supreme Court pick]\n\nBut key Democrats think Grassley can be persuaded \u2014 or, more precisely, shamed \u2014 to take up an Obama nomination in the coming months, thus breaking the Republican blockade and opening the door to an eventual confirmation vote.\n\nFour cases that could re-shape the country will be heard when the Supreme Court meets this term without Justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia consistently expressed conservative views when reviewing court cases. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) launched an opening salvo at Grassley last week, accusing him in a floor speech of having \u201csurrendered every pretense of independence\u201d and having allowed McConnell to \u201cannex the Judiciary Committee into a narrow, partisan mission of obstruction and gridlock.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this the legacy he wants?\u201d Reid said. \u201cIs this how he wants his committee work remembered \u2014 as a chairman who refused his duty and instead allowed the Republican leader to ride roughshod over the Judiciary Committee\u2019s storied history?\u201d\n\nGrassley responded tersely the following day in a floor speech of his own: \u201cWe all know that is how some people act when they don\u2019t get their own way, but childish tantrums are not appropriate for the Senate.\u201d\n\nObama personally made his case for action Tuesday morning, when McConnell and Grassley visited the White House to discuss the Supreme Court vacancy. Vice President Biden and Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the senior Judiciary Committee Democrat, also attended the closed-door meeting.\n\nGrassley said after that he remained opposed to taking up Obama\u2019s nominee: \u201cWhether everybody in the meeting today wanted to admit it, we all know that considering a nomination in the middle of a heated presidential campaign is bad for the nominee, bad for the court, bad for the process and, ultimately, bad for the nation.\u201d\n\nAlthough Obama did not confront Grassley as directly as Reid has \u2014 it was McConnell who did most of the talking Tuesday, a person familiar with the meeting said \u2014 Democratic lawmakers and aides said they think that the 82-year-old sixth-term senator will be forced to relent.\n\nDuring the health-care battle, Obama tried to cajole Grassley into supporting the bill by making a series of changes. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times last month, Obama described working with an unnamed Republican on the sprawling legislation, having \u201ctaken every idea that he had \u00adsuggested.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe just finally turned to me \u2014 I was sitting in the Oval Office \u2014 and he said, \u2018You know what, Mr. President, I got to admit there\u2019s no change that allows me to vote for this thing,\u2019 \u201d Obama said.\n\nAn individual familiar with the exchange who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations confirmed that Obama was speaking about \u00adGrassley.\n\nWhere the White House previously tried to win Grassley over with carrots, the Supreme Court fight has Democrats turning to sticks \u2014 arguing that the court blockade will undermine Grassley\u2019s legacy and his carefully tended just-folks image.\n\nReid again targeted Grassley in floor remarks Monday, saying that \u201chistory will not be kind to his tenure as chairman\u201d if the blockade continues.\n\n\u201cThe chairman has turned the impartial reputation of the Judiciary Committee into an extension of the Trump campaign,\u201d Reid said, before noting Grassley\u2019s attendance at a January rally for Donald Trump\u2019s presidential bid in Pella, Iowa.\n\n[Harry Reid ties Senate\u2019s Supreme Court battle to Donald Trump]\n\nHe also took aim at Grassley\u2019s record streak of consecutive Senate votes cast \u2014 more than 7,500 dating to July 1993 \u2014 saying the Supreme Court blockade \u201ctaints\u201d that distinction: \u201cWhat good are 7,500 consecutive votes if you simply sweep the votes you don\u2019t like to take under the rug?\u201d\n\nIn a brief interview Monday, Grassley brushed off Reid\u2019s remarks: \u201cI ain\u2019t going to hold it against him. It\u2019s one of these things where today we disagree on something and tomorrow we\u2019ll agree on it. That\u2019s just the collegiality of the Senate.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have gotten some support in their efforts to paint Grassley as an obstructionist \u2014 if not a hypocrite \u2014 from voices in the six-term senator\u2019s home state.\n\nAt least a half-dozen Iowa newspapers have called on the Senate to consider Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, including the state\u2019s largest, the Des Moines Register.\n\n\u201cThis was an opportunity for our senior senator to be less of a politician and more of a statesman,\u201d the paper wrote. \u201c[B]ut he chose instead to disregard his constitutional duty by rejecting a nominee who hasn\u2019t even been named.\u201d\n\nA particularly sharp editorial came from the Hawk Eye in Burlington, Iowa, a paper that heralded Grassley\u2019s record-breaking consecutive vote in January. Last week, citing Grassley\u2019s \u201csmug, partisan rhetoric,\u201d the paper declared, \u201cWe take it back.\u201d\n\nGrassley said he was not concerned about the editorials or other feedback he has gotten from Iowans on the high-court vacancy. \u201cYou can\u2019t worry about those things, so don\u2019t even ask me about whether or not I\u2019m worried about reelection,\u201d he said.\n\nShould the White House determine that Grassley is the most crucial figure in breaking the blockade, one particular nominee could bring special pressure to bear: Judge Jane L. Kelly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in 2013 after serving as a federal public defender in Iowa for the previous two decades.\n\nKelly \u2014 who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991, the same year as Obama \u2014 first applied for the 8th Circuit seat to then-Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), according to a questionnaire from her Senate confirmation hearing. But Grassley spoke highly of her at the hearing.\n\nGrassley read portions of a letter of support from former 8th Circuit judge David R. Hansen, for whom Kelly had clerked in the early 1990s.\n\n\u201cEvery sentence of it speaks highly of your work,\u2019\u2019 Grassley said.\n\nDemocrats said they are confident that McConnell and Grassley will hold hearings.\n\nBut several Republican senators said they expected Grassley would hold fast.\n\n\u201cDo you know Chuck Grassley?\u201d Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), a Judiciary Committee member, asked a reporter. \u201cWhen he gets on a principle, he\u2019s like a bulldog with a bone. He\u2019s going to stay on that principle.\u201d\n\nJuliet Eilperin and Jerry Markon contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "To secure a hearing for high-court nominee, Reid & Co. are playing the shame game.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "To secure a hearing for high-court nominee, Reid & Co. are playing the shame game.", "title": "Sen.
