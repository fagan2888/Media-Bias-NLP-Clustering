They are many, many times more dangerous than the terrorists groups out there.\n\n\u201cPeople will realize later that this is true,\u201d he added during comments at a Heritage event that also featured a keynote address by Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.\n\nChen is best known for exposing the horrific \u201cfamily planning\u201d practices of the Chinese Communist Party, which include forced abortions and sterilization under the so-called One Child Policy. He is a self-taught lawyer from rural China who became blind at childhood when a fever destroyed his optic nerves.\n\n>>> Watch: China\u2019s One Child Policy: A Discussion on Valuing Women and Girls in the 21st Century\n\nChen came to wide public attention in May 2012 when, after four years in prison and two years under house arrest in which he endured beatings for standing up for human rights, he and his wife and two children escaped to the United States. Relatives back home then faced arrest and beatings themselves.\n\nAs China continues to rise as one of the world\u2019s economic powerhouses, Chen\u2019s allies in spirit criticize the government for lagging in fundamental human rights, with the One Child Policy a prime example.\n\nSmith, co-chairman of the U.S. Commission on China, said the issue \u201ctoo often is neglected\u201d in Washington. He called abortion in China \u201ca weapon of mass destruction.\u201d\n\n>>> Read Rep. Chris Smith\u2019s Keynote Address\n\nOlivia Enos, a Heritage research assistant in Asian studies, said the Chinese Communist Party boasts that in 34 years it has \u201cprevented\u201d 400 million births by restricting couples to one child. Worse, a cultural preference for boys has spurred sex-selective abortions of tens of millions of unborn girls.\n\nToday, China counts 37 million more men than women, driving sex-trafficking, a black market for children and social unrest.\n\nSpeaking at Heritage through a translator, Chen \u2014 now distinguished senior fellow in human rights at Witherspoon Institute\u2019s Simon Center on Religion and the Constitution \u2014 recounted the story of one family\u2019s victimization:\n\nIn my neighboring village, one couple\u2014the wife was pregnant without obtaining permission\u2014was requested by the local government to get an abortion. But she refused \u2026 and they were taken by thugs and the local authority on a truck. Before they arrived at the clinic, the husband was taken off the truck and beaten on the ground. After the beating, the husband was put back on the truck and the couple was brought to the clinic for a forced abortion. They then brought them back home and they were left hopeless, without anyone to take care of them after a beating and forced abortions.\n\n>>> Jennifer Marshall: The Horror Behind Chen\u2019s Great Escape\n\nThe couple\u2019s experience, Chen said, is nothing out of the ordinary. His own investigation in 2005 found \u201cover 100,000 women who had abortions and none of them said they were willing to do so,\u201d he said.\n\nSome activists striving to draw attention to forced abortion and sterilization call the situation in China \u201cthe real war against women.\u201d\n\n\u201cForced abortions is not a pro-choice or pro-life issue, it\u2019s a human rights issue,\u201d Reggie Littlejohn, founder and president of Women\u2019s Rights Without Frontiers, said at the Heritage event.\n\n>>> \u2018I Cannot Be Silent\u2019: Chen Speaks on Abuse, Forced Abortion\n\nGovernment policies and propaganda have so demoralized society that the Chinese people discount the value of human life, Chen said.\n\n\u201cThe Communist Party does not represent the Chinese people\u2014they\u2019re becoming a public enemy of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nTo mark the United Nations\u2019 International Day of the Girl on Oct. 11, created to raise awareness of gender inequality around the world, Chen called on the international community\u2014and specifically the United States\u2014to speak out against such inhumane policies.\n\n\u201cPeople of conscience must stand up to the Communist Party in China,\u201d he said.\n\n>>> Commentary: How China\u2019s One Child Policy Is Setting Up China for Economic Crisis", "article_metadata": {"description": "In forcing abortions and sterilization, communists who control China are \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than the terrorist group ISIS, activist Chen Guangcheng says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In forcing abortions and sterilization, communists who control China are \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than the terrorist group ISIS, activist Chen Guangcheng says.", "title": "Rights Activist: China\u2019s Regime \u2018More Dangerous\u2019 Than ISIS", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/abausaphotostwo076439.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-10T10:28:33+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1vV38xt"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In forcing abortions and sterilization, communists who control China are \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than the terrorist group ISIS, activist Chen Guangcheng says.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/abausaphotostwo076439.jpg"}, "title": "Rights Activist: China\u2019s Regime \u2018More Dangerous\u2019 Than ISIS", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Asia,Protecting Life", "published_time": "2014-10-09T20:03:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-10T10:28:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "One Child Policy, china, isis, terrorism, Chen Guangcheng, women's rights without frontiers, international day of the girl"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde2b9\"", "article_summary": ">>> Commentary: How China\u2019s One Child Policy Is Setting Up China for Economic Crisis\nThe Communists who control China are \u201cmany times more dangerous\u201d than the brutal terrorist group ISIS, human rights activist Chen Guangcheng said today in remarks in Washington at The Heritage Foundation.\nThey then brought them back home and they were left hopeless, without anyone to take care of them after a beating and forced abortions.\nChen said:I believe that we have underestimated the threat from the Communist regime in China.\nHe is a self-taught lawyer from rural China who became blind at childhood when a fever destroyed his optic nerves."}
