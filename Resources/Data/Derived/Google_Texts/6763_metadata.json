Legal experts have offered mixed views on the viability of any court challenge.\n\nThe new rules, intended to discourage tax \"inversions,\" led to the collapse of U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc's $160 billion acquisition of Ireland's Allergan Plc.\n\n\"We recognize there is broad discretion in some areas of that tax code,\" Brady, a Texas Republican and chairman of the tax-writing House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, said in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"But it certainly appears that Treasury overstepped its authority, especially in effect, taking legislative proposals that haven\u2019t passed this Congress or any other Congress and essentially making it law through regulation.\"\n\nBrady gave no indication of what his committee might do. It was unclear what action, if any, the Republican-controlled Congress would take against the inversion rules in an election year marked by voter anger over taxes and international trade.\n\n\"I share the concern about inversions. Everyone does. But there\u2019s a right way and a wrong way to tackle them,\" Brady said.\n\nAn inversion is a tax-driven deal in which a U.S. company acquires a smaller, foreign business and adopts its tax domicile to reduce the combined company's overall tax burden. The deals most often involve reincorporating in Ireland or Britain.\n\nThough inversions have been going since the 1980s, a new wave has been under way for about five years. The Pfizer-Allergan deal would have been the biggest inversion of all time.\n\nThere is bipartisan agreement on the need for comprehensive tax reform to address inversions, but the deeply divided Congress is unlikely to tackle this until 2017, especially with elections coming in November, analysts said.\n\nIn the interim, the Obama administration has tightened inversion rules in limited areas, drawing Republican criticism.\n\n\"The administration\u2019s strategy won\u2019t solve the fundamental problem and likely will make it worse,\" Brady said.\n\n(Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Andrew Hay)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's proposed rules to stop U.S.", "title": "Obama tax inversion rules may overstep authority: U.S. lawmaker", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/15/Obama-tax-inversion-rules-may-overstep-authority-US-lawmaker", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-tax-inversions-obama_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/15/Obama-tax-inversion-rules-may-overstep-authority-US-lawmaker", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-tax-inversions-obama_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's proposed rules to stop U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In the interim, the Obama administration has tightened inversion rules in limited areas, drawing Republican criticism.\nThe new rules, intended to discourage tax \"inversions,\" led to the collapse of U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc's $160 billion acquisition of Ireland's Allergan Plc.\nRepresentative Kevin Brady said his staff is scrutinizing the rules, which were unveiled last week by the U.S. Treasury Department.\nIt was unclear what action, if any, the Republican-controlled Congress would take against the inversion rules in an election year marked by voter anger over taxes and international trade.\nAn inversion is a tax-driven deal in which a U.S. company acquires a smaller, foreign business and adopts its tax domicile to reduce the combined company's overall tax burden."}
