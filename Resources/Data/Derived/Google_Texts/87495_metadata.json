Iran has given its interpretation, which is another reason why we need to scrub this whole idea,\u201d Webb said.\n\nWebb called for the full consent of Congress to any deal reached with Iran.\n\nAs senator he made similar statements with both Presidents Bush and Obama.\n\nWebb\u2019s support of congressional oversight was not his only point. He followed up by rebuking the details of the framework, saying he believed it could embolden Iran\u2019s standing in the region.\n\n\u201cThe end result of this could well be our acquiescence in allowing Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. We don\u2019t want that,\u201d Webb said.\n\nWebb said he shared concerns with the negotiations, especially the verification process brought up by former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. The op-ed criticized the deal, and called for the United States to step back from the table. The Obama administration dismissed the advice.\n\nWebb\u2019s potential primary rival, Hillary Clinton, has yet to speak out on the deal besides an initial, vague statement. While the statement was mostly positive and seemingly supported the outline, one rich friend of Clinton\u2019s hinted that she does not like what Secretary of State John Kerry brought back from the negotiating table in Switzerland.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former senator and likely Democratic potential presidential candidate Jim Webb said he was concerned that President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran will acquiesce to the country, making it an even larger player in the Middle East.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Former senator and potential\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate Jim Webb said he is concerned that President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran will will allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and enhan", "title": "Jim Webb Pans Iran Deal: Congress \u2018Needs to Scrub This Whole Idea\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/jim-webb-pans-iran-deal-congress-needs-to-scrub-this-whole-idea/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former senator and potential\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate Jim Webb said he is concerned that P", "creator": "@bassalid", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "title": "Jim Webb Pans Iran Deal: Congress \u2018Needs to Scrub This Whole Idea\u2019", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Iran has given its interpretation, which is another reason why we need to scrub this whole idea,\u201d Webb said.\n\u201cThe end result of this could well be our acquiescence in allowing Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.\nWebb called for the full consent of Congress to any deal reached with Iran.\nWebb\u2019s potential primary rival, Hillary Clinton, has yet to speak out on the deal besides an initial, vague statement.\nThe op-ed criticized the deal, and called for the United States to step back from the table."}
