Washington D.C. is an exciting city in many ways. It experiences a steady flow of high-stake dramas — the 2013 government shutdown, the bumpy roll-out of the Affordable Care Act; the world’s first exhibition of yogic art, the naming of baby panda Bao Bao; fierce lunchtime food trucks, local hip-hop music known as go-go, and of course, the hapless Washington Redskins.

But my favorite aspect of the city’s offerings is its robust roster of African artists that roll through the town on international tours. And with less fanfare but equal appeal, the abundance of local African talent.

Tosin Aribisala is a Nigerian drummer, singer/songwriter who lives in the area. He is versatile, focused, and innovative. I invited Tosin into our studios on the occasion of his just released CD — Life Begins.
