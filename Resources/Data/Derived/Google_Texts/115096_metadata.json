Credit: Pat A. Robinson\n\nBy of the\n\nA white square the size of a large area rug is set into the center of a ballroom, chandeliers hanging overhead. We see someone in strappy platforms, from the ankles down, walk out onto the space.\n\nThe heels are carefully removed and replaced with\u2014 sparkly ice skates!\n\nThe camera pulls back. A man puts on what look like painters' pants and a white hooded coat with tails. Cue violins, and then \u2014 ta da! \u2014 the man spins and jumps as if he were on ice.\n\nThis is the scene in a trailer video prepared for \"Legacy,\" an event organized by former \"Project Runway\" contestant and local fiber artist and fashion designer Timothy Westbrook (above). Leave it to Westbrook to embrace a winter pastime while finding a way to reject the actual ice.\n\nThe event, which Westbrook calls an \"abstract fashion experience,\" will explore themes of angst related to finding one's path in life, particularly Westbrook's decision to call himself an artist.\n\nIt will include fashions, indoor figure skating (on some mysterious, hard material that makes this possible) and Westbrook's signature obsession: unicorns.\n\nEverything in the show will be made from \"art waste.\" Attendees are encouraged to \"dress to express\" with attire inspired by origami, surrealism and abstract painting.\n\nThe show is Wednesday in the Imperial Ballroom at the Pfister Hotel, 424 E. Wisconsin Ave., where Westbrook was an artist in residence.\n\nDoors open at 7:30 p.m.; the performance starts at 8:30 p.m. Reception and other performances will follow. Tickets are $15.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Former 'Project Runway' contestant stages 'Legacy'", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/arts/former-project-runway-contestant-stages-legacy-b99225263z1-250474901.html", "image": {"width": 1799, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99225263z.1_20140315162708_000_g1a59jo4.1-0.jpg", "height": 1468}, "type": "article", "description": "An \u201cabstract fashion experience\u201d by Timothy Westbrook features video and indoor ice skating.", "title": "Former \u2018Project Runway\u2019 contestant stages \u2018Legacy\u2019"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tapmilwaukee", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99225263z.1_20140315162708_000_g1a59jo4.1-0.jpg", "description": "An \u201cabstract fashion experience\u201d by Timothy Westbrook features video and indoor ice skating.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Former 'Project Runway' contestant stages 'Legacy'"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3125\"", "article_summary": "This is the scene in a trailer video prepared for \"Legacy,\" an event organized by former \"Project Runway\" contestant and local fiber artist and fashion designer Timothy Westbrook (above).\nTimothy Westbrook is a former artist-in-residence at the Pfister.\nThe show is Wednesday in the Imperial Ballroom at the Pfister Hotel, 424 E.
