It was the 12th straight month the private sector added more than 200,000 jobs, the longest such streak since 1977. The robust job growth coincided almost exactly with the official start of health coverage through the Obamacare exchanges, which began in January 2014. Over that time, the economy has added 3.2 million jobs.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way.\n\nPrior to the law\u2019s implementation, numerous politicians and pundits predicted an economic apocalypse once Obamacare took effect. Here are a few of the worst predictions:\n\n1. Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA): \u2018It\u2019s going to destroy our economy\u2026It\u2019s going to push us into a total economic collapse\u2019 (October 8, 2013)\n\nThis was actually Broun\u2019s attempt to moderate his claims about Obamacare. He previously said that Obamacare would \u201cdestroy America.\u201d He later told CNN that he meant it would destroy the American economy.\n\n2. Speaker John Boehner (R-OH): Obamacare \u2018will bankrupt our nation, and it will ruin our economy.\u2019 (January 6, 2011)\n\nCREDIT: AP\n\nDuring his press conference, which lasted 14 minutes, Boehner used the phrase \u201cjob-killing\u201d once every 2 minutes. He called the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare \u201cRepealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act.\u201d\n\nIn addition to robust job growth, the deficit in 2014 plunged to its lowest level in 6 years. Deficit as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product was 2.8 percent, which is below the 40-year average.\n\n3. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK): \u2018There will be no insurance industry left in three years.\u2019 (October 12, 2010)\n\nCREDIT: AP\n\nAccording to Coburn, the destruction of the insurance industry was part of a larger plot. Tulsa World reported his remarks to the Republican Women\u2019s Club of Tulsa County:\n\nThat is by design. You\u2019re going to make insurance unaffordable for everyone \u2014 which is what they want. Because if there\u2019s no private insurance left, what\u2019s left? Government-centered, government-run, single-payer health care.\n\nFive years later, there is still an insurance industry. Large insurance companies have embraced Obamacare and continue to increase their participation in the law\u2019s state-level marketplaces.\n\n4. Rush Limbaugh said Obamacare would cost the economy \u20182.5 million jobs minimum\u2019 and would be a \u2018literal tragedy\u2019 (February 6, 2014)\n\nLimbaugh\u2019s comments were based, in part, by a Congressional Budget Office report which he misinterpreted. In fact, the health law has had little effect on unemployment and underemployment. Since Rush Limbaugh made this statement, the U.S. economy has added 3.2 million jobs.\n\n5. Glenn Beck: \u2018This is the end of prosperity in America forever, if this passes. This is the end of America as you know it.\u2019 (November 19, 2009)\n\nCREDIT: AP\n\nAlong with historically strong job growth, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stands at 17,856, which is up over 72 percent since Beck\u2019s remarks. At the time Beck made his prediction, the unemployment rate was at 10 percent. Today, the unemployment rate is 5.5 percent.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "It wasn't supposed to be this way.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "It wasn't supposed to be this way.", "title": "5 Embarrassing Predictions About What Obamacare Would Do To The Economy", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/03/09/3631281/obamacare-economy-predictions/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_218068753.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It wasn't supposed to be this way.", "title": "5 Embarrassing Predictions About What Obamacare Would Do To The Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_218068753-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@JuddLegum", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_218068753.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_218068753.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-09T08:03:47+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/juddcooperlegum"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde661\"", "article_summary": "Health 5 Embarrassing Predictions About What Obamacare Would Do To The Economy CREDIT: ShutterstockIn February, the economy added 295,000 jobs.\nOver that time, the economy has added 3.2 million jobs.\nBecause if there\u2019s no private insurance left, what\u2019s left?\nSince Rush Limbaugh made this statement, the U.S. economy has added 3.2 million jobs.\nHe previously said that Obamacare would \u201cdestroy America.\u201d He later told CNN that he meant it would destroy the American economy."}
