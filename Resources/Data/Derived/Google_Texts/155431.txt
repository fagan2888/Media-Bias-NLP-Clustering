Penn State Fayette marks 50th anniversary of founding

The 50th anniversary of the founding of Penn State Fayette, The Eberly Campus was celebrated with the dedication of a new clock at the new Founders Plaza.

“Welcome to Founder's Day,” said Dr. Charles Patrick, chancellor of Penn State Fayette, The Eberly Campus, on the anniversary of Penn State University opening its doors and bringing university education locally to the public.

Penn State was in the area before the founding of the campus as a cooperative extension service in 1907, then established an undergraduate center in Uniontown from 1934 to 1940. It closed because of the approaching war.

The campus was opened with an undergraduate program in 1965 in downtown Uniontown followed by the first building at the location of the current campus in 1968.

“Local business leaders raised $1.2 million for this land,” said Bill Blaney, advisory board chairman.

Blaney said the campus location was chosen because it's centrally located in Fayette County between Connellsville and Uniontown and has access to a major highway.

“This is a hub for education and culture and enjoys a great partnership with the community,” Patrick said.

The anniversary ceremony concluded with the unveiling of a new clock on the plaza.

Student activity fees paid for the project.

“No student tuition money was used to purchase the plaza,” said Angela Simmons, the outgoing president of the campus student government association.

Patrick said the clock is one of several legacy projects for the plaza, which is right outside the community center.

Organizers said the clock has 250 bricks around its base that are for sale for memorials or dedications with the proceeds going toward student scholarships.
