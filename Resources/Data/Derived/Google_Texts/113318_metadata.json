On the Republican side, the quality of the discussion surrounding this topic has been pretty poor. Facts have been thrown out of the window, replaced with racist stereotypes. Those GOP candidates with softer stances towards immigrants have either dropped out of the race or hardened their position.\n\nThe Democratic candidates, meanwhile, are trying to woo the country\u2019s growing Latino and Asian populations that will most likely be voting for one of them. To this end, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have unveiled immigrant-friendly policy agendas. While they\u2019re similar in some senses, they also differ in ways that haven\u2019t really been fleshed out in the Democratic presidential debates so far.\n\nSo with 11 states and the American Samoa heading to the polls on Super Tuesday, here are some key takeaways from each candidate\u2019s immigration agenda, based on their campaign websites, remarks made in recent debates, their voting records while in Congress, and information gathered from with both staffs.\n\nWhere they\u2019re similar\n\nAt their core, Sanders and Clinton are promising many of the same things. They\u2019ve both pledged to make immigration reform a priority, vowing to act on it within their first 100 days in office. They support a path to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. And to achieve the latter, they intend to defend and expand President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, currently on hold pending a review by the Supreme Court, which if implemented would shield 5 million undocumented people from being deported.\n\nBoth Sanders and Clinton recently spoke out against the Obama administration\u2019s problematic raids of Central American mothers and unaccompanied minors, and laid out their respective plans to deal with the surge in migration from that region. They\u2019ve also offered to close down family detention centers (activists and courts have deemed the detention of children in these prison-like centers inhumane) as well as for-profit detention centers (where instances of abuse have been reported).\n\nIn addition, they both want to make Obamacare benefits accessible to the undocumented. And for those already on the path to citizenship, both candidates aim to make what\u2019s now a pretty expensive naturalization process a little bit cheaper.\n\nWhere they differ\n\nOn deferred action of undocumented folks. According to his campaign website, Sanders wants to extend administrative relief from deportation to groups that include parents of DREAMers and legal permanent residents, and undocumented workers who have reported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement after labor disputes. He would also lower the bar of eligibility for deferred action, allowing immigrants charged with \u201csignificant misdemeanor\u201d offenses\u2014crimes which include driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, sexual assault, and burglary, among others\u2014to apply for relief, Erika Andiola, a press secretary for Senator Sanders, tells CityLab via email.\n\nClinton\u2019s plan extends deferred action to parents of DREAMers and \u201cothers with a history of service and contribution to their communities,\u201d her website says. How many undocumented people that ultimately adds up to is unclear, but it seems to be fewer than the number eligible for relief under Sanders\u2019s policies.\n\nOn unaccompanied minors and refugees from Central America. In a recent letter asking President Obama to halt the raids on Central American families, Sanders asked for Temporary Protected Status for the refugees from that region. In other words, he wants the government to let individuals who\u2019ve fled violent countries in Central America to stay in the U.S. and work on humanitarian grounds. (Organizations like the American Immigration Lawyers Association have asked for the same.) Sanders also highlighted in this letter, as well as on his website, the importance of providing legal counsel for detained immigrants and child refugees, and of funding immigration courts to fairly adjudicate asylum cases.\n\nClinton caught some flak recently for expressing her support for deportation for these children last year, and for saying that she wouldn\u2019t employ a \u201cblanket rule\u201d that lets all children coming from Central America automatically stay in the country. She did, however, walk back her position in the Democratic presidential debate held in Milwaukee, via The Washington Post:\n\n\u201cWith respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.\u201d\n\nHer plan, according to her campaign, pushes for government-funded access to legal counsel for unaccompanied minors, as well as more resources for the part of the judicial system that processes their applications\u2014similar to Sanders\u2019s plan. Where it goes a step further is that it asks Congress to fund a White House effort to help mitigate the economic and violent conditions in Central America that lead to the exodus. She advocates working with regional partners to \u201csupport entrepreneurship, infrastructure, and workforce training in the region; help strengthen judicial systems and rule of law; and expand education, especially for girls,\u201d according to a press release her campaign sent to reporters.\n\nOn the role of police in immigration enforcement. Currently, many police departments in the country work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as per the federal agency\u2019s Priority Enforcement Program. Clinton\u2019s 2016 agenda doesn\u2019t explicitly mention a stand on the issue. But in 2008 she said that she wasn\u2019t in favor of police enforcement of immigration law, via Politico:\n\n\u201cIt should not be the responsibility of a municipality or county. This has to be fixed at the federal level. There are lots of strong arguments against turning local police officers into immigration enforcement officials. It has to do with making sure people will report crimes, making sure people will go to the police when there\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s a matter of public safety. It doesn\u2019t always only affect the immigrant community, it affects all of us.\u201d\n\nSanders, meanwhile, wants to \u201cdecouple\u201d the ICE from local law enforcement, in keeping with the recommendations made by a policing task force set up by the President Obama.\n\nOn some other key points. Apart from the all of the above, Sanders goes further for undocumented immigrants in other ways. He wants to offer in-state tuition for DREAMers nationwide, for example, whereas Clinton would \u201csupport any state that takes that position, and would work with those states and encourage more states to do the same thing,\u201d she said in a recent debate.\n\nOn his website, Sanders includes a section on how he intends to make ICE and Customs and Border Patrol more accountable and transparent; for one thing, he wants their officials to wear body cameras. And instead of scaling up border security to keep out Mexicans crossing into the U.S. illegally, he wants to review the effect of trade agreements that were meant in part to decrease the flow of migrants but have failed to do so. (For context, net migration from Mexico has fallen to zero, according to the Pew Research Center.)\n\nSanders does support electronic status verification systems, like E-Verify, which would enable employers to check the immigration status of job applicants. E-Verify has been criticized on a number of fronts, including accuracy and potential for discrimination.\n\nOverall, Clinton has yet to go into as much detail about what she envisions for America\u2019s undocumented immigrants, and what she has made clear doesn\u2019t go as far in protecting them as what Sanders has proposed.\n\nWhat about the legal immigration pipeline?\n\nBoth candidates have been relatively mum on how they intend to remake the broken skilled immigration pipeline, a part of the immigration puzzle that\u2019s important but doesn\u2019t typically get much airtime in presidential debates.\n\nGuest worker programs are one issue in this domain that Sanders, at least, has been pretty vocal about. He believes strongly in the need to overhaul guest worker visa programs\u2014specifically H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, and J-1\u2014because employers often used these programs to exploit guest workers and displace American workers. That there aren\u2019t enough protections for U.S. and foreign workers built into these programs is the reason Sanders says he didn\u2019t vote for Ted Kennedy\u2019s 2007 immigration reform bill and the reason he considered the 2013 \u201cGang of Eight\u201d immigration bill, which he did vote for, flawed.\n\nHe\u2019s faced some criticism for taking this restrictionist position, especially with respect to his 2007 vote, given that some of these programs are the only stepping stones to citizenship for people hoping to immigrate legally to the U.S. The reforms he\u2019s suggested in his current agenda, however, don\u2019t seem unreasonable. Sanders wants guest workers not to be bound to one employer, and advocates for higher wages of workers \u201cif there is a true labor shortage,\u201d his website says.\n\nWhether he intends to raise or lower the number of visas given out through these programs accordingly is unclear (although a flexible cap on H-1B visas was a part of the 2013 reform he voted for). Andiola, the press secretary, clarifies that he supports making advanced STEM graduates eligible for green cards upon graduation\u2014a provision included in both the 2013 legislation and the Obama administration\u2019s executive action on immigration.\n\nClinton, too, believes guest worker programs need to be reformed, as she mentioned in her previous presidential campaign. But she\u2019s supported immigration legislation proposed in 2006 and 2007 that\u2019s sought to expand some guest worker programs as well as put in more worker protection. And of course, she has come out in support of President Obama\u2019s executive actions (which address skilled immigration). But a detailed plan of skilled immigration reform from her end is not yet available.\n\nFrom the above differences, it\u2019s fair to say that, overall, Sanders gets immigration right\u2014certainly more so than Clinton. That matters for the primary. But the question that will remain afterward is this: In a divisive Congressional climate, where agreement on immigrant-friendly legislations have failed time and again, can either of them get their reforms passed if they\u2019re elected?", "article_metadata": {"description": "In many ways, Clinton and Sanders have similar views.
