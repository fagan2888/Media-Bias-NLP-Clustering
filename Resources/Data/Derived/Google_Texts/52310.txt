Sen. Marco Rubio Marco RubioTrump encourages Rubio to reclaim Senate seat The Trail 2016: Interleague play Rubio: I'd speak on Trump's behalf at convention MORE (R-Fla.) said late Tuesday that militants with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS or ISIL) could be crossing the Mexican border into the United States.

Asked by Fox News host Sean Hannity if ISIS "would use the southern border to cross," Rubio said "Sure, potentially."

"But it's not just ISIS," Rubio added. "I mean, there are multiple groups around the world that want to strike us. I mean, we forget, with all this focus on ISIL, and rightfully so, that there are multiple other groups that are plotting the exact same things. There's a new al Qaeda affiliate in the Indian peninsula. ... There's al Nusra. There's all sorts of elements in Pakistan that are extremely dangerous, as well."

Rubio also emphasized the threat from ISIS members holding Western passports entering through airports. "So the border is certainly a concern, but so are our airports because many come of them from visa waiver countries that allow them immediate access to our nation."

Rubio joins Republicans, such as Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a potential presidential primary rival, in warning of ISIS crossing the southern border.

There has so far been no evidence of ISIS crossing the southern border into the United States, the administration has said.

“There is no credible intelligence to suggest that there is an active plot by ISIL to attempt to cross the southern border,” Homeland Security Department officials said in a statement this week.
