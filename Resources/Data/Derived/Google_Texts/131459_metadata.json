Both houses passed their respective budget proposals Thursday, so the measure \u2014 and all other budget differences between the two chambers \u2014 will be taken up in negotiations next week.\n\nSupporters and opponents of Medicaid expansion, which would tap billions in federal dollars to expand insurance for the poor, began casting blame for a showdown that could push the General Assembly past its March 8 adjournment deadline and perhaps even cause a state government shutdown.\n\nIn a sign of the high stakes \u2014 and raw nerves \u2014 over the issue, a Republican delegate accused Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) of threatening an economic development project in his district if he didn\u2019t support expansion. A McAuliffe spokesman denied the account.\n\nMcAuliffe has put enormous political capital into the effort, hoping both for a budget windfall and to help validate a Democratic president\u2019s key achievement. But for Republicans, the stakes are equally high. GOP leaders must heed the will of their small-government base, but they are also deeply sensitive to the national view that they are the party of \u201cno.\u201d\n\nAt its core, the debate is less a partisan brawl than a fight within the Republican Party. On one side is a conservative House caucus sticking to long-held principles of limited government and lower spending; on the other is a moderate group of GOP senators mindful of the changing political landscape of Virginia and motivated more by pragmatism than ideology to take advantage of federal largess.\n\nThe chief architect of the plan House Republicans rejected is Sen. John C. Watkins (R-Powhatan). Watkins folded a host of Republican-friendly components into his proposal, which is called Marketplace Virginia.\n\nThe plan would seek federal permission to impose a requirement that unemployed recipients of coverage try to find work. It would push recipients to pay up to 5 percent of their wages for their insurance and add other market-based incentives to reduce spending. And it would allow Virginia to back out of the program if the federal government shorts the state in future years.\n\nThe proposal would cover an estimated 255,000 people in households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $23,850 for a family of four. It would use $1.7 billion of the taxes collected in Virginia under Obamacare to buy commercial insurance plans for the uninsured in the state.\n\nOne thing the proposal does not do, however, is seek to dismantle Obamacare. And Watkins believes that\u2019s the ultimate sticking point for his colleagues down the hall.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to exhibit their disdain for the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel if enough people refuse to use it, somehow it\u2019s going to go away, that it will fail.\u201d\n\nWatkins said that tens of thousands of Virginians have already signed up for insurance on the federal exchange. If Obamacare went away, those individuals \u201cwouldn\u2019t have insurance. You kind of go, \u2018Whoa. Come on, guys, \u201d Watkins said.\n\nLast week, House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) said that \u201cwe don\u2019t all walk in lock step. There are 67 of us [Republicans in the House], and I think the vast majority of those 67 agree. Not everybody in our caucus agrees with this position.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, 66 Republicans, including the speaker, agreed.\n\n\u201cWe wanted them to have a clean vote because we wanted to be able to say, \u2018This is where our caucus stands,\u2019 \u201d said House Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights). \u201cAnd that 67 vote, I\u2019m very confident.\u201d\n\nThe vote was not purely along partisan lines: Johnny S. Joannou (D-Portsmouth) voted against expansion, and Thomas Davis Rust (R-Fairfax) voted for it.\n\nStill, Thursday\u2019s vote did nothing to change the basic political dynamics that will shape the hardest-fought debate in Richmond this session. The insurance plan remains a centerpiece of the Senate\u2019s budget and is still headed for a conference committee, where a handful of legislators from the House and Senate will try to hash out a compromise before March 8.\n\nAfter more than hour of debate, three Senate Republicans \u2014 Watkins, Emmett W. Hanger Jr. (Augusta) and Walter A. Stosch (Henrico) \u2014 voted with Democrats to endorse the plan despite the concerns of more conservative members of the GOP caucus. The plan is \u201cour attempt to glean the best of what we\u2019ve seen in other states developing around the nation,\u201d Hanger said.\n\nSenate conservatives joined their House colleagues in denouncing the effort. \u201cThe federal government has an uncanny ability to screw up an otherwise good idea,\u201d said Sen. Mark D. Obenshain (R-Harrisonburg).\n\nDemocrats countered that it made no sense to reject the federal funds. Majority leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) said, \u201cFor us to turn this money down would be an absolute act of lunacy.\u201d\n\nDel. Riley E. Ingram (R-Hopewell) said McAuliffe called him to his office before the vote and threatened a biofuels project in his economically distressed district if he did not support Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThe only thing the governor said was if I did not support Medi\u00adcaid, that the Senate was going to kill my bill,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been in politics a long time, 20-something years. And I know what hardball is, and I understand.\u201d\n\nHe said he told the governor he\u2019d think about it but decided, \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy disputed Ingram\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unequivocally false,\u201d Coy said in an e-mail. McAuliffe and Ingram \u201chad a cordial meeting this morning about several issues, including closing the coverage gap and their mutual support for the Hopewell project. He will continue to encourage House Republicans to put Virginia families and our economy ahead of partisan ideology and join the bipartisan coalition that supports Marketplace Virginia.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who oppose expansion have repeatedly warned that the federal government is an unreliable long-term partner, particularly given its own severe budget woes, and that Washington can\u2019t be trusted to keep sending Virginia all the funds it is promising today. Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government would initially pay 100 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid and would later cover 90 percent.\n\nHouse Republicans say Medi\u00adcaid spending is already rising at an unsustainable clip and is on track to devour other crucial areas of the budget, including education.\n\nExpansion opponents also have warned that Washington would not agree to many of the strings backers of the Senate plan are promising will be included.\n\nBut it has already done so in some cases. For instance, Arkansas, which has been offering a \u201cprivate option\u201d akin to the Virginia proposal, can pull out if the promised federal funds fall short. And Medicaid rules already allow states to require beneficiaries to spend a percentage of their own money on their insurance.\n\nA requirement that the newly insured seek work has not been endorsed by federal officials. In the House debate Thursday, Appropriations Committee Chairman S. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk) said that part of Watkins\u2019s plan was \u201caspirational\u201d but not guaranteed to come to fruition.\n\nJones said ongoing Medicaid reforms must have a chance to show results before any expansion.\n\nHe also predicted that Democrats will force a shutdown over the issue. \u201cOur teachers would not get paid . . . law enforcement wouldn\u2019t get paid. VDOT would probably have to shut down, and we\u2019d have to lay state employees off,\u201d Jones said.\n\nWatkins and other Senate colleagues agree that a deadlock is possible, but they offered a different point of view on who would take the blame if legislators leave town without a budget.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to turn out unless they\u2019re willing to make some concession and adopt most of our bill,\u201d said Sen. Charles J. Colgan Sr. (D-Prince William), co-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nLegislators might recess for a couple weeks or a month, or they could be called back by the governor, Colgan said. In any of those cases, time at home listening \u201cto what their constituents are saying is going to help them make up their mind,\u201d Colgan said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conflicting budgets could mean extended legislative session or even a shutdown of state government.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Conflicting budgets could mean extended legislative session or even a shutdown of state government.", "title": "House and Senate in Virginia at loggerheads over Medicaid expansion", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/2014/02/20/7bdf47f0-9a3d-11e3-b931-0204122c514b_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "virginiapolitics, medicaid virginia, vapolitics,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "7bdf47f0-9a3d-11e3-b931-0204122c514b", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "virginiapolitics, medicaid virginia, vapolitics,"}, "article_summary": "The chief architect of the plan House Republicans rejected is Sen.
