Bush thinks that the Obama ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion could do a lot uni\u00adlat\u00ader\u00adally to clean up the Obama\u00adcare mess that would come if the Su\u00adpreme Court rules against the gov\u00adern\u00adment this month.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been the po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtion of the White House or some leg\u00adal ex\u00adperts sym\u00adpath\u00adet\u00adic to\u00adward the law. But Thomas Scully, who was Bush\u2019s Cen\u00adters for Medi\u00adcare and Medi\u00adcaid Ser\u00advices ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtrat\u00ador from 2001 to 2004, said Thursday that he thought the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion could largely mit\u00adig\u00adate the fal\u00adlout of King v. Bur\u00adwell if the Court de\u00adcides to in\u00adval\u00adid\u00adate the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act\u2019s tax sub\u00adsidies for more than 6 mil\u00adlion people in the 30-plus states that use the fed\u00ader\u00adal Health\u00adCare.gov.\n\n\u201cThe ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion is go\u00ading to have the flex\u00adib\u00adil\u00adity and take the flex\u00adib\u00adil\u00adity to ba\u00adsic\u00adally do state-based ex\u00adchanges in prob\u00adably 40 states out\u00adside the Deep South,\u201d Scully said at a pan\u00adel hos\u00adted by The Wall Street Journ\u00adal. \u201cSo if you\u2019re in Pennsylvania or Illinois or Ohio, the gov\u00adernor is go\u00ading to come in and say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to blow my\u00adself up. I want to turn my\u00adself in\u00adto a state ex\u00adchange,\u2019 and the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion is go\u00ading to do everything in their power pos\u00adsible to let that hap\u00adpen.\u201d\n\nThe im\u00adplic\u00ada\u00adtion was that the Health and Hu\u00adman Ser\u00advices De\u00adpart\u00adment would make it as pro\u00adced\u00adur\u00adally easy as pos\u00adsible for states to es\u00adtab\u00adlish their own ex\u00adchanges and get the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act\u2019s sub\u00adsidies flow\u00ading again\u2014and most states would take the deal.\n\nHol\u00add\u00adouts, Scully said, would likely be the deep\u00adest-red states most in\u00adtrins\u00adic\u00adally op\u00adposed to the health care law.\n\nThe ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion hasn\u2019t shown its cards pub\u00adlicly on what, if any\u00adthing, it would try to do ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtrat\u00adively if the Court rules against it\u2014but it has hin\u00adted that it couldn\u2019t do much. HHS Sec\u00adret\u00adary Sylvia Math\u00adews Bur\u00adwell re\u00adit\u00ader\u00adated that Thursday at the Journ\u00adal\u2018s event. (She did note, however, that Pennsylvania had already ap\u00adplied to set up a state ex\u00adchange in case the sub\u00adsidies are nixed, pos\u00adsibly hint\u00ading to\u00adward Scully\u2019s scen\u00adario).\n\n\u201cIn terms of ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtrat\u00adive abil\u00adity, if the Court makes that de\u00adcision, it\u2019s lim\u00adited,\u201d Bur\u00adwell said, while warn\u00ading about the risk of a \u201cdeath spir\u00adal.\u201d\n\nScully was skep\u00adtic\u00adal about that.\n\n\u201cI un\u00adder\u00adstand where Sec\u00adret\u00adary Bur\u00adwell is. I would have said the same thing if I were her: \u2018We have no flex\u00adib\u00adil\u00adity.\u2019 The real\u00adity is, if the rul\u00ading comes out the oth\u00ader way, the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion has a lot of flex\u00adib\u00adil\u00adity,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there will be a very big ef\u00adfort by the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion if that hap\u00adpens to do a quick work\u00adaround for most states that want to have a state-based ex\u00adchange.\u201d\n\nSome law pro\u00adfess\u00adors like the Uni\u00adversity of Michigan\u2019s Nich\u00adolas Bagley, who sup\u00adports the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion\u2019s po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtion in King, have also in\u00advest\u00adig\u00adated the is\u00adsue and ex\u00adpressed skep\u00adti\u00adcism about what HHS could do ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtrat\u00adively if the Court in\u00adval\u00adid\u00adates the sub\u00adsidies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re quite pess\u00adim\u00adist\u00adic. The op\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion\u00adal, leg\u00adal, and polit\u00adic\u00adal chal\u00adlenges here are im\u00admense,\u201d Bagley said last year. \u201cThe more I\u2019ve looked at this, the more alarmed I\u2019ve grown.\u201d\n\nAn ag\u00adgress\u00adive ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtrat\u00adive strategy by HHS could also in\u00advite more lit\u00adig\u00ada\u00adtion from the law\u2019s op\u00adpon\u00adents.
