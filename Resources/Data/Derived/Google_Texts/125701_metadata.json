(AP) - Percy Sledge, who soared from part-time singer and hospital orderly to lasting fame with his aching, forlorn performance on the classic \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman,\u201d died Tuesday in Louisiana. He was 74.\n\nHis family said in a statement released through his manager, Mark Lyman, that he died \u201cpeacefully\u201d at his home in Baton Rouge after a yearlong struggle with cancer. The cause of death was liver failure, Lyman said.\n\nA No. 1 hit in 1966, \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d was Sledge\u2019s debut single, an almost unbearably heartfelt ballad with a resonance he never approached again. Few singers could have. Its mood set by a mournful organ and dirge-like tempo, \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d was for many the definitive soul ballad, a testament of blinding, all-consuming love haunted by fear and graced by overwhelming emotion.\n\nThe song was a personal triumph for Sledge, who seemed on the verge of sobbing throughout the production, and a breakthrough for Southern soul. It was the first No. 1 hit from the burgeoning Muscle Shoals music scene in northern Alabama, where Aretha Franklin and the Rolling Stones among others would record, and the first gold record for Atlantic Records.\n\nAtlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler later called the song \u201ca transcendent moment\u201d and \u201ca holy love hymn.\u201d Sledge\u2019s hit became a standard that sustained his long touring career in the U.S., Europe and South Africa and led to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. It was a favorite at weddings - Sledge himself did the honors at a ceremony for musician and actor Steve Van Zandt - and often turned up in movies, including \u201cThe Big Chill,\u201d \u201dThe Crying Game\u201d and a 1994 Meg Ryan drama named for the song\u2019s title.\n\n\u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d was re-released after being featured in Oliver Stone\u2019s Vietnam War film \u201cPlatoon\u201d in 1987 and reached No. 2 in Britain. Michael Bolton topped the charts in the 1990s with a cover version and Rolling Stone magazine later ranked it No. 53 on its list of the greatest songs of all time.\n\nOn Twitter Bolton called Sledge an \u201cinspiration\u201d and a gracious human being.\n\nRecognizable by his wide, gap-toothed smile, Sledge had a handful of other hits between 1966 and 1968, including \u201cWarm and Tender Love,\u201d \u201dIt Tears Me Up,\u201d \u201dOut of Left Field\u201d and \u201cTake Time to Know Her.\u201d He returned to the charts in 1974 with \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Everything.\u201d\n\nDavid Hood, 71, one of the legendary \u201cSwampers\u201d studio musicians from Muscle Shoals, said he owed his career to Sledge and described him as the \u201cnicest person you\u2019d ever want to meet.\u201d\n\nBefore he became famous, Sledge worked in the cotton fields around his hometown of Leighton in northwest Alabama and took a job in a hospital in nearby Sheffield. He also spent weekends playing with a rhythm-and-blues band called the Esquires. A hospital patient heard him singing while working and recommended him to record producer Quin Ivy.\n\nIn the 2013 documentary \u201cMuscle Shoals,\u201d Sledge recalled recording the song: \u201cWhen I came into the studio, I was shaking like a leaf. I was scared.\u201d He added that it was the \u201csame melody that I sang when I was out in the fields. I just wailed out in the woods and let the echo come back to me.\u201d\n\nSledge said the song was inspired by a girlfriend who left him for a modeling career after he was laid off from a construction job in 1965. But in a decision that likely cost him a fortune, he gave the songwriting credits to two Esquires bandmates, bassist Calvin Lewis and organist Andrew Wright, who helped him with it.\n\nWhile identified with Muscle Shoals, Sledge lived for most of his career in Baton Rouge. He was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 1993 and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nIn April 1994, Sledge pleaded guilty in federal court to tax evasion involving income from concerts in the late 1980s. He was sentenced to six months in a halfway house, given five years of probation, and ordered to pay $96,000 in back taxes and fines.\n\nSledge had surgery for liver cancer in January 2014 but soon resumed touring.\n\nFellow musicians gathered in Florence, Alabama, later that year for a concert to raise money for Sledge\u2019s health care. The performance closed with Sledge joining in on his famous song.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t get to sing but one line,\u201d recalled David Johnson, a producer on some of Sledge\u2019s recordings and an organizer of the benefit. Johnson said another R&B star, Eddie Floyd, sang most of the song but handed the microphone to a frail Sledge.\n\nHis family\u2019s statement said he would have been 75 in November.\n\nHe is survived by his wife and 12 children, Lyman said.\n\n__\n\nSantana reported from New Orleans.
