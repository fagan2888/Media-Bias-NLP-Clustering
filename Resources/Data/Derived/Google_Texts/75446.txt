Connor Halliday’s tenure with the Washington Redskins appeared to have come to an abrupt and unexpected end Friday morning.

The undrafted free agent quarterback out of Washington State did not participate in drills on the first day of the Redskins‘ rookie minicamp and is no longer on the team’s roster. The reason for Halliday’s departure is unclear.

Halliday was well-regarded by new general manager Scot McCloughan, who attended the quarterback’s pro day on April 1. With Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy each entering the final year of their respective contracts, the former Washington State standoutn was viewed as a candidate to make Washington’s roster in 2016.

Halliday navigated injuries to set numerous program records in his time at Washington State, including a severely broken ankle that ended his senior season. The injury caused his draft stock to plummet, dropping him from a possible mid-round selection to undrafted free agency.

In a conversation with The Washington Times earlier this week, Halliday said he was frustrated by the draft process but grateful for his opportunity in Washington.

“I got here Sunday. It’s been real great ever since,” Halliday said. “I really appreciate the opportunity that Coach [Jay] Gruden and Mr. McCloughan are giving me.”

Following Halliday’s departure, the Redskins had only two quarterbacks at their rookie mini-camp Friday: Georgia’s Hutson Mason and USC’s Anthony Neyer.
