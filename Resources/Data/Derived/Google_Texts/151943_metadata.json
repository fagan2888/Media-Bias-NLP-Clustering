When you\u2019re dealing with something as deeply rooted as racism or bias\u2026 you\u2019ve got to have vigilance but you have to recognize that it\u2019s going to take some time, and you just have to be steady so you don\u2019t give up when we don\u2019t get all the way there.\u201d He warned, \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be solved overnight.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAware that his charge of racism might turn a few heads, Obama used the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner to add: \u201cAs painful as these incidents are, we can\u2019t equate what is happening now to what was happening 50 years ago. If you talk to your grandparents, parents, uncles, they\u2019ll tell you that things are better \u2014 not good, in some cases, but better. We have to be persistent, because typically progress is in steps. It\u2019s in increments.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s latest statement follows repeated allusions to racism in the United States:\n\nObama, January 2014: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s some folks who just really dislike me because they don\u2019t like the idea of a black President.\u201d\n\nObama, January 2012: \u201cEverything we fought for during the last election is at stake in this election. The very core of what this country stands for is on the line \u2014 the basic promise that no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, this is a place where you could make it if you try.\u201d [emphasis added]\n\nAfter the arrest of Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., in 2009: \u201cthere is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately, and that\u2019s just a fact.\u201d\n\nEven Bill Clinton once accused Obama of playing the race card, in 2008: \u201cI think that they played the race card on me. And we now know, from memos from the campaign and everything that they planned to do it all along. I was stating a fact, and it\u2019s still a fact.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama Tells BET: Racism 'Deeply Rooted' in U.S.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama Tells BET: Racism 'Deeply Rooted' in U.S.", "title": "Obama Tells BET: Racism 'Deeply Rooted' in U.S. - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Barack-and-Michelle/obama-lil-bit-reuters.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/07/obama-racism-deeply-rooted-in-u-s/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama Tells BET: Racism 'Deeply Rooted' in U.S.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Barack-and-Michelle/obama-lil-bit-reuters.jpg", "title": "Obama Tells BET: Racism 'Deeply Rooted' in U.S. - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bill Clinton, Reuters, WSJ,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "WSJ", "published_time": "2014-12-07T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In Obama\u2019s interview, which will be broadcast Monday evening, he intoned, \u201cThis is something that is deeply rooted in our society, it\u2019s deeply rooted in our history.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPlaying the race card more overtly than ever before, Barack Obama told Black Entertainment Television that racism is \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d in the United States.\nAnd we now know, from memos from the campaign and everything that they planned to do it all along.\nIf you talk to your grandparents, parents, uncles, they\u2019ll tell you that things are better \u2014 not good, in some cases, but better.\nI was stating a fact, and it\u2019s still a fact.\u201d"}
