WASHINGTON — Democrats are aiming to make Sen. Ted Cruz a political liability to some fellow Republicans.

They blasted GOP Senate candidates in 11 states Tuesday, attempting to tie them to Cruz and his aggressive stances on Obamacare, budget talks and the debt limit. Cruz has made clear that he will attempt to use the Oct. 17 deadline on the debt limit as leverage against the health care law.

“Refusing to abandon the Ted Cruz strategy during the debt limit debate is an entirely new level of bad judgment and recklessness from Bill Cassidy and he should be ashamed of himself,” said Justin Barasky, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, referring to a GOP nominee in Louisiana. “Republican Senate hopefuls like Bill Cassidy should immediately abandon Ted Cruz’s dangerous strategy and not allow radical Republicans to renege on the obligations of the United States.”

The committee is issuing similar missives against candidates in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and West Virginia.
