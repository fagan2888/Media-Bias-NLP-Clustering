I have in fact found a great deal of criminal fraud in the Healthcare.gov web sites software development projects, but I haven\u2019t finished the article yet because I have expanded it substantially to include an economic analysis of Obamacare. I hope to have it done within the next couple of weeks.\n\nBy way of introduction, it is worth reviewing what has happened with the Veterans Administration healthcare system.\n\nIn 2006, far-left NY Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote the following, describing the Veterans Administration (VA) health care system:\n\n[The VA\u2019s] success story is one of the best-kept secrets in the American policy debate. \u2026 [Conservative] pundits and policy makers\u2026can\u2019t handle the cognitive dissonance.\n\nKrugman is not known for his intelligence, or for much else besides his loony left ideology. After Krugman wrote this, the horror show of the VA health system began to come out in the media.\n\nWe now know that the VA system is loaded with fraud, corruption, lying, and unbelievably poor health care services. Since this has been well-reported in the media, we won\u2019t do more than list some of the well-documented problems:\n\nVeterans on waiting lists had to wait many months to get medical services, while administrators lied and provided phony waiting lists to the VA.\n\nWorkers at VA hospitals were often ordered by their superiors to lie to VA about waiting times.\n\nDr. Jose Mathews, former chief of psychiatry for the St. Louis VA Health Care System, was bullied, demoted and harassed by superiors and co-workers when he became a whistleblower and reported that psychiatrists there were seeing patients less than four hours a day. Mathews also discovered that false data was being entered into veterans\u2019 medical records.\n\nAnother whistleblower, Dr. Katherine Mitchell, medical director of the Iraq and Afghanistan Post-Deployment Center of the Phoenix VA, told Congress of long and secret waiting lists.\n\nIn Chicago, employee bonuses were tied to manipulating wait time data.\n\nThe bottom line is that apparently no one in the VA actually gave a damn about medical care for veterans.\n\nThis appears to be exactly what is happening in Obamacare, according to the research that I\u2019ll be reporting within a couple of weeks.\n\nThere will also be a separate article posted on my web site on academic research into the general problem of sabotage, fraud and subversion in software development projects. This will be of interest to academic researchers and software development managers. Forbes (23-May-2014) and St Louis Today (8-Jul-2014)\n\nBritain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) faces existential financial crisis\n\n\n\nUK National Health Service (NHS) launch leaflet, July 1948\n\nThose who favor copying the United Kingdom\u2019s single-payer National Health Service (NHS) should be aware that on Monday it was announced that NHS is facing an existential financial crisis. NHS health care providers are forecasting a deficit of over $3 billion in 2015-16. The deficit is growing rapidly, and the NHS is being required to find $35 billion in \u201cefficiency savings\u201d by 2020.\n\nAccording to a letter sent on Monday to NHS from David Bennett, head of the Monitor agency that monitors the NHS:\n\nAs you know, the NHS is facing an almost unprecedented financial challenge this year. Current plans are quite simply unaffordable. As I have said before, if we are to do the best we can for patients we must leave no stone unturned in our collective efforts to make the money we have go as far as possible.\n\nThis week, the NHS is being told to take the following steps in response to the financial crisis:\n\nStaffing: Hospitals and other providers are being told to fill vacancies \u201conly where essential,\u201d in order to cut down the number of people providing medical services.\n\nHospitals and other providers are being told to fill vacancies \u201conly where essential,\u201d in order to cut down the number of people providing medical services. Waiting times: Currently, hospitals have to see 90% of patients requiring an overnight stay within 18 weeks of a referral from a GP (General Practitioner). Those waiting time requirements will be scrapped.\n\nCurrently, hospitals have to see 90% of patients requiring an overnight stay within 18 weeks of a referral from a GP (General Practitioner). Those waiting time requirements will be scrapped. Waiting times: Currently, 95% of day patients must be seen in the same timeframe. Those waiting time requirements will also be scrapped.\n\nThese minor tweaks to the NHS system will not come anywhere close to providing the required $35 billion in \u201cefficiency savings.\u201d A massive restructuring will be required.\n\nAccording to the Labor Party\u2019s health secretary Andy Burnham:\n\nThis is a sign of a serious deterioration in NHS finances. It suggests that the financial crisis in the NHS is threatening to spiral out of control and hit standards of patient care. The suggestion that hospitals can ignore safe staffing guidance will alarm patients and the Government must decide if it will overrule this advice. Morale in the NHS is already at an all-time low and doctors have lost confidence in the Health Secretary. It will raise further questions about how the Government can possibly fulfil commitments on a seven-day NHS without the money to back it up.\n\nNot surprisingly, with so much money involved, the NHS is filled with criminality and fraud, just as in the case of Obamacare and the Veterans Administration. A study last year by Portsmouth University found that fraud alone is costing the NHS something like $8 billion a year. Some of the fraudulent activities include:\n\nNon-payment of prescription charges by patients\n\nMedical professionals claiming for work they have not done\n\nDentists making claims for non-existent patients\n\nGPs (General Practitioners) falsifying records to claim extra payments\n\nConsultants putting in for bogus overtime.\n\nNot surprisingly, \u201cthe NHS in recent years has stopped measuring its own losses,\u201d according to the report. When an organization stops collecting early warning data, that\u2019s a sure sign that a problem is turning into a full-scale disaster.\n\nBritain\u2019s dentistry services have already become so bad that many people are buying \u201cdo-it-yourself (DIY) dentistry kits\u201d that can be obtained from local stores. According to one resident, \u201cDIY dentistry is fairly common round here. They sell a lot of those first aid kits\u2026 and you\u2019ve got people taking care of their whole family\u2019s teeth with them.\u201d\n\nThe NHS financial crisis is so enormous that nobody doubts that it will seriously impact patient care. The NHS is facing a massive restructuring.\n\nBy American standards, an 18-week waiting time is ridiculously long, and now the NHS is scrapping even that waiting period. Any American who uses the NHS as a model has to be a total moron. Independent (London) and BBC and Independent (London) and BBC (24-Mar-2014) and Guardian (3-Apr-2015)\n\nSummary of Obamacare findings\n\nThe following is a brief summary of my findings that I will be posting within a couple of weeks:\n\nThe core problem with Healthcare.gov was that each web site should have cost $10-20 million to develop, but the Obama administration provided $150-200 million per web site. In order to spend all that money, contractors hired thousands of programmers, many of them incompetent. The resulting disaster enormously humiliated the Obama administration, which was well deserved.\n\nHealthcare.gov web sites are already outdated technology, so there\u2019s no chance of upgrading to mobile phones and tablets. Also, with a code base of hundreds of millions of lines of code, the web sites are unsupportable. In the endgame, these dinosaur web sites will have to be thrown out.\n\nThe Medicaid expansion made millions of new people insured, creating a major financial crisis in Kentucky and other states. Obamacare imposed what I call \u201cNixon-Obama price controls,\u201d to emphasize the fact that the imposed Medicaid price controls are as destructive to our economy as Nixon\u2019s price controls in the 1970s that destroyed the economy for a decade.\n\nObamacare confiscated the $710 billion Medicare insurance fund that workers have been paying into for decades, and used it to fund a bunch of Obamacare entities. These entities were supposed to be self-sustaining by now, as the Medicare money runs out, but they\u2019re almost all financial disasters: Obamacare exchanges, Obamacare risk corridors, Obamacare co-ops, and Obamacare web sites. In the endgame, these will all have to be thrown out.\n\nThe $710 billion Medicare insurance fund has essentially been thrown into the garbage, with almost nothing to show for it.\n\nThe number 12 million of \u201cnewly insured\u201d people is essentially fraudulent because it does not take into account the many millions of people who are effectively uninsured, either because they are on Medicaid and cannot find a doctor who takes Medicaid, or because they are on a standard \u201cbronze\u201d plan with a $10,000-12,000 deductible, and have to pay all their medical bills anyway.\n\nBefore Obamacare, any uninsured person could get medical care in a hospital emergency room. The Obamacare endgame is that the only place where a Medicaid patient will get medical care is in a hospital emergency room, where they\u2019ll get $50 worth of medical services, since that is the Medicaid reimbursement to the hospital. As before, only people with private health insurance will get good medical care.\n\nUK\u2019s National Health Service, Veteran\u2019s Administration health care, and Obamacare all share the same things: fraud, criminality and worsening health care. Unfortunately, there\u2019s little chance that any lessons will be learned.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m perhaps uniquely qualified to do this analysis. I\u2019m an apolitical, non-ideological, highly analytical writer. I have decades of experience in software development (Resume: http://www.jxenakis.com/resume). And I also have decades of experience as a tech journalist, including two years as Boston Bureau Chief of InformationWeek Magazine, and ten years (part time) as Technology Editor for CFO Magazine (Examples: http://ww2.cfo.com/author/john-xenakis/).\n\nKEYS: Generational Dynamics, Veterans Administration, Obamacare, Healthcare.gov, Paul Krugman, Jose Mathews, Katherine Mitchell, Britain, National Health Service, NHS, David Bennett, Andy Burnham, Portsmouth University, Medicaid, Medicare insurance fund, Obamacare exchanges, Obamacare risk corridors, Obamacare co-ops, Obamacare web sites\n\nPermanent web link to this article\n\nReceive daily World View columns by e-mail", "article_metadata": {"description": "World View: Britain's National Health Service (NHS) Faces Existential Financial Crisis", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "World View: Britain's National Health Service (NHS) Faces Existential Financial Crisis", "title": "World View: Britain's National Health Service (NHS) Faces Existential Financial Crisis - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 700, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/NHS.jpg", "height": 481}, "updated_time": "2015-08-05T15:50:11-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/08/05/world-view-britains-national-health-service-nhs-faces-existential-financial-crisis/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "World View: Britain's National Health Service (NHS) Faces Existential Financial Crisis", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/NHS.jpg", "title": "World View: Britain's National Health Service (NHS) Faces Existential Financial Crisis - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Andy Burnham, Britain, David Bennett, Generational Dynamics, healthcare.gov, Jose Mathews, Katherine Mitchell, medicaid, Medicare insurance fund, National Health Service, NHS, obamacare, Obamacare co-ops, obamacare exchanges, Obamacare risk corridors, Obamacare web sites, Paul Krugman, Portsmouth University, Veterans Administration,National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-08-05T04:00:52-07:00", "section": "National Security", "modified_time": "2015-08-05T15:50:11-07:00", "tag": "Veterans Administration", "categories": "National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e5f\"", "article_summary": "UK\u2019s National Health Service, Veteran\u2019s Administration health care, and Obamacare all share the same things: fraud, criminality and worsening health care.\nForbes (23-May-2014) and St Louis Today (8-Jul-2014)Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) faces existential financial crisisUK National Health Service (NHS) launch leaflet, July 1948Those who favor copying the United Kingdom\u2019s single-payer National Health Service (NHS) should be aware that on Monday it was announced that NHS is facing an existential financial crisis.\nNHS health care providers are forecasting a deficit of over $3 billion in 2015-16.\nWe now know that the VA system is loaded with fraud, corruption, lying, and unbelievably poor health care services.\nBy way of introduction, it is worth reviewing what has happened with the Veterans Administration healthcare system."}
