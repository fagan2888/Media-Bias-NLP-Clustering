On June 27, PolitiFact Oregon released a fact-check showing that the claim by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence that nine children are killed every day in gun violence is false.

The Brady Campaign made the claim at a June 17 Vancouver rally in the wake of the murder-suicide at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, Oregon. The group wrote, “9 kids every day will never have another birthday” on a chalkboard, displayed for all to see.

According to PolitiFact Oregon, the real number from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) shows 7.81 deaths daily for those who fall under the Brady Campaign’s “kids” age range. But the problem with that age range is that it includes 19-year-old adults.

The CDC’s “own metrics” show that “about half of all youth gun deaths” from 2007 to 2011 are for the age group of 18 to 19. And when “unintentional” firearm-related injuries are isolated, “roughly 46 percent” is for the age group of 18 to 19, as well.

Remove these and there is “an average of 4.76 unintentional gun [firearm] injuries each day and 3.85 [firearm-related] deaths.”

The 3.85 number is considerably lower than the claim that 9 children are killed each day.

PolitiFact Oregon contacted the Brady Campaign’s Heidi Yewman about these figures, and “she acknowledged that the number presented at the Vancouver rally was incorrect.”
