But at least it was built out of the best dishonest bricks that a billion dollars could buy.

Gruber's videos have, if nothing else, have gotten some liberals to begin backing slowly away from ObamaCare. This latest comes from Ron Fournier at the National Journal.

He called you stupid. He admitted that the White House lied to you. Its officials lied to all of us—Republicans, Democrats, and independents; rich and poor; white and brown; men and women. Liberals should be the angriest. Not only were they personally deceived, but the administration's dishonest approach to health care reform has helped make Obamacare unpopular while undermining the public's faith in an activist government. A double blow to progressives.

And a useful reminder to the rest of us what progs actually are.

And so even I have to admit, as a supporter, that Obamacare was built and sold on a foundation of lies. No way around it, unless you're willing to accept a political system that colors its lies—the reds, the whites, and the blues.
