But fortunately being better trained for running fast for long periods of time can reduce that risk.\n\nResearch from the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute at Laval University found that strenuous exercise can cause inflammation of the heart, especially among runners with lower fitness and less training. The study followed 20 marathon runners between the ages of 18 and 60. The participants were evaluated before and shortly after the Quebec City marathon, and three months later. While the runners trained, researchers led by Dr. Eric Larose used MRIs and blood tests to keep track of their heart function.\n\nAfter the marathon, half of the runners showed a functional decline in both the left and right ventricles of the heart. In some, there was swelling and a decrease in blood flow in certain areas of the heart. Larose found that those who were less fit were more likely to experience this decline in function. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t train as you should, you are going to get these changes,\u201d he said. A similar study conducted in 2011 showed that extreme endurance exercise could temporarily damage the right ventricle of the heart, but not the left ventricle.\n\nOf course, the study isn\u2019t meant to alarm people, especially those running to stay fit and healthy. The benefits of running far outweigh any temporary damage that might occur in the heart muscle. The damage isn't permanent, Larose stresses. Besides, those who are more fit and who have more training under their belts are less likely to experience this temporary inflammation, and are more likely to benefit from the long-term effects of aerobic exercise.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is reason for concern,\u201d Dr. James Eichelberger, associate professor of cardiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, told HealthDay. \u201cThere is little risk. If you want to avoid that, exercising less vigorously for a less amount of time makes some sense.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that while exercise is good, there may be a limit, or a point at which the benefits begin to plateau. \u201cHabitual physical activity reduces coronary heart disease events, but vigorous activity can also acutely and transiently increase the risk of sudden cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction in susceptible persons,\u201d authors of a 2007 study write. Also noted in the study is that habitual physical activity reduces the risks of fatal and nonfatal coronary artery disease (CAD) events, and that benefits of regular exercise outweigh its risks. Performing mild exercise, like the 30 minutes per day of walking recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, can help people reach a moderate level of fitness without the rare risks of heart inflammation, enlargement, or scarring.\n\nSources: Gaudreault V, Tizon-Marcos H, Poirier P, Pibarot P, Gilbert P, Amyot M, Rod\u00e9s-Cabau J, Despr\u00e9s JP, Bertrand O, Larose E.
