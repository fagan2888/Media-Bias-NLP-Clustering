(Photo: FILE PHOTO)Buy Photo\n\nBarnabas Health plans to merge with Robert Wood Johnson Health System, the two health care chains said Tuesday, in a deal that would bring together two landmark hospitals and create New Jersey\u2019s biggest health care system.\n\nExecutives said the new company, called RWJ Barnabas Health, would be in a better position to deliver high-quality care in the age of health care reform. Hospitals are being rewarded for keeping patients healthy instead of merely treating them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that shift,\u201d said Stephen K. Jones, president and chief executive officer of Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Robert Wood Johnson Health System. \u201cThe need to shift in order to increase access, improve experience, manage cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the impact on patients would be increased access to all of our clinical programs,\u201d Barry H. Ostrowsky, president and chief executive officer of Barnabas Health, said in an interview. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a level of care we don\u2019t possess in this new enterprise.\u201d\n\nThe merger of West Orange-based Barnabas and New Brunswick-based Robert Wood Johnson had long been rumored, and it continues the rapid consolidation in the hospital industry. Meridian Health signed an agreement in May to merge with Hackensack University Health Network in what was, until now, New Jersey\u2019s biggest hospital merger.\n\nHospitals under pressure\n\nHospitals have been under pressure to rein in costs since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, went into effect in 2010, in part by keeping patients out of the hospital setting, where care is much more expensive.\n\nMedicare, for example, penalizes hospitals whose patients return within 30 days of their procedure. And insurers are working with hospitals to pay them not for the services they provide but for the outcome of their patients\u2019 health.\n\nIt has pressured hospitals to find partners \u2014 physicians, urgent care facilities, other hospitals \u2014 that can provide care that ranges from the simple to the complex. And it has pressured hospitals to invest in technology so they can better manage the care they are providing, said Linda Schwimmer, vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, an advocacy group based in Pennington.\n\n\u201cI think this whole merger mania is inevitable,\u201d Schwimmer said. \u201cI can see five or six large systems and a couple standalones being what the New Jersey landscape looks like in the next few years.\u201d\n\nBarnabas has seven acute care hospitals, including Community Medical Center in Toms River; Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch; and Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus in Lakewood, formerly known as Kimball Medical Center.\n\nRobert Wood Johnson has four acute care hospitals, including Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick.\n\nThe agreement is expected to be submitted to the state Attorney General\u2019s Office for review. The two companies said the merger should be completed in 2016.\n\nNo layoff plans\n\nIf it is approved, the new health care system will be a juggernaut with annual revenue of $4.5 billion, nearly 30,000 employees and 9,000 physicians. (In a sign of the times, the company also pointed out that it has five fitness and wellness centers).\n\nOstrowsky, of Barnabas Health, will lead the new company. Jones will be chief academic officer, focusing on its partnership with Rutgers University.\n\nExecutives said there are no plans to shutter facilities or lay off employees. And they noted that the two companies mostly served different footprints. Barnabas has a big presence in Monmouth, Ocean, Hudson, and Essex counties; Robert Wood Johnson operates in Middlesex, Mercer and Union counties.\n\nHospital mergers don\u2019t come without scrutiny. Among the concerns: A bigger health care system will have more bargaining power with insurance companies and drive up costs. And it will consolidate, devoting fewer resources to low-income communities.\n\nBut consumer advocates on Tuesday were slow to criticize.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t taken an actual position on it at the moment,\u201d said Maura Collinsgru, health policy advocate for New Jersey Citizen Action, a consumer group. \u201cBut as always our radar is on ensuring that community access to quality, affordable care remains. Our experience with those two health systems has been as good community providers.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, \u201cThis development brings an opportunity to our two New Brunswick hospitals to build upon their modest collaborative community efforts,\u201d said Ronald C. Rak, president and chief executive officer of Saint Peter\u2019s Healthcare System. \u201cAnd to explore in this ever-changing health care environment how to best serve the people of New Jersey.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1MrGhQo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Barnabas Health plans to merge with Robert Wood Johnson Health System in a deal that would create New Jersey\u2019s biggest health care system.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Barnabas Health plans to merge with Robert Wood Johnson Health System in a deal that would create New Jersey\u2019s biggest health care system.", "title": "Big hospital merger: Barnabas, Robert Wood Johnson", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/money/business/2015/07/14/barnabas-robert-wood-johnson/30136049/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Barnabas Health plans to merge with Robert Wood Johnson Health System in a deal that would create New Jersey\u2019s biggest health care system.", "title": "Big hospital merger: Barnabas, Robert Wood Johnson", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1ca8b022d98f39025949bccc4973dde9d8a6e7ae/c=0-360-2336-2696&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/14/Bridgewater/B9318080826Z.1_20150714164532_000_GRMBBLCI3.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Barnabas, Robert Wood Johnson, merger, Monmouth Medical Center, Community Medical Center, Kimball Medical Center"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2679\"", "article_summary": "Robert Wood Johnson has four acute care hospitals, including Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that shift,\u201d said Stephen K.
