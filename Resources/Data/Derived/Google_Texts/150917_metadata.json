The study \u2014 by researchers at Stanford University, UC San Francisco, Truven Health Analytics and the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \u2014 was published in Health Affairs.\n\n\u201cPeople say there are plenty of dentists, but there\u2019s a subtler argument we\u2019re trying to make: that there is a low rate of dentists who take Medicaid.\u201d\n\nResearchers said a dearth of dental providers who accept Medicaid patients, particularly in those urban underserved areas, has limited the effectiveness of Medicaid dental coverage in states that provide it.\n\n\u201cWe found that, in urban counties there were large concentrations of all providers, but not really to serve the poor,\u201d said Maria Raven, senior author of the study and associate professor of emergency medicine at UCSF.\n\n\u201cThere may be a higher density of dentists [in urban areas], but they\u2019re still not accepting Medi-Cal patients,\u201d Raven said. \u201cCoverage doesn\u2019t equal access.\u201d\n\nThat has resulted in high ED use even in states with Medicaid dental coverage, she said.\n\nMedi-Cal is California\u2019s Medicaid program, and it did not have adult dental coverage in 2010, when the study\u2019s data were collected.\n\nKatie Fingar, lead author of the study and research leader in health care at Truven, said the numbers were slightly better in rural areas.\n\n\u201cWe did see that for those in rural areas, a greater supply [of dental providers] was associated with lower ED use,\u201d Fingar said. But, she said, 90 percent of Medicaid dental visits are in urban areas.\n\nAs a result, she said, more than 2 percent of all emergency department visits are related to non-traumatic dental conditions.\n\nIn April, the American Dental Association released a similar study that drew similar conclusions.\n\n\u201cOne of the important things about the study we did is we looked at provider density,\u201d Raven said. \u201cPeople say there are plenty of dentists, but there\u2019s a subtler argument we\u2019re trying to make, that there is a low rate of dentists who take Medicaid.\u201d\n\nProvider rates in California are among the lowest Medicaid rates in the nation, she said, but care can still be worked out in underserved urban areas, such as the use of mid-level dental providers \u2014 or getting more dentists to see Medi-Cal patients.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad provider rates aren\u2019t higher,\u201d she said, \u201cbut everyone needs to pitch in. Coverage is a necessity, but you have to pair it with providers.\u201d\n\nDavid Gorn is a senior reporter with California Healthline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers say while there are likely enough dentists, the problem is the low rate of those accepting Medicaid.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Even With Insurance, Medicaid Recipients Still Go to ER for Dental Problems\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/08\\/06\\/even-with-insurance-medicaid-recipients-still-go-to-er-for-dental-problems\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-06 10:01:54\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-08-06 17:51:31\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":57722,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Dental Care\",\"Medi-Cal\",\"Medicaid\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/08\\/iStock_000007102144_Large-e1438880252888.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Researchers say while there are likely enough dentists, the problem is the low rate of those accepting Medicaid.", "title": "Even With Insurance, Medicaid Recipients Still Go to ER for Dental Problems", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/08/06/even-with-insurance-medicaid-recipients-still-go-to-er-for-dental-problems/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/08/iStock_000007102144_Large-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "dental care,medi-cal,medicaid", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCoverage doesn\u2019t equal access.\u201dThat has resulted in high ED use even in states with Medicaid dental coverage, she said.\nBut, she said, 90 percent of Medicaid dental visits are in urban areas.\nMedi-Cal is California\u2019s Medicaid program, and it did not have adult dental coverage in 2010, when the study\u2019s data were collected.\nStates that provide Medicaid adult dental care still have high rates of dental patients who show up at hospital emergency departments, particularly in urban underserved areas, according to a study released this week.\n\u201cThere may be a higher density of dentists [in urban areas], but they\u2019re still not accepting Medi-Cal patients,\u201d Raven said."}
