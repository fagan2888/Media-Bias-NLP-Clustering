Among these uninsured black men, 59 percent report an income at or below the national poverty line.\n\nThe report, \u201cCharacteristics of Uninsured Adult Males by Race and Ethnicity (Ages 19 to 64 Years)\u201d is a snapshot of the state of health care for men of various races across the US. While we\u2019ve focused quite a bit on how the Affordable Care Act is bringing more Americans on to much-needed health care plans, the uproar the law has caused among Republicans, and the impact that the new mandates \u2014 and the Supreme Court decisions against them \u2014 has on women, there\u2019s also men\u2019s health to be concerned with.\n\nAccording to the latest numbers, eight million people have signed up for health insurance under the ACA. The Office of Minority Health is a special effort within the Department of Health and Human Services charged with creating policies and programs that benefit minorities and reduce health disparities in this country. This latest report shows that there\u2019s a big gap in access to health insurance. In every age group, white men have the lowest percentage of people lacking health insurance (Asian men are next). African American and Latino men have the highest.\n\n\u201cAn important factor in making progress toward reducing health disparities and achieving health equity is our ability to understand why disparities occur and how to eliminate them,\u201d Dr. J. Nadine Gracia, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Minority Health and the Director of the Office of Minority Health, told us via email.\n\n\u201cThis type of knowledge about the patterns of uninsurance among adult minority men prior to the establishment of the Health Insurance Marketplace and the expansion of Medicaid eligibility can be a powerful tool for organizations today. It can help them develop targeted interventions to ensure that more men of color and their families obtain access to opportunities for coverage and preventive health benefits to improve the health status of all Americans,\u201d she continued.\n\nPoverty is a closely-related issue, specifically among African-American men, who are more often at the federal poverty level (FPL) than any other racial group. Forty-three percent of African-American men have no full-time worker in their household, also the highest percentage among the racial groups examined.\n\nFor more from the Office of Minority Health, click here.
