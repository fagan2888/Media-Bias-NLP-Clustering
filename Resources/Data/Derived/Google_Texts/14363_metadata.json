But now researchers have cleverly figured out how to turn sweat into energy.\n\nScientists have devised a small skin patch they call a \u201ctemporary tattoo\u201d that can transform lactate \u2014 one of 800 or so chemicals in sweat \u2014 into electrical energy.\n\nNot much energy, so far. Only about 4 microwatts, less than half of what it takes to power a digital watch. But the energy alchemists are confident they can scale up their sweat \u201cbiobattery\u201d enough to play an iPod, power a GPS device, or warn a marathoner when it\u2019s time to top up her electrolytes.\n\nThe researchers think their work could also have military and biomedical applications, if they can tweak the technology to squeeze more electricity out of sweat.\n\n\u201cSweat has been largely neglected, not thought of as a worthwhile physiological fluid.\u201d \u2013 Researcher Josh Windmiller\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re working on the biofuel cell so it can get higher power,\u201d Wenzhao Jia, of the University of California San Diego, tells CommonHealth. She\u2019s describing the skin-patch biobattery tomorrow at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco.\n\nOne problem in experiments so far: People who are less fit produce more energy from their sweat than those who are moderately fit. The fittest subjects produce the least amount of power. The researchers are trying to figure out how to compensate for this.\n\n\u201cWe want to integrate another electronic element such as a super-capacitor that can store the power,\u201d Jia says. \u201cUltimately, we can connect a number of cells together to make the current higher.\u201d\n\nJia says the sweat-powered battery grew out of an earlier effort to monitor levels of lactate, a metabolic byproduct when sugar (glucose) is broken down to produce energy \u2014 a process called glycolysis. (It\u2019s the buildup of lactate, or lactic acid, that makes your muscles sore after strenuous exercise.)\n\n\u201cLactate is a very important indicator of how you are doing during exercise,\u201d Jia says. High-performance athletes monitor their lactate levels to evaluate their endurance capacity and their training program. It\u2019s also an important marker of heart failure, shock or generalized infection.\n\nBut up to now, measuring lactate required drawing blood and analyzing it in a laboratory. Last year Jia and her UCSD colleagues reported a new way to measure lactate levels by analyzing sweat.\n\nThey devised a lactate sensor that could be printed onto a flexible plastic strip \u2014 the same process used in printing T-shirts. The strip can be worn like a bandage, collecting data that can be streamed to a mobile device \u2013- and voila, continuous monitoring of lactate in sweat during exercise, something not possible before.\n\nThe new \u201cbiobattery\u201d takes the approach a step farther, from collecting data through sweat to harvesting energy.\n\nJosh Windmiller, one of the researchers, says the work shows that sweat deserves more respect.\n\n\u201cSweat has gotten a bum reputation,\u201d Windmiller said in a recent online interview. \u201cIt makes us uncomfortable, makes us smell\u2026Sweat has been largely neglected, not thought of as a worthwhile physiological fluid.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s founded a company called Electrozyme to develop wearable sweat monitors. It\u2019s betting that fitness buffs will pay for a device \u2014 maybe someday a sweat-powered device \u2014 that gives them a minute-by-minute read-out of their metabolism.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers have figured out a way to turn sweat into energy: a small skin patch they call a \"temporary tattoo\" that can transform lactate, one of 800 or so chemicals in sweat, into electrical energy.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Researchers have figured out a way to turn sweat into energy: a small skin patch they call a \"temporary tattoo\" that can transform lactate, one of 800 or so chemicals in sweat, into electrical energy.", "title": "Perspiration Power: Scientists Turn Sweat Into Electrical Energy", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/08/sweat-power-exercise-energy", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/08/sweatpower.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/08/sweat-power-exercise-energy", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/08/sweatpower.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Perspiration Power: Scientists Turn Sweat Into Electrical Energy"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-13", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Wed, 13 Aug 2014 10:26:54 -0400"}, "article_summary": "Perspiration Power: Scientists Turn Sweat Into Electrical EnergyBy Richard KnoxIt takes energy to work up a sweat.\n\u201cWe want to integrate another electronic element such as a super-capacitor that can store the power,\u201d Jia says.\nScientists have devised a small skin patch they call a \u201ctemporary tattoo\u201d that can transform lactate \u2014 one of 800 or so chemicals in sweat \u2014 into electrical energy.\nBut now researchers have cleverly figured out how to turn sweat into energy.\nOne problem in experiments so far: People who are less fit produce more energy from their sweat than those who are moderately fit."}
