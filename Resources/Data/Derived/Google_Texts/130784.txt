AMSTERDAM (AP) — Amsterdam’s mayor and organizers of a large children’s winter festival have unveiled plans to reform the image of “Black Pete” — the sidekick to the Dutch Santa Claus — to remove perceived racist elements.

Mayor Eberhard van der Laan said Thursday the “negroid character” of Pete’s appearance will be eliminated over a period of years.

The long-term goal will be making Pete look like he has been merely tarnished from soot from going down chimneys to deliver presents — a common storyline.

Black Pete has become the subject of protests in the Netherlands. Opponents say he is a caricature of an African slave carried over from colonial times: Pete is usually portrayed by white people wearing blackface makeup, bold red lipstick and frizzy “Afro” wigs.

But a large majority of the Netherlands’ mostly white population says that Pete is a positive figure, and denies any racial insult.

Last month an Amsterdam court agreed with findings by a Dutch discrimination vetting board and a U.N. advisory panel that Pete’s look is offensive.
