The final rule also requires covered health programs and activities to treat individuals consistent with their gender identity.\u201d\n\nThe USCCB and other religiously affiliated groups had opposed the rule\u2019s imposing coverage of abortion and \u201cgender reassignment\u201d treatment last fall.\n\nThe rule\u2019s language indicates that it does not repeal current religious exemptions for faith-based healthcare providers, stating, \u201cThe final rule on Section 1557 does not include a religious exemption; however, the final rule does not displace existing protections for religious freedom and conscience.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, it drew condemnation from religious liberty and family advocates for its lack of constitutionality and imposition of gender identity and abortion.\n\n\u201cAs bad as the ACA is, it\u2019s laughable to suggest that when Congress referred to \u2018sex\u2019 in Section 1557 it was referring to anything other than biological sex,\u201d stated Ken Klukowski, attorney with First Liberty Institute and Breitbart News legal editor.\n\n\u201cThis is Orwellian,\u201d Klukowski wrote at Breitbart. \u201cBut beyond that, it is an unconstitutional assault on the First Amendment that the Obama administration is forcing their rejection of biological fact onto people whose faith teaches that \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 refer to what they have meant for thousands of years, and that God purposefully created them that way.\u201d\n\nThe executive director for the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, Doctor Jane Orient, said the government was presuming to dictate medical ethics through the rule, and it would lead to doctors and hospitals discontinuing acceptance of Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nOrient decried the medical danger in the Obama Administration\u2019s imposition of gender ideology as well.\n\n\u201cTransgender treatment, especially to minors, inflicts irreversible harm on persons too young to consent,\u201d she stated. \u201cIt constitutes radical, non-consented social experimentation. Chemical or surgical castration should be considered a crime against humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAffirming a patient\u2019s delusions (e.g. that he really is a she) is considered psychiatric malpractice in other contexts,\u201d Orient continued.\n\nThe Family Research Council (FRC) also criticized the Obamacare rule, and called upon Congress for redress.\n\n\u201cHHS's final rule concocts out of thin air a redefinition of sex discrimination to include both gender identity and abortion,\u201d FRC Vice President of Government Affairs David Christensen said in a statement. \u201cThis intolerant and unjust rule, in turn, threatens to force health care providers to participate in and perform services that substantially violate their consciences.\u201d\n\nChristensen called the rule regulatory overreach, and drew a parallel with the Obama Administration\u2019s forcing gender identity on the nation\u2019s public schools earlier last Friday under the guise of sex discrimination.\n\n\u201cThis action erodes Americans' freedom to believe and act in accordance with their beliefs,\u201d Christensen stated, \u201cnot only as it relates to the privacy of the bathrooms but also now when it comes to the taking of innocent human life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "The new HHS rule 'concocts out of thin air a redefinition of sex discrimination,' say critics.", "title": "Obama tells hospitals: Do abortions and \u2018sex changes\u2019 or you\u2019ll lose federal funding", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/Politicians/obama/obama.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/obama-tells-hospitals-do-abortions-and-sex-changes-or-youll-lose-federal-fu", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "The new HHS rule 'concocts out of thin air a redefinition of sex discrimination,' say critics."}, "description": "The new HHS rule 'concocts out of thin air a redefinition of sex discrimination,' say critics.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "article_summary": "The HHS claims the new rule \u201cbuilds on prior Federal civil rights laws to prohibit sex discrimination in health care\u201d and \u201calso prohibits the denial of health care or health coverage based on an individual\u2019s sex, including discrimination based on pregnancy, gender identity, and sex stereotyping.\n\u201cHHS's final rule concocts out of thin air a redefinition of sex discrimination to include both gender identity and abortion,\u201d FRC Vice President of Government Affairs David Christensen said in a statement.\nOrient decried the medical danger in the Obama Administration\u2019s imposition of gender ideology as well.\nThe Family Research Council (FRC) also criticized the Obamacare rule, and called upon Congress for redress.\n\u201cTransgender treatment, especially to minors, inflicts irreversible harm on persons too young to consent,\u201d she stated."}
