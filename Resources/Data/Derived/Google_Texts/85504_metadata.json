(Photo: ~File photo)\n\nBRIDGEWATER A Piscataway man and North Plainfield woman are facing drug charges after police allegedly found more than a half-ounce of cocaine in their vehicle parked at a Route 22 restaurant.\n\nAndres Nazario, 47, of Piscataway, and Amirah Thompson, 33 of North Plainfield, were arrested Sept. 11 after the Somerset County Prosecutor's Office Organized Crime and Narcotics Task force received information a man and a woman would be in possession of a quantity of cocaine when they arrived at a Route 22 West restaurant in a red SUV, according to Somerset County Prosecutor Geoffrey D. Soriano.\n\nA surveillance team was set up near the restaurant and around 9 p.m. detectives noticed a red Ford Edge with two occupants arrive and park in the restaurant\u2019s parking lot.\n\nTask Force members approached the vehicle and advised Nazario, the driver, and his passenger, Thompson, of the narcotics investigation.\n\nSoriano said that Somerset County Sheriff\u2019s Office K-9 \u201cApex\u201d and his handler responded to the scene to assist in the investigation. After sniffing the exterior of the vehicle the K-9 gave a positive indication for the presence of narcotics inside the vehicle. A Superior Court search warrant was obtained for the vehicle.\n\nInside the vehicle, police seized more than a half-ounce of cocaine near the passenger side door. Inside Thompson's purse police found less than a half-ounce of suboxone strips, a drug used to treat opiate addiction. Both Nazario and Thompson were arrested.\n\nNazario and Thompson were transported to the Somerset County Jail in Somerville, where Nazario was being held on $150,000 cash bail and Thompson was held on $100,000 cash bail.\n\nStaff Writer Suzanne Russell: 732-565-7335; srussell@mycentraljersey.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1FaIuRq", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Members of the Somerset County Prosecutor's Office Organized Crime and Narcotics Task Force were told cocaine would be arriving in a red SUV", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Members of the Somerset County Prosecutor's Office Organized Crime and Narcotics Task Force were told cocaine would be arriving in a red SUV", "title": "2 accused of drug charges on Route 22", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2015/09/14/2-accused-drug-charges-route-22/72273616/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Members of the Somerset County Prosecutor's Office Organized Crime and Narcotics Task Force were told cocaine would be arriving in a red SUV", "title": "2 accused of drug charges on Route 22", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5226fba5d84089428a94b79607b2dfeaeae11693/c=67-0-334-267&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/14/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635778497211473810-police-uniform.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Somerset County Prosecutor Geoffrey D.
