Ian Padgham, a popular Viner with over 350,000 followers and dozens of videos, released his most endearing Vine yet: his wife Claire Pasquier\u2019s nine-month pregnancy in six seconds. The couple was able to capture what took nine months to accomplish in just a matter of seconds, showing the baby bump growing and growing, with the end result \u2014 you guessed it: a baby.\n\n\u201cIt was a fun way to capture the progress,\u201d Padgham told BuzzFeed. \u201cWe would watch the draft coming together as the pregnancy progressed.\u201d The Vine was done by filming about two frames per month. The short clip captures the mother\u2019s early stages of pregnancy, two frames at a time, until you see the newborn in her arms.\n\nThe physical changes a woman\u2019s body goes through during pregnancy were also seen in the Vine. Notably, Pasquier gained weight, as pregnant women need only about 300 healthy calories more a day than they did before they got pregnant, gaining an average of 25 to 35 pounds. Also, breast changes can be seen as women\u2019s breasts often get extremely tender and begin increasing in size during the early stages of pregnancy, specifically in the first three months.\n\nNot only did Padgham\u2019s Vine capture his wife\u2019s physical changes of pregnancy, he was able to get more creative by adding a melodic tune. The proud dad admits to being very excited when Vine recently allowed uploads to these videos. \u201cI was about to post it but when I saw Vine had updated to allow uploads, I decided to add in a song \u2014 really happy I got to do that!\u201d Padgham said.\n\n\"The 9 Month Vine\" https://t.co/6B10JDF876 with @artiste :) \u2014 Ian Padgham (@origiful) August 22, 2014", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "the miracle of life, nine months, pregnancy, labor, women's health, vine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A popular Viner captured his wife's pregnancy in a six-second vine that takes you through all the stages of the nine months.", "title": "Dad Squeezes Wife's 9-Month Pregnancy In 6-Second Vine [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miracle-life-6-seconds-ian-padgham-dad-be-captures-9-months-pregnancy-vine-299640", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/25/man-captures-wifes-entire-pregnancy-six-seconds.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A popular Viner captured his wife's pregnancy in a six-second vine that takes you through all the stages of the nine months.", "title": "Dad Squeezes Wife's 9-Month Pregnancy In 6-Second Vine [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miracle-life-6-seconds-ian-padgham-dad-be-captures-9-months-pregnancy-vine-299640", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/25/man-captures-wifes-entire-pregnancy-six-seconds.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/25/man-captures-wifes-entire-pregnancy-six-seconds.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-25T13:44:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-25T13:52:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A popular Viner captured his wife's pregnancy in a six-second vine that takes you through all the stages of the nine months."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb813\"", "article_summary": "Not only did Padgham\u2019s Vine capture his wife\u2019s physical changes of pregnancy, he was able to get more creative by adding a melodic tune.\nIan Padgham, a popular Viner with over 350,000 followers and dozens of videos, released his most endearing Vine yet: his wife Claire Pasquier\u2019s nine-month pregnancy in six seconds.\nThe short clip captures the mother\u2019s early stages of pregnancy, two frames at a time, until you see the newborn in her arms.\n\u201cWe would watch the draft coming together as the pregnancy progressed.\u201d The Vine was done by filming about two frames per month.\nThe physical changes a woman\u2019s body goes through during pregnancy were also seen in the Vine."}
