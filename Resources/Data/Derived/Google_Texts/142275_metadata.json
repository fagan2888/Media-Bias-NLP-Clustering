Bobby Rush, as well as residents and business owners, who called for more jobs and educational opportunities to help Chatham reclaim its former glory.\n\nTravis Kluska, program officer for the Community Investment Corp., an organization that works to boost investment in that specific part of the neighborhood noted the part of Chatham east of Cottage Grove Avenue has struggled with vacancies and crime.\n\nHe pointed out a particular building, 804 E. 81st St., a 20-unit building that had fallen into disrepair and was targeted by looters in front of which Jeromy Ellis was murdered in May.\n\n\"We're always wondering about how we can reclaim these buildings for the community,\" Kluska said.\n\nThat particular building is now the responsibility of Kluska's organization, after it won a housing court case to take it over. Community Investment Corp. is now looking for someone to invest in that building, something that could cost nearly $500,000.\n\nSmall projects like corner plantings go a long way toward showing those from inside and outside the neighborhood that it is worth investing in, Kluska and others at Saturday's event said. A fourth intersection is slated to get a planting later this summer.\n\n\"The corner parkways are gateways to these blocks,\" said Ald. Michelle Harris (8th), an avid gardener. \"We're here to resuscitate the local housing market.\"\n\nFor more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "description": "About 60 people turned out at a neighborhood beautification event in Chatham Saturday morning.", "application-name": "DNAinfo", "og": {"url": "https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20140607/chatham/chatham-beautification-project-seeks-boost-investment-pride", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/chicago_photo/2014/06/img6192-1402162766.jpg/extralarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "site_name": "DNAinfo Chicago", "description": "About 60 people turned out at a neighborhood beautification event in Chatham Saturday morning.", "title": "Chatham Beautification Project Seeks to Boost Investment, Pride"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"site": "@DNAinfoCHI", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "DNAinfo", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-70x70px.png", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "54902139,1379988119,575522805,108424,5519941,48600120,112261,662865465", "app_id": 153948644632011}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Chatham,Business & Economy,Health & Wellness,Real Estate,Sports & Outdoors,Community Investment Corporation,Urban Partnership Bank,Folake Kehinde,Eitan Feldman,Travis Kluska,Michelle Harris,Neighbor Works Day", "google-site-verification": "AYA-4dHbK-igtSqpqIYyKuCbHO3o3KourjkrAnfCeZc", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-150x150.png", "googletag": {"topic": "business-economy,health-wellness,real-estate,sports-outdoors", "tags": "urban-partnership-bank,community-investment-corporation", "events": "neighbor-works-day", "people": "michelle-harris,folake-kehinde,eitan-feldman,travis-kluska"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5ec6\"", "article_summary": "Beautification Project Focuses on Street Corners to Boost Pride, Investment View Full CaptionCHATHAM \u2014 There's power in planting flowers.\nCommunity Investment Corp. is now looking for someone to invest in that building, something that could cost nearly $500,000.\n\"We're always wondering about how we can reclaim these buildings for the community,\" Kluska said.\nTravis Kluska, program officer for the Community Investment Corp., an organization that works to boost investment in that specific part of the neighborhood noted the part of Chatham east of Cottage Grove Avenue has struggled with vacancies and crime.\n\"We are helping revitalize the neighborhood and bringing positive attention to these ports of reentry,\" said Eitan Feldman, owner of two apartment buildings along 81st Street."}
