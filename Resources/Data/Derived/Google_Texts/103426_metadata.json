They just added to an already precarious financial situation for the couple. Before her stay in the hospital, the Evanses were already struggling to pay off $1,100 monthly mortgage payments for their house.\n\n\u201cWhen I see her walking compared to 20 years ago, it\u2019s a lot different,\u201d Percy said in the six-part Al Jazeera documentary series Hard Earned. \u201cShe walks slowly and more cautious about her steps.\u201d\n\nAlthough insured their policy did not cover every expense and Beverly wracked up the debt since the couple declared bankruptcy after they both lost their jobs during the Great Recession.\n\nShe is far from alone. Nearly 20 percent of U.S. consumers \u2014 42.9 million people \u2014 have unpaid medical debts, according to a December 2014 report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n\n\u201cMedical debt is incurred differently than other unpaid bills, such as unpaid phone or utility bills. Medical debt can result from an event that is unpredictable and costly, such as an accident or sudden illness,\u201d the CFPB said. \u201cIn addition, consumers are often temporarily responsible for the whole bill until insurance works it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cComplaints to the CFPB indicate that many consumers do not even know they owe medical debt until they get a call from the collections agency or they discover it on their credit report.\u201d\n\nA 2014 analysis by the financial planning company NerdWallet found that health care expenses comprised 38 percent of all debt payments received by third-party agencies. About half of all overdue debt mentioned on Americans' credit reports is from medical debt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Low-income families struggle to pay off steep health care costs, even with insurance plans", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/ajam-presents-hard-earned/articles/2015/6/5/high-price-crippling-medical-debt.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/dam/ajam/images/articles/colorado_healthcare_100213.jpg", "height": 913}, "type": "article", "description": "Low-income families struggle to pay off steep health care costs, even with insurance plans", "title": "High price paid by Americans with onerous medical debt"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/dam/ajam/images/articles/colorado_healthcare_100213.jpg", "description": "Low-income families struggle to pay off steep health care costs, even with insurance plans", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "title": "High price paid by Americans with onerous medical debt"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Health Care, U.S., Medical Industry, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe066e\"", "article_summary": "About half of all overdue debt mentioned on Americans' credit reports is from medical debt.\n\u201cMedical debt is incurred differently than other unpaid bills, such as unpaid phone or utility bills.\nMedical debt can result from an event that is unpredictable and costly, such as an accident or sudden illness,\u201d the CFPB said.\nPercy Evans, 66, sat across from his wife Beverly, 65, as she grimly shuffled through her unpaid medical bills while sitting at their kitchen table.\nNearly 20 percent of U.S. consumers \u2014 42.9 million people \u2014 have unpaid medical debts, according to a December 2014 report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)."}
