Asked whether mass shootings, like the one that devastated a community college in Oregon the day before, could be averted through prayer vigils, Bush said:\n\nWe\u2019re in a difficult time in our country and I don\u2019t think that more government is necessarily the answer to this. I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s very sad to see. But I resist the notion \u2014 and I did, I had this, this challenge as governor, because we have \u2014 look, stuff happens. There\u2019s always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something, and it\u2019s not necessarily the right thing to do.\n\nAs soon as the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza reported Bush\u2019s \u201cstuff happens\u201d comment, Twitter blew up. But although the Internet is generally in a state of perpetual overreaction, this felt like one of the rare occasions when the histrionics were deserved. For nearly the 300th time just this year, someone in America had used a gun to kill or maim at least four other people. And Bush, a man with a decent shot of becoming president, did little more than shake his head, sigh, and say, \u201cGuns, boy, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nTo my surprise, though, not everyone agreed that Bush\u2019s response was egregious \u2014 and I\u2019m not just talking about Republicans. \u201cThe news media immediately initiated its gaffe sequence,\u201d snarked New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait. But because Bush uttered \u201cstuff happens\u201d in the midst of an awkward transition from gun massacres to \u201cpublic problems in general,\u201d Chait argued, labeling \u201cstuff happens\u201d as a gaffe or screw-up was unfair. The idea that \u201cevents occur and the proper response is nothing,\u201d he continued, \u201cis not always wrong,\u201d even if gun-safety supporters (including Chait) think applying it to the mass-shooting context is \u201cterribly wrong.\u201d\n\nChait\u2019s argument, in essence, was that \u201cdenying any public policy response to endemic gun violence is a completely standard position in the GOP.\u201d So, really, the only newsworthy aspect of Bush\u2019s remark was \u201cthe callousness of the wording.\u201d The content itself was ho-hum. That was certainly the way Bush felt: When a reporter asked him if he regretted the phrasing, he bristled, demanding the reporter \u201cexplain to [him] what [he] said wrong.\u201d Then, with the snippiness that has come to increasingly color his interactions with the press, Bush added, \u201cThings happen all the time. \u2018Things\u2019 \u2014 is that better?\u201d\n\nMore striking than Chait\u2019s argument, however, was the fact that the New Republic\u2019s Brian Beutler \u2014 who is far more familiar with the reality of gun violence than anyone should be, and who lacks Chait\u2019s mannered iconoclasm \u2014 agreed with it. \u201cLet\u2019s stipulate that Jeb Bush is tin-eared,\u201d Beutler wrote. \u201cEven so, his comments clearly imply that we should interpret the term \u2018stuff\u2019 as a shorthand for tragedies and other crises.\u201d Stripping \u201cstuff happens\u201d of its context, Beutler argued, \u201cmakes it seem like Bush shrugged off a mass killing as something akin to stepping in a dog pile.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is one person's assault weapon worth another's life?
