A professor at Kent State University is under an FBI investigation after posting Facebook images in support of ISIS. Julio Pino, a history professor, is an Islamic convert who once shouted "death to Israel" at a lecture by an Israeli diplomat in 2011. Pino is accused of supporting ISIS and recruiting students to join the group.

From the Washington Times:

An independent probe Tuesday turned up disturbing posts on his purported Facebook page praising Osama bin Laden and urging al Qaeda fighters to merge with the terrorist group. An independent probe Tuesday turned up disturbing posts on his purported Facebook page praising Osama bin Laden and urging al Qaeda fighters to merge with the terrorist group. “Sheik Osama (May Allah be Pleased with Him) was the greatest, and desrves (sic) praise for kicking off this jihad,” one post from an account in Julio Cesar Pino’s name begins. The post, which has since been deleted, was preserved in a screenshot by The Clarion Project, a New York-based research institute that monitors international terrorism. University spokesman Eric Mansfield told the New York Daily News that the institution had been contacted and was fully cooperating with the feds. A statement from Kent State added, “As this is an ongoing investigation, we will have no further comment. The FBI has assured Kent State that there is no threat to campus.”

Pino has been employed by the university since 1992 and is a tenured member of the faculty.

It's mind-boggling to me how a person who lives in the United States could ever say anything in support of al Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, or ISIS. It's also troubling that a person with a history of praising terrorist groups is allowed to shape the minds of young adults. For what it's worth, the majority of his reviews on the site "Rate My Professor" are not positive, and students have been encouraging their peers to not take his class for the better part of a decade.
