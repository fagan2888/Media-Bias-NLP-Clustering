I bet you can even hear the inflection of the president\u2019s voice as you read that line.\n\nOr how about our president telling us how much money his new health care law would save us? If not, let\u2019s refresh our memory:\n\n[[{\u201ctype\u201d:\u201dmedia\u201d,\u201dview_mode\u201d:\u201dmedia_large\u201d,\u201dfid\u201d:\u201d95612\u2033,\u201dattributes\u201d:{\u201calt\u201d:\u201d\u201d,\u201dclass\u201d:\u201dmedia-image\u201d,\u201dtypeof\u201d:\u201dfoaf:Image\u201d}}]]\n\nI couldn\u2019t even watch the whole thing. After a while, you just get sick of the lies.\n\nSo here\u2019s a new question for President Obama: \u201cWhere\u2019s my $2,500?\u201d\n\nThe impacts of Obamacare are still developing, but the results are not looking good so far. A county-by-county study by Forbes and the Manhattan Institute reports that the average cost for individuals went up by 49 percent, rather than going down. The people whose rates go up most are those who are young, healthy, and/or male.\n\nThe study asked, \u201cDoes the Affordable Care Act live up to its name? Does it make health insurance less expensive?\u201d You can read the detailed numbers yourself, but the answer, in 80-90 percent of U.S. counties, is a big fat no.\n\nFurther, a measure that was meant to force uninsured people to sign up for plans will instead hit a million low-income Americans with a penalty for not doing so. That\u2019s costing them more, and they still don\u2019t have affordable health care. (It\u2019s also producing more income for the federal government.)\n\nDespite all the promises, and all the \u201cresults\u201d promoted by the media and Obamacare supporters, the law is still unpopular. And it has benefitted far fewer than it was supposed to help.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get rid of bureaucrats who will say anything to get our votes and don\u2019t care about the consequences of their actions. It\u2019s time to return the government to what the Founding Fathers intended: a true representation of the people that leaves personal decisions over things like health care up to them.\n\nAbraham Lincoln said it well:\n\nThe legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do, for themselves\u2014in their separate, and individual capacities. In all that the people can individually do as well for themselves, government ought not to interfere.\n\nBecause when it does interfere, it just makes a big mess.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cc7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.\u201dEvery American remembers hearing this empty promise.\nDespite all the promises, and all the \u201cresults\u201d promoted by the media and Obamacare supporters, the law is still unpopular.\nOr how about our president telling us how much money his new health care law would save us?\nThat\u2019s costing them more, and they still don\u2019t have affordable health care.\nSo here\u2019s a new question for President Obama: \u201cWhere\u2019s my $2,500?\u201dThe impacts of Obamacare are still developing, but the results are not looking good so far."}
