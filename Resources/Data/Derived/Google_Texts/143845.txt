The Oklahoma Highway Patrol is on the scene of a fatal motorcycle crash in Tulsa. Reports say a motorcycle crashed on the Creek Turnpike near Yale.

Troopers said 39-year-old Joe Brooks Jr. of Catoosa was driving westbound on the Creek Turnpike when he went off the road, hit the ground then went about 150 feet before hitting the sound barrier wall. They said they aren't sure why he initially left the road.

The body had been thrown nearly eight-feet from the cycle, the helmet was found 16-feet away. They also said marks were seen nearly 11-feet up the wall.

Troopers said Brooks may have crashed early Wednesday morning or overnight Tuesday. They said they believe he had been down for at least 12 hours before they arrived.

Troopers said Brooks was wearing his helmet.
