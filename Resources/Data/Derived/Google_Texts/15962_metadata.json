It was the biggest expansion of the social safety net since Medicare was established in the 1960s. It more or less achieves a goal \u2014 access to health insurance for all Americans \u2014 that progressives have been trying to reach for three generations. And it is already producing dramatic results, with the percentage of uninsured Americans falling to record lows.\n\nObamacare is, however, what engineers would call a kludge: a somewhat awkward, clumsy device with lots of moving parts. This makes it more expensive than it should be, and will probably always cause a significant number of people to fall through the cracks.\n\nThe question for progressives \u2014 a question that is now central to the Democratic primary \u2014 is whether these failings mean that they should re-litigate their own biggest political success in almost half a century, and try for something better.\n\nMy answer, as you might guess, is that they shouldn\u2019t, that they should seek incremental change on health care (Bring back the public option!) and focus their main efforts on other issues \u2014 that is, that Bernie Sanders is wrong about this and Hillary Clinton is right. But the main point is that we should think clearly about why health reform looks the way it does.\n\nIf we could start from scratch, many, perhaps most, health economists would recommend single-payer, a Medicare-type program covering everyone. But single-payer wasn\u2019t a politically feasible goal in America, for three big reasons that aren\u2019t going away.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFirst, like it or not, incumbent players have a lot of power. Private insurers played a major part in killing health reform in the early 1990s, so this time around reformers went for a system that preserved their role and gave them plenty of new business.\n\nSecond, single-payer would require a lot of additional tax revenue \u2014 and we would be talking about taxes on the middle class, not just the wealthy. It\u2019s true that higher taxes would be offset by a sharp reduction or even elimination of private insurance premiums, but it would be difficult to make that case to the broad public, especially given the chorus of misinformation you know would dominate the airwaves.\n\nFinally, and I suspect most important, switching to single-payer would impose a lot of disruption on tens of millions of families who currently have good coverage through their employers. You might say that they would end up just as well off, and it might well be true for most people \u2014 although not those with especially good policies. But getting voters to believe that would be a very steep climb.\n\nWhat this means, as the health policy expert Harold Pollack points out, is that a simple, straightforward single-payer system just isn\u2019t going to happen. Even if you imagine a political earthquake that eliminated the power of the insurance industry and objections to higher taxes, you\u2019d still have to protect the interests of workers with better-than-average coverage, so that in practice single-payer, American style, would be almost as kludgy as Obamacare.\n\nWhich brings me to the Affordable Care Act, which was designed to bypass these obstacles. It was careful to preserve and even enlarge the role of private insurers. Its measures to cover the uninsured rely on a combination of regulation and subsidies, rather than simply on an expansion of government programs, so that the on-budget cost is limited \u2014 and can, in fact, be covered without raising middle-class taxes. Perhaps most crucially, it leaves employer-based insurance intact, so that the great majority of Americans have experienced no disruption, in fact no change in their health-care experience.\n\nEven so, achieving this reform was a close-run thing: Democrats barely got it through during the brief period when they controlled Congress. Is there any realistic prospect that a drastic overhaul could be enacted any time soon \u2014 say, in the next eight years? No.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nYou might say that it\u2019s still worth trying. But politics, like life, involves trade-offs.\n\nThere are many items on the progressive agenda, ranging from an effective climate change policy, to making college affordable for all, to restoring some of the lost bargaining power of workers. Making progress on any of these items is going to be a hard slog, even if Democrats hold the White House and, less likely, retake the Senate. Indeed, room for maneuver will be limited even if a post-Trump Republican Party moves away from the scorched-earth opposition it offered President Obama.\n\nSo progressives must set some priorities. And it\u2019s really hard to see, given this picture, why it makes any sense to spend political capital on a quixotic attempt at a do-over, not of a political failure, but of health reform \u2014 their biggest victory in many years.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160118032108, "twitter": {"description": "Should progressives re-litigate Obamacare?
