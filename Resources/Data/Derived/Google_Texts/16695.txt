Deductibles in PPACA plans were already high in 2014. And this year, they’re only getting higher — at least in the most popular plans.

That’s the overall consensus from HealthPocket analysis, which found that the average deductible for 2015 bronze-level policies, the lowest tiered plan, is about $5,181 for individuals — up from $5,081 last year, and $10,545 for families.
