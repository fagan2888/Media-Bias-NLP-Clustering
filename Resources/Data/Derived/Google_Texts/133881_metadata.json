His campaign isn\u2019t built on small-government and constitutionalist ideals that are the foundation of the tea party movement that blossomed in the United States in 2009.\n\nNevertheless, top activists see the plainspoken and combative Mr. Trump as a Ronald Reagan or John Wayne figure who they believe can unite conservative voters to win the White House and put the country back on track.\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump stuns rivals with poll numbers, supports mosque surveillance and waterboarding\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really view him as a true tea party candidate,\u201d said Ken Crow, a tea party activist in Iowa who is supporting Mr. Trump. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a history of being real conservative on a lot of issues, but we do see him as probably the only one who can save the country. That\u2019s why the support level is what it is for him.\u201d\n\nMost tea party leaders named Sen. Ted Cruz as the tea party favorite in the presidential race. And yet the movement hasn\u2019t coalesced behind the Texas Republican.\n\nMr. Trump edged out Mr. Cruz for tea party support, 32 percent to 30 percent, in a Quinnipiac University Poll earlier this month. It was an improvement for Mr. Cruz since September, when Mr. Trump topped him among tea party members 37 percent to 19 percent.\n\nSimilar to other recent surveys, the poll showed Mr. Trump leading the race overall, with 24 percent of support among likely Republican voters, and Mr. Cruz trailing in fourth place with 13 percent.\n\nThere also has been a subtle shift in the tea party\u2019s focus from issues such as repealing Obamacare to addressing illegal immigration, which coincides with Mr. Trump making a crackdown on illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign.\n\nThe Quinnipiac Poll identified immigration as the No. 2 issue for tea party voters behind the economy and jobs.\n\nThe solid tea party backing, and a flood of newly engaged conservative voters that Mr. Trump has brought into the process, have kept him out in front since he entered the race in June.\n\nPart of the reason Mr. Crow and other tea party voters gravitated to Mr. Trump is because they view him as more electable than Mr. Cruz, who has been vilified by the left since his election to the U.S. Senate in the 2012 tea party wave.\n\n\u201cHe is the man that most of the membership of the tea party recognizes as the one that can get elected and get the job done,\u201d Mr. Crow said. \u201cHe\u2019s John Wayne. He\u2019s not going to take crap off of anybody. America is going, \u2018Yeah, we finally have John Wayne back.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe success of the tea party comes from not having a leader,\u201d said Sal Russo, founder and chief strategist of Tea Party Express.\n\nHe said that Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t leading the movement but was expanding the conservative base in a way similar to Reagan, appealing not to voters\u2019 ideology but to their hunger for a better life.\n\nRecalling how Reagan often talked about how the American public doesn\u2019t look at candidates through an ideological lens but in terms of whether the candidate will lift up or bring down the quality of life in America, he said that Mr. Trump had the same political instincts and demonstrated it with his vow to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur voters are not that much different from the average voter. And so there\u2019s not a big difference between what you see in the national polls and what you see among people who support tea party ideas,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Russo pushed back against pundits who have pronounced that the tea party\u2019s influence is fading, citing polls such as a recent Public Religion Research Institute survey that found the number of self-identified tea party members has dropped from 11 percent in 2010 to 6 percent today.\n\n\u201cPeople point out how few people self-identify as tea party. I would say just look at the election results,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that [voters] are responding to tea party issues and electing more conservatives than we\u2019ve elected since 1926 says it is a potent and powerful movement, and it still is.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to Republican wins in 2014 that gave the party the largest majority in the House since President Calvin Coolidge occupied the White House.\n\nWhile arguing that Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t a true tea party conservative and wasn\u2019t taking over the movement, the tea party leaders also maintained that he had been good for the cause.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s entry into this presidential campaign and the policies [for] the most part that he has advocated are a tremendous benefit to our nation as a whole. And I say this because a lot of the issues Donald Trump has taken a stand on are positions that our leaders in Washington have failed us on,\u201d said Joe Dugan, founder and executive producer of the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump, because of his celebrity, because of his wealth, he attracts a lot of attention,\u201d said Mr. Dugan. \u201cThe mainstream media covers everything he says. And we in the tea party have been shouting out this message and begging for years for someone to listen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tea party activists refuse to claim Donald Trump as one of their own and swear he hasn't become the de facto leader of the movement, but they still cheer on tea party members who rally behind the billionaire businessman to help keep him at the front of the race for the Republican presidential nomination.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Tea party activists refuse to claim Donald Trump as one of their own and swear he hasn\u2019t become the de facto leader of the movement, but they still cheer on tea party members who rally behind the billionaire businessman to help keep him at the front of the race for the Republican presidential nomination.", "title": "Donald Trump enjoys support of tea party movement that refuses to fully embrace him", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/22/donald-trump-enjoys-support-of-tea-party-movement-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/22/Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/22/Trump.jpg", "description": "Tea party activists refuse to claim Donald Trump as one of their own and swear he hasn't become the de facto leader of the movement, but they still cheer on tea party members who rally behind the bill", "card": "summary", "title": "Donald Trump enjoys support of tea party movement that refuses to full"}, "Author": "S.A.
