VCU CNS, CC BY-NC 2.0\n\nOne Chinese hospital called upon adult female virgins to donate their blood so that tests of the human papillomavirus (HPV) can be performed more effectively against control samples, China Daily reports. Despite the hospital\u2019s adamancy that the tests are legitimate, reactions to the request have been mixed.\n\nThe request for 100 virgin women aged 18-24 first appeared on online bulletin board systems last week at Peking University and Beijing Normal University. Researchers at Peking University Cancer Hospital said the need for testing HPV against virgin blood was necessary because women who haven\u2019t had sex face a far lower risk for contracting the disease, which stands out as the leading cause of cervical cancer. A serum antibody to HPV can come only from women who have never been infected, experts say, making virgins prime candidates.\n\n\"Male virgins are not needed, just females, how is this science?\" wrote one user of Sina Weibo, a social media service akin to Twitter and a lively forum for popular opinion, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nSimilar reactions have sprouted up around the Internet, to which the hospital has replied by calling the criticisms shortsighted and having essentially missed the point of the request.\n\n\"It's in line with international practice to collect female virgins' blood samples, which serve as negative control substances in HPV research,\u201d spokeswoman Guan Jiuping told China Daily, \u201cgiven that the risk of contracting HPV is low among women who have never had sex.\u201d\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI), with more than 40 types that can infect one\u2019s genital area and mouth. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 90 percent of cases go away by themselves; however, the disease is so common, nearly all sexually active men and women will contract at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives.\n\nTesting for HPV is available to help screen women over 30 for cervical cancer. Men, children, and women under 30 should not receive these tests. And despite the disease\u2019s often mild, temporary nature, no general test exists to check a person\u2019s \u201cHPV status.\u201d Children should receive HPV vaccinations around the age of 11 or 12.\n\nRoughly 79 million Americans are currently infected with the disease. In addition to being the leading cause of cervical cancer, which sees 12,000 new diagnoses each year in the United States, HPV can also cause vulvar cancers, penile cancers, anal cancers, and oropharyngeal (throat) cancers.\n\nWhen asked how doctors would verify the virgin donors\u2019 blood, hospital officials said they would take the doctors\u2019 word for it. Opponents of the request have pointed to the unnecessary premium that the hospital is placing on virginity, as Chinese culture has often prized a woman\u2019s virginal status before marriage. The market for artificial hymens and restorative surgeries to mimic virginity among women has grown in recent years, according to Agence France-Presse. Nevertheless, Guan said the criticisms do not have their place in the current situation.\n\n\"Too much attention to sensitive words like 'virgin' and 'sex' is not necessary in this context,\" she said, conceding that the hospital will seek to improve its communication of touchy issues in the future.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chinese hospital, virgin blood, female virgins, hpv, human papillomavirus, cervical cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "One Chinese hospital has requested female virgins donate their blood so that tests of HPV can have more effective control groups.", "title": "Chinese Hospital Requests Virgin Blood For HPV Study: Are Critics Being Too Sensitive?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chinese-hospital-asks-virgin-blood-run-tests-hpv-calls-criticisms-insulting-women-not-necessary", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/16/hpv-vaccine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One Chinese hospital has requested female virgins donate their blood so that tests of HPV can have more effective control groups.", "title": "Chinese Hospital Requests Virgin Blood For HPV Study: Are Critics Being Too Sensitive?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chinese-hospital-asks-virgin-blood-run-tests-hpv-calls-criticisms-insulting-women-not-necessary", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/16/hpv-vaccine.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/16/hpv-vaccine.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2013-09-16T12:13:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-16T12:13:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "One Chinese hospital has requested female virgins donate their blood so that tests of HPV can have more effective control groups."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9bd0\"", "article_summary": "One Chinese hospital has requested female virgins donate their blood so that tests of HPV can have more effective control groups.\nWhen asked how doctors would verify the virgin donors\u2019 blood, hospital officials said they would take the doctors\u2019 word for it.\nThe request for 100 virgin women aged 18-24 first appeared on online bulletin board systems last week at Peking University and Beijing Normal University.\nA serum antibody to HPV can come only from women who have never been infected, experts say, making virgins prime candidates.\nVCU CNS, CC BY-NC 2.0One Chinese hospital called upon adult female virgins to donate their blood so that tests of the human papillomavirus (HPV) can be performed more effectively against control samples, China Daily reports."}
