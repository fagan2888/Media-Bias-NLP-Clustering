She found it much quicker, easier and harder to mess up than cat eyes and other liner trends. Join the conversation on Instagram (instagram.com/heckela) and let her know your favorite fast-makeup tricks. \u2022 Get additional information about Suzanne Blons at suzanneblonsmakeup.com\n\nMakeup tips from a pro Suzanne Blons has learned a lot of shortcuts and makeup tricks through the years. Here are a few of her favorite ways to make a big cosmetic impact fast: \u2022 Use ultra-light sunscreen makeup: Instead of all-over foundation, Blons applies Chanel's Vitalumiere Aqua around her eyes, nose and mouth, as well as concealer where needed. You need only a small drop of this light foundation. \u2022 Warm up with bronzer: Lightly apply bronzer under your cheekbones and a little on your forehead. \u2022 Get facials: \"The basis of everything is beautiful skin, especially here (in Colorado) with it being so dry,\" Blons says. \"If you take care of your skin, you don't need gobs of makeup.\" She gets a facial once a month at Creme de la Creme (boulderfacecare.com) in Boulder. \u2022 Line your waterline: Instead of applying eye liner above and below your lash line, use a waterproof pencil to line right inside your lashes. This frames your eyes in a crisp way and looks natural. If you have green eyes, use purple or rich brown; for blue eyes, navy or warm brown; for brown eyes, any color. If you're older than 40, line only your upper lid. Avoid black, unless you are African-American. \"I've done this to women and their whole face comes alive,\" says Blons, who recommends waterproof gel pencils from Colorado-based LipBar (lipbar.com).\n\nHillary Clinton sits down in your chair. You have five minutes and a makeup case.\n\nThis isn't the setup to a joke, or even a hypothetical. This is Suzanne Blons' life.\n\nBlons, who lives in Superior, is a makeup artist and stylist for television and publications. Before moving to Colorado, she did the faces of Al Gore, Barbara Bush, Bob Dole, Jesse Jackson and Larry King, to name a few. Now in Colorado, she has worked with the likes of Peyton Manning, although when she got hired for the gig, it took her a minute to remember who he was.\n\nShe lived in Europe for 15 years; soccer is more her style.\n\nWhen Manning sat down in her makeup chair, she says she had it all planned out.\n\n\"I wanted to joke that I was thrilled with all of his home runs,\" she says. \"I had two minutes to make him up, and he didn't say hardly two words to me. That's how it is. I wanted to say something, but I didn't get to.\"\n\nSo goes the life of a celebrity stylist.\n\nBlons says she always is ready to disarm and charm her clients with friendly banter; her ability to get along with even the biggest divas \u2014 she won't names names \u2014 while still maintaining a level of professionalism and self-respect is what she attributes to her success in the industry, even more so than her makeup skills.\n\nStylist to the stars, Suzanne Blons, of Superior.

You've got to be able to deal with and work with people,\" Blons says. \"I know loads of phenomenal makeup artists who can't do a collaborative environment with big egos. It's a tough gig. You've got to be able to dance that dance.\"\n\nThe work is also a total whirlwind, Blons says. She typically has about five minutes to polish up a face for the screen.\n\nShe approaches makeup methodologically. First, she applies concealer around the eyes and covers blemishes. Then she highlights, typically the eyebrow bone and lips. Then she adds blush, to prevent people from looking washed out on camera. Eyes are last, if there's time. A simple crease color, and off the client goes.\n\nBlons first learned her quick-hit tricks in front of the screen. She worked as a professional model in the '80s. She was the \"Charlie Girl\" for the popular fragrance. You also might recognize her face from Revlon advertisements: In her early 20s, she was the face of Revlon for two years before she decided to quit.\n\n\"I just didn't enjoy it. I burned out,\" she says. \"I'm fit but not skinny. You see models \u2014 they want you bone thin, and I'm 5-10, size 8. In the modeling world, that's obese. I had a hard time with that.\"\n\nShe decided what she enjoyed the most about modeling was the production and being part of a team, so she began studying makeup. She worked for five different cosmetic lines, including doing management for MAC Cosmetics for four years, and trained under the head makeup artist at CNN. That's where she got her political ins.\n\nToday, she works with the Wilhelmina Denver agency and keeps busy as a stylist for Gaiam TV.\n\nAimee Heckel: 303-473-1359, heckela@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/aimeemay", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_28534160/makeup-artist-from-superior-has-worked-likes-hillary", "sailthru.author": "By Aimee Heckel \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28534160:view"}, "startDate": "2015-07-26T06:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "She once was in front of the camera with Revlon, but Suzanne Blons takes pride in making other more photogenic.", "title": "Makeup artist from Superior has worked with the likes of Hillary Clinton, Peyton Manning", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_28534160/makeup-artist-from-superior-has-worked-likes-hillary", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0724/20150724__26DCPHECw~3.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Lifestyles", "modificationDate": "2015-07-24T15:30:59-0600", "endDate": "2025-07-24T14:18:45-0600", "news_keywords": "Lifestyles, Lifestyles news, Boulder Colorado Lifestyles news, Boulder Colorado news, Lifestyles Boulder news, Lifestyles Colorado news, US Lifestyles news, world Lifestyles news.", "byline": "By Aimee HeckelStaff", "pubDate": "2015-07-24T15:32:03-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-26T06:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Makeup artist from Superior has worked with the likes of Hillary Clinton, Peyton Manning", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0724/20150724__26DCPHECw~3_300.jpg", "description": "She once was in front of the camera with Revlon, but Suzanne Blons takes pride in making other more photogenic.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_28534160/makeup-artist-from-superior-has-worked-likes-hillary", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "She once was in front of the camera with Revlon, but Suzanne Blons takes pride in making other more photogenic.", "title": "Makeup artist from Superior has worked with the likes of Hillary Clinton, Peyton Manning"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0724/20150724__26DCPHECw~3.jpg"}, "article_summary": "\u2022 Get additional information about Suzanne Blons at suzanneblonsmakeup.comMakeup tips from a pro Suzanne Blons has learned a lot of shortcuts and makeup tricks through the years.\nStylist to the stars, Suzanne Blons, of Superior.\nThis is Suzanne Blons' life.\nBlons, who lives in Superior, is a makeup artist and stylist for television and publications.\nShe worked for five different cosmetic lines, including doing management for MAC Cosmetics for four years, and trained under the head makeup artist at CNN."}
