In 2008, Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich, who had served a tumultuous single term as mayor of Cleveland in the 70\u2019s, introduced articles of impeachment against Bush and Vice President Cheney, charging them in 35 separate articles with disobeying international law, taking the country to war with misleading and false information, and a host of violations in how the war was conducted.\n\n\u201cI brought it with no small degree of trepidation,\u201d Kucinich recalled in a lengthy phone conversation with the Daily Beast. \u201cHe was always personally very decent to me. This is not something I took any pleasure in. I thought it was important for the American people to be aware we were sent into war based on falsehoods.\u201d\n\nBased on his experience as a lawmaker who sought impeachment as a remedy, Kucinich is candid about warning Republicans what they would unleash, and why launching impeachment proceedings against President Obama would be bad for the country, and bad for the Republican Party.\n\nKucinich\u2019s lonely quest was short-circuited by the Democratic leadership, which used the media to convey the message. Asked if Speaker Pelosi \u201cshut him down,\u201d Kucinich said no: \u201cI was never asked not to proceed. They made it clear in the media it wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders today are doing the same thing, using the media to tell their members there will be no impeachment. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d says Kucinich. \u201cYou have to look at it practically.\u201d It\u2019s not politically smart, it\u2019s not in the interest of the country, and it remains to be seen if the articles that would be brought forward are sufficient, he says.\n\nHe hears lots of loose talk but no apparent understanding of the arduous process, the hearings that would have to scrutinize each article, and the partisan feelings that would be unleashed on all sides. Is that worth it for a president who will be out the door in two years? Do the Republicans want to alienate important constituencies they will need in 2016? \u201cImpeachment is a riveting event in the history of the country,\u201d Kucinich says. \u201cEverything else stops, it freezes the country. It\u2019s not in the Republican Party\u2019s interest to do that.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s always possible for any member to introduce an article of impeachment, and you only need one, you don\u2019t need a hundred, Kucinich says, he doesn\u2019t see Republicans being willing to de-stabilize the government\u2014\u201cand if they go forward with impeachment they would be seen as de-stabilizing the government. That\u2019s why you\u2019re not going to see a shutdown,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey would be seen as unable to govern.\u201d\n\nAnd if the GOP wants to take the presidency in 2016, an impeachment effort or a shutdown \u201cwould raise questions about whether the Republican Party has the ability to put a steady hand on the wheel of the ship of state,\u201d says Kucinich, though he adds the qualifier that if a presidential act surfaces that is \u201cso egregious it can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d that they have act, so be it.\n\nKucinich says he talked with \u201chundreds of people who understand the Constitution and the historical meaning of the facts\u201d to build his case. \u201cThis took years, it was not a kneejerk reaction to one thing. It was years in the making.\u201d At one point he had 100 counts before winnowing it down to 35.\n\n\u201cI was not shopping it like some bill that deserves support,\u201d he recalls, emphasizing it was a legal document that needed to be above partisan politics. Asked what kind of support he got from rank-and-file Democrats, he paused before replying with a hearty laugh. \u201cI had a lot of quiet support, very quiet.\u201d\n\nAsked if he sees any parallels between the articles he filed and what the Republicans might be contemplating, he said no, that his suit grew out of his involvement in challenging the Iraq war, and the false justification for that war, and he says he felt no personal animus against Bush. The Republicans he believes are driven at least in part by their intense dislike of Obama.\n\nMotivation aside, a recent poll about executive power and whether Obama has gone too far and should be impeached mirrors the results of polls that asked the same questions in 2006 about President Bush. Then, 48 percent said Bush had gone too far, 34 percent said he was about right, and 14 percent said not far enough. The numbers for Obama are 48 percent too far, 29 percent about right, and 21 percent not far enough.\n\nIn September 2006, 30 percent said Bush should be impeached and 69 percent said they didn\u2019t feel that way. For Obama, 29 percent say he should be impeached; 70 percent don\u2019t feel that way.\n\nRepublican efforts to defund the implementation of Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration, and the party\u2019s ongoing attempt to deny sufficient funds to implement Obamacare are rooted in the separation of powers. \u201cAnytime Congress funds the actions or the policies of a president, it\u2019s endorsing those policies,\u201d Kucinich says.\n\nNancy Pelosi voted against the Iraq war but as Speaker of the House, she backed President Bush\u2019s requests to fund the war, often framing it as supporting the troops. She held that position despite considerable opposition from the anti-war left, including protests outside her home in San Francisco. Reminded of Pelosi\u2019s position, Kucinich said with measured calm, \u201cWith all due respect to Representative Pelosi, whom I\u2019ve known forever and I consider a friend, PLEASE\u2014You support the troops by bringing them home, not keeping them in the field on a mission that was not based on fact.\n\n\u201cOne of the great pretenses in American politics is that we stay at war to support the troops, That is on its face so fallacious and so cynical and dismissive of the troops that it stands as a glaring admission of complicity in the war. Support the troops, yeah, keep them in danger, will you be there when the troops come home and need jobs and health care?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "eleanorclift"}, "keywords": "Dennis Kucinich, Impeachment, Republican Party, Barack Obama, u.s. poli, George W Bush", "publicationDate": 201412051045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Dennis Kucinich, Impeachment, Republican Party, Barack Obama, US Politics, George W Bush", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Repubs Should Take It From Kucinich: Impeachment Isnt Worth It", "tags": "entity:person/dennis_kucinich,entity:event/impeachment,entity:organization/republican_party,entity:person/barack_obama,topic:politics,entity:person/george_w_bush", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The ex-congressman from Cleveland brought 35 articles against Bush and Cheney but says now that the Republicans would be mad to proceed.", "title": "Repubs Should Take It From Kucinich: Impeachment Isn\u2019t Worth It", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/05/repubs-should-take-it-from-kucinich-impeachment-isn-t-worth-it.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/12/05/repubs-should-take-it-from-kucinich-impeachment-isn-t-worth-it/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1421875888365.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "The ex-congressman from Cleveland brought 35 articles against Bush and Cheney but says now that the Republicans would be mad to proceed.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Eleanor Clift", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-12-05T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/eleanor-clifthtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/12/05/repubs-should-take-it-from-kucinich-impeachment-isn-t-worth-it", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Repubs Should Take It From Kucinich: Impeachment Isn\u2019t Worth It\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/05/repubs-should-take-it-from-kucinich-impeachment-isn-t-worth-it.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/12/05/repubs-should-take-it-from-kucinich-impeachment-isn-t-worth-it/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47395862.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/12/05/repubs-should-take-it-from-kucinich-impeachment-isn-t-worth-it\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-12-05T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Eleanor Clift\",\"tags\":[\"dennis_kucinich\",\"impeachment\",\"republican_party\",\"barack_obama\",\"politics\",\"george_w_bush\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/e/eleanor-clift", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "\u201cImpeachment is a riveting event in the history of the country,\u201d Kucinich says.\nPresident Bush called him \u201cMayor,\u201d and they got alone fine, meeting some nine times mostly on education reform before the 9/11 attacks changed the focus of Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\u201cI brought it with no small degree of trepidation,\u201d Kucinich recalled in a lengthy phone conversation with the Daily Beast.\nAsked if Speaker Pelosi \u201cshut him down,\u201d Kucinich said no: \u201cI was never asked not to proceed.\nSupport the troops, yeah, keep them in danger, will you be there when the troops come home and need jobs and health care?\u201d"}
