SEPs were created under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to help people sign up outside of the regular open-enrollment period to account for life-changing events, like the birth of a child.\n\nBut insurers have vehemently objected to how SEPs were being used, and their number, declaring that individuals signing up during the special buying windows were disproportionately sicker than regular open enrollment sign-ups. Some, they said, even gamed the system by refusing to pay premiums after receiving health care (HPW 1/18/16, p. 1). In response, HealthCare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan on a Jan. 19 blog announced a realignment of the SEPs and killed off six of them, like SEPs for consumers who enrolled with too much in advance payments of the premium tax credit because of a redundant or duplicate policy or consumers who were affected by an error in the treatment of Social Security income for tax dependents (HPW 1/25/16, p. 7).\n\nBut health insurers remained adamant that more needed to be done. And in a new Oliver Wyman report for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans released on Feb. 23, a day before CMS acted on verification, the industry lobby said the proof of the danger of SEPs was clear. In the report, Wyman said 20% of active exchange enrollees at the end of 2014 were people who enrolled during a SEP. And per-member per-month (PMPM) claim costs during 2014 for individuals enrolled during a SEP were 10% higher than for those who enrolled during the regular open-enrollment window. Further, the report said, PMPM claim costs during 2014 for individuals who enrolled during a SEP were 24% higher on average for the first three months of enrollment versus the regular open-enrollment sign-ups. That first-three-month difference rose to 41% for 2015, Wyman said.\n\nConsumers Told to Prove Their Case\n\nNow, under the new SEP confirmation process unveiled by Counihan on Feb. 24, all \u201cconsumers applying through the most common special enrollment periods will need to submit documentation to verify their eligibility to use an SEP. This represents a major overhaul of the SEP process.\u201d\n\nCounihan said SEPs remain in place for people who lose health insurance during the year or who experience qualifying life changes. \u201cThis change in HealthCare.gov\u2019s special enrollment period process does not restrict anyone\u2019s access to a special enrollment period who is rightfully able to enroll in coverage. But consumers will need to be sure to provide sufficient documentation to establish their eligibility,\u201d he said. \u201cIf an individual doesn\u2019t respond to our notices, they could be found ineligible to enroll in Marketplace coverage and could lose their insurance.\u201d\n\nCMS and the exchange will seek feedback from stakeholders over the next few weeks. \u201cWe welcome feedback and suggestions, which can be sent to SEP@cms.hhs.gov,\u201d Counihan added.\n\nMoreover, it is not just the feds who are acting on SEPs. The largest state-run exchange, Covered California, on Feb. 18 reviewed the issue during a board meeting where staff presented a proposal to make consumers provide documentation, much like HealthCare.gov is doing. The marketplace\u2019s board of directors is expected to vote on the proposal in April, and, if approved, it would take effect in June. According to the staff proposal, SEP members in Covered California have between 15% and 50% higher costs per month than open-enrollment period members in the exchange\u2019s four largest plans.\n\nView the AHIP report at http://tinyurl.com/hbjb47g and the CMS announcement at http://tinyurl.com/hf6bpsf.\n\n\u00a9 2016 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
