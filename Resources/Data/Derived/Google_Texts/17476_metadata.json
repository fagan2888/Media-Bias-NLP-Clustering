Andrew Cuomo went down to the wire on more than 70 bills that required his signature or veto by midnight.\n\nAmong the more notable vetoes were two measures meant to enhance the public\u2019s understanding of the inner workings of government: As the TU\u2019s Rex Smith recently wrote, one of the measures would have heightened the potential consequences for government entities that ignore state Freedom of Information Law by commanding that a judge \u201cshall\u201d award legal fees to plaintiffs seeking documents. The other would reduce the amount of time government can delay release by appealing a court ruling.\n\nIn his veto message, Cuomo called the bills \u201cmyopic in their scope\u201d because as currently structured, FOIL law is more rigorous on the executive branch than on the Legislature. (This point was part of Cuomo\u2019s I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I? response to legislative criticisms of his administration\u2019s expansion of a 90-day automatic email deletion policy across executive agencies; under withering pressure, the administration dropped the policy last spring.)\n\n\u201cAs I stated repeatedly, any reform to the state\u2019s FOIL laws must apply uniformly and equitably to all parties, and ensure that both legislative and executive branches of state government are subject to the same FOIL provisions,\u201d Cuomo wrote. \u201cTo that end, I will be advancing comprehensive FOIL reform in the next legislative session that applies equally to the Executive and the Legislature, improves transparency, and increases accountability.\u201d\n\nThe governor also argued that both bills would have impeded judicial discretion in transparency cases.\n\nCuomo also vetoed a bill that would restrain the State Liquor Authority from taking disciplinary action against a New York licensee for violations of other states\u2019 liquor laws until regulators in those states had completed their own disciplinary actions against those violators. The measure was inspired by SLA\u2019s pursuit of the Colonie retailer Empire Wine, which is August 2014 was cited for shipping to consumers in more than a dozen states where such shipments are illegal.\n\n\u201cI am fully committed to advancing and promoting New York\u2019s alcoholic beverage industry,\u201d Cuomo wrote in his veto message. \u201cHowever, signing this bill would jeopardize the State\u2019s achievements by sending a clear signal that New York is a haven for entities intent on breaking other states\u2019 laws, avoiding other states\u2019 legitimately imposed taxes and regulations, and selling to minors with impunity.\u201d\n\n\u201d \u2026 However, I have consistently stated that portions of (state Alcoholic Beverage Control Law) need to be amended for modern-day business practices, specifically regarding E-commerce. Accordingly, I am directing representative, interested stakeholder, and advocates to review and suggest changes to the law. I am also directing SLA to work collaboratively with liquor authorities in other states to address these issues and propose recommendations for legal interstate sales.\u201d\n\nAssemblyman Phil Steck of Colonie, who sponsored the bill with Long Island Republican Sen. Phil Boyle, expressed his disappointment in a statement.\n\n\u201cI had hoped that our Governor would join me in recognizing the need to guard against excessive accumulation of power by our administrative agencies,\u201d Steck wrote. \u201cBusinesses should not have to spend tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees fighting agencies that have overstepped their bounds. This is destructive of democracy and of people\u2019s faith in their government. While corruption may inspire more headlines, this problem should also be the focus of reform efforts.\u201d\n\nCuomo also vetoed a bill that would have swapped out the word \u201cfailing\u201d for \u201cstruggling\u201d in the definition of the schools across the state that are, uh, challenged in terms of students\u2019 performances.\n\nCuomo noted that the bill failed to amend the terms in the $75 million appropriation for the program meant to deal with \u201cfailing\u201d schools, which could lead to inconsistent definitions. Also, \u201cI do not believe in making isolated changes outside of a larger conversation about our State\u2019s commitment to maximizing student achievement at these schools,\u201d the governor wrote.\n\nIn pet-related legislation, the governor vetoed a bill that would have exempted hunting dogs from the definition of pets illegally \u201crunning at large,\u201d a change that Cuomo said could create hassles for property owners confronted by hunting dogs on their land and local law enforcement who would have to respond to such cases.\n\nThe full accounting of bills acted upon, with approvals first:\n\nChapter 518, Approval #14\n\nA836 Gunther (MS) \u2014 Relates to training for staff in residential mental health treatment units programs inside correctional facilities\n\nSame as S 633 CARLUCCI Chapter 519\n\nA1233A Paulin (MS) \u2014 Authorizes broadcasting of open meetings of an agency or department\n\nSame as S 76-A GALLIVAN Chapter 520, Approval #15\n\nA2409 Rodriguez \u2014 Relates to conditions for granting scaffolding permit renewals on construction projects involving public housing provided by the New York city housing authority\n\nSame as S 5369 PERKINS Chapter 521\n\nA2458A Bronson \u2014 Relates to fuel gas transmission lines\n\nSame as S 71-A GALLIVAN Chapter 522\n\nA2801 Pretlow \u2014 Provides for the payment of the salary, wages, medical and hospital expenses of any city of Yonkers detention officer injured in the line of duty\n\nSame as S 4134 STEWART-COUSINS Chapter 523\n\nA4487A Ramos (MS) \u2014 Requires annual reports to contain information specific to veteran-owned small businesses\n\nSame as S 656-A KENNEDY Chapter 524\n\nA5317B Braunstein \u2014 Relates to publicly accessible collection bins\n\nSame as S 5893-B LANZA Chapter 525\n\nA5333 Abbate \u2014 Provides a procedure for determining suspensions and demotions of members of police agencies upon abolition or reduction of positions\n\nSame as S 4559 GOLDEN Chapter 526\n\nA5519C Gunther \u2014 Exempts fire vehicles from the weight restrictions of other vehicles\n\nSame as S 4278-C CROCI Chapter 527\n\nA5653B Gunther \u2014 Relates to fees for registration and reregistration of an agricultural trailer\n\nSame as S 4241-B RITCHIE Chapter 528\n\nA6191 Abinanti \u2014 Authorizes the county of Westchester to issue certain bonds without the need for a referendum but subject to a public hearing\n\nSame as S 4486 STEWART-COUSINS Chapter 529\n\nA6265 Kaminsky (MS) \u2014 Relates to the use of expert affidavits in summary judgment motions\n\nSame as S 5188 BONACIC Chapter 530\n\nA6941 McDonald (MS) \u2014 Relates to the qualifications of certain county probation officer directors\n\nSame as S 4757 BRESLIN Chapter 531\n\nA7462A Goldfeder \u2014 Authorizes the commissioner of motor vehicles to waive certain requirements relating to junk and salvage vehicles\n\nSame as S 4957-A ROBACH Chapter 532, Approval #16\n\nA7487 Cusick \u2014 Requires the issuance of certificates of occupancy, in the city of New York, for certain one and two family residences on an unmapped street\n\nSame as S 3472-A LANZA Chapter 533\n\nA7547 Abbate (MS) \u2014 Relates to allowing members of the NYSLPFRS to receive credit for service rendered with Metro-North, the L.I.
