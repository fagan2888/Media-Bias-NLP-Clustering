Ted Cruz\u2019s 21-hour talk-a-thon and President Obama\u2019s joint appearance with former President Clinton will keep us busy for a while, but so far we\u2019ve seen our share of false, misleading and not-quite-right statements:\n\nCruz falsely claimed that the spouses of 15,000 UPS employees will be \u201cleft without health insurance\u201d and forced into \u201can exchange with no employer subsidy.\u201d UPS is dropping coverage for spouses only if they can get insurance with their own employer.\n\nObama greatly exaggerated when he credited the health care law for bending the cost curve on health care spending. Experts say the down economy is the overwhelming reason that national health care spending has been growing at historically slow rates in recent years.\n\nCruz said the \u201cIRS employees union has asked to be exempted from Obamacare.\u201d Not so. The union wants its workers to be treated like any other worker with employer-provided health insurance. It opposes a GOP bill that it says, contrary to law, would \u201ctake coverage away from employees who already receive it through their employers.\u201d\n\nCruz said the unemployment rate for black teens \u201cis over 10 times higher than it is for college graduates \u2014 38.2 percent.\u201d True, but that\u2019s comparing apples to oranges. The unemployment rate for white teens, aged 16 to 19, is also high, at 20.5 percent. There\u2019s still a racial disparity, but the rate is nearly double, not 10 times higher.\n\nCruz cited an outdated quote from Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, to back up his claim that Obamacare is slowing job growth. Zandi told us the slowdown in job growth at small businesses is \u201cno longer the case.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul wrongly argued that \u201ceverybody is going to pay more\u201d for health insurance under the law. The fact is, some will pay more and some will pay less. Some currently uninsured Americans will pay little or nothing because of the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid.\n\nCruz said Obama promised three-and-a-half years ago \u2014 in 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed \u2014 that premiums \u201cwould drop $2,500\u2033 for the average family by the end of his first term. That\u2019s not exactly what the president said or when he said it.\n\nAnalysis\n\nCruz, the freshman senator from Texas, commandeered the Senate floor for 21 hours in a blistering attack on the Affordable Care Act. He even took a swipe at fact-checkers, calling our craft \u201ca particularly pernicious bit of yellow journalism that has cropped up that lets journalists be editorial writers and pretend they are talking about objective facts.\u201d That\u2019s his opinion, and he\u2019s entitled to it. But, as Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, people are not entitled to \u201ctheir own facts,\u201d and that would include Cruz and Obama.\n\nSo, let\u2019s see how they did in sticking to the facts.\n\nUPS Spouses \u2018Left Without Health Insurance\u2019?\n\nCruz, whose speech began the afternoon of Sept. 24, falsely claimed that the spouses of 15,000 UPS employees will be \u201cleft without health insurance\u201d and forced into \u201can exchange with no employer subsidy.\u201d UPS is dropping coverage for spouses only if they can get insurance with their own employer.\n\nCruz: Just a few weeks ago UPS sent a letter to some 15,000 employees saying: We are dropping spousal health insurance because of ObamaCare. That is 15,000 UPS employees who had insurance for their husbands and wives, and suddenly those husbands and wives are left without health insurance and being told: Go on an exchange with no employer subsidy.\n\nThis misrepresents the impact that the UPS decision will have on spouses. It\u2019s true that UPS in August informed its employees that as of Jan. 1, 2014, it would no longer extend health insurance coverage to \u201cworking spouses\u201d who are eligible to obtain coverage from their own employers. \u201cSince the Affordable Care Act requires employers to provide affordable coverage, we believe your spouse should be covered by their own employer \u2014 just as U.P.S. has a responsibility to offer coverage to you, our employee,\u201d UPS said in a memo to employees.\n\nBut UPS said that it is \u201ccontinuing to cover spouses who either don\u2019t work, or work for employers that don\u2019t provide health benefits.\u201d UPS said it currently covers about 33,000 spouses and it estimates that about 15,000 of those can get insurance through their employers.\n\nCruz mentioned UPS twice. The first time he used it \u2014 correctly \u2014 to illustrate the folly of President Obama\u2019s promise that \u201cyou can keep your own insurance.\u201d As we\u2019ve said, Obama cannot make such a promise. Those working spouses of UPS employees won\u2019t be able to keep their insurance. Still, Cruz is wrong to say that those spouses will be \u201cleft without insurance.\u201d\n\nObama Exaggerates Law\u2019s Impact on \u2018Cost Curve\u2019\n\nPresident Obama spoke with former President Bill Clinton in front of a live audience at the Clinton Global Initiative Health Care Forum in New York on Sept. 24. Obama greatly exaggerated when he credited the health care law for bending the cost curve on health care spending. Experts say the down economy is the overwhelming reason that national health care spending has been growing at historically slow rates in recent years.\n\nObama, Sept. 24: [B]ecause of these changes we initiated in terms of how we\u2019re paying providers, health care costs have grown, as you pointed out, Mr. President, at the slowest rate in 50 years. We are bending the cost curve and getting at the problems that are creating our deficits in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nClinton had earlier boasted of the slow rate of growth in national health care spending \u2014 a measure that includes spending by the government, businesses and individuals \u2014 saying that \u201c[i]n the last three years, just as we started doing this, inflation in health care costs has dropped to 4 percent for three years in a row for the first time in 50 years.\u201d\n\nTechnically, the measure is health care spending, not costs, but it is true that the growth has been 4 percent in 2009, 2010 and 2011, the lowest rate of growth since the data were first collected in 1960 by the National Health Expenditure Accounts (see Table 3). And that\u2019s expected to continue through 2013. But how much of that is due to the Affordable Care Act? Experts say it might have played some role, but the main reason for slower growth in spending is the once-faltering and still-recovering economy.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation analyzed the trend and determined that the economy was responsible for 77 percent of the slow growth rate. Plus, the study said, the rate of growth is expected to increase as the economy continues to pick up.\n\nKFF study, April 2013: Based on statistical analysis of 50 years of health spending and economic trends, the study finds that the economy, including factors such as Gross Domestic Product growth and inflation, produces a major but delayed effect on the nation\u2019s health spending. This effect stretches over a period of six years, meaning that the recession that ended in 2009 will continue to dampen health care spending for several more years and that spending will increase gradually as the economy strengthens.\n\nThe slower growth also began in 2009, before the law was signed.\n\nIn 2011, experts at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services pointed to the economy as the reason for slower growth in spending: \u201cJob losses caused many people to lose employer-sponsored health insurance and, in some cases, to forgo health-care services they could not afford.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the health care law didn\u2019t play some role, albeit a significantly smaller one. The Kaiser Family Foundation study, conducted with the Altarum Institute\u2019s Center for Sustainable Health Spending, said that the remaining 23 percent of the slowdown in growth was due to \u201cchanges in the health care system, potentially including higher deductibles and other cost-sharing that dampen patients\u2019 use of services, as well as various forms of managed care and delivery system changes.\u201d The study said it \u201ccannot determine the separate impact of these factors.\u201d\n\nSo, some changes in the health care system, which could be a result of the law, were a factor. Experts told the New York Times in February that the law may have contributed to changes in how insurers pay providers, by offering financial incentives. And there\u2019s been an effort in health care to reduce waste and limit rehospitalizations. The Times said: \u201cHealth experts say they do not yet fully understand what is driving the lower spending trajectory. But there is a growing consensus that changes in how doctors and hospitals deliver health care \u2014 as opposed to merely a weak economy \u2014 are playing a role.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Obama, or Clinton, boasted of those low rates of spending growth. During his State of the Union address this year, Obama said the ACA \u201cis helping to slow the growth of health care costs.\u201d This time, he flatly stated that the slow growth was \u201cbecause of these changes we initiated in terms of how we\u2019re paying providers.\u201d And at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton suggested the law was the reason for the slowdown.\n\nThe ACA pushes for new payment models, as Obama mentioned, such as paying for outcomes and encouraging coordinated care. The Kaiser Family Foundation report said \u201csubstantial savings\u201d were expected to come from Medicare, due to the law\u2019s reduction in the growth of payments to health care providers and insurers. But much of that part of the law hasn\u2019t been implemented yet. Says the study, in talking of the future: \u201cChanges in the delivery system \u2013 through accountable care organizations (ACOs) and bundled payments to providers \u2013 may also yield results and help to keep \u2018excess\u2019 health costs down in public programs, as well as in private insurance.\u201d\n\nThe law is also expected to increase spending as more Americans purchase health insurance, some receiving government subsidies to do so or joining Medicaid. The Kaiser Family Foundation report said the law would cause \u201ca modest one-time increase in health spending\u201d because of that.\n\nBut, again, mainly it\u2019s the economy that\u2019s driving spending. And the growth rate is expected to increase in coming years as the economy further recovers. The Office of the Actuary for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services estimates the growth at 6.1 percent for 2014, and near 6 percent for 2015.\n\nIRS Employees and the \u2018Train Wreck\u2019\n\nCruz said the \u201cIRS employees union has asked to be exempted from Obamacare.\u201d Not so.\n\nCruz: There is a reason why the IRS employees union has asked to be exempted from Obamacare. These are the guys who are in charge of enforcing it on the rest of us. They have asked to be exempt because it is not working. The facts are clear. It is a train wreck. As the lead author Democratic senator put it: It is a train wreck.\n\nCruz is referring to the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents over 150,000 agency and department employees, including the IRS workers.\n\nBut the union hasn\u2019t \u201casked to be exempted\u201d from the law. NTEU opposes H.R. 1780, a bill from Rep. Dave Camp, which would move federal employees \u2014 including the president, vice president, members of Congress and other employees as defined by Title 5, Section 2105 of the U.S. Code \u2014 out of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and into health plans or insurance exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe union doesn\u2019t have a problem with the health care law, though. In fact, it opposes Camp\u2019s legislation on the grounds that the bill goes against the intent of the law.\n\nThe union drafted a sample letter for its members to send to their representatives in Congress, asking them to oppose the legislation. It says the law\u2019s goal was \u201cnot to take coverage away from employees who already receive it through their employers.\u201d\n\nNTEU sample letter: H.R. 1780 would put federal employees in a special class where they would be prohibited from receiving health insurance through their employer. It would treat federal employees differently from state and local government employees and most employees of large private sector companies who receive health insurance benefits through their employer. The primary purpose of the Affordable Care Act was to provide a marketplace for the sale and purchase of health insurance for those who do not have such coverage \u2014 not to take coverage away from employees who already receive it through their employers.\n\nCruz claimed that the IRS union was seeking \u201cto be exempted\u201d because Obamacare is a \u201ctrain wreck,\u201d attributing the phrase to the bill\u2019s lead author, Sen. Max Baucus. Cruz said, \u201cAs the lead author Democratic senator put it: It is a train wreck.\u201d We\u2019ve already debunked that claim. As we\u2019ve written, Baucus was only referring to how the law was being implemented this spring \u2014 not the law itself.\n\nAt an April budget hearing, the Montana Democrat upbraided Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius for her department\u2019s lack of planning to properly implement the law, and warned of \u201ca huge train wreck coming down.\u201d Baucus \u201cwas clearly commenting specifically on a concern he had regarding one aspect of implementation of the law \u2014 the rollout of the public awareness campaign,\u201d Meaghan Smith, an aide to the senator, told us.\n\nBaucus is no longer concerned about that, however. In a Sept. 16 interview with Fox Business Network\u2019s Stuart Varney, Baucus said \u201cI don\u2019t expect a train wreck\u201d when the exchanges open for business on Oct. 1.\n\nRacial Disparity in Unemployment Rates\n\nCruz cited an apples-to-oranges comparison of unemployment rates while making a point about how Obamacare disproportionately hurts minorities.\n\nCruz: If you are lucky enough to be a college graduate, your unemployment rate is 3.5 percent. \u2026 For black teens the unemployment rate is over 10 times higher than it is for college graduates \u2014 38.2 percent.\n\nCruz\u2019s numbers are correct. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for blacks between the ages of 16 and 19 was 38.2 percent in August. And the unemployment rate for college graduates over the age of 25 was 3.5 percent in August. But he\u2019s comparing black teens to college graduates over the age of 25. The unemployment rate for whites aged 16 to 19 is also high \u2014 20.5 percent in August.\n\nIn other words, there is a racial disparity, but it\u2019s not 10-to-1.\n\nQuoting Mark Zandi\n\nCruz cited an outdated quote from Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, to back up his claim that Obamacare is slowing job growth.\n\nCruz: In May 2013 Moody\u2019s economist Mark Zandi noted a slowdown in small business hiring due to Obamacare.\n\nIt\u2019s true that in an interview on CNBC on April 5, Zandi said just that when asked about a jobs trends.\n\nZandi, April 5: But again, I think health care reform might be having an impact. \u2026 [W]ith employees [totaling between] 50 to 499 \u2014 that\u2019s the group that would be affected by the health care reform \u2014 we\u2019ve seen a rather sharp slowing in job creation.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what Zandi has been saying more recently.\n\n\u201cThere is little evidence that fiscal austerity and health care reform have had a significant impact on the job market,\u201d Zandi said in a Sept. 5 story in USA Today.\n\nWe reached out to Zandi and asked if Cruz had quoted him accurately and in context. Moody\u2019s sent this response from Zandi: \u201cYes, in the spring there appeared to be a slowdown in job growth at small businesses. But this is no longer the case. Job growth at small businesses picked up this summer. I don\u2019t see any meaningful impact on job growth from healthcare reform, at least not yet.\u201d\n\nPaul: Obamacare Driving Up Costs\n\nDuring his brief cameo in Cruz\u2019s lengthy speech, Sen. Rand Paul argued that due to Obamacare, \u201ceverybody is going to pay more.\u201d The fact is, some will pay more and some will pay less.\n\nPaul, Sept. 24: We went through this whole debacle of giving people ObamaCare and it is going to be expensive. Everybody is going to pay more. Many people still will not have insurance. The ones who do have insurance are going to pay more.\n\nAs we wrote recently in our wrap-up of Obamacare myths, how much you pay depends on such things as your age, health and whether or not you are currently insured. Those who are uninsured and have a preexisting condition will likely pay less than they would have otherwise. Those who are uninsured but young and healthy will likely pay more (without accounting for any subsidies they may receive). Those who are insured through their employer likely won\u2019t see much change either way. And some of the currently uninsured will pay little to nothing because they will join Medicaid \u2014 the program will expand by 13 million Americans by 2020 under the law, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.\n\nEmployer-sponsored premiums did go up slightly due to the law from 2010 to 2011 (a 1 percent to 3 percent increase, according to experts), because of added benefits, such as coverage for dependents up to age 26, free preventive care and an increase in caps on coverage. Since then, premium growth has been 4 percent on average for 2012 and 2013, modest growth rates historically.\n\nFor those who buy their own insurance, it\u2019s difficult to make generalizations about who will pay less or more. Many who had purchased on the individual market in the past will get more generous benefits. And the vast majority buying their own exchange plans \u2014 80 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 will receive subsidies that bring their total out-of-pocket costs down.\n\nPlans sold to individuals can no longer charge more based on health status or gender, but they can vary premiums based on geography, age and tobacco use. A RAND study, published in August and sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, estimated there would be \u201cno widespread trend toward sharply higher prices in the individual market,\u201d in the words of the lead author. Rates would likely vary from state to state and based on individual circumstances. So Paul is wrong to make the sweeping claim that \u201ceverybody is going to pay more.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s Premium Promise\n\nCruz said Obama promised in 2010, when the Affordable Care Act passed, that premiums \u201cwould drop $2,500\u2033 for the average family by the end of his first term. That\u2019s not exactly what the president said or when he said it.\n\nCruz: President Obama three-and-a-half years ago promised the average American that by the end of his first term, by the end of last year, the average American family\u2019s premiums would drop $2,500.\n\nBy saying three-and-a-half years ago, Cruz is placing Obama\u2019s comments in 2010, which is when the law was passed. But Obama initially promised to lower premiums $2,500 by the end of his first term in June 2008 while running for president. That\u2019s five-and-a-half years ago.\n\nObama, June 5, 2008: In an Obama administration, we\u2019ll lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year. And we\u2019ll do it by investing in disease prevention, not just disease management; by investing in a paperless health care system to reduce administrative costs; and by covering every single American and making sure that they can take their health care with them if they lose their job. \u2026 And we won\u2019t do all this twenty years from now, or ten years from now. We\u2019ll do it by the end of my first term as president of the United States.\n\nAt the time, we called Obama\u2019s promise \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201coverly optimistic.\u201d That\u2019s because the campaign told us half of the savings would come from investing in electronic health records and the campaign relied on a study that projected those savings would not fully materialize until 2019 \u2014 well beyond Obama\u2019s first term. Plus, estimated savings wouldn\u2019t go just to families, but to all of those who pay into the health care system, including governments and businesses.\n\nNow, Obama did repeat a version of his promise in 2009 during the congressional debate over the federal law, saying the legislation plus some effort to reduce costs from labor unions, and insurance, drug and medical industries \u201ccould save families $2,500 in the coming years \u2014 $2,500 per family.\u201d But this time the president didn\u2019t say by the end of his first term.\n\nObama, May 13, 2009: On Monday I met with representatives of the insurance and the drug companies, doctors and hospitals, and labor unions, groups that included some of the strongest critics of past comprehensive reform proposals. We discussed how they\u2019re pledging to do their part to reduce our nation\u2019s health care spending by 1.5 percent per year. Coupled with comprehensive reform, this could result in our nation saving over $2 trillion over the next 10 years, and that could save families $2,500 in the coming years \u2014 $2,500 per family.\n\nAs we said at the time, the promise was \u201cstill optimistic.\u201d But, he didn\u2019t promise this would be done by the end of his first term and Obama didn\u2019t promise that premiums \u201cwould drop,\u201d as Cruz put it. The Obama administration told us that future spending could be $2,500 per family lower compared with what it was otherwise projected to be.\n\nA year later, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Nancy-Ann DeParle told ABC News that the law needs to play out before savings materialize. She said \u201cby 2019 we estimate that the average family will save around $2,000.\u201d\n\nRepeated Claims\n\nWe also heard some claims that we have debunked before, including these:\n\nCruz repeated the false claim that members of Congress are exempt from the health care law. As we have written numerous times, the law requires congressional members and their staffs to get insurance through the newly created exchanges, so they are not exempt. In fact, the law prevents them from getting insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, like other federal employees. However, the federal government, will continue to make contributions toward the premiums of lawmakers and their staffs \u2014 just as most large employers do for their employees.\n\nCruz said, \u201cObamacare has a philosophy: empower government over your life, put a government bureaucrat between you and your doctor.\u201d But, as we\u2019ve said, the law doesn\u2019t create a government-run system. If anything, the law comes between you and your insurance company, forbidding them from capping your coverage or charging you more based on health status.\n\nThere may be more to do on the events staged by Cruz and Obama. We were only able to review the first 51 pages of Cruz\u2019s floor speech in the Congressional Record, and there are some statements made by Clinton and Obama that we are still checking out. So check back with us soon.\n\n\u2014 by Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson, D\u2019Angelo Gore and Robert Farley\n\nSources\n\nU.S. Congressional Record. 24 Sep 2013: S6701-S6752.\n\nGreenhouse, Steven. \u201cU.P.S. to End Health Benefits for Spouses of Some Workers.\u201d New York Times. 21 Aug 2013.\n\n\u201cWorking Spouse Eligibility.\u201d UPS, via Kaiser Health News website. 15 Jul 2013.\n\nRobertson, Lori. \u201cObamacare Myths.\u201d FactCheck.org. 16 Sep 2013.\n\nWhite House. \u201cRemarks by President Obama and Former President Clinton at Clinton Global Initiative Health Care Forum.\u201d 24 Sep 2013.\n\nOffice of the Actuary, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
