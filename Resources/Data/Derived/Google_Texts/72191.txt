Technical experts are reportedly being called in to fix what’s ailing the badly flawed Obamacare website, the Department of Health and Human Services said Sunday.

The agency admits it “has not lived up to the expectations of the American people,” notes the Wall Street Journal.

“We are committed to doing better,” agency officials declare in a blog post, adding that “our team is bringing in some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve healthcare.gov.”

And while a reportedly “very worried” President Obama is scheduled to speak Monday about the website problems and may even accept the blame for the failed rollout, NBC chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd has other ideas.

Todd said Sunday that the White House needs “a fall person” if the Obamacare site continues to fail…then pointed directly at the head of the HHS.

During in a “Meet the Press” interview, Todd noted that “if all else fails, they’re going to…say, ‘You know what? This didn’t work. Fire somebody. Maybe high profile.’ Kathleen Sebelius is very nervous about her standing with the president.’”
