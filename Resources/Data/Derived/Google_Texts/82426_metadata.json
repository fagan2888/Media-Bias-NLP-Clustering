But does the fact that the paparazzi are unsavory and mean allow for stars to dismiss them using the coarsest sort of anti-gay language? Hill, in a moment of stress, figured that the best way he could degrade and insult his harasser was an anti-gay slur.\n\nThat the actor apologized will mean this is unlikely to stick to him in any meaningful way going forward; oddly, Hill seems to have next-to-no public profile at all, positive or negative. Unlike, say, Baldwin, he\u2019s not known for lashing out. The biggest previous scandal that attached itself to Hill, one that was quickly forgotten, was his public feud with openly gay CNN anchor Don Lemon when Hill allegedly snubbed Lemon in a hotel; though the whole thing was instigated by an erratic Lemon, Hill did call the anchor a \u201c12-year-old girl.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jonah Hill flips out and uses the \"f-word\"", "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jonah Hill flips out and uses the \"f-word\"", "title": "The next Alec Baldwin?
