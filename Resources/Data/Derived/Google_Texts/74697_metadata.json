That's the highest of the year. Our peak was 216,000 [cars] ... before everything hit the fan\" during the financial crisis.\n\nOver at BofA, Moynihan told CNBC that American consumers are spending.\n\n\"September so far is about 5 percent to 6 percent over last year,\" he continued, but acknowledged, \"people wish this were going faster, but it's just a lot of work to take a huge economy like ours and get it completely back to where people want it, 3 percent-plus growth.\"\n\nCountrywide troubles\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!
