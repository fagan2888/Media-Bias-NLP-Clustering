Welcome to One Nation, Reno.

It’s your chance to be heard nationally on issues that matter in the 2016 presidential election. RGJ Media has partnered with the USA TODAY NETWORK to bring one of 10 live discussions about the issues to Reno on Feb. 11.

Your $10 ticket will get you free beer and a discussion about health care that includes national experts on insurance, technology and health care and medical marijuana.

Our goal is to help you cut through the noise of this year’s election, be smarter about the topics we know you care about and engage with democracy. Rock the Vote will be on site to help you register to vote – if you haven’t already.

The event, which began at 6 p.m. at Cargo in Whitney Peak, is sponsored locally by Renown and St. Mary’s.

See what people are saying about the event on Twitter:

While we’re talking health care here in Nevada, other cities will delve into different topics. For example, experts will talk climate change in Palm Springs, Calif.; the economy and jobs in Detroit and immigration in Phoenix.

Our discussion here will include the Affordable Care Act, but it also will look to the future. And that includes millennials, a generation that could significantly affect health care policies in the years to come.

Don’t let this election cycle pass you by. Democracy depends on it.

Show up, engage. It’s our chance to be part of the national #OneNation conversation.
