Hoboken received aid \u201con par\u201d with other cities\n\nposted at 11:01 am on January 26, 2014 by Jazz Shaw\n\nIf you\u2019ve been watching the cable news networks over the last few days you may have noticed something missing. The previous, non-stop gab festival about New Jersey Governor Chris Christie\u2019s alleged attempts to extort Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer seems to have faded largely into the background. As Allahpundit noted this morning, not a single one of the Sunday morning shows has so much as one Jersey related guest. What\u2019s with the media blackout of the Story of the Century?\n\nOur colleague Guy Benson has a story over at Town Hall which may explain the dearth of Christie Corruption Madness. In short, Zimmer\u2019s story is starting fall to pieces.\n\nCNN reported that Zimmer had explicitly denied any withheld Sandy funds were the result of any political machinations just one week prior to changing her story for MSNBC. In addition, a Democratic mayor of a different New Jersey town \u2014 who, according to Zimmer\u2019s account, was present for one of the extortionary encounters \u2014 stated for the record that his recollection does not coincide with hers. He went on to praise Team Christie for their professionalism and responsiveness in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Zimmer has since announced that she won\u2019t comment publicly on her allegations any further, in accordance with a supposed request from investigators. With her story unraveling, the Associated Press is out with a new analysis that strikes another blow against her credibility:\n\nHere\u2019s the AP report which guy is referencing.\n\nThe city whose Democratic mayor said GOP Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s administration tied Superstorm Sandy aid to her support for a real estate project has, so far, received a level of aid from state-run programs that is similar to what other towns got, a review of grant data shows. Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer is no longer discussing her allegations that New Jersey\u2019s second-largest city has been shortchanged on Sandy funds, that its aid is being held \u201chostage\u201d as political leverage or that she feared further retribution in the next round of funding.\n\nGuy also provides the full breakdown of the state level aid data. As you\u2019ll see, Hoboken received $142,080 in aid which was precisely the same as 39 other communities of similar size. When Zimmer\u2019s spokesman, Juan Melli, was asked about the claims that Hoboken was shortchanged this week, his response seemed strangely different than his boss\u2019s previous tale.\n\nThe problem, he said in an interview last week, is that New Jersey hasn\u2019t created Sandy aid programs designed to help places like Hoboken, a city of 50,000 across the Hudson River from New York City. Most of the communities devastated by Sandy were towns on the Jersey shore. \u201cWe\u2019re a densely populated urban environment,\u201d Melli said. \u201c(The programs) make sense in other places, but they don\u2019t make much sense here.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the Garden State has some antiquated policies in place which fail to balance the needs of shore side flood zones against more inland communities which primarily suffered wind damage. I don\u2019t know, but if they do it\u2019s a legitimate beef which the Governor should look into. But it\u2019s also nothing even remotely like the previous allegations. They\u2019re not even on the same planet.\n\nOne thing is becoming increasingly clear; if the Christie administration is guilty of attempted extortion, they\u2019re incredibly bad at it. You don\u2019t threaten to withhold something in order to get what you want while simultaneously handing out the very thing you were threatening to withhold. I understand that there are plenty of Democrats (along with more than a few antiestablishmentarianism conservatives) who are looking to pile on Christie, knock him down a few pegs in New Jersey and curtail his possible presidential ambitions. It\u2019s only natural. But, as the man once said\u2026 you\u2019ll have to do better than that.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Your 15 minutes are up", "title": "Dawn Zimmer\u2019s story unravels.
