GUESTS: Laura Wingard, news and digital editor, KPBS Megan Burks, reporter, Speak City Heights Transcript\n\nReporters from four California public media newsrooms \u2014 KPBS, KPCC in Pasadena, KQED in San Francisco and Capital Public Radio in Sacramento \u2014 are teaming up this election year to ask why some people don't cast their ballots and why others make it a priority.\n\nThe project is called California Counts.\n\nIn an interview with KQED, California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said there are 6.7 million eligible California voters who are not registered to vote, and that they are disproportionally minorities, young and from working-class families.\n\nPadilla said immigrants and young people may not come from a family with a tradition of voting, and so he talks to high school and community college students about voting.\n\nVideo Small California Secretary of State Alex Padilla Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.

We have to get out there and increase civic education in our schools.\"\n\nTo start the California Counts project, the stations asked voters what issues are most important to them this election. People wrote the issues on their hands or held up signs with the issues, and posted them on Twitter using the hashtags #CACounts and #whatsmyissue.\n\nAt Cool Down Coffee in Chula Vista, Alex Lopez said his issue is education.\n\nAt All The Perks in La Mesa, Whitney Bautista singled out the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, a bipartisan job training bill President Barack Obama signed into law.\n\nSteven Belchamber of Santee said his issue is adherence to biblical principles.\n\nAnd Hannah Fletcher of Santee said she's most concerned with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThese issues and others are helping people decide who they\u2019ll vote for in the presidential race on down, as well as on local and state ballot measures.\n\nDuring the California Counts project, KPBS wants to hear what issues will influence your voting decisions. Take this survey to give us your answer.\n\nWe will also be bringing you stories about efforts to increase voter turnout in San Diego, including profiles of voters who never miss an election. And we\u2019ll ask people who never vote why that is.", "article_metadata": {"description": "KPBS asked voters what issues are most important to them this election.
