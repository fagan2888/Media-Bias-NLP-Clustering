Jay Nixon a $27 billion spending blueprint on Thursday.\n\nBefore heading home for the weekend, Senate Majority Floor Leader Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, said the Senate remains on track to act on the same trio of issues he highlighted as priorities when the session began in January. They include good government legislation, a voter identification law and changes to civil justice laws.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working toward those goals,\u201d Kehoe said.\n\nLooming above those topics, however, is a proposed voter referendum that would shield some businesses that deny services for same-sex weddings.\n\nThe fight over Senate Joint Resolution 39 has been intense, with major businesses calling on the Legislature to drop the effort or drastically alter it. A scheduled vote in a committee stalled last week.\n\nHouse Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, said he doesn\u2019t believe the influence of big business is making much of a dent in the support or opposition of the plan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the lobbying has changed people\u2019s perspective on this issue,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cI think you\u2019re seeing across the country a very serious conversation about how people deal with this question of religious liberty.\u201d\n\nRep. Ron Hicks, R-St. Peters, a member of the House Emerging Issues Committee, said Friday he\u2019ll support the measure, but he has concerns.\n\n\u201cAre we going to lose a bunch of business because of it or are we going to bounce back?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause sometimes the state has to take a stand on the issues. Because we\u2019ve taken a stand on Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, abortion, Common Core \u2014 this is just another one.\u201d\n\nHicks said the delayed vote was caused by an expected tie and one member who requested more time to evaluate the proposal. Hicks declined to say which of the 12 committee members were on the fence.\n\n\u201cWith it being at a tie, if they would\u2019ve brought the bill up, the measure would\u2019ve failed,\u201d Hicks said.\n\nAll three Democrats on the committee oppose the proposal. Rep. Anne Zerr, R-St. Charles, who also sits on the panel, said Saturday she was still deciding how she would vote. Rep. Caleb Rowden, a Republican who is running for a Columbia-based state Senate seat, could not be reached on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, a proposal to ask voters to raise the state\u2019s gas tax by 5.9 cents per gallon also faces a steep climb in the House.\n\n\u201cA tax increase of any kind is going to be very, very difficult,\u201d Richardson said.\n\nA plan to ban lawmakers from accepting freebies from lobbyists has run into turbulence in the Senate, where Sen. Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, is pushing for a $40 cap on gifts instead of the outright ban approved earlier in the House.\n\nOther issues on the GOP agenda include election-year staples like abortion, guns and reining in the influence of labor unions.\n\nLawmakers also are trying to start a prescription drug monitoring program, which supporters say is an essential tool in combating opioid addiction. The program could help doctors and pharmacists determine if addicts are visiting multiple doctors to get prescriptions.\n\nOpponents like Republican Sen. Rob Schaaf, a St. Joseph doctor, say the program would be an invasion of privacy.\n\nKehoe acknowledged it could become a lengthy debate.\n\n\u201cThere are passionate feelings on both sides,\u201d Kehoe said.\n\nThe to-do list doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nSt. Louis Zoo officials are trying to win approval of a plan to allow surrounding counties to add a sales tax to help fund the operation. Additional reforms of the municipal court system are still being debated. And, Ameren and other utilities attempting to convince lawmakers to change how electric rates are set.\n\nIn addition, Richardson sounded hopeful the state could move to become in compliance with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling barring juvenile murderers being sentenced to life without parole.\n\n\u201cIt is a priority,\u201d Richardson said.\n\n?Kurt Erickson \u2022 573-556-6181\n\n@KurtEricksonPD on Twitter\n\nkerickson@post-dispatch.com\n\nJack Suntrup \u2022 573-556-6184\n\n@JackSuntrup on Twitter\n\njsuntrup@post-dispatch.com\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a92016 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nVisit the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at www.stltoday.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "LakeExpo.com", "description": "JEFFERSON CITY \u2022 With their job of crafting a state budget completed, lawmakers enter the final three weeks of the annual session with more than a dozen major issues in legislative limbo.", "title": "Gas tax, anti-gay marriage measure face Missouri lawmakers in final three weeks", "url": "http://lakeexpo.com/news/top_stories/gas-tax-anti-gay-marriage-measure-face-missouri-lawmakers-in/article_00363c50-0afa-11e6-b213-8b875a59b8c2.html", "image": "http://www.lakeexpo.com/app/LakeExpoLogo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@lakeexpo", "card": "summary"}, "description": "JEFFERSON CITY \u2022 With their job of crafting a state budget completed, lawmakers enter the final three weeks of the annual session with more than a dozen major issues in legislative limbo.", "fb": {"app_id": 342827975815947}, "keywords": "republican,senate,mike kehoe,lawmaker,caleb rowden,todd richardson,government,top_stories,politics,law,institutes,parliament,featured", "google-site-verification": "y_oEaOrK0_9RmGjQJYKNJ3MtCOzSMXcipXv5xNWHiCY", "news_keywords": "republican,senate,mike kehoe,lawmaker,caleb rowden,todd richardson,government,top_stories,politics,law,institutes,parliament,featured"}, "article_summary": "Rep.
