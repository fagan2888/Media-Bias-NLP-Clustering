Going to the hospital happened only when all other options were exhausted.\n\nIn today\u2019s healthcare environment, with its spiraling costs and downward pressures from the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s no wonder the question\u2019s been raised whether that old-fashioned approach might be updated for today\u2019s needs. Some industry leaders are saying yes\u2014and they point to the medical home delivery model as a possible solution.\n\nA medical home is any place where an integrated team of providers can meet the gamut of a patient\u2019s primary healthcare needs without sending the patient to a more expensive, specialty hospital. Taking a leaf from the pediatric world where parents must often coordinate immediate, ongoing, and follow-up visits for young children, the medical home setting offers both the staff and the patient a variety of healthcare and social services, either on-site or in another immediately accessible department. \u201cIt\u2019s coordinated care for a patient within that 60- to 90-minute visit,\u201d says Brenda Bush-Moline, associate principal at VOA Associates Inc. (Chicago).\n\nThis means medical homes can be located wherever there\u2019s an urgent need for primary care, says Suzy Cobin, senior vice president of HSA Primecare (Chicago). She sees medical homes in rural areas ranging from Alaska, North Dakota, or the Adirondacks in upstate New York to regional health systems in Chicago and California, where hospital officials are thinking through outpatient centers in retail strips, standalone buildings, or in conjunction with an existing specialty practice.\n\nSuch facilities are also a creative boon to architects, presenting them with a golden opportunity to radically rethink healthcare delivery through sites capable of both general wellness maintenance and specific illness treatment. \u201cThe doctors are the ones who say, \u2018Here is our concept, design something around it,\u2019\u201d says Martin Valins, principal at Stantec (Philadelphia). \u201cIt\u2019s a blank design slate influenced primarily by the operational policies of the healthcare practitioners.\u201d\n\nA closer look\n\nChase-Brexton Health Services in Baltimore is one example of a patient-centered medical home design. Offering services for HIV-positive patients and the local lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender population, the facility was designed by NBBJ (New York) to re-interpret how care is brought to the patient, not vice versa. As a result, a care suite approach, where everyone works in one location\u2014the doctor, case manager, behavioral health expert, nutritionist, nurse, and financial adviser\u2014was created.\n\n\u201cAll care providers work in what we call teaming spaces,\u201d says Kris Krail, senior associate/healthcare planner at NBBJ. Medical staff examines patients in the bays surrounding the teaming space. If a private discussion is needed, connected rooms are available, but otherwise there\u2019s no need for the patient to leave the suite.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "[page-title],[metatags-global-keywords-1],Interior Design Ideas,Architectural Design Ideas,Financial Matters,Building Ideas,Design Ideas,Technology", "revisit-after": "1 day", "description": "[site-name],[site-mission]"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa4e\"", "article_summary": "This means medical homes can be located wherever there\u2019s an urgent need for primary care, says Suzy Cobin, senior vice president of HSA Primecare (Chicago).\nSome industry leaders are saying yes\u2014and they point to the medical home delivery model as a possible solution.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blank design slate influenced primarily by the operational policies of the healthcare practitioners.\u201dA closer lookChase-Brexton Health Services in Baltimore is one example of a patient-centered medical home design.\nMedical staff examines patients in the bays surrounding the teaming space.\nA medical home is any place where an integrated team of providers can meet the gamut of a patient\u2019s primary healthcare needs without sending the patient to a more expensive, specialty hospital."}
