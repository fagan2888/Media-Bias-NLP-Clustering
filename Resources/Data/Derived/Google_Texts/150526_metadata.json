While the poll results are notable, what is capturing Americans\u2019 attention may be even more telling: the Ebola virus, and not the threat of the Islamic State (ISIS), garners more attention.\n\nThe poll, released Wednesday, found that only 15% of Americans are following the 2014 midterm elections \u201cvery closely.\u201d While interest in midterm elections is usually significantly below the interest in presidential election years, Pew found at least 20% of Americans harboring the same amount of interest in the past two elections (21% of Americans in 2006 and a significant 25% in 2010).\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPositing alternative news stories capturing the American imagination, Pew found that Americans are closely following both the spread of Ebola and military gains made by the terrorist group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Specifically, 36% of Americans are following the spread of Ebola within and outside of Africa, while 31% are following American military action against ISIS. Additionally, 21% say they are following ongoing embarrassing news stories regarding the Secret Service.\n\nAs Pew noted, this suggested that twice the number of Americans care about Ebola than they do about the midterm elections. Also, significantly more concern exists about Ebola than the concern in 2009 about the international Swine Flu outbreak.\n\nSuch interest could be devastating for voters\u2019 public opinion of the White House, given the results from other polls specifically asking about Ebola. For example, an NBC News poll released on Thursday revealed that 58% of Americans want the federal government to ban travel from West Africa into the United States to prevent the spread of the disease. President Obama has categorically stated through the White House Press Office that he is not considering the possibility of banning those flights, instead opting for a \u201cwhole government\u201d approach to the problem. Perhaps relatedly, only 20% of Americans have said they have a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of confidence in Obama\u2019s ability to handle the Ebola crisis.\n\nPresident Obama is also battling disillusion specific to the black American community. A YouGov/Economist poll showed that a whopping 59% of black Americans believe that a cure for Ebola would exist if the disease were to have originated in Europe or the United States; generally, 62% of Americans believe \u201cmore would have been done\u201d to stop Ebola had the disease originated anywhere but Africa.\n\nThat is not to say that Americans would have more faith in the President had they answered that their interests rested more with the developing situation in the Middle East. Polls show little confidence in President Obama\u2019s ability to eliminate the Islamic State, as well. In a poll that NBC News and The Wall Street Journal released in September, 68% of Americans answered that they did not believe President Obama could defeat the Islamic State. Yet more Americans\u201372%\u2013said they believed President Obama would break his promise not to place \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Iraq and Syria.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pew Poll: Americans More Concerned about Ebola Than ISIS", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Pew Poll: Americans More Concerned about Ebola Than ISIS", "title": "Pew Poll: Americans More Concerned about Ebola Than ISIS - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/Ebola/ebola-sign-reuters.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/10/10/pew-poll-americans-more-concerned-about-ebola-than-isis/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pew Poll: Americans More Concerned about Ebola Than ISIS", "creator": "@francesmartel", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/Ebola/ebola-sign-reuters.jpg", "title": "Pew Poll: Americans More Concerned about Ebola Than ISIS - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "ISIS, NBC, White House,National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "National Security", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-10-10T08:50:00-07:00", "categories": "National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c5d\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA recently released Pew Center survey found Americans extraordinarily disengaged from news surrounding the 2014 midterm elections.\nSpecifically, 36% of Americans are following the spread of Ebola within and outside of Africa, while 31% are following American military action against ISIS.\nAs Pew noted, this suggested that twice the number of Americans care about Ebola than they do about the midterm elections.\nYet more Americans\u201372%\u2013said they believed President Obama would break his promise not to place \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Iraq and Syria.\nWhile the poll results are notable, what is capturing Americans\u2019 attention may be even more telling: the Ebola virus, and not the threat of the Islamic State (ISIS), garners more attention."}
