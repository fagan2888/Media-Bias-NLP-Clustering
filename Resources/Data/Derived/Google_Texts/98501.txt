As the 2016 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) came to a close in Boston on February 25, we spoke with Dr. Carl Dieffenbach, Director of the Division of AIDS at NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), about some of the highlights of the HIV research presented there.

He notes that there were significant scientific advances discussed at the conference that are relevant to healthcare providers, people living with HIV, and people at risk for HIV. These developments included advances in HIV therapies that will make treatments safer and easier to use; new methods to deliver pre-exposure prophylaxis and support uptake and adherence among some of the most disproportionately impacted populations; and new, more effective treatments for hepatitis C, the most common co-infection among people living with HIV in the U.S.

View Dr. Dieffenbach’s other conference updates and read more about HIV research highlights shared at CROI in these blog posts. Presentation videos and slides and other conference information is available at the conference website.

Next week, we’ll share some additional video interviews we captured during CROI 2016.
