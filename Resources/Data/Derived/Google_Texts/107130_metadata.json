Ala Dallas Buyers Club, Taylor opened up her Bel Air home and nurtured the growth of an underground network to procure experimental drugs for friends with HIV/AIDS, Ireland said.\n\nTaylor\u2019s interest in the disease was both pioneering and personal. She helped break the stigma surrounding what the media called a \u201cgay plague\u201d \u2014 public health officials referred to it as \"gay-related immune deficiency\" \u2014 in the winter of 1985, when she chaired the first major AIDS benefit. According to Vanity Fair, Taylor\u2019s Commitment to Life dinner earned a cool $1 million from charitable benefactors for AIDS Project Los Angeles, a service group providing hands-on care to patients.\n\nFor the many skeptics who see this bit of philanthropy as just another celebrity media gambit, it must be said Taylor was exceptional at that time. No other name brand Hollywood stars dared associate their names with what was then a mysterious and frightening disease. Taylor's life had been touched by the disease.\n\nEarlier that year, for instance, her friend and former co-star Rock Hudson surprised not only the world but also Taylor when he announced he had AIDS. At the time she said she knew he was gay but believed he had cancer. Six years later her secretary Roger Wall, who had been diagnosed as HIV-positive, committed suicide by swallowing a handful of sleeping pills. Vanity Fair reports Taylor felt this as \"one of the biggest losses\" of her life. Even closer to home, Aileen Getty, Taylor's former daughter-in-law and mother to her grandchildren, was diagnosed with the virus in 1985. By 1992, Getty had developed AIDS.\n\nWatch the video, courtesy of CelebTV, for more information about Ireland's surprise announcement.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "elizabeth, taylor, ran, aids, drug, buyers, club, out, her, home, bel, air, says, kathy, ireland", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Elizabeth Taylor formed an underground network to procure experimental AIDS drugs for friends and other patients, says Kathy Ireland.", "title": "Liz Taylor Ran Her Own LA 'Buyers Club' For AIDS Patients", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/elizabeth-taylor-ran-aids-drug-buyers-club-out-her-home-bel-air-says-kathy-ireland-363926", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/04/a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Elizabeth Taylor formed an underground network to procure experimental AIDS drugs for friends and other patients, says Kathy Ireland.", "title": "Liz Taylor Ran Her Own LA 'Buyers Club' For AIDS Patients", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/elizabeth-taylor-ran-aids-drug-buyers-club-out-her-home-bel-air-says-kathy-ireland-363926", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/04/a.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/04/a.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-12-04T11:20:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-04T11:31:45-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Elizabeth Taylor formed an underground network to procure experimental AIDS drugs for friends and other patients, says Kathy Ireland."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf34f\"", "article_summary": "For World AIDS Day, Kathy Ireland told Entertainment Tonight about Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s most progressive and daring charitable act on behalf of the AIDS community.\nEven closer to home, Aileen Getty, Taylor's former daughter-in-law and mother to her grandchildren, was diagnosed with the virus in 1985.\nAla Dallas Buyers Club, Taylor opened up her Bel Air home and nurtured the growth of an underground network to procure experimental drugs for friends with HIV/AIDS, Ireland said.\nTaylor's life had been touched by the disease.\nEarlier that year, for instance, her friend and former co-star Rock Hudson surprised not only the world but also Taylor when he announced he had AIDS."}
