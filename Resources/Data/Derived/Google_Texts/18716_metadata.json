In the Americans for Prosperity ad aimed at destroying Michigan Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Gary Peters, Julie Boonstra inaccurately claims that Obamacare is threatening her cancer treatment and that it \u201cjeopardized my health.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that Boonstra was a Republican through and through, and her story of ACA victimization was widely debunked by fact checkers everywhere because it failed to mention that Boonstra would save $1,200 on her health insurance premiums under Obamacare.\n\nThe Koch funded ad completely backfired in Michigan, and has helped its target, Democrat Gary Peters, to lead the U.S. Senate race.\n\nThese completely fabricated tales of Obamacare woe have been turning up in states all across the country, and they have been called out for being false at every turn.\n\nBecause of the negative backlash, it appears that the Koch brothers are trying a new approach. Instead of claiming that the ACA will literally kill you, Koch money is now being spent on ads that argue that the law doesn\u2019t work.\n\nHere is the latest ad:\n\nNotice the difference? The new ads have retreated back to the same widely debunked lies about millions of people losing their health insurance. The Kochs have been reduced to treading over the same old tired ground that Republicans have been working for the past four years.\n\nThe dramatic tales of Obamacare killing granny are out, and in comes the same batch of lies that almost destroyed the Republican Party during the government shutdown last fall.\n\nKoch front group, Americans For Prosperity, denied to TPM that they were changing tactics, \u201cWe are currently on-air with many different types of ads, including personal testimony of Obamacare impact. This is the same strategy we\u2019ve been using for 6 months. This does not represent a shift in strategy.\u201d\n\nThe Koch strategy of claiming that Obamacare will kill you has completely failed. Judging by the millions who are still flocking to sign up for the ACA, people don\u2019t believe what the Kochs are selling.\n\nOne of the biggest signs of their defeat is the desperate manner in which the right is flailing about trying to find that one Obamacare lie that will carry them to victory.\n\nThe Koch brothers had their lies called out, so they changed tactics. Like copies of copies, each new tactic is weaker than the previous attempt. It all appears to be a futile effort. Not even the Koch billions can stop the Obamacare lies from slowing fading away.\n\nThe truth is that the stench of defeat has once again consumed both the Republican Party and their billionaire puppeteers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Koch brothers spent millions of dollars on ads that focused on bogus ACA horror stories.
