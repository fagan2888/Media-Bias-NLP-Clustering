SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - Illinois lawmakers are advancing proposals that would make feminine hygiene products and contraception more affordable for women.



The Senate overwhelmingly approved a measure on Thursday that would exempt feminine hygiene products from the state sales tax. The plan heading to the House is a part of a national movement to eliminate the so-called "pink tax."



The average statewide sales tax is 6.25 percent but can be as high as 10.25 percent in Chicago.



House lawmakers narrowly approved a plan that would make it easier and more affordable for women to access birth control by a 61-52 vote. Bill sponsor Democratic Rep. Elaine Nekritz of Northbrook said the plan puts the state in line with the Affordable Care Act.
