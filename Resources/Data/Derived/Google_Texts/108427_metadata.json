We warn you to immediately stop resisting,\u201d said a policeman into a loud hailer before jeering activists.\n\nMore than 100 people have been arrested in Mong Kok over the past two days. Hong Kong\u2019s Cable TV said 4,000 police were involved in Wednesday\u2019s operation.\n\nA Reuters witness saw police take away Shum, and the Facebook page of the student group Scholarism announced that Wong had been arrested for contempt of court.\n\nAlthough the protests have had no formal leadership structure, Wong and Shum were part of a group of students who many looked to as the movement\u2019s de facto leaders.\n\nIn August, Beijing offered the people of Hong Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, the chance to vote for their own leader in 2017, but said only two to three candidates could run after getting majority backing from a 1,200-person \u201cnominating committee\u201d stacked with Beijing loyalists.\n\nThe protests started in late September and drew more than 100,000 to the streets at their peak.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not the end\u2019\n\nThe clearance of the Mong Kok site is a big breakthrough in the authorities\u2019 efforts to end the most tenacious protest movement in Hong Kong\u2019s recent history, although it could trigger retaliatory protests elsewhere as activists regroup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end,\u201d said Helen Lau, a young activist with a leather yellow ribbon around her neck, who was shouting at police and demanding to re-enter the cleared area. \u201cWe still have plan B; either to occupy other places or to step up our actions.\u201d\n\nProtesters still occupy segments of roads, blocking traffic, in the city\u2019s Admiralty district near government offices and Causeway Bay, a major shopping area.\n\nThe crowded, working class district of Mong Kok has been the scene of some of the most violent confrontations in the two-month long \u201cOccupy Central\u201d civil disobedience campaign.\n\nThe pro-democracy movement is showing signs of splintering, with radical voices calling for escalated action.\n\nLate on Wednesday, police said seven officers had been arrested in connection with the beating of a pro-democracy protester last month. A group of officers were caught on camera last month kicking and punching Ken Tsang, a social worker and member of the Civic Party.\n\n(Additional reporting by Twinnie Siu, James Pomfret and Venus Wu; Writing by John Ruwitch; Editing by Alex Richardson, Anne Marie Roantree and Mike Collett-White)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Protesters in Hong Kong have been occupying segments of roads, blocking traffic, in the city's Admiralty district near government offices and Causeway Bay, a major shopping area.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Global Post", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Protesters in Hong Kong have been occupying segments of roads, blocking traffic, in the city's Admiralty district near government offices and Causeway Bay, a major shopping area.", "title": "Hong Kong Riot Police Clear Protest Site, Arrest Student Leaders", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/hong-kong-riot-police-clear-protest-site-arrest-student-leaders/199394/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP643451448626.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-26T15:31:27-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Protesters in Hong Kong have been occupying segments of roads, blocking traffic, in the city's Admiralty district near government offices and Causeway Bay, a major shopping area.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP643451448626.jpg", "title": "Hong Kong Riot Police Clear Protest Site, Arrest Student Leaders", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Protests", "published_time": "2014-11-28T05:00:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-26T15:31:27-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd259a\"", "article_summary": "Hong Kong Riot Police Clear Protest Site, Arrest Student LeadersProtesters have been occupying segments of roads, blocking traffic, in the city's Admiralty district near government offices and Causeway Bay, a major shopping area.\nScuffles broke out when riot police moved against hundreds of protesters on Nathan Road in gritty Mong Kok, Reuters witnesses said.\nMore than 100 people have been arrested in Mong Kok over the past two days.\nThe crowded, working class district of Mong Kok has been the scene of some of the most violent confrontations in the two-month long \u201cOccupy Central\u201d civil disobedience campaign.\nRiot police clashed with protesters late into the evening as activists sought to regroup and regain lost ground."}
