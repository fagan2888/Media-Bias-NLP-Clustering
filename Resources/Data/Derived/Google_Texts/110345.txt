Bosch Adds to Packaging M&A with Osgood Acquisition

The buyer previously picked up Tescor Machines and Ampack

Bosch Packaging Technology is buying Osgood Industries Inc. for an undisclosed amount.

Osgood, headquartered in Oldsmar, Florida, specializes in filling pre-formed containers with products that require clean hygienic standards, especially food. The company packages ice cream, yogurt, dessert, salad and cheese, among other things.

The deal adds to Waiblingen, Germany-based Bosch's liquid food packaging abilities. The company has been building up for a while, acquiring Tecsor Machines et Systemes Sas in August 2013, and Ampack in October 2012.

The packaging industry has hosted several M&A deals recently. In January, Paris investment firm Wendel closed a $198 million deal for packaging group CSP Technologies, and before that, in December, Pamplona Capital Management LLC bought Charter Nex Films, which makes packaging products for the food and health care industries.
