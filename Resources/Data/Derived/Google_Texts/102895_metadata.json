What I do know is that drones are a modern weapon. When used effectively, when taking out ISIS or terrorist leaders, that's pretty impressive. When bombing wedding parties of innocent people and killing dozens of them, that is, needless to say, not effective and enormously counterproductive. So whatever the mechanism, whoever is in control of that policy, it has to be refined so that we are killing the people we want to kill and not innocent collateral damage.\u201d\n\nRelated: What Bernie Sanders Gets Right\n\nCalling for fewer mistaken attacks on innocent civilians isn\u2019t exactly evidence of deep thought on the question.\n\nSanders didn\u2019t do much better when he was asked how he would handle captured terrorists, such as a hypothetical \u201cISIS commander.\u201d\n\nSanders: Imprison him.\n\nDaily News: Where?\n\nSanders: And try to get as much information out of him. If the question leads us to Guantanamo ...\n\nDaily News: Well, no, separate and apart from Guantanamo, it could be there, it could be anywhere. Where would a President Sanders imprison, interrogate? What would you do?\n\nSanders: Actually I haven't thought about it a whole lot. I suppose, somewhere near the locale where that person was captured. The best location where that individual would be safely secured in a way that we can get information out of him.\n\nRelated: Sanders\u2019 Fundraising Surges Again as the Campaigns Get Testy\n\nAgain, for Sanders to admit at this point in the campaign that he hasn\u2019t given much thought to one of the most contentious national security issues this country has faced in the post-9/11 era is at least surprising, if not troubling.\n\nHe is on the verge of winning his fourth primary in a row tonight, in Wisconsin. Sanders still trails Hillary Clinton badly in the delegate count, but he is now his party\u2019s de facto back-up plan if the Clinton campaign implodes. But he\u2019s not acting like it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If Bernie Sanders is aware that one of the main knocks against his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination is his lack of experience and expertise in foreign policy and national security issues, he sure didn\u2019t show it in his interview with the New York Daily News editorial board, a transcript of which was published late Monday.", "title": "Sanders Reminds Everyone of His Worst Weakness", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/05/Sanders-Reminds-Everyone-His-Worst-Weakness", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04052016_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/05/Sanders-Reminds-Everyone-His-Worst-Weakness", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04052016_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If Bernie Sanders is aware that one of the main knocks against his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination is his lack of experience and expertise in foreign policy and national security issues, he sure didn\u2019t show it in his interview with the New York Daily News editorial board, a transcript of which was published late Monday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0583\"", "article_summary": "Sanders still trails Hillary Clinton badly in the delegate count, but he is now his party\u2019s de facto back-up plan if the Clinton campaign implodes.\nSanders didn\u2019t do much better when he was asked how he would handle captured terrorists, such as a hypothetical \u201cISIS commander.\u201dSanders: Imprison him.\nSanders: Actually I haven't thought about it a whole lot.\nWhen bombing wedding parties of innocent people and killing dozens of them, that is, needless to say, not effective and enormously counterproductive.\nSanders: And try to get as much information out of him."}
