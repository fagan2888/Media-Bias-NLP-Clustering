The IAEA says it takes no information at face value.\n\nUnder the road-map, the IAEA could ask Tehran to provide more clarification by Oct. 15 so that the watchdog can write a final PMD report by the end of the year.\n\nFull sanctions relief can only go ahead once the IAEA says Iran has complied not only with requests about its nuclear past but also with a range of measures to shrink its current atomic program.\n\nThe agency has come under fire by U.S. politicians for not disclosing its road-map agreement with Iran, which the U.N. body says is in line with its normal nuclear safeguards proceedings.\n\nRepublican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, who chairs a committee overseeing his country's financial contribution to the IAEA, has said he would push to stop such money if the agency does not publish its arrangements with Iran.\n\n(Reporting by Shadia Nasralla; editing by Susan Thomas)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial",
