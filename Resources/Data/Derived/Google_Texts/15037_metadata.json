We\u2019re a few weeks out from the first debate, and we need to get something straight before this thing really gets going. There\u2019s a word we\u2019re using wrong, at least most of the time.\n\n\u201cGaffe.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll all use the word at some point during this election season\u2013some of us many, many times\u2013and there\u2019s a really good chance we\u2019ll be using it incorrectly in most instances.\n\nMy aim is not to sound nerdy or nit-picky and haughtily point out mistakes while pushing my glasses up the bridge of my nose. I\u2019m not simply pointing out lexical sloppiness, which I\u2019m probably guilty of more than you. No, I\u2019m talking about how we assess what is said by this array of people vying to be our leader, and misuse of the word \u201cgaffe\u201d is more than just a misappellation.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Oxford English Dictionary defines \u201cgaffe\u201d:\n\nA blunder, an instance of clumsy stupidity, a \u2018faux pas\u2019.\n\nMerriam-Webster gives a couple examples of the word\u2019s proper usage:\n\nHe realized that he had committed an awful gaffe when he mispronounced her name. She committed a huge gaffe when she started drinking from the finger bowl.\n\nTo be sure, politicians do make gaffes, minor verbal blunders, clumsy stumbles in their speech. Joe Biden is gaffe-prone: Being caught by the mic telling President Obama that the passage of the Affordable Care Act is a \u201cbig fucking deal\u201d is a gaffe. Or when he told Missouri State Senator Chuck Graham to \u201cstand up and let \u2018em see you\u201d during 2008 campaign event, not knowing that Graham, a paraplegic, was wheelchair-bound. That\u2019s a gaffe.\n\nRick Perry\u2013bless his heart\u2013is guaranteed to gaffe this time around. He\u2019ll always be remembered for his infamous \u201coops\u201d moment in a 2012 Republican debate, when he couldn\u2019t remember the third federal department he would shut down. That was a gaffe. And he went for the Guinness record in the field in New Hampshire that year when he delivered a truly bizarre 25-minute speech that felt like one long, unbroken gaffe.\n\nSarah Palin is a gaffe machine. All of time and space collapsed into a dense state of pure gaffe in 2008, what with the Palin Pangaea where Russia is seen from her house and America\u2019s \u201cneighboring country of Afghanistan\u201d being just down the road from New Hampshire in the \u201cGreat Northwest.\u201d Palin flubbed and told us that the White House was at 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue, that Paul Revere warned the British in 1775, and that the Founding Fathers said the \u201cPledge of Allegiance,\u201d All gaffes, simple mistakes.\n\nBut most of what gets called \u201cgaffes\u201d are not at all gaffes. They\u2019re expressions of beliefs and political and ideological positions that turn out to be intensely unpopular or offensive to a segment of the population, and the press, usually so careful in our language, tosses them in the same linguistic barrel as when Palin said \u201crefudiate\u201d or when President George W. Bush talked about \u201chow hard it is to put food on your family.\u201d\n\nTake last week, when Jeb Bush offered that Americans need to work longer hours. The proposal was immediately attacked by Democrats, and Bush was forced to address the comments later that same day after the swift and substantial backlash. Bush\u2019s rush to clarify his unpopular comments was reported on seemingly uniformly as an effort to mend his \u201cgaffe,\u201d as though he simply misspoke or exhibited the sort of clumsy speech his brother is known for. Major political news outlets assigned the word \u201cgaffe\u201d to Bush\u2019s proposal\u2013Politico, the Boston Herald, Business Insider, The Hill, and Vox, among others.\n\nBush was presenting his solution to the anemic recovery after the financial crisis of 2007-08. Bush\u2019s remedy includes Americans working longer hours, a point he reiterated in his clarification. The word \u201cgaffe\u201d seems to have been so widely assigned to the initial comments simply because they offended wage-working Americans and became an early weapon for Democrats against the GOP front-runner. But it\u2019s not a gaffe if it\u2019s a repeated belief. And it\u2019s not a gaffe just because a well-considered belief turns out to be an unpopular way to view Americans from someone in a position of wealthy political aristocracy.\n\nAn ascendant Senator Obama made similarly unpopular remarks on the campaign trail in 2008, when he described the electorate in small-town Pennsylvania as \u201cclinging to guns and religion.\u201d Obama did one worse and made his elitist-sounding comments before a crowd of elites, those assembled at a hoity-toity donor dinner in San Francisco. It was routinely called a \u201cgaffe\u201d in such news outlets as The Hill, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, and others. But it wasn\u2019t a gaffe. That\u2019s how Obama sees (or saw, maybe) that section of the population in the wake of deindustrialization and globalization. He\u2019s quite clear. The quote goes on beyond the soundbite we typically heard, and it\u2019s clear that this is something Obama had thought about at some length. It\u2019s his way of making sense of what he saw as a tendency of rural white conservatives to turn away from their economic self-interest and toward religious fundamentalism, racism, xenophobia and Second Amendment literalism.
