Fair or not, we all know how the story goes in Denver: The coach\u2019s conservative game plans, not skills diminished by age, made quarterback Peyton Manning look bad.\n\nKubiak took the hit for the problems of a patchwork offensive line when his boss refused to trade for Pro Bowl tackle Joe Thomas, because Broncos Country loves John Elway.\n\nAnd should the Broncos somehow lose a playoff game to the battered Pittsburgh Steelers, whose injuries make Denver a prohibitive favorite? Heaven forbid. His name no longer would be Kubes in this town. It would be dirt.\n\nSo I asked Kubiak: Do players or the coach face more pressure in the playoffs?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question. I\u2019ve never really thought of that. \u2026 Of course, when I was a player, I wasn\u2019t starting many of those playoff games,\u201d replied Kubiak, poking fun of his status as the backup quarterback to Elway from 1983-91, with his usual self-deprecating good humor.\n\n\u201cBeing a coach? I don\u2019t know. Your preparation is the same. Obviously, the stakes get higher, but that\u2019s why you\u2019re in the business.\u201d\n\nBeat the Steelers? This is the game Kubiak was hired to win.\n\nThe Broncos parted ways with John Fox for a number of reasons, from the painfully slow development of young draft choices such as Cody Latimer and Michael Schofield to the perception that Fox\u2019s coaching staff was more interested a year ago in landing that next job rather than beating Indianapolis in the playoffs.\n\nBut a team with Super Bowl aspirations has been shocked twice in its opening postseason game during a three-year span. If you want to know why Kubiak is here, that\u2019s got to be No. 1 on the list.\n\nSo Kubiak cannot lose to the Steelers. Otherwise, what was the point of hiring him?\n\nWhile coach of the year honors will go to Ron Rivera for nearly leading Carolina to an undefeated season or Andy Reid for rescuing Kansas City from the depths of a 1-5 start, what Kubiak has done with the Broncos is remarkable in a more subtle way.\n\nYes, Denver\u2019s offensive production dropped from 482 points in 2014 to 355 points during Kubiak\u2019s first season as coach, slippage of more than a touchdown per game. But from the moment Elway slashed Manning\u2019s pay, this felt like a transition year, yet Kubiak coaxed the No. 1 seed out of the Broncos, despite losing Ryan Clady and Tyler Sambrailo, his top offensive tackles, to injury.\n\nNot long ago, I mentioned to Manning it must have been difficult to accept a pay cut, and the veteran quarterback abruptly ended the conversation by saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into all of that\u201d in a tone that suggested it remains a touchy subject. While Manning deserves full credit for battling back from a foot injury that burdened him with the embarrassment of a 0.0 quarterback rating during a November loss to Kansas City, it should also be underscored how Kubiak doggedly kept the faith in a fading quarterback whose pride took hard hits all season long.\n\nGive Wade Phillips kudos for the Broncos finishing first in total defense, but try not to forget that Kubiak hired a 68-year-old defensive coordinator who was out of work a year ago.\n\nComing off a bye, the first playoff game for a No. 1 seed is tricky, because it is the ultimate everything-to-lose situation. Despite the benefit of rest and home-field advantage, the top seeds in the postseason tournament are an alarmingly modest 11-9 in their playoff openers during the past 10 years. My theory? Football coaches do feel the pressure of winning a championship, and in that first step on the long road to the Super Bowl, the coach of a No. 1 seed often tries to manage risk rather than boldly playing to win.\n\nDuring the playoffs, as players are coached to not say anything controversial, it becomes more common to parrot the message heard in team meetings. And it\u2019s obvious that mistake-free football is being preached to the Broncos.\n\nBut big moments call for bold action. And it\u2019s hard to win big with the mantra: Don\u2019t mess up. So I asked Kubiak how he balances the desire to play clean football with the necessity of letting talent flow in a big game.\n\n\u201cI talk about being aggressive,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cI want their aggression, as a football team and a player. I want their confidence. We\u2019re going to make mistakes in the game. You\u2019re going to make them, but come back and make the next play. I want them flying around and having fun, because like I said: They deserve the right to play this game.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s only one way for a big favorite to pound a wounded underdog into submission:\n\nSwing that hammer.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go get after it,\u201d Kubiak said.\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or @markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Gary Kubiak faces can\u2019t-lose situation in Broncos vs. Steelers", "title": "Kiszla: Gary Kubiak faces can\u2019t-lose situation in Broncos vs. Steelers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/kiszla-gary-kubiak-faces-cant-lose-situation-in-broncos-vs-steelers/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T17:06:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:00:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Mark Kiszla"}, "article_summary": "And should the Broncos somehow lose a playoff game to the battered Pittsburgh Steelers, whose injuries make Denver a prohibitive favorite?\nThis is the game Kubiak was hired to win.\nComing off a bye, the first playoff game for a No.\n\u201cI want their aggression, as a football team and a player.\nGary Kubiak would be a candidate for NFL coach of the year if he had more of an ego."}
