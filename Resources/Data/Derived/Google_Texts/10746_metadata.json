Ron Paul reacts during a scene from the 2012 GOP televised debate schedule.\n\nThe Charleston County Republican Party is hoping its city can be a destination for another premier event: South Carolina\u2019s lone televised GOP primary debate.\n\nOnline For more political coverage, information on the Palmetto Politics app or to sign up for our newsletter, go to palmettopolitics.com.\n\nLocal Republican Jonathan Hoffman is in charge of the effort, saying he expects there will be a community-wide campaign to get the debate ahead of the Feb. 20 vote. \u201cTo us, it\u2019s a no-brainer for having an event of that caliber in South Carolina,\u201d he said.\n\nThe goal is to \u201cmake it as easy as possible\u201d for the debate sponsors, CBS News and the Republican National Committee, to pick Charleston, he said.\n\nThe North Charleston Coliseum, the TD Arena at the College of Charleston and the new Gailliard Center are possible venues.\n\nFor now, the committee is waiting for guidance from the Republican National Committee on how to proceed. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve nailed down the numbers yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThe free advertising (for the city) is obviously unbelievable.\u201d\n\nThe debates are considered cash cows for whatever town lands one. Vendors, construction equipment and carpenters will be needed. Competition will also be fierce. Greenville, Charleston, Columbia and Myrtle Beach are each expected to throw their hats into the ring.\n\nMyrtle Beach is said to be lobbying heavily for the debate to help fill its hotel rooms in the February off-season.\n\nThe debate would be around the time that Charleston hosts the Southeastern Wildlife Expo, which could hurt the city\u2019s chances because of the crowds it draws.\n\nDavid Mack catching fire\n\nThe final week of the legislative session was particularly hard on state Rep. David Mack, D-North Charleston, who saw his car go up in flames inside the Statehouse complex garage.\n\nSomehow, his 2008 Chrysler 300 caught fire after he parked it. The key wasn\u2019t in the ignition. The flames were significant but no one was hurt.\n\nWhile the cause remains under investigation, Mack took to the House floor to thank the first-responders who arrived on the scene, including state Rep. Wendell Gilliard, D-Charleston, who showed up \u201cwith a fire extinguisher and led the charge,\u201d Mack said.\n\n\u201cSomebody asked, \u2018Why are you so relaxed?\u2019 \u201d Mack said afterward. \u201cIt\u2019s only material stuff.\u201d\n\nScott to start vetting presidential candidates\n\nThe first round of U.S. Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s hosting of town hall meetings with the GOP presidential candidates is set for July 6, in Anderson, with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee scheduled to appear.\n\nScott, who along with Gov. Nikki Haley, owns the two most prized endorsements in the state, is inviting the candidates to appear with him ahead of the Feb. 20 primary as way for local Republicans to hear their pitches.\n\n\u201cTim\u2019s Town Halls provide the opportunity for South Carolinians to look candidates in the eye, shake their hand, and make a choice free of polls or that week\u2019s hot name in the media,\u201d his announcement said.\n\nJoining him at the Anderson Civic Center will be U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.\n\nLindsey Graham\u2019s money tree\n\nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham spent the first week of his presidential roll-out campaigning in New Hampshire and Iowa, and in rolling out the list of names on his finance committee.\n\nAmong those signing on nationally are Jeff Immelt, chairman and CEO of General Electric, and Ronald O. Perelman, chairman and CEO of MacAndrews & Forbes Inc.\n\n\u201cLindsey Graham understands America\u2019s leadership role in promoting an enduring peace on the global landscape,\u201d Perelman said.\n\nAmong the local Charleston members of the national finance team are Anita Zucker, CEO, the Inter Tech Group; Charleston attorney Bart Daniel; and Robert V. Royall, former U.S. ambassador to Tanzania.\n\nBest Volvo pun\n\nLawmakers took turns skewering Gov. Nikki Haley and the Department of Commerce last week when Commerce Secretary Bobby Hitt requested $123 million in bonds to help front the cost of luring Volvo to Berkeley County.\n\nFrustrated with Commerce\u2019s request for economic development bonds to circumvent having to ask the Legislature for money, Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, D-Orangeburg, reiterated that lawmakers should be consulted about such deep-pocket details.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is how an industry anywhere in this world would think they could come into a state and do business in that state without involving members of the General Assembly,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important ... that it be made clear to any potential industry that there is some \u2018General Assembly required.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s presidential visits\n\nFormer Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry will be aboard the aircraft carrier Yorktown at Patriots Point on Monday beginning at 6 p.m. for a town hall meeting. With him will be retired Navy SEAL and \u201cLone Survivor\u201d author Marcus Luttrell. The event is open to the public.\n\nFormer Florida Republican Gov. Jeb Bush will be at the Charleston Maritime Center on June 18 as part of his announcement tour. That\u2019s a day after Democrat Hillary Clinton is expected to be here.\n\nFrom political reporters Schuyler Kropf and Cynthia Roldan", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Charleston going after GOP presidential debate, News, \r\nNewsPolitics, \r\nElections, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nLegislature, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Gilda Cobb-Hunter", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The Charleston County Republican Party is hoping its city can be a destination for another premier event: South Carolina\u2019s lone televised GOP primary debate.", "title": "Charleston going after GOP presidential debate", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150606/150609529/charleston-going-after-gop-presidential-debate", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150606/PC1603/150609529/AR/0/AR-150609529.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150606/PC1603/150609529/AR/0/AR-150609529.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Charleston County Republican Party is hoping its city can be a destination for another premier event: South Carolina\u2019s lone televised GOP primary debate.", "title": "Charleston going after GOP presidential debate", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Palmetto Politics", "iphone": "Palmetto Politics", "googleplay": "Palmetto Politics"}, "id": {"ipad": 897497885, "iphone": 897497885, "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.eveningpostpublishingcompany.palmettopolitics"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150606/PC1603/150609529/AR/0/AR-150609529.jpg?201506061924", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150609529}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Charleston going after GOP presidential debate , News, \r\nNewsPolitics, \r\nElections, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nLegislature, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Gilda Cobb-Hunter", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T18:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-06-06T19:24:00Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Charleston County Republican Party is hoping its city can be a destination for another premier event: South Carolina\u2019s lone televised GOP primary debate."}, "article_summary": "The Charleston County Republican Party is hoping its city can be a destination for another premier event: South Carolina\u2019s lone televised GOP primary debate.\nThe North Charleston Coliseum, the TD Arena at the College of Charleston and the new Gailliard Center are possible venues.\nFormer Florida Republican Gov.\nThe goal is to \u201cmake it as easy as possible\u201d for the debate sponsors, CBS News and the Republican National Committee, to pick Charleston, he said.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important ... that it be made clear to any potential industry that there is some \u2018General Assembly required.\u2019 \u201dThis week\u2019s presidential visitsFormer Texas Republican Gov."}
