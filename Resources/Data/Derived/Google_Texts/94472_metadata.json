He was going to side with the other justices and find that Obamacare was unconstitutional. Is it something that was dug up on him by the NSA or the CIA? Was that used against him to blackmail him?\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are the kinds of things the government is doing, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so scary what\u2019s going on with the NSA and the CIA,\u201d said Klayman. \u201cIt can happen in a democracy. So that may help explain it, and perhaps we can reach these issues through the NSA cases that we brought, the NSA/CIA cases. I intend to get the truth on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is actually a staggering response to believe the government could have spied on a Supreme Court justice \u2026 and that information is somehow utilized against him to pass Obamacare. This is huge,\u201d Klein said.\n\n\u201cIf the government wants to destroy you, it has to access the information that it can use to do it, and that\u2019s why this is so frightening,\u201d Klayman said. \u201cIt has a greater capability than King George III had in 1776. The tyranny is greater today than it was at the time of the American Revolution.\u201d\n\nEver since the controversial Obamacare ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts, many have wondered why he went against the other conservative Supreme Court justices, who believed the law was unconstitutional, why Roberts changed his mind and switched his opinion.\n\nKlayman\u2019s answers may lend some credibility based on the allegations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden who broke the news of the NSA\u2019s domestic spying that included members of Congress, other government officials, and world leaders, which would leave no doubt that none of the U.S. Supreme Court Justices were immune from such spying activities.\n\nIn January 2014, Judge Andrew P. Napolitano reported on Fox News that The Guardian newspaper reported that the NSA shares raw, unfiltered information it has gathered with some foreign nations, including England and Israel. It also reported that the NSA shares this raw data with its boss who happens to be, President Obama.\n\nNapolitano said, \u201cThe lawlessness continues. The president\u2019s NSA spies remain out of control. They are spying on Congress and the courts; the military and the press; the CIA and other spies; friends, foes and the pope.\u201d\n\nThe radio show interview between Klayman and Klein can be heard here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Allegations that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts was blackmailed by the National Security Agency (NSA) to give the okay and approve Obamacare was repor", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/was-u-s-supreme-court-chief-justice-roberts-blackmailed-to-approve-obamacare", "type": "article", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/70/d8/70d88ba04b712de2bf78d04fb89c7a66.jpg?itok=o7u4sG8-", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "title": "Was U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts blackmailed to approve Obamacare?"}, "twitter": {"description": "Allegations that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts was blackmailed by the National Security Agency (NSA) to give the okay and approve Obamacare was reported by Larry Klayman, the attorney who h", "title": "Was U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts blackmailed to approve Obamacare?", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/70/d8/70d88ba04b712de2bf78d04fb89c7a66.jpg?itok=o7u4sG8-", "creator": "@PCGOPExaminer", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2014-05-18T20:56:29-06:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Government Topics, NSA, Supreme Court, Justice John Roberts, Obamacare, blackmail", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-18T20:56"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf879\"", "article_summary": "In the interview, Klayman said, \u201cBut let\u2019s take this possibility\u2026 why did Chief Justice Roberts at the eleventh hour change his decision?\nI intend to get the truth on this.\u201d\u201cThis is actually a staggering response to believe the government could have spied on a Supreme Court justice \u2026 and that information is somehow utilized against him to pass Obamacare.\nAllegations that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts was blackmailed by the National Security Agency (NSA) to give the okay and approve Obamacare was reported by Larry Klayman, the attorney who has come to be known as \u201cthe NSA slayer\u201d for his successful legal battles against the National Security Agency was reported by WND on Sunday.\nIt also reported that the NSA shares this raw data with its boss who happens to be, President Obama.\nThe tyranny is greater today than it was at the time of the American Revolution.\u201dEver since the controversial Obamacare ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts, many have wondered why he went against the other conservative Supreme Court justices, who believed the law was unconstitutional, why Roberts changed his mind and switched his opinion."}
