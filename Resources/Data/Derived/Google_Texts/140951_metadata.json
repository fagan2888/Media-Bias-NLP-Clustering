Our round-up of state blogs will follow on Saturday afternoon.\n\nJump to:\n\nElections and the road to 2016\n\nThe GOP\u2019s first debate\n\nGovernment, the Beltway and Congress\u2019 agenda\n\nForeign policy, defense and trade\n\nObamacare and health policy\n\nThe economy and society\n\nAnd finally\u2026\n\nPresident Obama, the Democratic Party, and the GOP\n\nOn Monday this week, Informed Comment draws connections between President Obama\u2019s politics and the rise of outspoken candidates Senator Bernie Sanders and billionaire Donald Trump. They argue that Obama\u2019s willingness to compromise, and his having lost sight of his mandate for change have led to voters being dissatisfied with the prospect of having yet another \u2018establishment\u2019 president.\n\nThis week also saw the White House unveil its Clean Power Plan which sets state-level emissions targets. The American Interest writes that the President\u2019s policy is sure to be buffeted by legal and Congressional challenges as well as massive opposition from the coal industry and coal-producing states. The Atlantic, meanwhile, examines the politics of the new regulations, commenting that it has been designed to make it more legally defensible by offering states more flexibility in reaching their targets, as well as giving them more time to comply.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hit & Run says that a bill signed by President Obama five years ago \u2013 the Fair Sentencing Act \u2013 has done much to reduce the Federal prison population by making the penalties for crack cocaine offences similar to those for cocaine powder.\n\nMoving on to the Republican Party, The Atlantic takes a look at the party\u2019s 30-year long fight to defund Planned Parenthood as it renews its calls to pull the organization\u2019s funding over the way it apparently handles fetal tissue. They say that the GOP\u2019s attacks are not really about fetal tissue but are a way of going after safe, legal, abortion. Political Animal says that calls from within the Republican Party to defund programs such as Planned Parenthood are being reinforced by its presidential fields\u2019 playing to the party\u2019s base, and attacks on the GOP\u2019s Congressional leadership for not standing up to Obama to the degree which they feel is needed.\n\nElections and the road to 2016\n\nTurning to the 2016 presidential race, Outside the Beltway looks at the state of the money race in the second quarter of this year. They say that former Florida Governor Jeb Bush leads the field with $120 million raised between his campaign and SuperPAC, followed by former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who has raised just under $68 million.\n\nOn Thursday, Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball says that at the moment, only one thing about the campaign is clear \u2013 many voters are angry. They say that this \u2018negative partisanship\u2019 has been on the rise for thirty years and that it is likely now the most important feature of the US political scene.\n\nTurning to our regular round-up of all things Donald Trump:\n\nTrump continued to expand his polling lead this week, heading to over 25 percent (Outside the Beltway)\u2026\n\n\u2026while Talking Points Memo says that we should look at Trump\u2019s net favorables, which have him at +17 percent, a positive shift of 45 points in three months.\n\nThe Federalist looks at who supports Trump \u2013 unsurprisingly, it is mostly older white males.\n\nThink Trump-mania is a big deal? You might be forgetting 2008\u2019s Palin-sanity (The Fix).\n\nRed State reckons that Trump is no longer a risk for the party, but an issue, given that needs to be dealt with before he steals the GOP\u2019s voter base out from under it.\n\nIs Trump in the first stage of his \u2018six stages of doom\u2019? Only time will tell (FiveThirtyEight).\n\nThe Atlantic thinks that one of Trump\u2019s 2010 donations might offer insights into what his priorities might be.\n\nTurning to the rest of the Republican Party\u2019s presidential field:\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker still doesn\u2019t know if President Obama is a Christian or not (Crooks & Liars).\n\nJeb Bush has been unapologetic about his SuperPAC\u2019s fundraising, stating that \u201cyou might as well front load it if you can\u201d (Post Politics).\n\nBush also questioned the need for the government to spend \u2018half a billion dollars\u2019 on women\u2019s health issues when asked about Planned Parenthood (Crooks & Liars).\n\nIf elected, former Arkansas Governor, Mike Huckabee would use federal forces to prevent women from getting an abortion (America Blog).\n\nNew Jersey Governor, Chris Christie was booed this week at Monmouth Park by a crowd of over 60,000 (FreakOutNation).\n\nAre Donald Trump and Senator Tec Cruz birds of a feather? (Townhall)\n\nThe GOP\u2019s first debate\n\nThis week saw the first debate between Republican candidates for the presidency in Cleveland, Ohio on Thursday evening. The week leading up to the debate was filled with commentary from across the ideological spectrum:\n\nFiveThirtyEight says that there is no perfect way to sort the candidates for such a debate after Fox News received criticism for using national polls to determine the top 10 out of 17 candidates.\n\nFox\u2019s methodology ended up squeezing out the former Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, with present Ohio Governor John Kasich squeezing in (Crooks & Liars)\u2026\n\n\u2026as some claim that neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, does not deserve to be on the debate stage (The Federalist).\n\nTownhall comments on what the GOP\u2019s establishment candidates must accomplish during the debate\u2026\n\n\u2026while The Fix looks at some expert prescriptions on how to debate Donald Trump.\n\nWe may want to take the debates this week with a grain of salt \u2013 The Fix has seven charts which show how much, and how little, they matter.\n\nBefore the main debate this week, fourteen GOP candidates took part in a forum in New Hampshire on Monday night. Post Politics said that the session felt like \u2018a round of political speed dating\u2019 and has details of how each candidate tried to stand out.\n\nThursday evening actually saw two debates; the first featuring the seven candidates who did not make Fox\u2019s polling cut for the later prime-time debate. Hit & Run comments that this debate saw little actual debating and said that, going by the opening round of questions, it was the \u201dlosers\u2019 debate\u201d. Most commentators agreed that the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, Carly Fiorina was the winner of this first debate. The Federalist acknowledges this, but also argues that she is not probably electable given her record of mass-layoff while at HP. Turning then, to the main debate:\n\nSenator Rand Paul (KY) got the fight over surveillance programs that he had been spoiling for since 2014 when he sparred with New Jersey Governor, Chris Christie (Post Politics).\n\nOhio Governor, John Kasich may have been one of the debate\u2019s biggest winners, having stolen Jeb Bush\u2019s thunder with his brand of compassionate conservatism (National Journal).\n\nInformed Comment has the top cringe worthy foreign policy moments from the debate \u2013 Senator Ted Cruz (TX) leads with praise for Egypt\u2019s leadership in addressing radical Islamic terrorists (President al-Sisi is accused of killing more than 1250 Muslim Brotherhood protestors)\u2026\n\n\u2026while The Federalist has the ten worst Donald Trump moments from the debate.\n\nTrump actually said during the debate that he had given most of his opponents campaign money \u2013 it turns out that\u2019s not true (The Fix).\n\nTrump also had the most speaking time at the debate, at more than ten and a half minutes \u2013 Rand Paul had the least, with less than half of that time (Smart Politics).\n\nMoving on to the Democratic side of the 2016 race:\n\nA new poll shows that the party would crush the GOP next year if Donald Trump decides to run as a third party candidate, with Hillary Clinton beating Jeb Bush 44 percent to 29 percent (PoliticusUSA).\n\nSpeaking of Clinton, The Fix looks at the two contradictory realities of her campaign \u2013 that while she has a major image problem, she will be very hard to beat in a Democratic primary.\n\nClinton has apparently bought $2 million in ad time in Iowa and New Hampshire, as polls show her support to be softening (Post Politics).\n\nWhile many have accused Clinton of being far too close to Wall Street, Crooks & Liars says that she collects far less money from that source than many think.\n\nThe big news this week on the Democratic field is that Vice-President Joe Biden is thinking about running for President (Outside the Beltway)\u2026\n\n\u2026something that The Fix says does not make a great deal of sense given the lack of room for him in the race\u2026\n\n\u2026while others describe Biden\u2019s campaign as being akin to Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat (FiveThirtyEight).\n\nFormer Maryland Governor, Martin O\u2019Malley has meanwhile called for a constitutional amendment which would guarantee the affirmative right to vote (America Blog).\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders has ruled out the possibility that he might run as a third party candidate if he does not win the Democratic nomination (PoliticusUSA).\n\nGovernment, the Beltway and Congress\u2019 agenda\n\nWith the House on its summer recess this week, Congress was a little quieter than normal, though the Senate was still very much in the news. The Fix warns that the GOP\u2019s attempts to defund Planned Parenthood could lead to another government shutdown in the fall if House and Senate Republicans attach a must-pass bill to the measure to fund the government, and the Democrats decide that the program is worth fighting for. Roll Call\u2019s #WGBD on the other hand reports that Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell (R-KY), has stated that there will not be any government shutdowns on his watch.\n\nRoll Call\u2019s 218 writes Tuesday that House Foreign Affairs Chairman, Ed Royce (R-CA) and Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) have set the stage for the House to disapprove of the Iran nuclear deal when it returns in September.\n\nTurning to the Senate, The Daily Signal says that Republicans on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works have alleged that a non-profit environmental advocacy group, the National Resources Defense Council has colluded with the Environmental Protection Agency to create the new emissions standards announced this week by President Obama.\n\nOn Thursday, Outside the Beltway reports that Mitch McConnell has stated that there will be no immigration reform so long as Barack Obama is President; something that they say is unsurprising.\n\nOne thing that could cause another headache for President Obama is Senator Chuck Schumer\u2019s (D-NY) just-announced opposition to the Iran deal, reports Roll Call\u2019s #WGBD. They say that Obama is relying on Senate Democrats to sustain a presidential veto of Congress\u2019 likely motion to disapprove of the agreement, and that the disagreement of the number 3 Senate Democrat may complicate the White House\u2019s \u2018full-court press\u2019.\n\nForeign policy, defense and trade\n\nStaying on the topic of the Iran deal, Townhall reckons that it is Obama\u2019s foreign policy Obamacare, in that it is both destructive and \u2018legacy-driven\u2019. They argue that the deal is the culmination of the President\u2019s dangerously flawed philosophy that national security can be enhanced through appeasement. The Hill\u2019s Congress blog is similarly negative about the deal, writing this week that it exposes Obama\u2019s double standards They say that he is pushing the deal despite public opposition, and that it will allow Iran to give more assistance to the Assad regime in Syria, and this contrasts with Obama\u2019s refusal to fight the Assad regime in 2013 because of public opposition.\n\nThe Atlantic, meanwhile, says that the Iran deal\u2019s critics will probably lose, mostly because all the signs point to the deal going into effect. Obama himself struck out against those who opposed the deal, branding them \u2018warmongers\u2019, reports Informed Comment. On Saturday, The Daily Signal says that GOP Senators John McCain (AZ) and Lindsey Graham (SC) have teamed up to deride what they say is Obama\u2019s \u2018feckless\u2019 foreign policy, and explicitly cited the Iran deal.\n\nOn Monday The American Interest writes that the White House is putting the blame for a recent mass hack of the Office of Personnel Management on China. They say that the Obama administration has promised to retaliate \u2013 though by just what means is still a gray area.\n\nObamacare and health policy\n\nTownhall looks ahead to what Obamacare will have in store by 2018. They say that in three years\u2019 time, many employers will face a 40 percent tax on health insurance benefits that are currently received by employees tax free.\n\nThe economy and society\n\nCrooks & Liars reports on recent comments from former President, Jimmy Carter, that the US is an oligarchy, not a Democracy, and that \u2018unlimited political bribery\u2019 is the essence of winning a presidential nomination. The Atlantic also looks at the state of American democracy, reminding us that the Voting Rights Act is 50 years old this week. They say that there are deep divisions over its current role, with the Republican Party feeling that it is a matter of the past, and Democrats arguing that state-based voting restrictions show that it is still very important.\n\nIn light of the current debate over the funding of Planned Parenthood, The Daily Signal asks if women would be OK without it. They write that some pro-life organizations say yes, while others say no.\n\nMoving on to economic issues, Wonkblog this week looks at what raising the minimum wage to $15 would actually mean in every state. For example, $15 would go much further in Macon, Georgia where prices are more than 12 percent below the national average than in New York, where they are 22 percent more expensive. The Fix has an interesting piece on Tuesday which examines the gap between black and white unemployment. Apparently black unemployment has exceeded that of whites by at least two-thirds every month that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping records.\n\nThis week also saw Puerto Rico default on a $58 million bond payment. The Hill\u2019s Congress blog says that this shows that sovereign debt crises are no longer just a foreign problem.\n\nAnd finally\u2026\n\nThe Fix looks at how running for the presidency makes you fat.\n\nNational Journal has the ten worst moments in presidential debates dating back to 1960\u2019s debate between Nixon and Kennedy.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz found an interesting use for a machine gun this week \u2013 cooking bacon, reports Crooks & Liars.\n\nFeatured image: Vice President Joe Biden Credit: jstreetdotorg (Flickr, CC-BY-NC-SA-2.0)\n\nPlease read our comments policy before commenting.\n\nNote: This article gives the views of the author, and not the position of USAPP\u2013 American Politics and Policy, nor of the London School of Economics.\n\nShortened URL for this post: http://bit.ly/1INiN4r", "article_metadata": {"description": "USAPP Managing Editor,\u00a0Chris Gilson looks at the best in political blogging from around the Beltway.
