I am the 71 percent.

That’s right — I am among the 71 percent of Coloradans who “really like or love” green bean casserole, according to the Del Monte Green Bean Index.

And tomorrow, Thanksgiving Day, is our day, our one day every year to eat enough green beans, cream of mushroom soup and french-fried onions to get us through another 365. Or 364, really, if you count the glory that is next-day, soggy-fried-onion, green bean casserole leftovers.

So, why do I love it?

I trace it back to my Wisconsin roots, a state where no church potluck was complete without 10 different casseroles and where one of my favorite childhood foods involved egg noodles and cream of chicken soup. Wisconsin may be the Dairy State, but if you ask me, it’s also the Casserole State. (Wisconsin, somehow, came in second on Del Monte’s index, at 77 percent. It’s Kentucky that loves green bean casserole the best, say the Del Monte bean counters, at 78 percent. Colorado’s 71 percent ranked a respectable eighth.)

I’m a purist when it comes to my green bean casserole, too. Green beans (frozen, not canned — just like my mom makes it), cream of mushroom soup, milk, black pepper and French’s French Fried Onions — that’s all I need. Mix it all together and cook it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, plus a few more to get the fried-onion topping extra crispy. Instant Thanksgiving.

I was a little surprised when I saw soy sauce listed on both the Del Monte and Campbell’s recipes. Is that a thing now? (Only French’s was a holdout.) According to Del Monte, other favorite additions include bacon, cheese, mushrooms, bread crumbs and almonds, but I’m fine without, thank you very much.

And to the 29 percent in Colorado, those of you who don’t care for green bean casserole, that’s just fine with me, too.

Just pass the casserole dish — I’ll gladly take your share.
