The United States is supporting the Saudi attacks with intelligence and logistical help.\n\nIn Iraq, the United States and Iranian-supported militias have tangled over their simultaneous involvement in a key battle against ISIS terrorists for the city of Tikrit.\n\nMeanwhile, Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2014a close ally of Iran\u2014continues to allegedly murder his own people in that country\u2019s four-year-old civil war, as the United States stays on the sidelines.\n\nIn the shadows of these conflicts, the United States is pushing for a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, a bizarre\u2014or normal\u2014specter (depending on whom you talk to) that may or may not be impacted by all of the other developments.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration is faced with a big problem,\u201d said Steve Bucci, a foreign and national security policy expert at The Heritage Foundation. \u201cThey are so determined to get a nuclear deal with Iran when at the same time they should be more concerned with the growing Iranian influence in the Middle East, which is complicated by wanting to stop ISIS. Which one of those end up winning? You can lose them all. Because they are all pulling in a different direction.\u201d\n\nSome experts, like Bucci, argue the recent developments in the Middle East\u2014and the Sunni world\u2019s amped up aggression against Iranian influence\u2014should pressure the Obama administration to get tougher with Iran.\n\n>>> What You Need to Know About Congress\u2019 Debate on Iran Sanctions\n\nWith the United States and its negotiating allies facing a March 31 deadline to agree to the framework of nuclear deal with Iran, America\u2019s Sunni Arab allies may be sending well-timed warning shots.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. policy towards Iran is contradictory and hard to understand,\u201d says @MaxAbrahms.\n\n\u201cBasically, the U.S. policy toward Iran is contradictory and hard to understand,\u201d said Max Abrahms, a Northeastern University professor and terrorism analyst, in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cWe in no way have a coherent strategy.\n\n\u201cAll of this is very relevant to the Iranian nuclear negotiations. The Sunni world is very alarmed by the spread of Iranian influence throughout the world. And there is a sense that the Obama administration, by agreeing to a nuclear deal, will pave the way for that country to develop a nuclear weapon. So the Sunni world is responding very strongly.\u201d\n\n>>> The Big Picture: Why Yemen Matters\n\nBut other experts say the nuclear talks with Iran should be carried out on its own terms and evaluated on its face\u2014outside of the circulating Iranian-tinged chaos.\n\n\u201cThe sheer complexity of all of these things going on and the number of directions they push and pull should suggest a simplicity,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, director of research for the foreign policy program at Brookings Institution, in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cI think the simplest way to look at it is that these are different issues that can largely be handled by themselves. If you look at one of these situations too closely, you can read all of these little nuances and determine that Iran is signaling if we do a deal they will behave better or not. But Iran will make their decisions [in each situation] based on what their best interests are, and we should approach it that way to.\n\n\u201cIt will be unrealistic to think any one of these things are going to improve,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon added. \u201cEven if we manage to get some sort of deal, I don\u2019t think they will start behaving better. Some think that they will start behaving slightly worse in the short term just to prove a point. Whether you like the Iran deal or not, you can view it on its own terms and not necessarily in a broader context.\u201d\n\nThough Middle East experts may be able to untangle each of these events\u2014and understand their complexities\u2014the Obama administration, if it seals a nuclear deal, will be tasked with selling the strategy to the American public.\n\nO\u2019Hanlon trusts that Americans are wise enough to judge the nuclear deal on what it is.\n\nO\u2019Hanlon, for his part, is \u201cprepared to hold my nose and tolerate the deal\u201d because it is better than any other short-term outcome.\n\n\u201cI think you should treat them [the American public] like grown ups,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon said. \u201cYou have to give the debate participants some credit, whatever side they\u2019re on, that they are reaching their conclusions for fairly specific reasons that have to do with the details of negotiations: details such as verification measures, previous [International Atomic Energy Agency] access, Iran\u2019s record of noncompliance, the sunset provision [when the deal expires], the question if we could reimpose sanctions if we needed to.\n\nHe acknowledged it was a hard debate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we need to make it harder by worrying about all these hypothetical linkages or about Iran\u2019s bad boy image,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon added. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many American are going to react based on a blanket hate for Iran or fear of Iran.\u201d\n\nAbrahms, who opposes the nuclear talks, views the situation more simply.\n\n\u201cIf we are confused, the American public is confused,\u201d Abrahms said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the March 31 deadline for the U.S. and Iran to agree to a nuclear deal approaching, the Middle East is in chaos.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "With the March 31 deadline for the U.S. and Iran to agree to a nuclear deal approaching, the Middle East is in chaos.", "title": "How Will Middle East Chaos Impact the Iran Nuclear Talks?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IranImpactFeature.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-02T22:53:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xq3QGl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "With the March 31 deadline for the U.S. and Iran to agree to a nuclear deal approaching, the Middle East is in chaos.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IranImpactFeature.jpg"}, "title": "How Will Middle East Chaos Impact the Iran Nuclear Talks?", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-03-29T13:33:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-02T22:53:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iran, ISIS, Yemen, Houthi, Saudia Arabia, nuclear deal, John Kerry, Syria, Iraq, Assad"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05a5\"", "article_summary": "O\u2019Hanlon trusts that Americans are wise enough to judge the nuclear deal on what it is.\nIn Iraq, the United States and Iranian-supported militias have tangled over their simultaneous involvement in a key battle against ISIS terrorists for the city of Tikrit.\n\u201cAll of this is very relevant to the Iranian nuclear negotiations.\nAnd there is a sense that the Obama administration, by agreeing to a nuclear deal, will pave the way for that country to develop a nuclear weapon.\nThe United States is supporting the Saudi attacks with intelligence and logistical help."}
