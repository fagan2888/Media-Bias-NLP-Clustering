Rick Santorum who sought unsuccessfully to appeal to working class voters in his presidential campaign, said GOP elites who covered their eyes eight months ago are paying attention to Trump now.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to believe it,\u201d Brabender said. \u201cFor the establishment, familiarity doesn\u2019t breed contempt. It breeds comfort.\u201d\n\nTrump diverges from GOP orthodoxy in significant ways: While Republican elites push to rein in or privatize entitlements almost as a matter of faith, he vows to preserve Medicare and Social Security \u2014 while reassuring that \u201cwe're going to take care of the people on the street dying\u201d after he repeals Obamacare.\n\nTrump is strongly protectionist on trade and pushes closed borders to reassure workers who feel threatened by undocumented workers and the exodus of manufacturing jobs.\n\nHe proposes even more massive tax cuts than his Republican rivals, but casts his tax plan as a way to lift up middle-class families and stick it to Wall Street.\n\nAnd on top of all that, he boasts that he can\u2019t be bought by the special interests and advocacy groups that normally fund political campaigns.\n\nBut if Trump\u2019s success in New Hampshire has forced the GOP establishment to recognize it has a problem, neither conservative elites, nor reformers are rushing to embrace prescriptions that they see as underdeveloped, far-fetched and, in some cases, mean-spirited. They argue his success has been fueled by his persona, not his positions.\n\n\u201cObviously Trump has tapped into an anger felt throughout the country, and voters have good reason to be angry at Washington,\u201d said Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee and a sharp Trump critic. \u201cBut that anger isn't exclusive to any particular demographic and should demand serious policy prescriptions. Which Trump eschews.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how he stands on six big issues, and how those stances have helped him consolidate support among blue-collar voters.\n\nImmigration\n\nPerhaps no issue has galvanized Trump\u2019s supporters as much as his bellicose posture on immigration. Besides his push to build a wall on the border with Mexico, and his demand that Mexicans pay for it Trump has suggested rounding up and deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants. He also wants the birthright citizenship of their children revoked.\n\nWhile those ideas resonate with stressed voters who lost ground in the Great Recession and who see immigrants as competitors and even as freeloaders, they rankle reform conservatives as well as traditional business-minded Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe idea of building a wall just absolutely runs counter to the free market business ideals that you would think a businessman could wrap his head around,\u201d says Craig Regelbrugge, a lobbyist for the horticulture industry.\n\nMichael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nStrain, said that presidents like Ronald Reagan have courted voters with similar fears without being so divisive. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen presidents who have been able to do that but who haven\u2019t been morally offensive and unserious,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s also railed against temporary work visas, which he says hurt American workers. But Republican strategists worry that stance alienates Hispanic voters when the party seeks to broaden its base by appealing to both blue-collar workers and Hispanics.\n\nTrade\n\nTrump has called for as much as a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S. and a 35 percent tax on cars crossing the Mexico border, arguing his protectionist approach would bring high-paying manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis,\u201d Trump said at his New Hampshire victory speech on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen anymore.\u201d\n\nHe has also called out corporations like Apple, demanding they \u201cbuild their damn computers and things in this country.\u201d He boasts of \u201ca great relationship with the unions,\u201d and labor leaders worry Trump\u2019s message could appeal to their members.\n\n\u201cHe targets people like us. But what is he really pushing?\u201d said Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. Trumka has blasted Trump, who opposes raising the minimum wage, for \"a campaign fueled by contempt and exclusion.\"\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s plan for high tariffs might appeal to workers worried their jobs are disappearing overseas, trade experts say his proposals would actually hurt his blue-collar base by raising the price of cheap imported goods.\n\nTrump\u2019s position \u201cis out of whack with the Republican party four years ago,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThe question is how far out of whack is it with the Republican Party now?\u201d\n\nEntitlements\n\nWhile Trump has denounced Obamacare, he\u2019s also spoken approvingly of single-payer systems in the past, making it difficult to figure out his precise positions.\n\nTrump has vowed to oppose cuts to Social Security and Medicare and to ensure every American has health coverage, horrifying some on the right. \u201cIt was a red flag for me,\u201d radio host Rush Limbaugh said last week about Trump\u2019s promise not to leave anyone without access to needed care.\n\nUnlike Republican ideologues he doesn\u2019t want to reduce the size of government so much as make it competent from his perspective.\n\nPolicy analysts compare his platform to that of European populist parties, which have a more nativist appeal, vow to protect the safety net and put less of an emphasis on the social issues that have animated many conservatives in the U.S. for decades.\n\nTrump also supports allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies \u2014 a longstanding Democratic idea reflexively opposed by the GOP. But the idea may resonate with a public fed up with skyrocketing drug costs.\n\n\u201cWho better than Donald Trump to be your chief negotiator with the drug companies?\u201d said Dean Clancy, a veteran GOP health wonk backing Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nTaxes\n\nLike other GOP candidates, Trump proposes a massive tax cut that would benefit the top 1 percent more than middle-class \u2014 making it hard to believe, as Trump claims, that he\u2019d pay more under his own plan. (Trump appears to be the only Republican candidate to have once backed the \u201cwealth tax\u201d popularized by the French economist Thomas Piketty.)\n\nThere are a few populist pieces to Trump\u2019s plan. Under his proposal, the number of taxpayers who won\u2019t owe income taxes \u2014 Mitt Romney\u2019s famous 47 percent \u2014 would jump to 63 percent, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\n\nBut Trump has also been more willing to play up his man-of-the-people bona fides than some of his rivals.\n\nDuring a recent GOP debate, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey called raising taxes on the wealthy \u201cclass warfare,\u201d even though polls shows the idea is popular. In contrast, Trump often plugs his proposal to end the preferential treatment of carried interest that help private equity managers. And he isn\u2019t shy about dumping on the Wall Street types who actually aren\u2019t the prime beneficiaries of carried interest. \u201cThe hedge fund guys didn\u2019t build this country,\u201d he said last August.\n\nEducation\n\nTrump\u2019s anti-Common Core, pro-school choice positions are in line with the GOP and he\u2019s open to scrapping the Education Department. But Trump also sounds like liberal hero Sen. Elizabeth Warren when he talks about college loan debt.\n\n\u201cThese student loans are probably one of the only things that the government shouldn\u2019t make money from and yet it does,\u201d Trump wrote in his 2015 book \u201cCrippled America.\u201d\n\nThat line could resonate with voters across the political spectrum. Polling has found that a strong majority of Republicans, Democrats and independents believe that college loan debt is a major problem.\n\nDefense/National security\n\nTrump reassures voters fearful of terrorist attacks and America\u2019s place in the world with his calls for a military \u201cso big and so strong and so great\u201d that he says no one will mess with it. He\u2019s called for destroying the Islamic State, without saying how, and plugs his opposition to the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\nHe\u2019s also talked about barring Muslims from entering the country. And most recently, he defended waterboarding, going further than his rivals by saying he\u2019d \u201cbring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Trump has shown minimal understanding of some key foreign policy issues, once suggesting he got his advice on security matters from the Sunday shows. He\u2019s confused the Kurds with the Quds Force, and been unable to explain the nuclear triad \u2014 gaps that have not eaten into his support so far.\n\nAnd while he\u2019s called China and Mexico trade bullies, Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has become a pariah among other Republicans.\n\nAt a Dec. 15 debate, Trump said he would seek to block the Islamic State from using the Internet, even as he offered no details. \"ISIS is using the Internet better than we are using the Internet and it was our idea,\" he said, adding he would \"get our brilliant people from Silicon Valley\u201d to solve the problem.\n\nAdam Behsudi, Helena Bottemiller Evich, Paul Demko, Eric Engleman, Darren Goode, Kimberly Hefling, Jeremy Herb, Marianne Levine, Brian Mahoney, Katy O'Donnell and Tim Starks also contributed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "His challenges to GOP orthodoxy spur soul-searching among party elites about how to snag working-class voters.", "title": "Trump's 6 populist positions", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/donald-trump-working-class-voters-219231", "image": "http://static.politico.com/21/cb/b4cf83f240699df8c3e7a465c4a9/160212-donald-trump-1160-gty3.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "His challenges to GOP orthodoxy spur soul-searching among party elites about how to snag working-class voters.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "There are a few populist pieces to Trump\u2019s plan.\nEducationTrump\u2019s anti-Common Core, pro-school choice positions are in line with the GOP and he\u2019s open to scrapping the Education Department.\nUnder his proposal, the number of taxpayers who won\u2019t owe income taxes \u2014 Mitt Romney\u2019s famous 47 percent \u2014 would jump to 63 percent, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\nImmigrationPerhaps no issue has galvanized Trump\u2019s supporters as much as his bellicose posture on immigration.\nTrump\u2019s position \u201cis out of whack with the Republican party four years ago,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute."}
