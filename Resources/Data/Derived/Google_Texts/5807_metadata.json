This suggests Congress could be headed for a \u201cwave\u201d election or major shakeup in the November 2014 mid-term elections.\n\nRelated: What Liz Cheney\u2019s Flameout Says About the 2014 Midterm Elections\n\nThere\u2019s no way of telling right now whether the Republicans who control the House or the Democrats who control the Senate will pay a bigger price this fall for voter disgust over a Congress that hit rock bottom last year in the amount of legislation passed. It also shut down the government for 16 days last October in a fight over Obamacare funding.\n\nIn an appearance Thursday on NBC\u2019s \u201cTonight Show,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) called the government shutdown a \u201cvery predictable disaster\u201d that he warned fellow Republicans to avoid, but ultimately went along with it at the behest of colleagues intent on a standoff with President Obama over the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked up, I saw my colleagues going this way. And you learn that a leader without followers is simply a man taking a walk,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I said, \u2018You want to fight this fight? I'll go fight the fight with you.\u2019 But it was a very predictable disaster.\u201d\n\nBoehner, in his typically blunt fashion, offered some revealing insights into the challenges of ruling conservative Republicans in the House.\n\n\u201cSome members, I have to be the big brother figure,\u201d he said. \u201cSome, I have to be the father figure. Others, I have to be the dean of students or the principal. Some of them, I have to be the Gestapo.\n\nRelated: Five Members of Congress to Watch in 2014\n\n\u201cI like to describe my job as trying to get 218 frogs in a wheelbarrow long enough to pass a bill,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to do.\u201d\n\nThe highest ranking Republican in government, however, was careful to praise Tea Party members of Congress who he said bring \u201cgreat energy to the political process.\u201d But he took pot shots at a number of conservative political organizations \u2013 such as Club for Growth, among others \u2013 who purport to represent the Tea Party but are actually misleading or exploiting House members.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I could do that was conservative enough for them,\u201d Boehner said.\n\nDespite Gallup\u2019s most recent troubling findings about public discontent with Congress, the polling organization stressed that the political direction of any potential electoral wave is difficult to determine. That\u2019s because self-identified registered voters of both parties largely agree that most members of Congress do not deserve re-election. Eighteen percent of Republicans, the majority party in the House, say most members deserve re-election, identical to the percentage of Democrats saying so.\n\n\u201cVoters\u2019 wrath appears not to be directed toward one party in particular, as much as toward any incumbent member of Congress,\u201d according to Gallup.\n\nMany political experts predict that the GOP will retain control of the House, largely because of the benefits of redistricting, fundraising prowess and historical trends. Republicans also have improved their odds for winning back control of the Senate this fall, although they have blown similar advantages in the past.\n\n\u201cBut with so few voters saying they are willing to reelect their own representative, it suggests that many officeholders will be vulnerable, if not in the general election, then perhaps in the host of competitive primaries soon to take place,\u201d according to Gallup.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In another sign of public outrage over a dysfunctional and politically divided Congress, a record low percentage of registered voters now say their own House member deserves another chance while even fewer believe that most members of Congress should be reelected, according to a new Gallup poll.", "title": "Voters Give a Thumbs-Down to Their Own Lawmakers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/24/Gallup-Poll-Voters-Give-Thumbs-Down-Their-Own-Lawmakers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01042013_113_congress_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/24/Gallup-Poll-Voters-Give-Thumbs-Down-Their-Own-Lawmakers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01042013_113_congress_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In another sign of public outrage over a dysfunctional and politically divided Congress, a record low percentage of registered voters now say their own House member deserves another chance while even fewer believe that most members of Congress should be reelected, according to a new Gallup poll.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc980d\"", "article_summary": "A new Gallup poll shows that only 46 percent of voters approve of their own congressmen, while a dismal 17 percent believe most other members of Congress deserve to be reelected.\nThat\u2019s because self-identified registered voters of both parties largely agree that most members of Congress do not deserve re-election.\n\u201cVoters\u2019 wrath appears not to be directed toward one party in particular, as much as toward any incumbent member of Congress,\u201d according to Gallup.\nEighteen percent of Republicans, the majority party in the House, say most members deserve re-election, identical to the percentage of Democrats saying so.\nThe 17 percent level of approval is well below the roughly 40-percent threshold that has historically been associated with major electoral turnover, according to Gallup."}
