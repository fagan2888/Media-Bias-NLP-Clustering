TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA – A year after establishing the Florida Commission on Access to Civil Justice, Chief Justice Jorge Labarga expressed his thanks to the commission members for “tackling their mission with dedication and creativity.”

The chief justice noted that the commission, which he chairs, marked its first-year anniversary.

The 27-member Commission is made up of dedicated leaders from all three branches of government, The Florida Bar, the Florida Bar Foundation, civil legal aid providers, the business community, and many other members working together toward a common goal to ensure all Floridians have access to civil justice.

The Commission submitted an interim report to the Florida Supreme Court last month and is to submit its final report to the Court on June 30, 2016.

“The holiday and this anniversary, together, remind me of the deep gratitude I feel for the hard work that is being carried out to eliminate barriers that keep many low-income and moderate-income people from receiving the justice they seek in civil cases,” Labarga said. “The justice gap is a societal problem – and this commission is developing a societal answer.”

The full Commission will next meet on Feb. 12, 2016.

The interim report and more information can be found on the Commission’s website at flaccesstojustice.org.
