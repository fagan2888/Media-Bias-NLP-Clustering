San Francisco 49er rookie Chris Borland turned more than a few heads this week when he announced he was walking away from a financially promising NFL career due to worries about his long-term mental health.

As more is learned about the effects of repetitive head trauma and concussions — occupational facts of life in football — an increasing number of players who still have at least a few seasons left in them are hanging up their cleats. When a talented linebacker like Borland decides to do so at the tender age of 24, many wonder if this is the beginning of the end for professional football as it’s currently known.

As for the merry crew of U.S. House conservatives for whom brain damage is but a mere scratch, the game goes on. And on. And on.
