For the majority of women \u2014 those whose risk of developing breast cancer is average at best \u2014 getting mammograms earlier or more often raises the likelihood of cancer scares and unnecessary follow-up treatments, the task force said.\n\nFor women older than 74, the panel said there\u2019s insufficient scientific evidence to make a recommendation.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force said that some women in their 40s may elect to get mammograms after discussing the pros and cons with their doctors. But the group cautioned that for these women, screening mammograms catch few preventable cancers while raising the risk of false positives.\n\nThe panel also made clear that for women ages 40 to 74 who are at average risk of breast cancer, annual screening is more likely to lead to overtreatment than it is to save lives.\n\nThe new recommendations are likely to affect women\u2019s decisions about getting mammograms in very real ways as they guide insurers\u2019 decisions about what treatments to cover. The Affordable Care Act requires that the task force\u2019s strongest recommendations \u2014 in this case, a mammogram every two years for women ages 50 to 74 \u2014 must be offered to insured women without co-payment.\n\nThat does not apply when the task force deems a treatment to have net benefits that are less than \u201cmoderate or substantial.\u201d As a result, mammograms for women still in their 40s need not be offered without co-payment by insurers.\n\nAfter years of fervent activism, public health campaigns and medical practice, the mammogram has become an annual ritual for many women older than 40 in the United States. For some breast cancer advocacy groups, the benefits of that ritual have become an article of faith.\n\nSo when the task force first questioned that conventional wisdom in 2009 and said screening could start later and take place less often, the result was confusion and controversy.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, whose physicians are most likely to counsel women about breast cancer screening, recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40, as does the American College of Radiology. After years of offering the same advice, the American Cancer Society changed its guidelines last year and now suggests yearly mammograms starting at age 45, switching to once every other year at age 55.\n\n\u201cThe most important message is that women have a choice,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth Lin, a family physician at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington. \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman in your 40s, you could start at 40, wait till you\u2019re 50 or start in between. Those are certainly reasonable choices, given the evidence we have.\u201d\n\nNot everyone was as receptive to the task force\u2019s advice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t endorse these guidelines,\u201d said Dr. Catherine Dang, associate director of Cedars-Sinai\u2019s Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program. She said she would still advise her patients to get annual mammograms in their 40s.\n\nAnticipating the new guidelines, Congress last month passed a law requiring health insurance companies to pay for annual mammograms for women in their 40s.\n\nWith prospects for such resistance looming, the task force painstakingly outlined the scientific evidence at hand and weighed the fine balance of potential benefits and harms for a range of screening regimens.\n\nFor every 1,000 women with an average risk of developing breast cancer, a mammogram every other year starting at age 40 and continuing until 50 might avert a single death from breast cancer, according to a detailed analysis published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. But that benefit came with a cost \u2014 over 10 years, those screenings would lead to 576 false positives and 58 biopsies that would prove benign.\n\nThe most extreme risk is that women will wind up getting unnecessary treatment for breast cancer because the screening tests will find small tumors that would never have caused harm if they had gone undetected and were left alone. In a comparison of two groups of 1,000 women in their 40s \u2014 one that got mammograms every two years and the other that did not \u2014 the mammogram group would over a decade have two more women who underwent treatment that was fraught with risk and provided no benefit.\n\nThe recommendations do not address women with a family history of breast cancer or who otherwise face a heightened risk of breast cancer.\n\nDr. Michael LeFevre, the immediate past chairman of the task force, said the panel\u2019s mandate is to assess the scientific evidence on screening tests, not to make decisions on insurance coverage or other politically charged matters.\n\n\u201cWe cannot exaggerate our interpretation of the science to ensure coverage of a service,\u201d the task force members wrote in an editorial that accompanied their analysis. \u201cThis would lead to confusion regarding the state of science versus the politics of coverage.\u201d\n\nAnother editorial from the journal\u2019s top editors emphasized that point as well, chiding those who accused the task force of restricting women\u2019s access to mammography.\n\n\u201cGuidelines that mislead women about the net health benefits they can expect from mammography would disrespect our mothers, wives, daughters and sisters,\u201d they wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s douse the flames and clear the smoke so that we can see clearly what the evidence shows and where we need to focus efforts to fill gaps in our knowledge\u201d about breast cancer screening.\n\nAs the task force made clear, those gaps are substantial. The panel said it had insufficient scientific evidence to make recommendations on whether new forms of mammography, such as digital breast tomosynthesis, could shift the balance of risks and benefits. Nor could they offer recommendations on the value of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging to women with especially dense breasts.\n\nAnd they lamented that the benefits and harms of mammography for women 75 and older were unclear because this population is so poorly represented in studies.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Breast cancer screening recommendations clarify science but muddy political waters", "Description": "The experts who sparked a passionate debate over the value of mammograms as a tool to screen for breast cancer are doubling down on the recommendations that earned them the ire of cancer groups, women\u2019s groups and a large contingent in Congress.
