The article below, written by the late Jesse Long-Bey (Omowale Ankobia), should lay to rest any illusions those who voted for soon-to-be Mayor Mike Duggan have, in particular regarding his concern for the Black majority population of Detroit. An earlier VOD article, linked below this one, discussed Duggan\u2019s other alliances with the corporate elite who are seeking to drive poor and Black Detroiters from their city, by any means they choose.\n\nDetroit police chief James Craig (l) with EM Kevyn Orr (r), who appointed him.\n\nThat includes the vicious, Gestapo-like raids that Detroit Police Chief James Craig has visited so far on the Colony Arms Apartments on East Jefferson, the Martin Luther King Apartments on East Lafayette, and the Grand River/14th St./Joy Rd. neighborhood on Detroit\u2019s west side. The mass media has reported these raids directly from the mouths of the police, with no investigation of whether the arrests, conducted by hundreds of police from multiple agencies, were valid, or just a means of further ridding the city of its Black and poor population, particularly its youth.\n\nThere are few job opportunities for them, half the public schools have been closed, virtually no recreation centers are left, and now the State has taken over Detroit\u2019s Belle Isle, the largest urban island park in the country. State troopers will see to it that Detroit youth are denied access to the island to \u201ccruise,\u201d while suburbanite youth continue the time-honored tradition down Gratiot and Woodward Avenues.\n\nThe Oreo-cookie trio of EM Kevyn Orr, Duggan, and Chief Craig, who hails from the Los Angeles Police Department, one of the most vicious in the country, bodes ill for us in the coming year.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated VOD stories:\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2013/08/05/no-to-duggan-napoleon-and-other-gangsta-politicians-take-it-to-the-streets-to-save-detroit/\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2013/10/22/families-demand-no-police-state-under-detroit-chief-craig-top-cops/\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2013/10/18/httpvoiceofdetroit-net20131018chief-craig-intensifies-detroit-police-state-march-mon-june-21-9-am-as-trial-of-aiyana-jones-father-opens-in-frank-murphy-to-new-dpd-hq/\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2013/04/29/police-slaughtered-matthew-joseph-23-on-detroit-streets/\n\nRelated Detroit News articles on suspension of excessive force constraints on DPD, and multi-agency raids on Detroit\u2019s poor neighborhoods:\n\nhttp://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131223/METRO01/312230068#ixzz2omAAAcIW\n\nhttp://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131217/METRO01/312170088\n\nhttp://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131115/METRO01/311150073\n\nhttp://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131203/METRO01/312030094", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://voiceofdetroit.net/2013/12/27/no-detroit-police-state-in-the-new-year-duggan-fired-medical-examiner-in-malice-green-case/", "site_name": "VOICE OF DETROIT:  The city's independent newspaper, unbossed and unbought", "author": "Diane Bukowski", "type": "article", "title": "NO DETROIT POLICE STATE IN THE NEW YEAR!
