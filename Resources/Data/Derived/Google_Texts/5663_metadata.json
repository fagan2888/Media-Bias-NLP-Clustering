Boasberg in Washington, D.C.\n\nOn Friday, Boasberg issued a preliminary injunction that barred immigration officers from detaining immigrants solely for the purpose of \u201cdeterring future immigration.\u201d\n\nImmigration officials greatly expanded the use of detention facilities for families last year when a surge in families with children, as well as unaccompanied minors, from El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua overwhelmed U.S. border agents.\n\nA year ago, fewer than 100 spaces were available to hold children and teens who were caught crossing illegally with a parent. But more than 950 parents with children are held in U.S. detention centers today, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement figures.\n\nThey include 509 parents and children at the Karnes County Residential Center in Karnes City, Texas; 359 parents and children at the South Texas Family Regional Center in Dilley, Texas; and 86 at the Berks County Family Shelter in Leesport, Penn.\n\nDetention facilities for families are supposed to have special medical care available, access to social services and schoolteachers, as well as areas for children to play and private rooms to meet with lawyers.\n\nCritics say the government should avoid locking up parents and children who enter the country illegally.\n\nMany have relatives in the United States who can house children and their parents while their asylum cases are considered in court, and can pay a financial bond or provide other assurances that the families will appear for scheduled hearings.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t lock up people in order to send a message to other people,\u201d Judy Rabinovitz, deputy director of American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrants Rights Project, said in a telephone interview from New York. \u201cI hope they would use this as an opportunity to rethink their policy,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @ByBrianBennett", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Immigration officials reviewing order to stop family detentions at border", "date": "2015-02-23", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The Obama administration has not decided how to respond to a court ruling last week that ordered the government to stop detaining nearly 1,000 immigrant families as part of a policy meant to discourage other Central American families from illegally entering the United States.", "title": "Immigration officials reviewing order to stop family detentions at border", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-immigration-families-20150223-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54eb8a23/turbine/la-na-immigration-families-20150223", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "immigration, detention, border", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82895613", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "immigration, detention, border", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "The Obama administration has not decided how to respond to a court ruling last week that ordered the government to stop detaining nearly 1,000 immigrant families as part of a policy meant to discourage other Central American families from illegally entering the United States.
