A $1.6 billion subway set to open in 2019 could provide an economic boost, bringing customers from outside while taking residents out to jobs. But speedier transit also brings added development pressures, especially in a pocket of the city coveted for its location.\n\nAt the same time, many Chinese Americans have scattered across the Bay Area, reducing the customer base of San Francisco\u2019s historic Chinese center. Banquet houses that once hosted celebrations are closed, with some making way for modern restaurants and others sitting empty.\n\nCan the birthplace of Chinese America maintain its heart in the midst of a race for space?\n\n\u201cIt is the last frontier, when you think about it,\u201d said Bertrand Pellegrin, a brand specialist with the firm b. on brand who is interested in helping preserve the neighborhood. \u201cIt is one of the last central places downtown that has not been completely gentrified and overdeveloped.\u201d\n\nSome civic leaders say traditional values and zoning regulations should protect the neighborhood of 15,000 to 18,000 people against too much development. Plus, they say, who would want to put a tech startup company in an older building without elevators or commercial janitorial service?\n\nOthers say, however, that younger generations of property owners may take the money from the rising land values and run.\n\n\u201cThe northeastern waterfront has always been the biggest battleground for property and development because it\u2019s so beautiful. The battle has always been to limit growth,\u201d said Howard Wong, a founder of a group opposed to the subway construction. \u201cA huge transit development will make that situation worse.\u201d\n\nAnd Chinatown leaders don\u2019t even agree on what the district should be, other than a gateway for immigrants and destination for tourists.\n\nTake 1920c, a fledgling co-sharing business launched in April, which offers work space to freelancers and to socially conscious startups. The people who bounded into the sunny yellow space one recent morning were young, plugged into wireless devices and, in many cases, not Chinese.", "article_metadata": {"description": "San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown clings to roots amid tech boom", "title": "San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown clings to roots amid tech boom", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown clings to roots amid tech boom", "title": "San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown clings to roots amid tech boom", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/25/san_franciscos_chinatown_clings_to_roots_amid_tech_boom/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/new-chinatown.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown clings to roots amid tech boom", "title": "San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown clings to roots amid tech boom", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/new-chinatown.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Janie Har", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Can the birthplace of Chinese America maintain its heart in the midst of a race for space?\nIt\u2019s the birthplace of Chinese America, and to some extent, the broader Asian America that descended from immigration over the Pacific Ocean throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.\nNow, Chinatown faces powerful economic and demographic challenges that could upend its identity as the city undergoes an unprecedented growth in tech jobs.\nAt the same time, many Chinese Americans have scattered across the Bay Area, reducing the customer base of San Francisco\u2019s historic Chinese center.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 For a century and a half, San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, the nation\u2019s oldest, has sheltered waves of immigrants seeking a new life."}
