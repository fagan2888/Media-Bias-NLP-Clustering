Romana Klee (cropped for size)/CC by 2.0\n\nYou've heard the phrase, probably while you were half-watching some science show on PBS, but truth is you don't really know what it means to \"donate your body to science.\" You suspect your cadaver would be used in an anatomy class at some med school somewhere, but the fact is your most intimate \"donation\" could just as easily end up in a science experiment or be used by a surgeon test-driving a new medical technology. Unfortunately, it's the one thing no one sees coming \u2014 once you've offered your body to science, you have no say in where it goes. Another thing you possibly do not know is you need to meet some unexpected criteria for your gift to be accepted.\n\nSo let\u2019s begin. There\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat, and, as this strangely appropriate proverb would suggest, there\u2019s more than one way to donate your body to science. All of those ways, though, undoubtedly will start with a difficult conversation, and this is true whether you contact your nearest university or place a call to a professional society, such as the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine or the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB). During the initial discussion, you will note that some people still refer to \u201ccadavers,\u201d but many professionals now encourage using the more sensitive term \u201cdeceased donor.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy infant son was a donor for research, and I think of him as a contributor to research and a hero, not a \u2018cadaver,\u2019\u201d said Sarah Gray, director of marketing and public affairs at AATB.\n\nIf you intend your body be used in a med school anatomy class, it\u2019s probably wisest to get in touch with a university (though they may not guarantee your remains will be used in that way). If you speak with someone at a professional society, they can recommend one of the 10 national organizations that supply the needs of researchers and other science professionals around the world. In particular, an AATB-accredited non-transplant anatomical donation organization would abide by the highest industry standards and a code of ethics.\n\nEcorche Ever Falling, CC by 2.0\n\nNo matter where you turn, you will be expected to answer a series of health-related questions to see if you qualify and, unfortunately, many people don\u2019t make it past this point.\n\n\u201cEverybody who calls up who wants to be a donor. We\u2019re probably taking only 30 percent of those,\u201d said Michael Pierre, lab manager at BioGift Anatomical, a whole body donation company located in Portland, Ore.\n\nAt BioGift, this early screening involves 22 medical/social questions that must be answered before the next set of questions, appearing on the pre-registration papers, arrive in the mail; other organizations follow a similar process. All these many questions will assemble a rough medical portrait and also screen out those who have communicable diseases, with special emphasis placed on hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, and syphilis. Usually, they will weed out anyone who weighs more than the limit. (Yes, even in death, you can be fat-shamed.)\n\nIf you pass this hurdle and qualify for pre-registration, you will receive authorization forms and instructions explaining the donation process and cards to be distributed to loved ones and health care providers. Sometimes, though, the process does not involve the donor. A next of kin can register on a donor\u2019s behalf, depending on the circumstance, either before or after death. For instance, if you have Alzheimer\u2019s, your nearest loved ones may act in your interest even before you die, though more commonly family members register their loved ones only after death.\n\n\u201cWe currently have 18,000 people pre-registered for our program,\u201d said Kana Neibert, managing supervisor at Anatomy Gifts Registry, a non-profit scientific organization based in Hanover, Md. According to Neibert, her organization has an average intake of about 70 bodies each month with more than half of those cadavers being \u201cfolks that signed up on their own.\u201d\n\nArteries of the Face and Skull University of Liberpool, CC by 2.0\n\nSo now you are preregistered, and in good time you hear the inevitable heavenly call and so your soul returns home. What happens next?\n\nAfter your death is confirmed and reported, your family or a caregiver (or a hospice representative) will contact your donor organization and, once again, all the questions on the medical/social screening survey must be answered. This is necessary to gain a precise picture of your medical health at the moment of death. Sadly, even those who passed a rigorous early screening may be turned away now for any number of possible reasons.\n\n\u201cThe coroner has jurisdiction over us, and if they need to do an autopsy, they do, and that person is no longer a donor,\u201d Pierre explained. While this is a rare scenario, other more likely reasons why a donation could be rejected include some previously undisclosed communicable disease, traumatic injury to tissues (resulting from, say, a car crash), a weight gain, or some other medical issue.\n\nHowever, if the cadaver is accepted, the donation process whirls into motion. A lab technician will draw blood to test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and HIV, even as arrangements for transporting the body are being made. In almost all cases, the body will arrive at the facility before the test results do and the organization sets to work.\n\n\u201cWe are making arrangements for maintaining proper storage and proceeding with the donation,\u201d said Melinda Ellsworth, vice president of Donor Services, at Science Care, possibly the largest company in the industry, headquartered in Phoenix, Ariz. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a more in depth medical history, looking at the body, and at the same time we\u2019re working with a network of clients.\u201d Sometimes, all hopes are dashed when a test for infectious diseases comes back positive.\n\n\u201cIf the test is positive, we notify the family,\u201d Neibert explained, and Pierre said he does the same: \u201cWe suggest in some cases they go to the doctor to be tested,\u201d he said. Only a small percentage of donations test positive, Neibert says, and Pierre figures it\u2019s about one out of every 30. In any event, a donated body will not be returned even if it is rejected for reasons of infection. \u201cWe keep our word and cremate the remains and return them to the family,\u201d Pierre said. In the majority of cases, though, the donation proceeds as planned.\n\nThe Anatomy Lesson by Rembrandt Public Domain\n\nAs the link between cadavers and scientists, the donation organizations are busy making arrangements to fulfill the wishes of their clients. Ellsworth says Science Care can accommodate most any need whether that means shipping ready-to-use tissue directly to a biomedical researcher halfway around the world or setting up an education event at a University facility, where 150 orthopedic surgeons will learn how to use a new robotic technology for hip replacement operations. No matter. As soon as a donated body is received, specialists are looking at it to identify what they can procure \u201cfrom a tissue perspective\u201d to meet client needs. Their goal is simple: to maximize the number of projects each donor body supplies.\n\n\u201cIn general, Science Care is able to place, on average, a donation with five medical research training programs,\u201d Ellsworth said.\n\nAfter the maximum amount of tissue has been recovered and placed with medical institutions, the remainder is sent to a crematorium, or, in the case of Anatomy Gifts Registry, cremated at their special in-house facility. Within six weeks, the ashes will be ready to be picked up or mailed to the family. One final task must be completed, though. A letter of gratitude is mailed to the family \u201cletting them know the research and education their gift benefitted,\u201d Neibert said.\n\nSo who donates their bodies to science?\n\n\"Lots of veterans \u2014 one in three of our donors are vets,\" said Ellsworth, who happened to check the demographics (including professions) before speaking with Medical Daily. \"And homemaker is at the top of the list. But it\u2019s also teachers, truck drivers, managers\u2026,\u201d her voice trailed off. \u201cEverybody has a specific story, either their loved one was suffering from a particular illness or they want to help other people live longer and healthier lives. It\u2019s just in their nature to do everything they can.\u201d\n\nPierre finds many of the people contacting his organization are \u201cin the medical field.\u201d This would make perfect sense, according to Dr. Justine Schober, director of Academic research for University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. After all, only scientists and health care professionals know how to go about a donation, since, in her words, \"the mechanism to donate your body is not understood by most people, the forms are not freely available, and you have to go online and figure out where the registries are and what to do.\" Schober looks forward to the day when the body donation process becomes more developed \u2014 easy, just like donating an organ, which you can sign up for whenever you renew your driver's license.\n\nIn the meantime, no matter how confusing the process may be, there appears to be a sharp increase in the number of donors of late.\n\nHead anatomy Patrick J. Lynch, CC by 2.0\n\n\u201cOn an annual basis, we\u2019re looking at doubling what we had the year before,\u201d Neibert said. Pierre sees a similar trend and suggests the sharp increase is like the surge that occurred in 1986 after the Catholic Church \u201csaid it was OK to cremate.\u201d Once that happened, he explained, \u201ccremation spiked. In most states and regions, cremation is more popular than burial today. And now body donation is moving just like cremation.\u201d Though everybody assumes it\u2019s about economics \u2014 after all, by donating your body to science you will be helping your loved ones avoid funeral costs \u2014 Pierre is quick to say he believes exactly the opposite is true.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with death, you\u2019re dealing with emotions, and when you can turn negative emotions into something positive, a lot of people appreciate that,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople get consoled knowing Mom\u2019s body is going to be useful to future generations after she\u2019s gone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "medical research, education, anatomy, medical school", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Though donating your body to science means your gift will advance medical research or technology in some way, it also means you have no say in where your cadaver goes or which branch of science it supports.", "title": "What Does It Mean To Donate Your Body To Science?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/greatest-gift-what-happens-when-you-donate-your-body-science-326358", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/20/corpse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Though donating your body to science means your gift will advance medical research or technology in some way, it also means you have no say in where your cadaver goes or which branch of science it supports.", "title": "What Does It Mean To Donate Your Body To Science?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/greatest-gift-what-happens-when-you-donate-your-body-science-326358", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/20/corpse.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/20/corpse.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-03-20T07:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-20T11:31:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Though donating your body to science means your gift will advance medical research or technology in some way, it also means you have no say in where your cadaver goes or which branch of science it supports."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2483\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat, and, as this strangely appropriate proverb would suggest, there\u2019s more than one way to donate your body to science.\nRomana Klee (cropped for size)/CC by 2.0You've heard the phrase, probably while you were half-watching some science show on PBS, but truth is you don't really know what it means to \"donate your body to science.\"\nTheir goal is simple: to maximize the number of projects each donor body supplies.\nIn particular, an AATB-accredited non-transplant anatomical donation organization would abide by the highest industry standards and a code of ethics.\nUnfortunately, it's the one thing no one sees coming \u2014 once you've offered your body to science, you have no say in where it goes."}
