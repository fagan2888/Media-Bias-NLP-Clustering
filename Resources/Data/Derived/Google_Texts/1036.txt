Over the weekend, Richard Sherman lit up the Internet with a sideline interview completed after he helped the Seattle Seahawks clinch their spot in the Super Bowl. “Well, I’m the best corner in the game,” he declared. “When you try me with a sorry receiver like [San Francisco 49er Michael] Crabtree, that’s the result you’re going to get. Don’t you ever talk about me!”

Deadspin collected the predictable, dispiriting assemblage of racist tweets from those who’d watched the Seahawks game; a black man shouting on television will always be scary to some. But what was notable, here, was what Sherman didn’t do. He didn’t curse, or threaten anyone with anything except a loss, in the future. He seemed to be speaking from a prepared speech in defense of his own talents against anyone who’d challenge them. Isn’t this exactly what football is about?

What do people who considered Sherman “classless” think that they had been watching for hours before? Football is a game in which strong men bash their heads into one another in order to gain ground; there’s nothing about it that’s particularly classy. Quarterbacks tend to dance in the end zone, unless they showily indicate they have a special bond with God that allows them to win. Sherman was making text what had been subtext — that he and Crabtree (and the Seahawks and 49ers) were engaged in a game of oneupmanship that could only have one winner. To dismiss him is to pretend that football has some loftier purpose, that there are unwritten rules governing behavior after what is in every other of its particulars all about intimidation. Since when is that most violent of sports governed by notions of gentlemanly decorum? And who gets to make those rules, anyway?
