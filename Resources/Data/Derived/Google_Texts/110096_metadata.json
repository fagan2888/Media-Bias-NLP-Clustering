Public and private insurance continues to cover annual mammograms for women age 40 to 50, strengthened by an Affordable Care Act requirement.\n\n\u201cIf the new recommendations are proven to be successful, specific implementation barriers should be identified and addressed to improve new guidelines implementation,\u201d Dehkordy said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1IiXh9x American Journal of Preventive Medicine, online April 2, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKBN0NF1XJ20150424", "sailthru.author": "Kathryn Doyle", "Author": "Kathryn Doyle", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "(Reuters Health) - Despite 2009 recommendations to stop giving women under 50 screening mammograms, the rate of first mammograms occurring at age 40 is on the", "title": "U.S. data show that mammograms still often begin at 40", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, CANCER, BREAST, SCREENING", "sailthru.title": "U.S. data show that mammograms still often begin at 40", "keywords": "US,CANCER,BREAST,SCREENING,Women's Health,Managed Healthcare (TRBC),Mental Illness,Breast Cancer,Corporate Events,Science,Psychology,Life and Health Insurance (TRBC),Cancer,Public Health,Clinical Medicine,Anxiety Disorders", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;CANCER;BREAST;SCREENING;Women's Health;Managed Healthcare (TRBC);Mental Illness;Breast Cancer;Corporate Events;Science;Psychology;Life and Health Insurance (TRBC);Cancer;Public Health;Clinical Medicine;Anxiety Disorders", "WT.cg_n": "Life", "sailthru.description": "(Reuters Health) - Despite 2009 recommendations to stop giving women under 50 screening mammograms, the rate of first mammograms occurring at age 40 is on the", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-24T17:48:50+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthNews;everything;ShellEnergy;AllianzInsurance;AllianzInvestments;Allianz;cfaglobal;shipping;nonegative;PorscheCayenne;ubs;Intel;PFG;Fidelity2014;TCS_IN;ABG_IN;CathayPacific_US;MOC_US", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "U.S.+data+show+that+mammograms+still+often+begin+at+40", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKBN0NF1XJ20150424", "WT.cg_s": "Health", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Despite 2009 recommendations to stop giving women under 50 screening mammograms, the rate of first mammograms occurring at age 40 is on the", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "DCSext.PageTotal": 3, "DCSext.rAuthor": "Kathryn Doyle", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/life/health/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-healthNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Despite 2009 recommendations to stop giving women under 50 screening mammograms, the rate of first mammograms occurring at age 40 is on the", "title": "U.S. data show that mammograms still often begin at 40", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-breast-screening-idUSKBN0NF1XJ20150424", "article": {"section": "Life", "tag": "US,CANCER,BREAST,SCREENING,Women's Health,Managed Healthcare (TRBC),Mental Illness,Breast Cancer,Corporate Events,Science,Psychology,Life and Health Insurance (TRBC),Cancer,Public Health,Clinical Medicine,Anxiety Disorders", "published_time": "2015-04-24T17:48:50+0000", "modified_time": "2015-04-24T17:48:50+0000", "author": "Kathryn Doyle"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Fri Apr 24 17:48:50 UTC 2015", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2882\"", "article_summary": "Public and private insurance continues to cover annual mammograms for women age 40 to 50, strengthened by an Affordable Care Act requirement.\nThe American Cancer Society, a nonprofit corporation, disagreed with the 2009 guideline, and continues to recommend that yearly mammograms begin at age 40.\n(Reuters Health) - Despite 2009 recommendations to stop giving women under 50 screening mammograms, the rate of first mammograms occurring at age 40 is on the increase, according to a new study.\nThere may be a similar delay for uptake of the 2009 USPSTF recommendations, she said.\nDehkordy\u2019s team used data from surveys in the years before and after the USPSTF recommendation \u2013 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2012 - to look at patterns in women\u2019s use of mammograms by age."}
