Attendance expected to be light according to some Tweeps \u2014 barrett marson (@barrettmarson) January 25, 2016\n\nNot the first Snapchat threat\n\nThis is not the first time Snapchat has been used to make a threat against a Valley school.\n\nIn September, a 16-year-old student at Sierra Linda High School was arrested and suspended for a Snapchat post that showed students in a school hallway with the text \"Planning the school shooting\" and smiling emojis.\n\n[RELATED: School shooting threat on Snapchat prompts arrest, suspension]\n\nA teenager in Colorado spotted the post and reported it.\n\nAccording to the Phoenix Police Department, the teen who was arrested and suspended admitted he was behind the post, but claimed it was a prank.\n\nSnapchat is a mobile messaging app that is particularly popular with teens and young adults. It allows users to send photos and videos that are deleted within seconds. In addition to Snaps, which last up to 10 seconds, users also can send Stories, which are Snaps that last for up to 24 hours.\n\nAlthough Snaps vanish from Snapchats servers, there is nothing to stop users from capturing screenshots of Snaps on their phones or tablets.\n\nFourth threat at a Chandler school in less than a week\n\nLast week, students at Willis Junior High School were evacuated for a time because of a bomb threat. The threat came a day after a series of school threats, not just across the Valley, but throughout the country.\n\nChandler's San Tan Junior High and Hancock Elementary were among the dozens of U.S. schools placed on lockdown or evacuated last Tuesday. The students were released as usual at the end of the day. Nothing of concern was found at any of the schools that received threats.\n\nThe Chandler Police Department does not believe Wednesday's incident at Willis was connected to Tuesday's threats.\n\nThe Chandler Police Department and Chandler Unified School District are offering a $3,000 reward for information about the person or people responsible for the bomb threat and subsequent evacuation.\n\n[RELATED: Reward offered for information about bomb threat at Chandler school]\n\nReporter Amanda Goodman contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
