We are hoping the train will act as a conduit between the quay and Poole Park,\u201d he said.\n\nPart of the ticket price will go towards off-setting the carbon footprint and they aim for a carbon neutral certificate next year.\n\nThe couple came to the town from Bromsgrove and Kris was a police officer for 14 years before a career change to catering and tourism.\n\nThe Rocket can carry around 60 passengers, is accessible to disabled people and will be supporting events in the town.\n\nThe return of the land train was welcomed by Graham Richardson, Poole\u2019s tourism manager. \u201cIt is really good to see it back again. It has been a big attraction for Poole and it\u2019s great to see it return,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "AFTER a two-year break the popular Poole land train is back on track, ferrying visitors between the park and the quay.", "title": "VIDEO: Land train back in town for summer", "og": {"site_name": "Bournemouth Echo", "name": "VIDEO: Land train back in town for summer", "title": "VIDEO: Land train back in town for summer", "url": "http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/11220921.VIDEO__Land_train_back_in_town_for_summer/", "image": "http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/resources/images/3031942/", "type": "website", "description": "AFTER a two-year break the popular Poole land train is back on track, ferrying visitors between the park and the quay."}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/resources/images/3031942/"}, "description": "AFTER a two-year break the popular Poole land train is back on track, ferrying visitors between the park and the quay.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "VIDEO: Land train back in town for summer"}, "vr": {"category": "News", "type": "Text"}, "fb": {"app_id": 205049739509691}, "keywords": "Bournemouth, Poole, Purbeck, Christchurch, East Dorset, New Forest, North Dorset, news, Dorset, Hampshire, A31, Spur Road, beach, Sandbanks, Boscombe Surf Reef, murder, roadworks, Bournemouth Air Festival, Red Arrows, Swine Flu, Gilbert the whale", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "News, Poole News, Rockley Rocket Land Train Back In Poole For Summer"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa3d\"", "article_summary": "AFTER a two-year break the popular Poole land train is back on track, ferrying visitors between the park and the quay.\nWe are hoping the train will act as a conduit between the quay and Poole Park,\u201d he said.\nThe return of the land train was welcomed by Graham Richardson, Poole\u2019s tourism manager.\nThe land train has been a common sight in the town for the last 12 years and provides a hop-on, hop-off service as well as a town tour.\n\u201cBeing new to Poole ourselves, we realised that everyone knew the quay but not everyone knows the park, and it\u2019s beautiful."}
