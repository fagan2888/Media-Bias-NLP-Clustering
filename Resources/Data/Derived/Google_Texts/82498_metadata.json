Hearings have exposed how the abortion company likely violated federal laws to sell the body parts.\n\nThe measure also repealed the abortion-funding Obamacare legislation and Obama cited that as the primary reason for vetoing the overall bill. The vote override vote comes just days after more than half a million Americans are expected to March for Life in the nation\u2019s capital and solemnly mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, which has resulted in the deaths of 58 million unborn babies since 1973.\n\nThe House voted 240-181 to de-fund Planned Parenthood with Republicans voting 239-3 for the bill and Democrats voting 1-178 against it. Unfortunately, with so many pro-abortion Democrats voting against the bill, it does not appear the House will achieve the two-thirds majority needed to override Obama\u2019s veto. If every member votes, pro-life advocates need 290 votes to override the veto.\n\nSIGN THE PETITION! Congress Must De-Fund Planned Parenthood Immediately\n\nAlthough Obama vetoed the bill, SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser said the vote is important because it shows a similar de-funding bill can get to a pro-life president in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe reconciliation process which brought this bill to the president\u2019s desk is the most important process because it is the one way to avoid a Senate filibuster, ensuring a similar bill could go to pro-life president in 2017,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the first bill ever to get to the president\u2019s desk that would achieve this longtime pro-life goal. We applaud the House and Senate\u2019s passage of this reconciliation legislation as the most important vehicle for actually achieving the goal of defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan is not shocked at President Barack Obama today vetoed a bill that would repeal Obamacare and de-fund the Planned Parenthood abortion business. He promised the House would hold a vote to override the veto.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that someone named Obama vetoed a bill repealing Obamacare. But we will hold a vote to override this veto, taking this process all the way to the end under the Constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing. The idea that Obamacare is the law of the land for good is a myth. This law will collapse under its own weight, or it will be repealed. Because all those rules and procedures Senate Democrats have used to block us from doing this? That\u2019s all history.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have shown now that there is a clear path to repealing Obamacare without 60 votes in the Senate. So, next year, if we\u2019re sending this bill to a Republican president, it will get signed into law,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cObamacare will be gone. And then, for all the people who have seen their premiums go up, for people who have lost their plan or their doctor, for people who have to deal with all the mandates, the restrictions, and the red tape, we can replace this law with a truly patient-centered health care system. It\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d\n\nThe bill would block, for one year, most federal payments to Planned Parenthood. At least 89% of federal funding of Planned Parenthood would be blocked by this bill. The bill would repeal a number of major components of the Obamacare health law, including two of the major provisions that will lead to rationing of lifesaving care \u2014 the \u201cIndependent Payment Advisory Board\u201d and the \u201cexcess benefits tax.\u201d\n\nIn August, Senate Democrats defeated an effort to revoke taxpayer funding for the Planned Parenthood abortion business by filibustering the bill and preventing a vote on it. Republicans were unable to secure the 60 voted needed to invoke cloture and stop debate on the bill, allowing an up or down vote. Republicans could only get 53 votes to shut off debate.\n\nThen, in September, Senate Democrats voted to defeat a government funding bill that would de-fund the Planned Parenthood abortion business after it was caught in a series of 10 videos selling aborted babies and their body parts. The Senate voted 52 to 47 against ending debate.\n\nDozens of leading pro-life groups have already indicated their support for the bill, including the National Right to Life Committee. In a letter to members of Congress that NRLC provided to LifeNews.com, the group indicated it strongly supports the bill to de-fund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cNRLC strongly supports the language in the bill that would block, for one year, most federal payments to affiliates of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA). It would close the largest pipeline for federal funding of Planned Parenthood, Medicaid, and apply as well to the CHIP and the Title V and Title XX block grant programs, thus covering roughly 89% of all federal funds to Planned Parenthood. The amounts denied to Planned Parenthood in effect are reallocated to community health centers,\u201d the pro-life group explained.\n\n\u201cOver one-third of all abortions in the U.S. are performed at PPFA-affiliated facilities. Longstanding objections to the massive federal funding of PPFA have been reinforced by recent widely publicized undercover videos, which illuminate the callous brutality that occurs daily in these abortion mills,\u201d NRLC added.\n\nThe reconciliation bill also repeals portions of Obamacare,including its rationing components. With regard to the rationing aspects of Obamacare, NRLC strongly supports a repeal.\n\n\u201cIn addition, NRLC has always opposed the Obamacare law and advocated its repeal. With respect to H.R. 3762, we particularly endorse the components that would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) and the \u201cexcess benefits tax\u201d (\u201cCadillac Tax\u201d), both dangerous mechanisms that would ultimately contribute to the rationing of lifesaving care,\u201d the right to life group said.\n\nLeading pro-life groups that also support the reconciliation bill to de-fund Planned Parenthood include Susan B. Anthony List, National Right to Life, Family Research Council, March for Life, Concerned Women for America, Students for Life, Priests for Life, Operation Rescue, and American Life League, among others.\n\nA new Congressional report finds that de-funding the Planned Parenthood abortion business \u2014 even for one year \u2014 would save \u201cseveral thousand\u201d unborn babies from the nightmare of abortion. The report also finds de-funding Planned Parenthood would save the federal government $235 million.\n\nThe expose\u2019 videos catching Planned Parenthood officials selling the body parts of aborted babies have shocked the nation. Here is a list of all eleven:\n\nIn the first video : Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I\u2019m not gonna crush that part, I\u2019m gonna basically crush below, I\u2019m gonna crush above, and I\u2019m gonna see if I can get it all intact.\u201d\n\n: Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I\u2019m not gonna crush that part, I\u2019m gonna basically crush below, I\u2019m gonna crush above, and I\u2019m gonna see if I can get it all intact.\u201d In the second video: Planned Parenthood\u2019s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, \u201cI want a Lamborghini\u201d as she negotiated the best price for baby parts.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, \u201cI want a Lamborghini\u201d as she negotiated the best price for baby parts.
