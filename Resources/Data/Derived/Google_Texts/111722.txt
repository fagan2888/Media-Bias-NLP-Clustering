The Rev. Al Sharpton said Thursday that he does not think rape allegations against Bill Cosby are racially motivated and that the comedian must “answer to someone” instead of staying silent.

Mr. Sharpton, who knows Mr. Cosby personally, told entertainment reporter Bill McCuddy “He needs to talk to somebody. He needs to talk … He has to answer to someone,” the New York Post reported Thursday.

The MSNBC host and activist added that he was “very disappointed” in Mr. Cosby, and that he would be happy to conduct an interview covering the resurfaced allegations.

Mr. Sharpton has also made headlines this week. The New York Times reported Tuesday that he owes the federal government $4.5 million in taxes.

“A lot of people don’t like the fact that President Obama’s the president. A lot of people do not like the fact that Bill de Blasio won for mayor. And they certainly don’t like that I’m still here, and I ain’t going nowhere,” Mr. Sharpton said at a press conference in Harlem, Politico reported Thursday.

Mr. Sharpton said that he is in the process of negotiating with the government to obtain a lower penalty on his back taxes, but that the National Action Network could write a check immediately, if necessary, Politico reported.
