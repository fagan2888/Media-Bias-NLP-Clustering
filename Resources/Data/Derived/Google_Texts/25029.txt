EDITOR: University of Wisconsin System students and their families have good reason to celebrate. Through Gov. Scott Walker’s bold leadership, they are benefitting from a statewide tuition freeze two years running, making college more affordable. The Walker administration’s tuition reform is putting the brakes on skyrocketing costs for higher education in Wisconsin.

After years of relentless tuition hikes ranging from 5.5 to 9.3 percent annually, resident undergraduates at our two-year colleges and four-year universities will pay no more for the 2014-’15 school year than they did for 2012-’13. Ditto the next two years, as Walker has proposed to extend the tuition freeze through the 2016-’17 school year. That means UW System students starting school in the fall of 2012 could earn a two-year or four-year degree without ever being hit with a tuition increase.

They can also take comfort knowing their financial futures will be brighter by carrying a smaller student loan burden combined with better paying job opportunities as Wisconsin’s economy continues to improve.

Gov. Scott Walker has been working hard to reverse the long-term trend in student tuition increases, while maintaining the UW System’s national reputation for outstanding higher education opportunities. For that he deserves to be re-elected.
