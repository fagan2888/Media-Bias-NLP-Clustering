About a third of the attendees reportedly chased the 2.6-mile-wide storm, which reached wind speeds of 295 mph near the ground.\n\nThe University Corporation for Atmospheric Research said in an analysis released a week after the storm that the \u201crare beast\u201d of a tornado was \u201cexceptionally dangerous for chasers and residents alike.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis storm did weird things,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIt spawned mini tornadoes and suddenly turned north to where Tim and his son were.\u201d\n\nSamaras saw the research possibilities in every storm, no matter the size, according to Tim Marshall, a regular ChaserCon keynote speaker over the years who often crossed paths with Samaras in the field.\n\nMarshall, who dressed in a shark costume as part of his \u201cSharknado\u201d presentation theme this year, told the audience that Samaras called the annual event his \u201cMecca\u201d \u2014 the one weekend a year people in the storm-chasing industry make journeys to visit with one another in Denver.\n\nNear the end of his presentation of the year\u2019s biggest tornadoes, Marshall showed a photo of the pile of crumpled metal that was all that was left of Samaras\u2019 car after being caught in the storm.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bet your life on the radar, because it may not be where you think it is,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nA tribute to Samaras was planned for 7:30 p.m. Hill said he expected that every one of the registrants would be there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be an opportunity for closure for a lot of people, because when it happened, people were still chasing. And it happened so quickly,\u201d Hill said.\n\nAlison Noon: 303-954-1223, anoon@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/alisonnoon", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "ChaserCon: Hundreds of storm chasers remember colleagues lost in Oklahoma", "title": "ChaserCon: Hundreds of storm chasers remember colleagues lost in Oklahoma", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/15/chasercon-hundreds-of-storm-chasers-remember-colleagues-lost-in-oklahoma/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140215__Chasercon1HC_8837p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140215__Chasercon1HC_8837p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-15T19:31:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T00:19:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Sixteen years ago, Tim Samaras hosted the first ChaserCon in his living room with pizza, beer, home videos of tornadoes and a few close friends.\n\u201cIt touched every storm chaser in the plains.\u201dThe group overflowed from the hotel\u2019s largest ballroom, where the three-day event, which opened Friday, brought speakers to discuss new technology and atmospheric prediction methods.\nAbout a third of the attendees reportedly chased the 2.6-mile-wide storm, which reached wind speeds of 295 mph near the ground.\nA tribute to Samaras was planned for 7:30 p.m. Hill said he expected that every one of the registrants would be there.\n\u201cDon\u2019t bet your life on the radar, because it may not be where you think it is,\u201d Marshall said."}
