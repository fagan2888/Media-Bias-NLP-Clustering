Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) must really get Bill O'Reilly's Irish up.

The blustery talk show host has promised to move to Ireland if Sanders, who is running for president as a Democrat, gets elected.

O'Reilly made the threat on Thursday's night's "O'Reilly Factor" after arguing that Sanders wants to “dismantle” Medicare and the Affordable Care Act “in the sense that it would be Berniecare and it would be much more than it is now.”

“If Bernie Sanders gets elected president, I’m fleeing," O'Reilly said. "I’m going to Ireland. And they already know it.”

O'Reilly went on to speculate that simply by making such a declaration, he might be handing a victory to Sanders.

“I shouldn’t say it publicly because that will get Sanders more votes," he said. "But I’m not going to pay 90 percent of my income to that guy. I’m sorry. I’m not doing it.”

Threatening to leave the country if something doesn't go your way is a popular way for celebrities and non-celebrities alike to express their displeasure (and, occasionally, to shoulder their way into the news cycle for five seconds).

Other famous folk who've made similar vows include Eddie Vedder, who said he'd move away if George W. Bush was elected in 2000, and Stephen Baldwin, who promised to leave in 2008 if Barack Obama was elected.

Spoiler alert: They're still here. (In Vedder's case, technically you could argue that Bush didn't get elected in 2000.)

Alec Baldwin reportedly said he'd move in 2000 if Bush was elected, but later denied making that statement.

Currently, Jon Stewart, Cher, Rosie O'Donnell and Samuel L. Jackson have all threatened to leave the country if Donald Trump becomes president.
