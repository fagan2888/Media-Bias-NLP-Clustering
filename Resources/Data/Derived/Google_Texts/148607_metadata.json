Least likely to support the ACA requirement were Baptists (48 %) and other Christians (45 %).\n\nFifty-six percent of women overall supported mandated health coverage of contraceptives and less than a fourth believed employers should be exempt from the law due to religion. The findings appear online ahead of print this month in international reproductive health journal Contraception.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe wanted to examine the relationship between religious affiliation and a woman\u2019s views on reproductive health care policy and what we found was that one didn\u2019t necessarily predict the other,\u201d says lead author Elizabeth Patton, M.D., M.Phil, M.Sc., an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Michigan Health System and researcher with the VA Center for Clinical Management Research.\n\n\u201cDebates surrounding reproductive health care have often been framed as religious versus non-religious but that\u2019s not an accurate narrative. Our findings show that religious women\u2019s attitudes toward policies affecting reproductive health care are much more complex than they are often portrayed. The differences in opinions about these policies between religious women and non-religious women are not always as striking as some may believe.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive coverage mandate was challenged last year by the owners of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood who said providing contraceptives to female employees went against their religious beliefs. The Supreme Court sided with them, ruling that corporations with religious owners cannot be required to pay for insurance coverage of contraception under the ACA.\n\nJust this week, the Supreme Court asked a lower court to reconsider its decision that barred Notre Dame \u2013 a Catholic university \u2013 from refusing to provide contraceptive coverage to employees on religious grounds.\n\nThe study found that just 23 percent of women believed religious hospitals and colleges should be excluded from contraceptive coverage requirements. The majority of women however disagreed with insurance coverage for abortion, with just 23 percent supporting abortion coverage in health plans. When controlling for factors such as income, education, ethnicity and political party, women who attended services most frequently (weekly or more, regardless of religious affiliation) were less likely to support employer sponsored insurance coverage of contraception and abortion care and more likely to support the exclusion of religious hospitals and colleges from contraceptive coverage requirements.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from the Women\u2019s Health Care Experiences and Preferences survey, which was conducted by the Program on Women\u2019s Health Care Effectiveness Research of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Michigan and includes a nationally-representative sample of 1,078 women in the U.S. age 18-55. The study examined associations between religious association (based on self-reported religious affiliation and frequency of attending religious services) and attitudes toward employer-provided insurance coverage of contraception and abortion services.\n\n\u201cWhen religion enters political discussions, we tend to hear from politicians, business leaders or church leaders who are often the most vocal, but these voices don\u2019t represent the religious community as a whole,\u201d says Patton, who is also a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar and member of the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.\n\n\u201cPolitical debates in the U.S. about reproductive health and religion continue. These policies primarily affect women \u2013 the vast majority of whom identify with a religion \u2013 and we need to ensure their viewpoints are heard so that misconceptions aren\u2019t perpetuated in these conversations.\"\n\n\u201cWe need to be aware of the complexity of how religion affects women\u2019s views so we can design reproductive health policies that truly reflect the beliefs and desires of most women in our country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdditional Authors: Kelli Hall, Ph.D., M.S. and Vanessa Dalton, M.D., M.P.H, both of U-M.
