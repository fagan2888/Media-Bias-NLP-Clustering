It\u2019s Romney who can\u2019t get a job.\n\nMitt also said if we bailed out the car companies you could kiss the American automotive industry goodbye. But we did bail them out, and it\u2019s doing better than ever.\n\nDonald Trump said Obamacare would be a job killer. But it didn\u2019t kill jobs. It didn\u2019t result in death panels. It didn\u2019t bankrupt the states. It didn\u2019t bankrupt the nation. It didn\u2019t bankrupt Medicare. It didn\u2019t bankrupt the insurance industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what actually happened. Insurance companies got richer; some black kids got inhalers, and John Boehner had to pay more taxes on his tan.\n\nOr how about Newt Gingrich in 2012 saying if you want ten dollar a gallon gasoline, Barack Obama should be your candidate. Or the NRA president saying that a reelected Obama would erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights. Or Rick Santorum warning that if gay marriage became the law of the land our country will fall.\n\nYou know, for a party that\u2019s so anti-gay, they sure pull a lot of stuff out of their ass.\n\n\n\nThe basis for the Republican Party\u2019s comprehensive track record of being wrong about everything is their decision to oppose anything President Obama suggests. The Republican refusal to compromise combined with a failed social and economic ideology has created an inability for Republicans to be right.\n\nThe Republican refusal to recognize facts has left them living a parallel universe that is governed by their feelings and beliefs. Republicans can\u2019t share common ground with the rest of us because they invent their own reality. Until Republicans decide to join the rest of us, they are going to be off on an island watching the rest of the world pass them by.\n\nThe United States is changing, evolving, and growing while the castaways on GOP island cling on to the past.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Maher hit Republicans right in between the eyes with reality by debunking 11 predictions that the Republican Party got wrong in 100 seconds.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Bill Maher hit Republicans right in between the eyes with reality by debunking 11 predictions that the Republican Party got wrong in 100 seconds.", "title": "Bill Maher Annihilates Republicans By Debunking 11 Wrong GOP Predictions In 100 Seconds", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/09/19/bill-maher-annihilates-republicans-debunking-11-gop-lies-100-seconds.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/maher-boehner.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-19T11:31:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Media,Bill Maher,list of predictions that Republicans got wrong,new rules,wrong republican predictions,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Media", "published_time": "2015-09-19T11:31:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-19T11:31:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Bill Maher, list of predictions that Republicans got wrong, new rules, wrong republican predictions"}, "article_summary": "Bill Maher hit Republicans right in between the eyes with reality by debunking 11 predictions that the Republican Party got wrong in 100 seconds.\nMaher said:During the last election Mitt Romney said, \u201cIf President Obama is elected you will not be able to get a job.\u201d But unemployment is now lower than it ever was under Reagan.\nIt didn\u2019t bankrupt Medicare.\nIt didn\u2019t bankrupt the states.\nIt didn\u2019t bankrupt the nation."}
