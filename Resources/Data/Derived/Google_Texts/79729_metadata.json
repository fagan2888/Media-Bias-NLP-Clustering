Headquarters: Kittanning Founded: 1999 Employees: 150 Sales: $30 million projected for 2013. Top executives: Pete Hess, managing partner; Shawn Nairn, retail operations director; Vince Politi, long-term-care pharmacy director. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters.\n\nMission Pharmacy, a Kittanning long-term-care pharmacy that supplies nursing home patients with medication, is looking south for growth.\n\nThe 14-year-old company acquired St. Clair Hospital's Senior Care Pharmacy in June for an undisclosed price, giving it a presence in Scott.\n\n\u201cStrategically, we think we can further our reach,\u201d said Shawn Nairn, an owner and retail operations director for Professional Specialized Pharmacies LLC, the Kittanning-based parent of Mission and six Hometown Pharmacy stores around Western Pennsylvania.\n\nMission Pharmacy's clients served a total of 3,000 nursing home patients before the St. Clair purchase, which added 400. Nairn said he expects the presence in Allegheny County to make Mission more attractive to potential customers.\n\nNairn and Mission's long-term care pharmacy director, Vince Politi, said they aren't actively seeking more acquisitions. But there are many smaller operations in Western Pennsylvania \u2014 such as St. Clair's pharmacy \u2014 that will struggle to implement electronic record systems that are being required by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nElectronic Medication Administration Records, or eMARs, are the pharmacy version of the electronic medical record systems that hospitals across the country are installing.\n\n\u201cUsing bar-code technology with an electronic medication administration record substantially reduces transcription and medication administration errors, as well as potential drug-related adverse events,\u201d according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, a division of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nThe investment to add such systems could push some of Mission's competitors to sell their businesses, Politi and Nairn said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of changes going on in the industry,\u201d Nairn said. \u201cIt's our theory that some of the smaller operations may not be able to exist.\u201d\n\nNairn said Mission has spent $25,000 so far to comply with eMARs, a cost that's expected to increase as the company buys equipment with each facility it adds to its system.\n\nNairn and Politi believe the investment in technology is paying off for Mission, which has doubled its sales during the past 18 months. Narin declined to provide specific sales figures for Mission but noted that overall sales for Professional Specialized Pharmacies, which includes revenue from its six retail pharmacies, is expected to reach $30 million for 2013.\n\nBut keeping that growth going is becoming a bigger challenge as the government and private insurers work to slow the pace at which health care costs are rising.\n\n\u201cThere's only so many dollars\u201d that can be spent on health care, Politi said. The company already operates on \u201cvery thin\u201d profit margins, and efforts to hold down drug prices have a big effect on pharmacy operators, he said.\n\nBut expansion of health coverage next year under the Affordable Care Act should mean more patients for companies like Mission, Nairn said, who called President Obama's health care law a \u201cdouble-edge sword\u201d because it is expected to further squeeze margins but increase volume.\n\nAbout 90 people work for Mission Pharmacy, and 60 work at the Hometown Pharmacies, Politi said.\n\nThe company's largest client is Presbyterian SeniorCare, an Oakmont-based operator of skilled nursing homes and other elder-care facilities in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nPresbyterian hired Mission at the beginning of this year to supply three nursing homes it owns in Oakmont, Washington and Verona, spokeswoman Janice Citeroni said.\n\n\u201cThey're very customer-focused,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just really go above and beyond for our residents and nurses.\u201d\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
