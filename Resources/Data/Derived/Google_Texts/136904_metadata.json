If left untreated, the tumor growth can eventually spread to other organs through a process called metastasis, which typically exacerbates prognosis and complicates therapy.\n\n\"We're seeing if we can use nano-flares to create a new type of breast cancer diagnostic, and the early results are remarkable,\u201d Mirkin told reporters. \u201cNano-flares could completely and radically change how we diagnose breast cancer.\"\n\nTo investigate, the researchers sent these particles through blood samples from cancer patients as well as health people. They found that the particles only lit up when they passed through breast cancer cells. Notably, the nano-flares reacted even in samples with low levels of cancerous activity.\n\n\"Nano-flares can detect just a few cancer cells in a sea of healthy cells,\" Mirkin said. \"That's important because when cancer spreads, only a few cells may break off from the original tumor and go into the bloodstream. An added bonus of these particles is that scientists may be able to sample the live cancerous cells and figure out what therapies they might respond to.\"\n\nToday, breast cancer is the second most deadly cancer among U.S. women, affecting over 200,000 and killing nearly 40,000 each year. It is estimated that one in every eight women will develop the disease at some point in their life. While the cause remains unknown, risk factors include early puberty, late menopause, and certain genes. Lifestyle factors like calorie intake and alcohol consumption have also been implicated in higher risk for diagnosis.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nanotechnology, breast cancer, metastasis, early diagnosis, early detection", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "\"Nano-flares\" may make it easier for doctors to diagnose breast cancer before it spreads to neighboring tissue.", "title": "Nanotechnology Could Help Detect Cancer Cells", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nano-flares-catch-breast-cancer-it-spreads-can-breakthroughs-nanotechnology-block-metastasis-271574", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/19/flare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Nano-flares\" may make it easier for doctors to diagnose breast cancer before it spreads to neighboring tissue.", "title": "Nanotechnology Could Help Detect Cancer Cells", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nano-flares-catch-breast-cancer-it-spreads-can-breakthroughs-nanotechnology-block-metastasis-271574", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/19/flare.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/19/flare.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-03-19T11:45:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-19T12:07:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"Nano-flares\" may make it easier for doctors to diagnose breast cancer before it spreads to neighboring tissue."}, "article_summary": "New nanotechnology may make it easier for doctors to diagnose breast cancer before it spreads to neighboring tissue.\nToday, breast cancer is the second most deadly cancer among U.S. women, affecting over 200,000 and killing nearly 40,000 each year.\n\"Nano-flares can detect just a few cancer cells in a sea of healthy cells,\" Mirkin said.\nThey found that the particles only lit up when they passed through breast cancer cells.\n\u201cNano-flares could completely and radically change how we diagnose breast cancer.\""}
