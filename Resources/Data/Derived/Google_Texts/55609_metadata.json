But you\u2019re as likely to find them 25 miles west in the Rockies, climbing into Fourth of July Basin or fishing Boulder Creek. \u201cThese people are doers,\u201d says Katherine Erstad, activities director at Aspen Lodge community center. \u201cThey develop passions and they pass them on to others.\u201d\n\nLast week Erstad took a call from a woman in New England, musing about moving west into one of Anthem Ranch\u2019s luxurious ranch designs by Toll Brothers. \u201cTell me about the hiking,\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m not the type that just walks up to the base of the mountain and then turns around.\u201d Erstad assured her she\u2019d have plenty of company at Anthem Ranch. Last month, she added, 45 residents biked for three days around the Elk Mountains near Aspen and Carbondale; while others packed into the Ten Mile Range for a hut trip. Another group launched a fly fishing club, teaching fly casting to 70 residents and grandkids.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not here you can create it,\u201d Erstad adds. Meanwhile, Anthem\u2019s nurturing approach to neighborhood groups (both Anthem Ranch and non-age-restricted Anthem Highlands have their own rec centers and activities directors) lures huge participation at special events, including at an annual Clam Bake last month \u2014 a classy affair that drew a record crowd that consumed 100 lobsters and other maritime fare flown in. \u201cI really think that so many people are coming from places where they\u2019ve had strong roots \u2014 that\u2019s what they see here, a place where you can grow roots quickly,\u201d says Erstad.That\u2019s doubly true, Erstad says, in the newest Toll Brothers neighborhoods, where everyone moves in more or less the same time. \u201cThey\u2019re really embracing that cul-de-sac and the people they meet,\u201d she adds. But if you imagine yourself becoming part of that scene, now is the moment to see Anthem Ranch, experience the action-oriented ambience, and tour Toll Brothers\u2019 six ranch-style models.\n\n\u201cIn this market, ranches are in demand everywhere \u2014 much more so with our lifestyle components,\u201d says Melanie McKenna, who with Leslie Reed can orient you to the community today. \u201cWe can already see the end of Anthem Ranch\u2019s supply of home sites, and we need to get you on a qualified interest list, so we can include you as home sites are released.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll also find ranch designs available in non-age-restricted Anthem Highlands by Richmond American, Standard Pacific, and Ryland Homes.
