Recent comments by administration officials suggested that they did not particularly like the legislation but could not stop the growing wave of bipartisan support for it.\n\nAt issue is a provision of the health care law that expands the definition of a \u201csmall employer\u201d to include companies with 51 to 100 employees, subjecting them to stringent insurance regulation starting Jan. 1. States have historically defined small employers as those with 50 or fewer employees.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe bill preserves the traditional definition of \u201csmall group,\u201d but allows states to expand it to include organizations with 51 to 100 employees if they want to do so.\n\nSenator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, the chief sponsor of the Senate version of the bill, said it would ensure that \u201csmall-business owners all across America are not more negatively impacted by Obamacare.\u201d\n\nSenator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the senior Democrat on the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, said that passage of the bill was \u201ca win for businesses across this country, a win for bipartisanship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis bill will make a helpful adjustment to the Affordable Care Act for small and midsize businesses by limiting potential premium increases and letting states determine what\u2019s best for their market,\u201d Mrs. Shaheen said.\n\nThe House passed the measure Monday. Representative Brett Guthrie, Republican of Kentucky, the chief sponsor, said he had heard from many small-business owners who feared that their insurance arrangements would be disrupted by \u201cthe mandated expansion of the small-group market.\u201d\n\nKurt Giesa, an actuary at Oliver Wyman, a management consulting concern, told Congress at a hearing last month that employers with 51 to 100 employees would face premium increases averaging 18 percent next year if they were subjected to the new requirements.\n\n\u201cMany of the groups receiving such sizable increases would elect to drop their health insurance coverage and either self-fund or not offer any coverage at all,\u201d Mr. Giesa testified.\n\nThe swift passage of the legislation followed months of lobbying and advocacy. Among those who endorsed the bill were the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151001221455, "twitter": {"description": "The action by Congress, intended to protect small and midsize businesses from insurance increases, was a rare example of bipartisan agreement on how to revise the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Health Law Revision Is Approved", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/health-law-revision-is-approved.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003952051"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/health-law-revision-is-approved.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003952051", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/health-law-revision-is-approved.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Health Law Revision Is Approved", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 1, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2015-10-02", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Law and Legislation", "published": "2015-10-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Small Business,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Senate,Law and Legislation", "news_keywords": "Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The action by Congress, intended to protect small and midsize businesses from insurance increases, was a rare example of bipartisan agreement on how to revise the Affordable Care Act.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The action by Congress, intended to protect small and midsize businesses from insurance increases, was a rare example of bipartisan agreement on how to revise the Affordable Care Act.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 1, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Senate", "slug": "02insure", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151002191220, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/health-law-revision-is-approved.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The action by Congress, intended to protect small and midsize businesses from insurance increases, was a rare example of bipartisan agreement on how to revise the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Health Law Revision Is Approved"}, "pdate": 20151001, "des": "Law and Legislation", "articleid": 100000003952051, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Health Law Revision Is Approved", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate passed legislation on Thursday intended to protect small and midsize businesses from increases in health insurance premiums, clearing the bill for President Obama\u2019s expected signature.\n\u201cMany of the groups receiving such sizable increases would elect to drop their health insurance coverage and either self-fund or not offer any coverage at all,\u201d Mr. Giesa testified.\nThe bill, approved this week in the House and the Senate by voice vote, eliminates a provision of the law that would have imposed tough, potentially costly new requirements on businesses with 51 to 100 employees.\nAt issue is a provision of the health care law that expands the definition of a \u201csmall employer\u201d to include companies with 51 to 100 employees, subjecting them to stringent insurance regulation starting Jan. 1.\nAmong those who endorsed the bill were the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association."}
