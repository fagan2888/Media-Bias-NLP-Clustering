And they have been served well by making this decision,\" Earnest insisted. \"And I do think that we see a lot of the -- Democratic candidates for president, who are running to succeed President Obama, vowing to build on the progress that the has made thus far.\"\n\n\"And I think that's an indication of the political potency of the kind of arguments that President Obama has been making public. And these kinds of political debates are important for our country.\"\n\nBut yeah, Earnest said, Obama \"generally wants Democrats to win elections.\"\n\n\"Stop the presses,\" he quipped.\n\nHe chalked up the GOP efforts largely to redistricting and off-year turnout.\n\nOf Bevin's win, Earnest said that \"vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act in some cases has been used as an effective political strategy that's not a terribly effective governing strategy.\"\n\n\"The fact of the matter is, since Medicaid was expanded in Kentucky, more than a half a million Kentuckians have gotten health insurance through Medicaid -- gotten health care coverage through Medicaid or CHIP. That's -- that's a testament to the astounding impact that the Affordable Care Act has had on the lives of half million Kentuckians. To say nothing of the more than 17.6 million Americans that have gotten health care since the Affordable Care Act went into effect,\" he said. \"That's why the uninsured rate across the country is at all-time lows, and even the uninsured rate in Kentucky has been cut in half since the Affordable Care Act went into effect.\"\n\n\"So -- so, I -- I think the, you know, the real focus here should be on the people of Kentucky and what impact, you know, these campaign promises are gonna have.\"", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Earnest: Election Day Shows That Dems are 'Served Well' by Running on Obama Agenda", "title": "Earnest: Election Day Shows That Dems are 'Served Well' by Running on Obama Agenda", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "Depends what your definition of 'win' is.", "title": "Earnest: Election Day Shows That Dems are 'Served Well' by Running on Obama Agenda", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/earnest-election-day-shows-that-dems-are-served-well-by-running-on-obama-agenda/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2014/10/joshearnest.jpg", "updated_time": 1464323189, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Depends what your definition of 'win' is.", "title": "Earnest: Election Day Shows That Dems are 'Served Well' by Running on Obama Agenda", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/earnest-election-day-shows-that-dems-are-served-well-by-running-on-obama-agenda/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2014/10/joshearnest.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "pinterest": "nopin", "pinterestDescription": "Earnest: Election Day Shows That Dems are 'Served Well' by Running on Obama Agenda", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That's -- that's a testament to the astounding impact that the Affordable Care Act has had on the lives of half million Kentuckians.\nTo say nothing of the more than 17.6 million Americans that have gotten health care since the Affordable Care Act went into effect,\" he said.\n\"And I think that's an indication of the political potency of the kind of arguments that President Obama has been making public.\nEarnest: Election Day Shows That Dems are 'Served Well' by Running on Obama AgendaThe White House said today it doesn't want to draw \"significant conclusions\" from GOP victories at the state level in Tuesday's elections.\nBut yeah, Earnest said, Obama \"generally wants Democrats to win elections.\""}
