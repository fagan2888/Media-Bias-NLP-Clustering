Rep. Mo Brooks Mo BrooksHouse GOP avoids debate over immigration in defense bill GOP rep. on 'Lucifer' remark: Boehner has ‘said much, much worse’ House conservatives push for strong majority of majority rule MORE (R-Ala.) on Tuesday argued that illegal immigrants are causing income inequality in the U.S.

Brooks said the administration was at fault for the influx of migrants illegally crossing the U.S. border.

"These failings contribute to America's porous border and produce millions of illegal aliens competing for American jobs, there by creating income inequality via wage suppression and lost job opportunities for American citizens," Brooks said on the House floor.

The Alabama Republican argued that illegal immigrants were given "stuff paid for with tax dollars" at the expense of American citizens.

"To solve the immigration problem, America must vigorously enforce immigration laws, stop promising illegal aliens amnesty, and stop giving illegal aliens stuff paid for with tax dollars forcefully taken from struggling American families," Brooks said.

Brooks said that not granting "amnesty" to people who immigrated to the U.S. illegally would stem the flow of immigrants.

"If America will be smart and do these things, there will be no immigration crisis," Brooks said. "There won't be illegal aliens competing with Americans for jobs, and American families can better participate in the American dream."
