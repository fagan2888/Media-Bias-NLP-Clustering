Rick Perry and AFP President Tim Phillips.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nObamacare critics do not like how the law allows Medicaid, originally enacted as a safety net to provide health coverage for poor mothers and children, to be expanded to cover able-bodied, working-age adults. Federal funds cover the costs of the new enrollees but will start scaling back in 2017. Moreover, states are on the hook for administrative costs for signing up the new enrollees, whose numbers have far exceeded estimates.\n\nFor fiscal conservatives, like the activists at the AFP conference, the massive spending incurred by Medicaid expansion is especially distasteful, and Kasich\u2019s support of it is viewed as a heretical departure from conservative principles, much like the way school choice advocates view former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s support for Common Core.\n\nKasich has defended his decision to authorize Medicaid expansion in Ohio on religious grounds, a rationale that has fallen flat with conservatives. According to a report by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, when Kasich was questioned about Medicaid expansion at a California conference sponsored by the Koch brothers, AFP\u2019s benefactors, he replied, \u201cWhen I get to the pearly gates, I\u2019m going to have an answer for what I\u2019ve done for the poor.\u201d\n\nGroups like Watchdog.org, a project of the Franklin Center for Government Accountability, and the Foundation for Government Accountability have joined AFP in criticizing Kasich. Nearly half a million Ohioans signed up under Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion, and the plan was already 33 percent over budget in just its first year.\n\nAccording to Watchdog\u2019s Jason Hart, Ohio\u2019s Medicaid enrollment numbers under Obamacare now exceed 600,000 and have cost taxpayers $4.4 billion.\n\nPhillips, the AFP President, mentioned Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion when he addressed the nearly 4,o00 activists on the conference\u2019s first day. Even though he never said Kasich\u2019s name, the implication was clear when he vowed that they would continue to fight against Medicaid expansion: \u201cWhether proposed by a Democrat or a Republican, we\u2019ll continue to oppose it with all we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama and some Republicans want to take millions of the most vulnerable citizens and they want to throw them into a Medicaid bureaucracy where the care is substandard,\u201d continued Phillips, as the audience cheered in agreement. \u201cThey call that compassion. We call it immoral.\u201d\n\nPerry also took a swipe at his fellow Republican presidential contender during his remarks on Saturday. Kasich has repeatedly claimed that the federal funds going to pay for Ohio\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u201cbelong\u201d to Ohioans and would be spent in other states if Ohio had not claimed them. Perry rejected this argument as \u201cjust nonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat money doesn\u2019t come from an endless vault of money in Washington. It is borrowed from bankers in China and children in Cleveland and Columbus,\u201d Perry added. \u201cJustifying Medicaid expansion on the grounds of returning federal money to your home state can only be done if you turn a blind eye to the fact that we are $18 trillion in debt.\u201d\n\nAvik Roy, Senior Advisor to Perry\u2019s presidential campaign and well-regarded as a health care policy expert before joining the campaign, spoke on a well-attended panel Saturday morning on the issue of Medicaid expansion. Like Perry, Roy found Kasich\u2019s justifications wholly unconvincing.\n\nPacked house at @AFPHQ #Dream15 #Obamacare panel in Columbus. pic.twitter.com/iG0LE6eN0P \u2014 Avik Roy (@Avik) August 22, 2015\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more important fight in terms of the expansion of government in this country right now,\u201d said Roy, than the issue of Medicaid expansion. He issued a challenge to Kasich: \u201cWho is going to Hell if we shove 15 million more people in a broken program?\u201d\n\nFollow Sarah Rumpf on Twitter: @rumpfshaker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans for Prosperity held their annual \"Defending the American Dream Summit\" in Ohio, but Republican Gov.
