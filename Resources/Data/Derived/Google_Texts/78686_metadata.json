The VA secretary could also demote the senior executive to another grade within the General Schedule pay scale.\n\nThe vote was 390-33 in favor of the bill, giving it the two-thirds majority needed to pass.\n\nRelated: Obama Sticks to Scandal Playbook on VA Mess\n\n\u201cThe Senate should pass it swiftly so President Obama and Secretary [Eric] Shinseki can start utilizing that authority,\u201d said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., in a press release sent out before debate began, and after Obama gave a 20-minute White House briefing on the topic. \u201cTime is of the essence, for the sake of our veterans who deserve better. Senior leaders at the VA must be held accountable, and the White House must continue to answer for the treatment of our veterans.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has introduced a companion bill in that chamber.\n\nBut federal agencies, including VA, already have the power to remove senior executives who receive unsatisfactory performance ratings \u2013 removal can mean termination or a demotion. Senior executives must be removed from the SES if they receive two \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d ratings within five consecutive years, or two \u201cless than fully successful\u201d ratings within three consecutive years. To begin the removal process, the agency must provide a 30-day written notice to the employee outlining the action. The Merit Systems Protection Board can review the action and make a non-binding recommendation to the agency; however, employees cannot appeal the actual performance rating, resulting in removal from the SES.\n\nThe Senior Executives Association has strongly opposed the bill, calling it unnecessary given the current authority that agencies possess, and distracting from the real issue of providing veterans with the highest quality health care. \u201cPassage of this legislation will politicize the SES corps and will create a culture where quality managers and executives choose to work elsewhere rather than lend their talents to the VA where they may be subject to a trial by media,\u201d said SEA President Carol Bonosaro in a May 20 letter to House members, urging them to vote against H.R. 4031.\n\nRelated: Neglect and Delay May Not Have Caused VA Deaths\n\nEssentially the legislation deprives career VA senior executives of due process, the organization argued, which makes it unconstitutional. \u201cSEA believes the problem employees should be held accountable but that an entire corps should not be placed at risk due to the poor performance or misconduct of a few,\u201d Bonosaro wrote. \u201cSEA also supports meaningful efforts to identify policies that strengthen employee accountability systems across government. This legislation does not achieve the goal of accountability and instead is a quick fix sound-bite that does not address the very real issues of backlogs and access to care.\u201d Bonosaro also pointed out that one-third of VA senior executives are themselves veterans.\n\nThe legislation\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., said in remarks on the floor Wednesday that the current removal system is \u201ccalcified in bureaucratic red tape\u201d and that the VA secretary is \u201cheld back by a failed civil service system\u201d that makes it nearly impossible to fire poor performers. Miller also added that encouraging action against a few poorly-performing senior executives was not meant \u201cto tarnish\u201d the hard work of the vast majority of VA employees, \u201cwho come to work every day and, by and large, provide excellent care to our veterans.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said during debate that the legislation is \u201ca knee-jerk reaction to a bad situation, painting with a very broad brush, and undermining a system that can work, has worked and has the mechanisms to work.\u201d The Maryland Democrat said no lawmaker should be in favor of a bill that \u201cturns senior executives into at-will employees.\u201d H.R. 4031 is a \u201cslippery slope to undoing the careful civil service protections that have been in place for decades,\u201d Hoyer added.\n\nMiller fired back: \u201cWe\u2019ve just been told this is a knee-jerk reaction to a crisis. It\u2019s the only action to a crisis.\u201d The Florida Republican added that if the bill becomes law, then the department will have to notify Congress within 30 days of decisions to fire or demote members of the SES. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do your job, you get fired,\u201d he said.\n\nShinseki has said he already has sufficient authority to fire poor performers. During a recent Senate hearing, Shinseki said VA has forced out -- through transfers, terminations or involuntary retirements -- 3,000 workers in each of the last two years, some of whom were senior executives. Data from the Office of Personnel Management show about 4,300 VA employees were removed or terminated from federal service for disciplinary reasons, but that figure does not include forced transfers or retirements. In fiscal 2012, there were 448 career SES employees at VA.\n\nH.R. 4031 has gained momentum in the past few weeks because of the burgeoning management crisis at VA. The department\u2019s inspector general has launched an investigation amid allegations that veterans were put on secret waiting lists for medical appointments at some VA hospitals, and that employees falsified documents. The reports surfaced after the recent deaths of vets in Phoenix, Ariz., who were waiting for care. The House leadership fast-tracked the legislation through the chamber for Wednesday\u2019s floor vote, bypassing the traditional committee markup process.\n\nMany veterans\u2019 groups, including the American Legion, support the legislation. The bill has 150 co-sponsors, including eight Democrats.\n\nThe White House did not outright oppose Miller's bill. \"The administration shares and supports the goals of the bill -- ensuring accountability at the VA,\" said an administration official. \"We do have some concerns that some provisions could result in significant litigation, which would divert valuable time and resources from VA\u2019s accountability efforts and its core mission of delivering quality services to our veterans. But we\u2019ve been very clear we want to work with Congress on specific language issues and look forward to discussing the bill going forward.\"\n\nObama met Wednesday with Shinseki, telling reporters in a briefing afterward that any employees who falsified documents or \u201ccooked the books\u201d will be held accountable and \u201cpunished.\u201d But he also cautioned that investigators need time to do their jobs and uncover the facts. The president made a point to praise VA employees who every day \u201cdo outstanding work and put everything that they\u2019ve got into making sure our veterans get the care, benefits and services that they need.\u201d\n\nObama said he receives letters from veterans praising VA doctors, nurses and facilities. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose sight of the fact that there are a lot of folks in the VA who are doing a really good job and working really hard at it,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201cIt never excuses the possibility that someone might have been trying to manipulate the data in order to themselves look better or make their facility look better.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Government Executive.\n\nRead more at Government Executive:\n\nThe VA Is a Disgrace.
