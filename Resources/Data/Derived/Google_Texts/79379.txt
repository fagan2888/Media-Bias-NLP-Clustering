A Topeka man who likes to walk a local trail without clothing isn't breaking any local laws.

Steven Herrold says he enjoys being nude outside. He's been spotted several times walking naked on the Shunga Trail. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports it's legal to walk and bike in Topeka without clothes. Public nudity could result in an arrest if the person is taking part in lewd and lascivious behavior.

Apparently some people have noticed Herrold and called police. Topeka police Lt. Colleen Stuart says the Shawnee County Parks and Recreation Department, which controls the Shunga Trail, may be posting signs stating people are expected to wear clothing in the parks.

That would put Herrold in violation of a policy -- not an ordinance.
