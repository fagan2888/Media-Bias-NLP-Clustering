Tea Party Republicans like to point out that poor cities like Detroit, Baltimore and Camden, New Jersey are run by Democrats, but they neglect to mention that some of the most affluent parts of the United States\u2014from Manhattan to the Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area to Cambridge, MA to Seattle to Chicago\u2019s North Shore suburbs\u2014are dominated by the Democratic Party. People in those heavily Democratic areas pay a lot of federal income taxes, and quite often, their tax dollars go to red states.\n\nEarlier this year, the personal finance website WalletHub.com conducted an in-depth study of the amounts individual states are paying in federal taxes compared to the amounts they are receiving. WalletHub analyzed data from the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Commerce Department and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. WalletHub\u2019s research demonstrates that, as a rule, the states that are the most likely to rail against \u201cbig government\u201d are the most likely to be benefiting from it.\n\nA few of the states in WalletHub\u2019s study that were receiving the most tax revenue from the federal government are states that President Barack Obama won in 2012 (most notably, New Mexico and Hawaii), but most were hardcore \u201cred states.\u201d And most of the states that, according to WalletHub, are taking less from the federal government than they are paying in are \u201cblue states\u201d that Obama won in both 2008 and 2012, including California, Massachusetts, Delaware, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Minnesota. WalletHub\u2019s research bears out comparable figures released by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation in the past: analyzing IRS data, Tax Foundation has found, more than once, that red states are likely to be the biggest recipients of federal tax money.\n\nBelow are 10 red states that take full advantage of the federal government and would be much worse off without the \u201ccoastal liberal elites\u201d they love to complain about.\n\n1. Mississippi: Mississippi is one of the most Republican states in the U.S.: Republicans dominate the state government, and not since Jimmy Carter\u2019s victory in 1976 has a Democrat carried Mississippi in a presidential race. \u201cFiscal responsibility\u201d is a recurring theme in Mississippi politics, where Democrats are often characterized as people who couldn\u2019t balance a budget if their lives depended on it. Yet the reality is that Mississippi is one of the most blatant examples of a state receiving more federal tax money than it gives: WalletHub finds that for every dollar in federal taxes Mississippi pays, it receives $3.07 from the federal government. A 2007 report from the Tax Foundation found that Mississippi was receiving $2.47 from the federal government for every dollar it was paying in.\n\nThe fact that Mississippi has a hard time making ends meet without help from Washington, DC stems from being a so-called \u201cright to work\u201d state, meaning it has a very low rate of unionization and plenty of low-wage jobs. Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the country, and Republican policies in that state\u2014hostility to unions, opposition to raising the minimum wage at either the federal or state level, tax breaks for the wealthiest 1% of Americans\u2014will likely keep Mississippi from being a substantial contributor to federal income taxes.\n\n2. Alaska: Alaska didn\u2019t become part of the U.S. until 1959, and since then, it has gone Republican in every presidential race except 1964 (when Alaska favored Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson over Republican Barry Goldwater). A bastion of hard-right politics, Alaska is the state where Sarah Palin was elected governor in 2006. But when it comes to \u201csmall government,\u201d Alaska Republicans don\u2019t practice what they preach: according to WalletHub, Alaska receives $1.42 from the federal government for every dollar it contributes. Tax Foundation\u2019s research showed Alaska receiving $1.93 from Uncle Sam for every dollar paid in. Alaska Republicans love to rail against the federal government, but the reality is that Alaska needs federal tax revenue badly in order to function.\n\nAlaska is infamous for its harsh winters, which put considerable wear and tear on the state\u2019s infrastructure\u2014and the money for that much upkeep and maintenance has to come from somewhere. That somewhere is Boston, Santa Monica, Brooklyn, Seattle and all the other places that are full of upscale Democrats Palin considers \u201cun-American.\u201d\n\n3. Alabama: Like Mississippi, Alabama is a state that hasn\u2019t given a Democratic presidential candidate its electoral votes since 1976. Alabama is one of the most Republican-dominated states in the U.S., and it is also a state that is very reliant on the federal government. According to Wallet Hub\u2019s study, Alabama receives 37% of its revenue from the federal government and receives $3.28 for every dollar it pays in federal taxes. Tax Foundation\u2019s data showed Alabama receiving $2.03 in federal tax money for every dollar it was paying in.\n\nThere are ways in which Alabama could become less reliant on Washington, DC: raising the minimum wage and having a more unionized workforce would generate more income tax revenue. So would raising income taxes on Alabama\u2019s 1%. But Alabama is a so-called \u201cright to work\u201d state, and a workforce that is generally underpaid and overworked isn\u2019t going to generate a lot of federal income tax revenue.\n\n4. Louisiana: In Republican-dominated Louisiana politics, it is fashionable to bash \u201cbig government liberals\u201d who live in San Francisco or New York City. But when Louisiana Republicans do that, they are biting the hands that feed them. According to Wallet Hub\u2019s research, Louisiana receives $3.35 from the federal government for every dollar it pays in; 44% of Louisiana\u2019s funding, WalletHub says, comes from Washington, DC.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans claim they've had it with American socialism.
