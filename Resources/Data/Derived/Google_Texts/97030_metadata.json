They\u2019ve shunned the traditional 9-to-5 and instead, more and more women are doing what Kim Stratton and Sharon Schneider did: opting-in to owning their own businesses. In fact, a movement of sorts is underway, as women become entrepreneurs at a national rate that outpaces men. Stratton is a new restaurant owner, and Schneider started MoxieJean.com only three years ago.\n\n\u201cWomen entrepreneurs have significantly increased their economic impact in the past few decades. Today, women business owners are the fastest growing segment of the economy,\u201d says Carla Harris, chairwoman of the National Women Business Council. \u201cThe work of the council is grounded in the belief that women have innovative ideas, that women are strong leaders and that women are launching businesses that create value and solve problems.\u201d\n\nThe council is a nonpartisan federal advisory organization that makes policy recommendations to the White House, Congress and the federal Small Business Administration. Its 2014 annual report states that more than a quarter of U.S. companies are headed or owned by a woman.\n\nThat confirms a phenomenon state Sen. Linda Holmes says she\u2019d already gotten wind of in her district. Holmes says that the city of Aurora, which she represents, has seen small women-owned businesses pop up in droves over the last decade. A longtime business owner herself, Holmes says she wants to capitalize on the startup growth by supporting the women and helping them grow. To be considered woman-owned, at least 51 percent of a business\u2019 ownership, equity, interest or stock must be owned by a woman.\n\n\u201cSmall business is what employs most people. We have noticed in the past years that women are becoming more and more apt to become business owners (and) because of that, we\u2019re trying to foster the ability of women to reach out to other women and act as mentors,\u201d says Holmes, a member of the Senate Labor Committee and chairwoman of the Commerce and Economic Development Committee.\n\nThis undeclared women\u2019s movement represents an injection of good news for a state that\u2019s become notorious for unsavory political doings and fiscal strife. The U.S. Census Survey of Business Owners from 2007 indicates that in Illinois, 343,117 of the state\u2019s 1.1 million businesses were owned by women \u2014 three out of 10. That\u2019s up 20.4 percent from 284,954 in 2002, and means the state ranked fifth in the nation, which makes sense given that Illinois is the fifth most populous state in the country.\n\nThe Survey of Business Owners offers the most recent government statistics about women-owned enterprises. On the local level, Cook County was second only to Los Angeles County. Chicago\u2019s 92,132 women-owned firms made it No. 3 among cities, trailing only New York and Los Angeles. The Chicago-Naperville-Joliet metropolitan area also had the third largest number of women-owned businesses with 271,068. The Census records business data every five years; information for 2012 will be released this year.\n\nIn the meantime, a 2014 estimate by credit-card and financial-services giant American Express counts 388,700 women-owned businesses in Illinois. Most of them \u2014 308,700 \u2014 are said to be in the Chicago metropolitan area, which is where both Stratton and Schneider set up shop. The numbers show that the upward trend continues and raises the question of why women are increasingly choosing this path.\n\nThe reasons are as varied as the women themselves.\n\nOn January 31, Stratton offered a spread of her home-cooked, southern-style fare for a modest crowd of supporters. They had turned out for the grand opening of her new restaurant, Kim Stratton\u2019s Kitchen. The gospel singer-turned-restaurateur had a mind to open a restaurant in December 2013. A series of baby steps helped her move from cooking and catering as a side hustle to opening her cafeteria-style eatery, located in the basement of a 10-story office building in the northwest Chicago suburb of Palatine.\n\nShe became a culinary entrepreneur \u201caccidentally on purpose,\u201d but says she\u2019s gratified to be in business for herself and helping others have work opportunities. For her, the journey began working alongside her mother \u2014 observing and emulating the matriarch\u2019s culinary prowess. \u201cI was her sous chef. I chopped everything,\u201d she says. And as she returned home from singing gigs on the road, Stratton would retreat to her kitchen for relaxation and solace \u2014 and helpings of her homemade favorites. \u201cI love to cook like I love singing,\u201d says Stratton, who has received multiple Grammy and Stellar awards nominations for her music.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really know what all [starting a business] entails, and I think I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t know,\u201d she says.\n\nSchneider had an inkling of what to do when she walked away from what she characterizes as a lucrative corporate philanthropy job. She conferred with her mother and sister and co-founded MoxieJean.com, an online, upscale, baby clothing resale shop.\n\n\u201cI wanted to move from advising traditional philanthropy to really doing something,\u201d says Schneider, a married mother of three who considers herself a bit of an environmentalist. The linguistics major became disenchanted with corporate culture. Instead, she wanted to make money \u2014 and make the world a better place. \u201cI don\u2019t love this culture, so let me go create my own,\u201d she recalls thinking. She melded motherhood, workplace dissatisfaction and her desire to save the planet to create her online store. She even discovered a vogue phrase for starting a business with a pointed purpose: social entrepreneurship. That\u2019s the ethos under which she launched her Arlington Heights-based company in August 2011.\n\nThe National Women\u2019s Business Council report indicates that women-owned businesses are making money and having a measurable economic impact. The Census data backs the claim, indicating that, collectively, women-owned businesses had revenue of $53.7 billion in 2007, an increase of 14.7 percent over the $46.8 billion in 2002. The report states that women\u2019s enterprises are thriving and growing, creating employment opportunities for others. Stratton\u2019s restaurant employs three full-time workers.\n\nA woman starts her business with half as much money as a man does, according to the council\u2019s report. But the revenue figures show just how much intensity some women pour into their businesses. \u201cMostly as an entrepreneur you\u2019re broke,\u201d says Schneider \u2014 laughing but serious. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that everybody doesn\u2019t talk about. You\u2019re putting all the money into your business; you\u2019re not taking money out.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the council\u2019s key recommendations to policymakers will be improving women\u2019s access to capital. The money would help even more women start businesses and help others grow and expand. Stratton and Schneider both emptied their personal savings to get their business going. The council says many women do that, opting not to seek business loans, either because they don\u2019t know about them or fear they won\u2019t be approved.\n\nStratton says she regrets not looking into loans. Schneider is shopping for investors. Illinois has a number of loan, grant and venture capital options through the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and other state agencies. DCEO\u2019s Advantage Illinois program, for example, collaborates with private lenders to make loans and provide venture capital to small businesses. In 2014, Advantage Illinois subsidized $5.4 million in loans to 29 women-owned businesses. Four women received state venture capital money through the program, totaling $457,500, according to agency records. The money was part of a 2010 federal law that helps states aid some of their small businesses. Further, 997 women-owned businesses are listed as vendors with the state through the Illinois Business Enterprise Program.\n\nAmong the National Women\u2019s Business Council\u2019s other expected recommendations: implementing tax credits for investors who help women finance their businesses; encouraging women in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math; creating opportunities for women business owners to connect with government and corporate procurement; and making child care more affordable.\n\nIt would be difficult to understate the importance of that last one. \u201cChild care burdens are a significant impediment to growth,\u201d the council states. It\u2019s something Schneider knows all too well. She says helping women with child care costs would be a boost. Her children were 7, 5 and 1 when she set out to launch MoxieJean.com. Care for the baby was $300 weekly \u2014 more than $1,200 each month. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge amount of money,\u201d Schneider says.\n\nHolmes echoes those concerns: \u201cWomen business owners have some different challenges that they have to deal with than perhaps a man might.\u201d She says despite their entrepreneurial pursuits, they\u2019re still often taking care of households \u2014 including cooking, cleaning, chasing toddlers and helping with homework \u2014 as they get their businesses off the ground and work to grow them. \u201cWe need to make sure women have access to child care,\u201d Holmes says.\n\nIllinois does have a child care subsidy program for low-income families, but it has been underfunded in recent fiscal years, including the current one.\n\nHolmes says with the increase in women-owned start-ups in her district, she looks forward to finding out what \u2014 if any \u2014 legislation could benefit them. \u201cStarting a business is not a part-time endeavor. It takes a huge amount\u201d of time investment, she says.\n\nEach of the women have had unexpected discoveries on their journeys to being owners and chief executives. People who aren\u2019t entrepreneurs, they say, think the women enjoy a lifestyle reminiscent of a perpetual tropical vacation with cash as low-hanging fruit on tree-lined beaches. Nowhere near, they quip.\n\nStratton admits she had the misguided notion that her schedule, as the boss, would be light. She chuckles at her initial thinking that she would go into \u201cthe office\u201d a few days a week. But she quickly learned that the restaurant would be like her second home. She spends 12 or more hours there every day. \u201cYou have to nurture\u201d the business, she says. \u201cBabysit it.\u201d\n\nSchneider says she realizes it may be a while \u2014 possibly years \u2014 before she has substantial profits. Entrepreneurs, including women, grind hard at the start \u201cso that someday you\u2019ll enjoy the benefits.\u201d Being an entrepreneur, Schneider says, is \u201cnot a short term strategy for (building) wealth.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Stratton got teary-eyed one day, after she had closed her new restaurant for the evening. As she turned the key in the door to lock it, reality sunk in. She had become a bona fide member of the movement.\n\nShe says, \u201cThat was a feel-good moment.\u201d\n\nIllinois Issues, March 2015", "article_metadata": {"category": "Illinois Economy", "description": "The rise of the female entrepreneur Women are saying \u201cno thanks\u201d to luxe corporate corner offices and tiny cubicles alike, to office politics and even the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wuis.org/post/women-s-work", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wuis/files/styles/medium/public/201502/kimsutton.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The rise of the female entrepreneur Women are saying \u201cno thanks\u201d to luxe corporate corner offices and tiny cubicles alike, to office politics and even the", "title": "Women\u2019s Work"}, "wordCount": 1810, "has_audio": 0, "author": "Rhonda Gillespie", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Women\u2019s Work"}, "nid": 44249, "datePublished": "2015-03-01", "keywords": "Illinois Issues, business climate, Women Entrepeneurs of Central Illinois", "twitter": {"site": "@WUIS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WUIS"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1239\"", "article_summary": "Today, women business owners are the fastest growing segment of the economy,\u201d says Carla Harris, chairwoman of the National Women Business Council.\nThe National Women\u2019s Business Council report indicates that women-owned businesses are making money and having a measurable economic impact.\nHolmes says that the city of Aurora, which she represents, has seen small women-owned businesses pop up in droves over the last decade.\nIn the meantime, a 2014 estimate by credit-card and financial-services giant American Express counts 388,700 women-owned businesses in Illinois.\nThe Chicago-Naperville-Joliet metropolitan area also had the third largest number of women-owned businesses with 271,068."}
