One of the reasons why American politics is so polarized and our American system of government is at risk is because of President Barack Obama’s deliberate abuse of power and disregard of his constitutional duties to faithfully execute our laws.

Take America’s immigration laws. In 2010, pressed by his supporters to stop deporting illegal aliens and unilaterally grant them legal status, Obama said, “I’m president, I’m not a king. I can’t do these things just by myself.” In 2013, he said, “I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.” In fact, Obama publicly said more than 20 times that he did not have the legal authority to change immigration laws.

However, by 2014, Obama apparently had convinced himself that he could be a king. As he remarked to the French president, “That’s the good thing about being president, I can do whatever I want.”

Sure enough. In November 2014, Obama unilaterally announced sweeping changes to our immigration laws. Afterward, Obama noted, “I just took an action to change the law.” Hail the emperor and new king!

Feeling his kingship oats, Obama has unilaterally changed several mandates included in the Obamacare law (no authority for that). Recently, his administration issued several made-up regulations that his own treasury secretary previously admitted they did not have the authority to do.

Just a hunch on my part — but I’ll bet the Democrats would not be so tolerant of this abuse of power if a Republican president were making up these laws. Wake up, America!
