Lincoln says, \u201cI suppose you will celebrate; and will even go so far as to read the Declaration.\u201d\n\n(Lincoln\u2019s comment here was an aside\u2014his larger point was that according to Stephen Douglas, the Declaration was nothing more than a justification for the colonists to withdraw their allegiance to the British, and that by this reading \u201cthe Declaration is of no practical use now\u2014mere rubbish\u2014old wadding left to rot on the battle-field after the victory is won.\u201d)\n\nSuppose you and your family decide to celebrate the Fourth according to the old custom this year, and at some point between the burgers and fireworks you gather everyone together and read the Declaration of Independence out loud. Once you get past the familiar opening\u2014\u201cWhen in the course of human events,\u201d etc.\u2014you\u2019ll get into the list of grievances against King George III, \u201ca history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.\u201d\n\nMost of us are less familiar with this section, but the list follows a standard rhetorical structure: it begins with the least severe crimes and gradually ramps up to the worst.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the way down, you\u2019ll notice a few injuries and usurpations that have a certain resonance today, like \u201cimposing Taxes on us without our Consent\u201d\u2014think Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate penalty, which was only construed as a \u201ctax\u201d by the Supreme Court after the fact. The accusation that King George \u201cerected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people\u201d should call to mind the deliberate targeting and harassment of conservative groups by the IRS, possible evidence of which was apparently \u201clost\u201d when former IRS official Lois Lerner\u2019s computer crashed.\n\nBut pay close attention to one item a little further down on the list, about \u201ctaking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments.\u201d That one is especially germane. Earlier this week, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz released the latest in a series of reports on the Obama administration\u2019s attempt to expand federal power, highlighting a \u201cpersistent pattern of lawlessness\u201d and a willingness to disregard the written law and instead enforce policies through executive fiat.\n\nCruz\u2019s report catalogs the administration\u2019s 20 unanimous defeats before the Supreme Court during the past five-and-a-half years, a tally that\u2019s all the more striking for the string of defeats it suffered in the Supreme Court\u2019s recently concluded term, including rulings this week in the Hobby Lobby case and Harris v. Quinn. In a statement accompanying the report, Cruz said the \u201cinescapable conclusion is that the Obama Administration\u2019s view of federal power knows virtually no bounds.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s very much like the complaint Jefferson and the Founders had with King George. In the spirit of the Declaration, the Cruz report lists some things the federal government would be able to do had the White House\u2019s lawyers won these cases:\n\nUnilaterally install officers and bypass the Senate confirmation process ( NLRB v. Noel Canning );\n\n); Search the contents of cell phones without a warrant ( Riley v. California );\n\n); Use international treaties to displace state sovereignty over criminal law ( Bond v. United States );\n\n); Expand federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws ( Burrage v. United States );\n\n); Apply arbitrary immigration rules (Judulang v. Holder)\u2026 And the list goes on. Given the Obama administration\u2019s spectacular losses in court, one could be forgiven for thinking that the president doesn\u2019t think much of \u201caltering laws and fundamentally abolishing our forms of government.\u201d After all, that\u2019s been the progressive project for more than a century. Woodrow Wilson\u2014the Founding Father of American progressivism, if you will\u2014was vexed above all by the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers. For him, the maxims of the Founders were an impediment to good governance and to truly democratic politics: \u201cThe old political formulas do not fit the present problems; they read now like documents taken out of a forgotten age.\u201d\n\nOne good thing about Wilson, though, was that he just came out and said exactly what he thought. The Obama administration, in contrast, has tried to couch its effort to dismantle the separation of powers in the language of the Constitution. In its brief before the Supreme Court for NLRB v. Noel Canning, the administration argued that the president\u2019s 2012 recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board were justified, and that disallowing such appointments \u201cwould prevent the President from being able to fill offices, and exercise his constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, even when the Senate is unable, for a significant period of time, to give its advice and consent to appointments.\u201d\n\nThe justices saw through this flimsy rhetoric and ruled unanimously that the president had overreached. Even the New York Times recognized that the 9-0 ruling was \u201cmomentous, involving a constitutional adjudication of the balance of power between the president and the Senate.\u201d In other words, it was a rare victory for the separation of powers.\n\nSo when you\u2019re reading the Declaration of Independence out loud in the backyard this Fourth, remember what was at the heart of the Founders\u2019 complaint with old King George. Remember also that the Declaration, together with the Constitution, evinces the genius of a free people\u2014and that attempts to alter fundamentally our form of government will never go away. From King George to Woodrow Wilson to the current administration, no wonder they say eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 04 Jul 2014 07:48:04 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "When you\u2019re reading the Declaration of Independence, remember what was at the heart of the Founders\u2019 complaint with old King George.", "title": "Notes for Reading the Declaration of Independence on the Fourth of July", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Declaration-of-Independence.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-08T08:57:03+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/07/04/notes-for-reading-the-declaration-of-independence-on-the-fourth-of-july/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "When you\u2019re reading the Declaration of Independence, remember what was at the heart of the Founders\u2019 complaint with old King George.", "creator": "@johnddavidson", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Declaration-of-Independence.jpg"}, "title": "Notes for Reading the Declaration of Independence on the Fourth of July", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "History", "tag": "Abraham Lincoln,e New York Times,Hobby Lobby,King George,Stephen Douglas,Supreme Court,Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2014-07-04T07:48:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-08T08:57:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When you\u2019re reading the Declaration of Independence, remember what was at the heart of the Founders\u2019 complaint with old King George."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07b6\"", "article_summary": "So when you\u2019re reading the Declaration of Independence out loud in the backyard this Fourth, remember what was at the heart of the Founders\u2019 complaint with old King George.\nFrom King George to Woodrow Wilson to the current administration, no wonder they say eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.\nRemember also that the Declaration, together with the Constitution, evinces the genius of a free people\u2014and that attempts to alter fundamentally our form of government will never go away.\nWoodrow Wilson\u2014the Founding Father of American progressivism, if you will\u2014was vexed above all by the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.\nThe Obama administration, in contrast, has tried to couch its effort to dismantle the separation of powers in the language of the Constitution."}
