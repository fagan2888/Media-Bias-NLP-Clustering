However, the district agrees that the benefit increases of the employers are a factor.\u201d\n\nThe grand jury said the same thing.\n\nThe public and the district are now faced with the following set of facts:\n\n1. The board has been told by its attorney and by the grand jury that it violated statutes required for the passage of pension benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. The board acknowledged in its response to the grand jury that the taxpayers have been harmed by this violation.\n\n3. The board members are fiduciaries to the citizens of the district.\n\nOnce individuals are informed that people to whom they have a fiduciary obligation have been harmed they have a legal obligation to pursue a remedy. This is a serious, thoughtful, competent board, more so than most. What will it do?\n\nEvery taxpayer in the district and every governing body whose citizens are in the district should be watching carefully and, if necessary, pressuring the Southern Marin Fire Protection District board to take action.\n\n\u2014 David C. Brown, Mill Valley, Citizens for Sustainable Pension Plans\n\nTrump is right to speak out on immigration\n\nI hope all the liberal Republicans and lefty Democrats are reconsidering the madness of not enforcing immigration laws for decades in light of the random slaughter on the Embarcadero by a five-time deported \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrant from Mexico.\n\nThirteen percent of California prisoners are illegal immigrants, costing the state\u2019s taxpayers $1 billion a year to keep them.\n\nThirty percent of federal prisoners are undocumented immigrants, costing billions to taxpayers.\n\nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office has over 300 murder arrest warrants for undocumented immigrants who have fled back to Mexico and may reappear at anytime.\n\nEnough is enough; when we deport someone they should not be able to just walk back into the country the next day.\n\nDonald Trump is right to point out how twisted the system has become and while he may not be the best messenger, I support his right to speak his views and hope Univision, Macy\u2019s, NBC and the leftist press will support American citizens for a change.\n\n\u2014 Tim Peterson, San Anselmo\n\nCan the United Nations make a difference?\n\nThe usefulness and justification of the United Nations has been challenged since its inception at San Francisco in 1945; and now re-emerges on its 70th anniversary. These critiques persist mainly because it has not achieved the successes for which many had hoped.\n\nIts signatories \u2014 learning from the failures at the League of Nations \u2014 understood that a body involving multiple nations with differing interests could not function in harmony. Hence, they pursued a more realistic and flexible charter that could survive internal disputes.\n\nDespite its flaws, the UN has provided inroads toward mitigating world problems, which could not have been pursued without such an organization.\n\nIt has been our sole means for aligning the world body and deflecting conflicts.\n\nThis leaves the question: Are we better off with the UN than without it?\n\n\u2014 Robert Settgast, San Rafael\n\nOffering equal access for health care?\n\nCongress created Medicare 50 years ago to provide seniors with health care, giving them protection against financial ruin, and peace of mind.\n\nAll that was needed was proof of age and citizenship (or legal residency). It was so simple and straightforward that all seniors were enrolled in six months, in the pre-computer era \u2014 using index cards!\n\nCongress could have and should have extended Medicare to cover all Americans, creating a single-payer system with the free choice of doctors and hospitals that seniors enjoy. Instead, it passed the hopelessly complex Affordable Care Act, with its malfunctioning websites and uneven coverage.\n\nIt has kept the wasteful and bureaucratic insurance industry in health care, wreaked havoc on the health care system, left millions uninsured, and millions more with woefully inadequate coverage.\n\nIt has also cost far more than simply extending Medicare.\n\nIt could be argued that by not extending Medicare to cover all Americans, the government is not providing equal protection under the law.\n\nIt is well known that people without insurance or with high deductibles wait longer to seek medical care, thus their illnesses or problems become more difficult to treat. They suffer more from injuries and disabilities, resulting in decreased productivity and poorer quality of life.\n\nThey face financial hardships or ruin (half of bankruptcies in the United States are due to medical debt). And, sometimes they die because they have no insurance (an estimated 50,000 every year).\n\nThose with Medicare have more protection against the devastating effects of illness and injury, get more help overcoming or living with disabilities, and are protected against financial ruin.\n\n\u201cEqual protection\u201d has been used, with some success, to improve access to education and, now, to allow same-sex couples to marry. It seems that an even stronger case can be made regarding access to health care \u2014 which is considered a right in every other developed nation.\n\n\u2014 Ann Troy, MD, Terra Linda\n\n\u2018Love and respect all people\u2019\n\nThe ludicrous nature of Ray Schneider\u2019s July 4 letter calling for magnanimity among Christians toward gay sinners is eclipsed by the hypocrisy of the disdain toward gays and the Supreme Court ruling shown by many who claim to be Christian.\n\nIf Christians follow their God\u2019s wishes, and refrain from judging others, then why despair over the Supreme Court ruling sanctioning gay marriage?\n\nLove and respect all people. Leave judging who is or is not a sinner to your God.\n\n\u2014 Tom Short, San Rafael", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drought should trigger construction moratoriumWith all the discussion about drought restrictions, water conservation, traffic problems and over-development (WinCup, for instance), I find the absence of any discussion of a const", "title": "Marin IJ Readers\u2019 Forum for July 8", "og": {"url": "http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20150707/LOCAL1/150709881", "image": {"width": "456px", "identifier": "http://www.marinij.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NO/20150707/LOCAL1/150709881/AR/0/AR-150709881.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "283px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Marin IJ Readers\u2019 Forum for July 8"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marinij.com", "description": "Drought should trigger construction moratoriumWith all the discussion about drought restrictions, water conservation, traffic problems and over-development (WinCup, for instance), I find the absence of any discussion of a const", "title": "Marin IJ Readers\u2019 Forum for July 8", "url": "http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20150707/LOCAL1/150709881", "image": {"src": "http://www.marinij.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NO/20150707/LOCAL1/150709881/AR/0/AR-150709881.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@marinij", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "Letters, Letters news, San Rafael Letters news, CA Letters news, US Letters news, world Letters news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Letters, Letters news, San Rafael Letters news, CA Letters news, US Letters news, world Letters news."}, "article_summary": "It has kept the wasteful and bureaucratic insurance industry in health care, wreaked havoc on the health care system, left millions uninsured, and millions more with woefully inadequate coverage.\nEvery taxpayer in the district and every governing body whose citizens are in the district should be watching carefully and, if necessary, pressuring the Southern Marin Fire Protection District board to take action.\nHowever, the district agrees that the benefit increases of the employers are a factor.\u201dThe grand jury said the same thing.\nThe board acknowledged in its response to the grand jury that the taxpayers have been harmed by this violation.\nThis grand jury said the same thing."}
