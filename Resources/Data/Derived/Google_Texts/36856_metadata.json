Now, after a bad reaction to a keratin treatment last fall, the starlet sports a new short style that has led her to a \u201clow-maintenance approach\u201d to hair. She's also become the spokeswoman for Living Proof hair products. In an interview with Parade magazine, as ABC\u2019s Good Morning America reported, Aniston revealed her hair care secrets. She also tests viewers' hair IQ as part of Living Proof\u2019s new ad campaign, shown in the video below.\n\nThe 45-year-old admits in addition to her simpler hair approach, she also washes her hair every other day or every three days. During her \u201cRachel,\u201d days, Aniston confesses Chris McMillian, her best friend and hairstylist who came up with the hairdo, would style her hair regularly so it would be great. It was one of the hardest hairstyles to maintain. But now, Aniston finds relief and simplicity in her hair routine, which of course includes Living Proof hair products.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get a lot of product build-up with Living Proof and my hair doesn\u2019t get dirty straight away. I wash my hair with No Frizz Shampoo and Conditioner. And with PHD Styling Treatment I can air-dry and style my hair in 10 minutes, when it used to take 25 minutes,\u201d she told Good Morning America.\n\nAniston and Living Proof, have launched a campaign where the actress asks hair care questions to Eric Spengler, Living Proof scientist, to test \u201cyour hair IQ.\u201d The one-minute plus video on Living Proof\u2019s YouTube channel, gives true or false responses to the most commonly asked questions about hair but does not provide in-depth answers, since Spengler is a scientist, not a stylist.\n\nThe duo addresses one of the most plaguing questions for women to wish to reach Rapunzel length locks: \u201cTrue or false, cutting your hair makes it grow faster?\u201d Aniston asks in the video. Spengler responds: \u201cThat\u2019s false. Cutting your hair has no impact on hair growth.\u201d Although Living Proof\u2019s scientist is correct, the answer is much more complex than meets the eye.\n\nHair growth, just like hair loss, is based on age, genetics, hereditary male and female hair patterns, according to Healthline. Hair on the scalp grows at a rate of about half an inch a month, or six inches per year, and although cutting hair won\u2019t necessarily help it grow faster, it does help maintain it healthier. Going to the salon regularly for trims will help you to avoid split ends and from cutting off a good amount when the splits run up high.\n\nThe secret to Aniston\u2019s luscious locks lies in a simple hair IQ test that will surprise you about what you may not know about your hair.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "jennifer aniston, living proof, hair care tips, hair iq, hair locks", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Think you know everything about hair care?
