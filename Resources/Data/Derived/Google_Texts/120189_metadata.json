The world's view of America. Rountree said \"the standing of the United States\" is at stake. \"Trump is not very respected\" abroad, he said, while Clinton has been \"a diplomatic fixture for years ... for better and worse.\"\n\n2. The U.S. Supreme Court. Rountree said the court \"is one appointment away from turning liberal for the first time since the Nixon Administration.\" A lot of precedents will fall if one to three justices are replaced, he said.\n\n3. Trade policy. Trump \"claims he will change trade policy significantly, gutting prior agreements and avoiding others,\" Rountree said. Clinton supports existing agreements \"and would likely support some version of Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership.\"\n\n4. American alliances. Clinton supports NATO, Rountree says, and Trump \"has serious misgivings about it.\" Trump \"appears ready to pull back from this alliance,\" he said.\n\n5. Health Care. Trump plans to revoke the Affordable Care Act (ACA/Obamacare), Rountree said, \"but it's not clear what he would replace it with. Clinton would build on ACA and try to bring more people into the fold, while keeping the means for paying for it in place.\"\n\nRountree spoke after returning to UAH from sabbatical where he worked on books about the Supreme Court overruling itself and the Syrian refugee crisis.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Clarke Rountree, news", "title": "Alabama communications professor says election 'Clinton's to lose'", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Old guard versus new, progressive versus moderate conservative and, historically, woman versus man", "title": "Alabama communications professor says election 'Clinton's to lose'", "url": "http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2016/05/alabama_professor_says_electio.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/alphotos/photo/2016/03/31/hillary-clinton-campaigning-5bb71356475d9834.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Old guard versus new, progressive versus moderate conservative and, historically, woman versus man", "creator": "@leeroop", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/alphotos/photo/2016/03/31/hillary-clinton-campaigning-5bb71356475d9834.jpg", "title": "Alabama communications professor says election 'Clinton's to lose'", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, May 18, 2016,  1:25 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, May 18, 2016, 10:10 AM", "article_author": "Lee Roop | lroop@al.com", "Description": "Old guard versus new, progressive versus moderate conservative and, historically, woman versus man"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe239c\"", "article_summary": "Clarke Rountree, chair and professor of communication arts at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, says this year's presidential election is Hillary Clinton's to lose.\nTrade policy.\nClinton supports existing agreements \"and would likely support some version of Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership.\"\nThe U.S. Supreme Court.\nRountree spoke after returning to UAH from sabbatical where he worked on books about the Supreme Court overruling itself and the Syrian refugee crisis."}
