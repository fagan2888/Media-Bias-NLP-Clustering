Meanwhile, Gov. Cuomo is ready to sign a bill fighting petnappers, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is blowing off Cuomo's GOP rival, outrage continues over the death of Eric Garner, Mike Bloomberg takes to the skies with El Al, and Chelsea Clinton may be wearing the pants in THAT family...\n\nNow it\u2019s a vacation. After spending his first two days in Italy meeting with officials in Rome, Mayor de Blasio on Tuesday finally had some play time. He enjoyed some fun under the sun on this shimmering island, including a father-son boat trip. De Blasio climbed into a yellow inflatable motorboat with his son Dante, 16, and headed out to open waters at a leisurely pace. Dante was shirtless and behind the wheel; his dad wore a blue T-shirt and sat in the back.\n\nDe Blasio on Tuesday nominated two people to serve on the Landmarks Preservation Commission, but he withdrew another nominee because of potential conflicts of interest. Marcie Kesner\u2019s nomination was yanked after de Blasio\u2019s office determined that she would have to recuse herself from too many cases because of her job at the land-use firm Kramer Levin. De Blasio instead named Adi Shamir Baron and John Gustafsson to the panel board.\n\nThe City Council is slated to pass Avonte\u2019s Law on Thursday, requiring the Education Department and NYPD to determine which schools need door alarms. The bill, named for autistic teen Avonte Oquendo \u2014 whose remains washed up on a Queens beach in January after he disappeared from his school last October \u2014 gives the agencies until May to submit a list of schools where alarms may be warranted.\n\nLocked in a high-stakes legal tussle with several New York officials, the popular apartment sharing website Airbnb has hired a political consultant with close ties to de Blasio. Airbnb confirmed Tuesday that Bill Hyers, de Blasio\u2019s campaign manager last year, has joined its New York team, but the company declined to detail his exact role.\n\nceleste katz\n\nEXCLUSIVE: A new law is adding some bite to penalties against dognappers in New York. Gov. Cuomo is set to sign legislation Wednesday that boosts the fines for mistreating or stealing \u201ccompanion animals\u201d from $200 to $1,000, the Daily News has learned. \u201cFor many New Yorkers, a pet can be an extension of their family \u2014 which is why pet theft is a particularly heartless offense,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIncreasing the penalties for stealing or harming dogs, cats and other animals is an important way that we can crack down on this crime.\u201d The legislation marks the first time in 40 years lawmakers have increased the penalty for stealing pets.\n\nUpset that Gov. Chris Christie dismissed his campaign to unseat Gov. Cuomo as a lost cause, Republican Rob Astorino suggested Tuesday that Christie should quit as chair of the Republican Governors Association. \u201cIf Gov. Christie is unable to help a Republican candidate for governor, then maybe he should consider stepping down as chairman of the RGA,\u201d Astorino said at a press conference in Manhattan.\n\nWNYC: \"Christie says he's considering cutting benefits for the state's younger public workers, but he does not intend to cut pensions for retirees or those close to retirement.\"\n\nNYT: \"While [Cuomo] now maintains he had every right to monitor and direct the work of [an anti-corruption] commission he had created, many commissioners and investigators saw the demands as politically motivated interference that hamstrung an undertaking that the governor had publicly vowed would be independent.\"\n\nap Eric Garner and his family.\n\nNew York's top cop on Tuesday ordered his 35,000 officers retrained in the use of force as an incensed lawmaker called the death of a dad placed in a banned chokehold \u201cmurder.\u201d As cries for justice resounded on the steps of City Hall over Eric Garner\u2019s demise in police custody, an autopsy on the asthmatic father of six proved inconclusive, and a spokeswoman for the medical examiner said further tests would be needed.\n\nState Sen. Ruben Diaz said he will introduce a bill to ban the use of chokeholds in New York. The bill would create a felony crime of \"strangulation in the first degree, disregard of banned employment procedures\" if a person violates an anti-chokehold employment policy and causes serious physical injury or death.\n\nDiaz announced the bill days after Eric Garner died on Staten Island after NYPD seemingly put him in a chokehold.\n\nCity and state pols blasted police in the death of Garner and demanded criminal charges against the officers involved. \u201cThis was a murder,\u201d said state Sen. Bill Perkins (D-Manhattan) at Tuesday's rally outside City Hall. \u201cWithout even being arrested, he was choked to death. Called for pity so that he could breathe. It\u2019s outrageous. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\n\nLongtime Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind utilizes his campaign warchest as a charitable foundation, new disclosure records reveal. The beleaguered Borough Park lawmaker used more than $18,150 of his well-stocked campaign kitty for donations to yeshivas and powerful Jewish groups, including $2,400 for a scholarship at a day camp connected to a rabbi under criminal investigation.\n\nFour people vying to become the newest Board of Elections commissioner will line up to be grilled by the City Council in a series of private interviews Wednesday, the Daily News has learned. A slot opened up when Manhattan Democratic Commissioner Gregory Soumas -- who had also served as president of the 10-member bipartisan board, quit July 11.\n\nWSJ: \"Investigators are trying to determine how two bleached-white American flags mysteriously appeared atop the Brooklyn Bridge Tuesday morning\u2014and whether the stunt was an art project, a political statement or just tomfoolery.\"\n\nTINA FINEBERG/AP\n\nAmerica is still astoundingly vulnerable to terror attacks, a new study by the authors of 'The 9/11 Commission Report' warns. \u201cThe world has become more dangerous over the past few years,\u201d says the report, released Tuesday, 10 years after the original 9/11 Commission report. \u201cThe struggle against terrorism is far from over.\u201d The study warns against terrorism\u2019s \u201cnew and dangerous phase,\u201d pointing out the perils of cyber attacks.\n\nFormer Mayor Mike Bloomberg, urging American authorities to lift their ban on U.S. flights to Israel, said he'd board a commercial flight to Tel Aviv Tuesday night in a show of solidarity with the Israeli people. After a Hamas rocket demolished a home near Ben Gurion Airport, U.S. and European airlines suspended air traffic into Israel \u2014 a decision Bloomberg said had \u201chand(ed) Hamas a victory.\u201d\n\nWreckage from the doomed Malaysia Airlines plane had been \"significantly altered\" by the time international monitors arrived at the eastern Ukraine crash site on Tuesday \u2014 five days after the airliner was shot down. Several pieces of the downed Boeing 777 \u2014 including its cockpit \u2014 were sliced apart with diesel-powered saws, officials with the Organization for Security and Cooperation told reporters at the scene.\n\nA New York congressman is reintroducing legislation to install anti-missile technologies on U.S. commercial airliners, prompted by the Ukraine air disaster and Hamas rockets in the Gaza crisis. Rep. Steve Israel (D-Long Island) on Tuesday confirmed his plans to dust off and recraft a 2003 proposal he made with Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) to require the Defense Department to equip passenger planes with protections against missiles. The original legislation followed high-profile air tragedies and the 9/11 attacks.\n\nLUCAS JACKSON / REUTERS\n\nIn the Clinton holy trinity, Chelsea Clinton is actually the one wearing the pants. The political heiress rules the roost and is operating as mom Hillary's \"shadow campaign manager\" in the lead-up to a likely 2016 run, according to a new takedown book by conservative journalist Daniel Halper, \"Clinton, Inc.\" Team Clinton has laughed off Halper's claims, attributed to insiders and unnamed sources, suggesting Halper's only out to make a \"quick buck\" by joining the wave of supposed Clinton tell-all tomes out this summer \u2014 including Ed Klein's \"Blood Feud.\"\n\nA new legal battle emerged over Obamacare after two federal appeals courts issued contradictory rulings Tuesday on a key aspect of the landmark healthcare reform law. The decisions - one by a court in Washington, the other by judges in 100 miles away in Richmond, Va. - addressed the government subsidies that help millions of low- and middle-income Americans pay their premiums.\n\nPolitico: \"When Eric Schultz gaggles with reporters Wednesday as President Barack Obama flies from San Francisco to Los Angeles, it will be a dress rehearsal for a new role: stepping behind the White House podium as the new principal deputy press secretary.\"\n\nFrom our Bramhall's World:\n\nLeaders' Lineup:\n\nPresident Obama\n\n9:20 AM: Attends a House Majority PAC event, Four Seasons, San Francisco\n\n12:00 PM: Delivers remarks and answers questions at a DCCC event, Private Residence, Los Altos Hills, Calif.\n\n4:55 PM: Attends a DNC event, Private Residence, Los Angeles\n\nGov.
