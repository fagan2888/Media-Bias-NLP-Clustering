She is currently trying to fend off a surprisingly strong challenge in next week's primary from Columbia law professor Tim Wu, and to explain to downstate Democrats her relatively conservative record in Congress, which included supporting gun rights and opposing some pro-immigration measures.\n\n\u201cI admire what she did,\u201d Niederman said, pointing to their joint support for the Affordable Care Act, which Hochul has suggested played into her defeat for reelection in 2012. (She also touted some votes against parts of the bill during that campaign.)\n\n\u201cYou stand for what you believe in. You don\u2019t flip flop,\u201d Niederman said, while noting that \u201cno one is perfect.\u201d\n\nNiederman said the group's support for the Cuomo-Hochul ticket was the result of measuring the governor\u2019s ability to be \u201cresponsive to the needs of the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue of jobs and health coverage and so on, there is a track record of achievement\u2014major achievements\u2014from the governor for the needs from the community,\u201d he continued. \u201cI believe the community in Williamsburg \u2026 will strongly support her and the governor.\u201d\n\nHochul\u2019s meeting with rival Aroynem leaders on the same day was similarly well-received.\n\n\u201cKathy Hochul recently visited with community leaders, impressing us with her sincerity, dedication to hard work, and grasp of the issues facing our communal services and institutions,\u201d two leading Aroynem leaders, Rabbi Moishe Indig and Isaac Sofer of the Central United Talmudical Academy, wrote in a statement.\n\nIndig and Soffer also praised Cuomo\u2019s work on behalf of the Hasidic community, saying, \u201cWhether standing up for increased aid to our schools or supporting help for our large families, Andrew Cuomo has insisted on equity for our communities.\u201d\n\nThey continued: \u201cWhile some special interests are angry with the fiscally responsible course Governor Cuomo has chosen for New York, the Satmar community believes their motivations address only their specific concerns, not the larger good of such a large state. This election is too important for ideological points to be made with a protest vote, Andrew Cuomo and Kathy Hochul deserve our support.\u201d\n\nMichael Tobman, a Brooklyn-based political consultant who works closely with the Aronyem community, said the decision to send Hochul to meet with the Hasidic community was an important one.\n\n\u201cThis was a meeting and a conversation that needed to happen,\" he said. \"Support up to that point was not a sure a thing.\"\n\nThe support of both Satmar sects, which often oppose one another in local elections, would seem to add several thousand votes to the columns of both Hochul and Cuomo. The leaders of both sects said they would spend the next week aggressively reaching out to their members ahead of the primary next Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt is a bloc vote,\" Tobman said. \"It\u2019ll be a solid vote. It\u2019s not pulling out X-thousands of votes, 60 percent of which will go for the ticket. One hundred percent will.\u201d\n\nHochul might need those votes as she faces Wu, who won the endorsement of the New York Times last week, and has forced the Democratic establishment to rally behind Hochul, who is not well-known outside her former congressional district.\n\nCuomo is facing a challenge from Fordham law professor Zephyr Teachout, whose spokesperson did not return a request for comment.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of the overwhelming support for Democrat Kathy Hochul in every community across the state because of her commitment to building on the progress New York has made over the last four years,\" said James Freedland, a spokesman for Hochul. \"There\u2019s no doubt that Kathy will have the broadest coalition of support for any candidate in the race.\"\n\nCORRECTION: This story initially stated Hochul lost her reelection campaign in 2010. She was elected in a special election in 2011, and lost reelection in 2012.\n\nAuthors:\n\nThis story tagged under: Albany\n\nAndrew Cuomo", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Politico PRO", "description": "<p>Brooklyn's two competing Satmar Hasidic sects are uniting behind Governor Andrew Cuomo and his running mate, Kathy Hochul, according to leaders in both camps.</p>", "title": "Rival Satmar sects agree on Cuomo-Hochul", "url": "http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2014/09/rival-satmar-sects-agree-on-cuomo-hochul-015461", "image": "http://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a%20-%20CuomoHochul_0.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "<p>Brooklyn's two competing Satmar Hasidic sects are uniting behind Governor Andrew Cuomo and his running mate, Kathy Hochul, according to leaders in both camps.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| AP Photo/Richard Drew Rival Satmar sects agree on Cuomo-HochulBrooklyn\u2019s two competing Satmar Hasidic sects are uniting behind Governor Andrew Cuomo and his running mate, Kathy Hochul, according to leaders in both camps.\nAndrew Cuomo and Kathy Hochul.\nThe support of both Satmar sects, which often oppose one another in local elections, would seem to add several thousand votes to the columns of both Hochul and Cuomo.\nThe leaders of both sects said they would spend the next week aggressively reaching out to their members ahead of the primary next Tuesday.\nThe rival Zaloynim and Aroynem factions each received a visit from Hochul, Cuomo's pick for lieutenant governor, in recent weeks, leaders of both groups told Capital."}
