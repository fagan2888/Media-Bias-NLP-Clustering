Some of the biggest organization you\u2019d rarely associate with medicine \u2013 from our space agency to companies best known for truck engine oils \u2013 are either spinning off their technologies to create the next medical breakthroughs, or making investments, acquisitions and strategic partnerships.\n\nHere are four good examples of futuristic \u201chealthcare companies,\u201d which outlined their approaches and what they\u2019re hoping to change in the medical industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNASA\n\nThe space agency has one of the greatest legacies of spinning off research into great innovations \u2013 including healthcare. When it comes to medicine today, the organization is focused on developing innovations that help treat crew members in space. For example, there\u2019s keen interest at NASA at addressing issues like bone-density loss and intracranial pressure that can impact vision, said John Sankovic, director of technology incubation and innovation at NASA.\n\nThese concepts can turn into the next mainstream medical breakthroughs. For example, NASA is considering the question of how to generate IV fluid in space. \u201cWe\u2019re on a three-year mission to MARS and there\u2019s a six-month shelf-life for saline,\u201d Sankovic noted.\n\nThe answer to that question could help create new breakthroughs for emergency medicine or rural healthcare.\n\nCox Communications\n\nAmerica\u2019s third largest cable television provider is in observation mode when it comes to how it can play the best role in healthcare, said Asheesh Saksena, chief strategy officer at Cox Communications. But the company has a mantra: they want to put technology in people\u2019s homes that will capture data and make sense out of it.\n\nThat means Cox\u2019s interest is in sectors like telemedicine and home healthcare.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s already done more than observe: it struck a partnership with Cleveland Clinic earlier this year to form Vivre Health. It also made an investment in telehealth company HealthSpot.\n\n\u201cHow can we make people manage their health conditions through home?\u201d Saksena said.\n\nLubrizol\n\nThis is a $7 billion company most people know from its oil and fuel additive business. But in recent years it has built out its life science division with a focus on pharmaceutical and medical device innovations.\n\nThe company \u201cbrings to the table what original equipment manufacturers don\u2019t see,\u201d said Murty Vyakarnam, the company\u2019s global director of R&D. Vyakarnam specifically mentioned post-operative pain management and drug delivery systems as areas of interest (in September, Lubrizol acquired Particle Sciences to expand its pharmaceutical development and drug delivery capabilities).\n\n\u201cThese are solutions OEMs weren\u2019t think about or have all the solutions,\u201d he said.\n\nParker Hannifin\n\nA $13 billion company that supplies parts of aerospace and large industrial machinery, Parker said late last year it was working on 100 different medical advancements: from devices that guide wires through the body to coverings around medical devices to cut the risk of infection.\n\nParker has had a particular interest in orthopedics. Its latest version of an exoskeleton to help those with spinal cord injuries walk came out this year, and last week it announced a project with the Department of Defense. It has also invested in an orthopedics design company.\n\nDale Ashby, vice president of technology and innovation at Parker Hannifin, said the company has benefited through constantly interviewing patients.\n\nWe hear, \u201d \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be cool if\u2026\u2019 or \u2018I love that medical device, except\u2026\u2019 That\u2019s where we\u2019re excited,\u201d Ashby said.\n\nThe executives from the four companies spoke over the weekend at the Cleveland Clinic Medical Innovation Summit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NASA, Parker Hannifin, Lubrizol and Cox Communications: All in the healthcare business.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "NASA, Parker Hannifin, Lubrizol and Cox Communications: All in the healthcare business.", "title": "From aerospace to cable TV: How 4 industry outsiders plan to change medicine", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/nasamars_flickr_nasaonthecommons.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-04T08:04:47-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/10/non-healthcare-companies/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/nasamars_flickr_nasaonthecommons.jpg", "description": "NASA, Parker Hannifin, Lubrizol and Cox Communications: All in the healthcare business.", "card": "summary", "title": "Meet 4 non-healthcare companies that will change medicine"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Cleveland, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland Clinic Medical Innovation Summit, Cox, defense, events, investing in heallthcare, Lubrizol, NASA, OB, Parker Hannifin, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Biotech", "tag": "Parker Hannifin", "published_time": "2015-10-25T19:29:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-04T08:04:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe40d8\"", "article_summary": "Here are four good examples of futuristic \u201chealthcare companies,\u201d which outlined their approaches and what they\u2019re hoping to change in the medical industry.\nCompanies like Under Armour and Google are the faces of change in healthcare: high-profile consumer-driven companies stepping into medicine to bring new ideas and products.\nThe executives from the four companies spoke over the weekend at the Cleveland Clinic Medical Innovation Summit.\nDale Ashby, vice president of technology and innovation at Parker Hannifin, said the company has benefited through constantly interviewing patients.\nWhen it comes to medicine today, the organization is focused on developing innovations that help treat crew members in space."}
