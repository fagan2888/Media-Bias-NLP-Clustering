Obama is on a four-day campaign swing out west. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\n5046512\n\nA leading House Republican wants a criminal prosecution referral for Oregon state officials, alleging they illegally coordinated with a former Oregon governor\u2019s campaign advisers on the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange and misused $300 million in federal taxpayer dollars.\n\nHouse Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (HOGR) Chairman and Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz made the request in letters to U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch and Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum on Wednesday. Chaffetz cited a new 200-page HOGR report made public Wednesday drawing from more than 170,000 pages of documents about the state\u2019s failed exchange, Cover Oregon.\n\nThe report claims former Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber\u2019s official staff and campaign operatives intervened in an independent state Obamacare board\u2019s decisions, using campaign funds and personal email accounts and other \u201cback channels\u201d to influence a move from the state-run website to HealthCare.gov, and by extension, influence the governor\u2019s 2014 reelection odds.\n\nHOGR also faults the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for allowing the collapse of Cover Oregon, and failing to conduct proper oversight of federal funds. (RELATED: Oregon To Drop Its Disastrous Obamacare Exchange)\n\n\u201cThe state exchange never came to fruition, and the money is gone,\u201d Chaffetz wrote to Lynch. \u201cOur investigation shows Oregon state officials misused federal funds, and improperly commingled official and political resources for the purpose of enriching the political prospects of then-Oregon state Gov. John Kitzhaber.\u201d\n\nCover Oregon became famous for spending $8 million on a marketing campaign that produced a psychedelic ad to promote enrollment in 2013. But the Cover Oregon rollout in October 2013 was a disaster, much like the federal rollout of HealthCare.gov.\n\nKitzhaber resigned in February 2015 amid allegations that he and his fianc\u00e9 used the governor\u2019s office for personal gain and to promote environmental groups.\n\nThe committee says the documents and testimony unearthed in a year-long investigation reveal the governor\u2019s official and campaign staff ignored official technology experts\u2019 recommendations and steered the supposedly independent Cover Oregon Board of Directors to switch from the state-run website to HealthCare.gov. The report also claims the governor\u2019s campaign spent its funds to support the governor in his official capacity in an attempt to improve the governor\u2019s reelection chances.\n\n\u201cDocuments and testimony show the involvement of Kitzhaber\u2019s staff and campaign advisers was inconsistent with the intent of Oregon law and the Cover Oregon governance model,\u201d the report said.\n\nDocuments also show the governor and his team \u201cattempted to thwart record-keeping laws through the use of offline, secret back channels,\u201d including personal email accounts, the report said.\n\nPatricia McCaig, one of Kitzhaber\u2019s top political operatives, told the governor she thought asking for extra money to restore the website would be politically risky. So, the day after an April 8, 2014, call between Kitzhaber\u2019s campaign staff, official staff, and Cover Oregon officials, McCaig on April 9 sent Kitzhaber an email \u201coutlining a plan to stage the decision to switch to HealthCare.gov,\u201d according to the committee report.\n\nThe governor also told his staff in a May 2014 email he was frustrated by the \u201cfree independent expenditure campaign that the Cover Oregon issue is giving to Dennis Richardson,\u201d his Republican opponent in the gubernatorial election.\n\nMcCaig sent Kitzhaber a list of options, including requesting the Attorney General to take legal action against Oracle, a Silicon Valley technology company contracting with Cover Oregon. The governor sent a letter to the Attorney General sent a letter requesting that shortly afterwards.\n\nFollow Kathryn on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
