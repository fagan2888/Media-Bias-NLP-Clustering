They set the foundation and did the hard work.\"\n\nCU doesn't have any big-name steeplers left on the roster, but the Buffs appear to be in good hands as they try to keep their rich tradition going in the event.\n\n\"We won't have a contender for the NCAA championship this year, but we'll have a very nice crew of young people in the development phase; they're going to be good in the future,\" CU head coach Mark Wetmore said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCU's tradition of success in the steeplechase goes back to Clint Wells, who was the school's first all-American in the event, in 1995 and 1996. He is one of six CU men to reach all-American status in the steeplechase.\n\nThe women have had at least one all-American steepler for 10 consecutive years, starting with Natalie Florence in 2005. Jenny Barringer, Emma Coburn and Shalaya Kipp combined for six national titles and 11 all-American honors from 2006-2014.\n\nColorado s Erin Clark cruised to first place in 3,000-meter steeplechase on Saturday.

Maybe a little bit of added pressure because you want to keep that tradition going, but it just keeps me sharp, keeps me on my toes.\n\n\"People do expect us to turn out good steeplers. I'm really looking to do my part in that.\"\n\nTheroux didn't compete Saturday, but has been top three in the Pac-12 the past two years, including runner-up a year ago. He posted the nation's 15th-best time a week ago and won't compete in the steeplechase again until the Pac-12 championships next month.\n\nWinter proved on Saturday that the Buffs now have a solid 1-2 punch.\n\n\"That was a very, very good debut,\" Wetmore said. \"I'm not sure I've ever seen a Colorado debut that fast up here. He'll make rapid strides. He is going to have a good chance of making the NCAA final in his very first season running the steeplechase.\"\n\nFreshman Adam Peterman was third on Saturday and Wetmore said he has a chance to be an NCAA qualifier this year, too.\n\n\"We have a lot of really good, fit guys,\" Winter said. \"You add in that little bit of technique and then, boom, you have some really, really good guys. It's fun to be a part of it, and it's new for me.\"\n\nLed by Barringer, Coburn and Kipp, the women have enjoyed the most success over the years, and there's hope of keeping that going with a young set of steeplers.\n\nFreshman Eric Clark cruised to first place Saturday, in 10:33.27, with three of her teammates finished 2-3-4.\n\n\"Erin Clark ran a really nice time and we're pleased with that,\" Wetmore said. \"The women behind her were pretty good for novices and they'll improve really fast.\"\n\nAdd in sophomore Melanie Nun, who is battling a \"minor\" back issue, and the Buffs like their chances of making a little noise on the women's side this spring, too.\n\n\"The kids keep the tradition going in everything,\" Wetmore said. \"They make it happen. Billy (Nelson) helped Shalaya and Emma and then they helped Blake and the women coming around now, and it just feeds on each other.\"\n\nFor CU's young steeplechasers, it's inspiring to see how much growth previous stars made during their collegiate careers.\n\n\"It shows how much improvement can be made here if you do things right and follow the coaches' instructions,\" Clark said.\n\n\"There's definitely some pride in wanting to build upon the great steeple reputation that they already have here.\"\n\nBrian Howell: howellb@dailycamera.com, on Twitter: @BrianHowell33.", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-04-11T16:11:54-0600", "sailthru.author": "By Brian Howell \n \n  BuffZone.com Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27895655:view"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "All-AmericansA list of the Colorado steeplechase runners who have earned all-American status over the years: \nMen\n\nAdam Batliner: 1998\nBilly Nelson: 2007, 2008\nTom Reese: 1999\nSteve Slattery: 2000, 2001, 2002\nAric Van Halen: 2012, 2013\nClint Wells: 1995, 96\nWomen\n\nJenny Barringer: 2006*, 2007, 2008*, 2009*\nEmma Coburn: 2010, 2011*, 2013*\nNatalie Florence: 2005\nShalaya Kipp: 2010, 2011, 2012*, 2014\n* Won national championship\nGoing into Saturday, Colorado junior Connor Winter had some nerves.", "title": "CU track: Buffs look to keep steeplechase tradition alive", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0411/20150411_042111_POTTS16.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-04-11T21:50:10-0600", "endDate": "2025-04-11T16:14:05-0600", "news_keywords": "Buffzone, cu, college sports, university of colorado, boulder, colorado", "byline": "By Brian HowellBuffZone.com", "pubDate": "2015-04-11T16:24:13-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-11T16:11:54-0600", "sailthru.title": "CU track: Buffs look to keep steeplechase tradition alive", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0411/20150411_042111_POTTS16_300.jpg", "description": "All-AmericansA list of the Colorado steeplechase runners who have earned all-American status over the years: \nMen\n\nAdam Batliner: 1998\nBilly Nelson: 2007, 2008\nTom Reese: 1999\nSteve Slattery: 2000, 2001, 2002\nAric Van Halen: 2012, 2013\nClint Wells: 1995, 96\nWomen\n\nJenny Barringer: 2006*, 2007, 2008*, 2009*\nEmma Coburn: 2010, 2011*, 2013*\nNatalie Florence: 2005\nShalaya Kipp: 2010, 2011, 2012*, 2014\n* Won national championship\nGoing into Saturday, Colorado junior Connor Winter had some nerves.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "All-AmericansA list of the Colorado steeplechase runners who have earned all-American status over the years: \nMen\n\nAdam Batliner: 1998\nBilly Nelson: 2007, 2008\nTom Reese: 1999\nSteve Slattery: 2000, 2001, 2002\nAric Van Halen: 2012, 2013\nClint Wells: 1995, 96\nWomen\n\nJenny Barringer: 2006*, 2007, 2008*, 2009*\nEmma Coburn: 2010, 2011*, 2013*\nNatalie Florence: 2005\nShalaya Kipp: 2010, 2011, 2012*, 2014\n* Won national championship\nGoing into Saturday, Colorado junior Connor Winter had some nerves.", "title": "CU track: Buffs look to keep steeplechase tradition alive"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0411/20150411_042111_POTTS16.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb842\"", "article_summary": "\"You add in that little bit of technique and then, boom, you have some really, really good guys.\nCU doesn't have any big-name steeplers left on the roster, but the Buffs appear to be in good hands as they try to keep their rich tradition going in the event.\nMaybe a little bit of added pressure because you want to keep that tradition going, but it just keeps me sharp, keeps me on my toes.\n\"The kids keep the tradition going in everything,\" Wetmore said.\nHe is one of six CU men to reach all-American status in the steeplechase."}
