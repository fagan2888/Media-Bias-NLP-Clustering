I think there is a moment where the right pieces are in place,\u201d Ben Walter, president and CEO of insurer Hiscox USA, said in a recent conversation about flood risk with Wells Media. \u201cThere\u2019s a combination of a lot of fiscal pressure and the right pieces are in place on the private side to be able to respond to the opportunity. But it takes an enormous amount of political will.\u201d\n\nIn Walter\u2019s view, among the factors favoring privatization now are plenty of capital in the industry, advances in risk modeling, and Washington politicians who talk about limiting the cost of government. Another is that the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is currently $24 billion in debt.\n\nPowered by InsuranceJournal.tv\n\n\u201cThe point here is, it\u2019s time to take the private sector involvement in flood insurance seriously and figure out what we need to do to make that happen,\u201d Walter says.\n\nAccording to the insurance executive, moving to a more private system is a political challenge because it would require policymakers to openly indicate how much of the risk should be borne by property owners and how much, if any, should be subsidized by the government.\n\nIt may also require mandating that people in flood prone areas buy insurance, he argues.\n\nKeeping the flood insurance subsidies would be fine if in fact that is what Congress and the public want, he offers. But he questions whether that\u2019s the case.\n\n\u201cThe question is have we really signed up to take the risk? When Congress passed the program it was designed to be self-funding but we\u2019re uncomfortable with what that really means,\u201d Walter says. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with that. I still think that the private sector can more efficiently allocate that risk because we do it with hurricanes and we do it really well. We can make that choice.\u201d\n\nCongress returned from its August recess last week. While there are proposals and efforts to move flood insurance pricing to actuarial levels and encourage private sector involvement, there are also calls for the government to discontinue the limited role the private insurers now have under the Write Your-Own (WYO) program to write and service policies.\n\nThe Biggert-Waters Act of 2012 was an attempt by Congress to address the NFIP\u2019s debt by eliminating certain premium subsidies and phasing-in premium increases so that prices more closely reflect the risk of flood-prone properties. However, Congress backtracked on those changes two years later after consumers protested, passing the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act (HFIAA) that rolled back key provisions of Biggert-Waters.\n\nPolitical Realities\n\nIn a discussion with Wells Media\u2019s Andy Simpson, Walter further discussed what he sees as the realities and the politics of flood insurance, urging policymakers to learn from earthquake and terrorism experiences and make the tough political choices needed to let privatization happen.\n\nAccording to Walter, politicians can differ over whether flood is a risk that should be shared by the public or privatized. \u201cI have a strong view that it should be privatized and that the market can efficiently respond to that, but that is a philosophical debate that we can have,\u201d he says.\n\nBut that\u2019s not quite what\u2019s been going on.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s unfortunate about flood is that we\u2019ve chosen to do it, but not really do it. We haven\u2019t done it in an actuarially sound way, where the government really is just the risk-taker of last resort.\u201d\n\nIn his view, the current flood insurance set-up contrasts with what has been done with terrorism insurance under the the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), where the government truly is the risk-taker of last resort. \u201cThat\u2019s really not what\u2019s happened with flood because you don\u2019t force any kind of actuarially sound rates,\u201d he says.\n\nThe 2012 Biggert-Waters Act attempted to install more actuarially-sound pricing but it didn\u2019t last.\n\n\u201c[A]s soon as people saw rate hikes in an election year, everybody backed off, and they repealed it. There is no political will to have this thing [flood insurance] be actuarially sound. That\u2019s simply because people have a benefit and taking away a benefit from people is hard, just like cutting Social Security or cutting Medicare, or any entitlement cuts. It\u2019s basically an entitlement,\u201d according to Walter.\n\nGiven the political realities, he suggests any move to risk-based pricing would have to be done gradually, along some sort of glidepath. If this were to happen, he says, there would likely be two results.\n\n\u201cOne is you will see more private sector participation and actuarially sound rates, which they are not today,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNumber two \u2014 and this is the really hidden, ugly part of this\u2013 is you\u2019ll see less development in floodplains. Why do people build in floodplains? Because it\u2019s subsidized. Why do people over-invest in housing? Because it\u2019s subsidized.\u201d\n\nHe said that in addition to real estate interests, others factors including geographic, socioeconomic and even racial politics influence how flood insurance is addressed.\n\n\u201cWe do have to accept that there is a socioeconomic and therefore, likely even, and on the uglier side, a racial component to this because outside of on the water in Florida, low lying areas tend to be less expensive and therefore more populated by minorities or those who are socio-economically disadvantaged,\u201d he said.\n\nHe maintains that turning over the flood program to private insurers promises to reduce the politics.\n\n\u201c[P]rivatizing the flood program would be much, much better because the insurance industry does this for a living. It\u2019s not politicized. It\u2019s actuarial,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s us trying to get a reasonable return on our money, whereas you know that flood maps are a political animal because of who gets a subsidy and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhy Now?\n\nHe says there are several reasons he thinks now is the time to consider privatization.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, obviously, you have an era of fiscal discipline in Washington. You have some people in power who are professing that. We\u2019ll see if they execute on it, but they\u2019re professing it, number one,\u201d the Hiscox executive says.\n\nNumber two is the record levels of capital in the global insurance and reinsurance industry. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money out there to take the risk and absorb the transition. It would be a hard thing to transition the program immediately after one of the biggest floods we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s at a time when there\u2019s calm and there\u2019s a good amount of capital built up in the industry. It\u2019s a good time to do it.\u201d\n\nAlso, he said there are now very sophisticated modeling and risk transfer options.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re much more advanced. We can really control what our aggregates are. If you can control your aggregates and there\u2019s enough capital in the industry, that\u2019s when you want to make a transition happen,\u201d he says.\n\nHe said a privatized system could include a role for government and even for certain subsidies as has been done with health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cMy point is the thing should be administered by the private sector and actuarially sound rates should be set by the private sector. In my view as much risk as possible should be pushed to the private sector because we\u2019re prepared to take it,\u201d he says, adding the government needs to decide how much of the risk it would retain.\n\nThere are three areas in particular where he thinks the private sector could do a better job than the government: \u201cI think pricing, modeling, and claims administration. I think having the best insurers in the world administer claims rather than FEMA administering the claims is a better thing.\u201d\n\nMandatory Coverage\n\nHe acknowledges there is a major challenge trying to get more people to buy flood insurance while simultaneously moving the premiums to risk-based levels. He points to the way earthquake insurance is handled as the way to not do it:\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve never understood. I\u2019m coming out and saying, \u2018I don\u2019t get this.\u2019 If you live on the beach in Florida and you borrow money to buy your house, the bank and/or Fannie and Freddie, whoever\u2019s taking the risk, will require you to carry hurricane insurance on that property. Because if a hurricane blows it over, they have no collateral left, right?\n\n\u201cIn California, you can buy a house on the San Andreas Fault and the bank and/or Fannie and Freddie does not require you to have earthquake insurance. I don\u2019t get that. What\u2019s interesting is, with the NFIP, the government is explicitly taking a risk and just not charging enough for it, right? In California and in other earthquake zones what\u2019s going on is the government\u2019s taking the risk. It\u2019s just that nobody admits it.\u201d\n\nThe answer, he believes, is to require flood insurance.\n\n\u201cI think you should have to carry it. Frankly, the reason that earthquake insurance doesn\u2019t work is it\u2019s the same challenges that were in the private individual health insurance marketplace before Obamacare. If not everyone has to have it, then it\u2019s adversely selective. If everyone participates, there\u2019s a market. If only certain people participate selectively there\u2019s no insurance market\u201d\n\nBut is this even doable politically? Wouldn\u2019t that be like raising taxes?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s like. You\u2019re a hundred percent right.\u201d\n\nBut he said the reality is that taxpayers pay for it now \u201cbut they don\u2019t blame politicians for the fact that they do. Let\u2019s be honest about what this is. That really is the challenge.\u201d\n\nWhy Not?\n\nHe said the reason that not many private insurers are in the flood insurance market now is because private carriers can\u2019t compete with the subsidized rates under the NFIP.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to get it through the NFIP than it is to charge what you\u2019d have to charge to make any money on it,\u201d he says.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only obstacle to private sector entry. The other is political uncertainty. Insurers are worried they will be forced to underwrite at an actuarial loss because it\u2019s politically popular to do so. \u201cUnless you have assurances that that\u2019s not the case, that will keep people out of the market,\u201d Walter stresses.\n\nHe said he thinks private industry is \u201cdesperate to put capital to work\u201d and would do so in the flood arena if restrictions were lifted. But he\u2019s not holding his breath.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic about the government creating the right conditions for private sector involvement,\u201d he concludes. \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic about the private sector getting involved if those restrictions could be taken off.\u201d\n\nIf that were to happen, Hiscox is ready to dive in.\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "The private insurance industry is ready and anxious to take on flood risk, and politicians should reform the federal program now to take advantage of this", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "The private insurance industry is ready and anxious to take on flood risk, and politicians should reform the federal program now to take advantage of this", "title": "Why Now Is Time to Privatize Flood Insurance: a Candid Conversation with Hiscox USA CEO Walter", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2015/09/Walter_Ben-Hiscox-300x225.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-14T12:23:31-04:00", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2015/09/14/381036.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The private insurance industry is ready and anxious to take on flood risk, and politicians should reform the federal program now to take advantage of this", "creator": "@ijournal", "image": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2015/09/Walter_Ben-Hiscox-300x225.jpg", "title": "Why Now Is Time to Privatize Flood Insurance: a Candid Conversation with Hiscox USA CEO Walter", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2015-09-14", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "National News", "tag": "WYO", "published_time": "2015-09-14T05:08:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T12:23:31-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7dc2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMy point is the thing should be administered by the private sector and actuarially sound rates should be set by the private sector.\nI think there is a moment where the right pieces are in place,\u201d Ben Walter, president and CEO of insurer Hiscox USA, said in a recent conversation about flood risk with Wells Media.\nAnother is that the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is currently $24 billion in debt.\nKeeping the flood insurance subsidies would be fine if in fact that is what Congress and the public want, he offers.\n\u201cOne is you will see more private sector participation and actuarially sound rates, which they are not today,\u201d he said."}
