SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) — Jae Yeong Hwang drove in two runs and Hae Chan Choi weathered a late Chicago rally to lead South Korea to an 8-4 win in Sunday’s Little League World Series championship game.

Hwang gave up one hit in two-plus innings while striking out four. He also drove in the Asia-Pacific Region champs’ first two runs as they built an 8-1 lead before Jackie Robinson West made it close.

Choi, who had a homer and scored twice, pitched the last four innings for South Korea, which won its third title after back-to-back championships in 1985 and ’85.

International teams have won the last three and four of the last five titles.

Brandon Green went 5 2-3 innings for Chicago, which had survived four straight knockout games before the final.
