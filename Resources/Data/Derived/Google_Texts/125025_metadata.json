It reminds us, in the midst of a national conversation about police violence toward and intimidation of minorities, that African American parents aren't the only ones who are likely to have the talk with their children. It's a conversation about deferring to law enforcement even if you haven't done anything wrong\u2014New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has a mixed-race son, is one of a number of public figures who has described the necessary discussion about behaving extra-carefully when dealing with a police officer.\n\nPember's account of \"driving while Indian\" resonates with what de Blasio and others have said, and has an added level of danger: A special-needs child unburdened, to an extent, by cynicism\u2014a child for whom the talk might not compute. Here are a few chilling lines from the piece:\n\nI tried to calmly answer the officer\u2019s stream of questions.\n\n\u201cLicense and proof of insurance,\u201d he asked tersely.\n\nAnd here is where I almost vomited from fear.\n\nAlways trying to be helpful, my daughter, Rosa, who is autistic, opened the glove box for the insurance papers. Reflexively the officer put his hand on his gun as he quickly stepped forward and shined the light toward Rosa and the glove box. She let out a little scream.\n\nTo read the whole thing, see \"Speak Your Piece: Driving While Indian\" at the Daily Yonder.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Native mother with a special-needs child is pulled over by a cop on a dark country road.
