HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) â€” Former porn star Jenna Jameson is suing her ex-boyfriend, mixed-martial arts fighter Tito Ortiz, over ownership of the Southern California home they shared before they split two years ago.

The Orange County Register reports (http://bit.ly/1L61BxB ) that Jameson filed a lawsuit last week claiming Ortiz failed to honor an agreement to add her name to the title of the waterfront home in Huntington Beach. The newspaper says Ortiz is sole owner of the home and lives there with their twin boys.

The suit says Jameson contributed to most of the down payment and allowed Ortiz's name to be on the title with the understanding that she would have 50 percent of the financial interests.

A message seeking comment from Ortiz's representatives was not immediately returned Tuesday.
