And if you fail to sign up for insurance during the current open enrollment period, you\u2019ll also lock yourself into an even steeper fine for 2015.\n\nBut what if you couldn\u2019t afford health insurance, or you have religious reasons for opposing it? The law allows for exemptions, and a lot of people are expected to qualify. In fact, according to a report out earlier this year by the Congressional Budget Office, by 2016, almost 90 percent of the 30 million people still uninsured won\u2019t pay the penalty, primarily because they\u2019ll qualify for one of nearly two dozen exemptions.\n\nHere, experts discuss the five exemptions likely to be most commonly used, as well as how to go about applying for them.\n\n1. You live in a state that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid.\n\nNationwide, about 4 million low-income people will remain uninsured because they live in one of the 23 states that chose not to expand its Medicaid program in 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation,\n\n\u201cThis should be one of the more commonly used exemptions,\u201d says Karen Pollitz, senior fellow with Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nPeople with incomes at or below 138 percent of poverty \u2013 about $27,000 a year for a family of three \u2013 won\u2019t be eligible for Medicaid coverage if they live in a state that didn\u2019t expand the program under the Affordable Care Act. In many cases, these folks also didn\u2019t get subsidies to help buy private insurance through the Marketplace because their income was too low to qualify for premium tax credits. The law doesn\u2019t provide financial assistance to people with incomes below poverty.\n\nInitially, people in this situation were required to apply for Medicaid and be denied, or to get a hardship exemption certificate by applying through the Marketplace.\n\n\u201cThe idea was you had to apply to the Marketplace by the end of this year to qualify,\u201d says Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. But the IRS recently changed course, thanks in part to a blog post Jost co-wrote in the journal Health Affairs urging it to do so.\n\nNow, this hardship exemption can be claimed on your 2014 tax return.\n\n2. Your income is too low to file for taxes.\n\nMillions of Americans don\u2019t file a tax return because their income falls below the threshold that requires them to do so. That\u2019s the case for a single person who earned less than $10,150 in 2014, or a married couple with an income below $20,300.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have to file taxes then you are also exempt from the mandate,\u201d says Linda Blumberg, health economist with the Urban Institute.\n\nSince you aren\u2019t required to file a tax return, no action is required to take advantage of this exemption from the health law. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to apply for the exemption,\u201d Blumberg says, because it will be automatically applied.\n\n3. Health insurance is too expensive for you.\n\nDespite subsidies to lower costs, health insurance remains unaffordable for millions of Americans. If coverage is too pricey for you, you\u2019ll qualify for an exemption.\n\n\u201cThe rule is you get the affordability exemption if the cheapest cost plan is more than 8 percent [of your income],\u201d Pollitz says.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why people might find themselves in this circumstance, she says.\n\nFor example, individuals with incomes in 2014 of roughly $29,000 and families of four who earned about $59,000 would qualify for a subsidy to help pay for insurance, but would still be required to pay more than 8 percent of their income \u2013 the law\u2019s threshold for insurance being deemed too costly.\n\nSome people can stay under that 8 percent threshold by purchasing a less expensive plan, Pollitz points out, \u201calthough when they do so they\u2019re going to pick up a lot more cost-sharing,\u201d she says.\n\nBut if you\u2019re older, the law allows insurers to charge you more than a younger person for the same health plan. For many people in their 50s and early 60s, it\u2019s possible even the least expensive bronze-level plan will be too pricey.\n\nThat\u2019s also likely to be the case for smokers and people living in an area with high medical costs \u2013 two additional factors for which insurers can charge consumers more. If these extra costs tacked onto your health plan premium drive the price of insurance above 8 percent of your household income, you\u2019ll be allowed to file for an exemption.\n\nYou can either claim it when you file your federal taxes, or apply for an exemption certificate through the Marketplace.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Heart disease affects people of all ages.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Plus, how to go about applying for each.", "zone": "healthplans/homepage/articles", "author": "Lisa Zamosky", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Plus, how to go about applying for each.", "title": "The 5 Most Common Health Insurance Exemptions \u2013 and Who Qualifies", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/12/29/the-5-most-common-health-insurance-exemptions-and-who-qualifies", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/c1/4b/0f1ff5c1448eae3652c2ca3bed14/140603-budgeting-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The 5 Most Common Health Insurance Exemptions \u2013 and Who Qualifies - US News", "description": "Plus, how to go about applying for each.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],health care reform,health insurance,Medicaid,HealthInsurance-Bucket-Obamacare [Consumer Advice],Lisa Zamosky", "published_at": "2014-12-29", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z58kdw", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-12-29"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/2de973b/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2Fc1%2F4b%2F0f1ff5c1448eae3652c2ca3bed14%2Fresizes%2F500%2F140603-budgeting-stock.jpg", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "health insurance, exemptions"}, "article_summary": "But what if you couldn\u2019t afford health insurance, or you have religious reasons for opposing it?\nDespite subsidies to lower costs, health insurance remains unaffordable for millions of Americans.\nIf you didn\u2019t have health insurance this year, you could be on the hook for a penalty when you file 2014 taxes.\nHealth insurance is too expensive for you.\nBut if you\u2019re older, the law allows insurers to charge you more than a younger person for the same health plan."}
