Bowing to pressure, President Barack Obama intends to permit continued sale of individual insurance plans that have been canceled because they failed to meet coverage standards under the health care law, officials said Thursday. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)\n\n3966014\n\nConservative provocateur and undercover filmmaker James O\u2019Keefe released a video on Thursday revealing rampant fraud among Obamacare navigators.\n\n\u201cLying about income and smoker status came natural to the navigators we encountered,\u201d O\u2019Keefe narrates. \u201cSome may argue that hiding small amounts of cash income is no big deal. But who, exactly, would that hurt?\u201d\n\nThe video rolls on to show more Obamacare navigators, whom, O\u2019Keefe notes, are paid in taxpayer dollars, advising the undercover actors to leave any extra, substantial cash they make unreported. (RELATED: Sebelius: Possible for convicted felons to become Obamacare navigators)\n\n\u201cWell, see, I don\u2019t know if you have to report all that,\u201d Texas navigator Kris McCray tells one actress, who said she made a significant amount of money nannying on weekends. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to get that from where you go off on your taxes. Stuff like that, to get a lower premium, I wouldn\u2019t include it. If I was cutting grass on the weekends, and they were just giving me money, that\u2019s my money. I would just try to get that number as low as you can.\u201d\n\nThe center where McCray works raked in $785,000 in taxpayer dollars to help Americans enroll in the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nThe North Texas Community Health Center, which received $139,487 in taxpayer dollars, also advised an actor \u201cnot to worry about\u201d reporting income on an Obamacare enrollment application that he didn\u2019t report on his taxes.\n\nAnother navigator, working at a center flush with $145,251 in taxpayer dollars, brushed off questions about reporting a second stream of income.\n\n\u201cAre you sure they won\u2019t find out?\u201d the actor asks the navigator.\n\n\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t claim it anywhere at all, it\u2019s \u2013\u201d the navigator interrupts herself.\n\nWatch:\n\nHealthCare.gov\u2019s malfunctions and the sweeping cancellations of millions of health insurance plans have left Americans little choice but to rely on Obamacare navigators to manage their sensitive health information, O\u2019Keefe said.\n\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s first installment also showed Obamacare navigators encouraging undercover actors to defraud the system by lying about their income, in order to lower the cost of their new health-care premiums.\n\n\u201cI always lie on mine,\u201d one navigator\u2019s assistant at the National Urban League Irving Community Center said.\n\nWatch:\n\nO\u2019Keefe maintains that the videos are only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nWe have so much footage, so many offices. So many employees. So much fraud caught on tape. We\u2019re going to release them all one by one. \u2014 James O\u2019Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) November 12, 2013\n\nFollow Katie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Katie McHugh", "description": "'That's my money'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Conservative provocateur and undercover filmmaker James O'Keefe released a video on Thursday revealing rampant fraud among Obamacare navigators.    \"Lying about income and smoker status came natural t", "title": "New James O\u2019Keefe sting reveals rampant Obamacare navigator fraud [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/14/new-james-okeefe-sting-reveals-rampant-obamacare-navigator-fraud-video/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/43145f5328084a79afcec6ecc128d1e1-e1384472746737.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'That's my money'", "title": "New James O\u2019Keefe sting reveals rampant Obamacare navigator fraud [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/14/new-james-okeefe-sting-reveals-rampant-obamacare-navigator-fraud-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/43145f5328084a79afcec6ecc128d1e1-e1384472746737.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-14 18:56:18", "sailthru.title": "New James O'Keefe sting reveals rampant Obamacare navigator fraud [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "james-okeefe,obamacare,katie-mchugh", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "james o\\'keefe,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Conservative provocateur and undercover filmmaker James O'Keefe released a video on Thursday revealing rampant fraud among Obamacare navigators.    \"Lying about income and smoker status came natural t", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/43145f5328084a79afcec6ecc128d1e1-e1384472746737.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)3966014Conservative provocateur and undercover filmmaker James O\u2019Keefe released a video on Thursday revealing rampant fraud among Obamacare navigators.\nAnother navigator, working at a center flush with $145,251 in taxpayer dollars, brushed off questions about reporting a second stream of income.\nBut who, exactly, would that hurt?\u201dThe video rolls on to show more Obamacare navigators, whom, O\u2019Keefe notes, are paid in taxpayer dollars, advising the undercover actors to leave any extra, substantial cash they make unreported.\nWatch:HealthCare.gov\u2019s malfunctions and the sweeping cancellations of millions of health insurance plans have left Americans little choice but to rely on Obamacare navigators to manage their sensitive health information, O\u2019Keefe said.\n\u201cLying about income and smoker status came natural to the navigators we encountered,\u201d O\u2019Keefe narrates."}
