The music was to be written and performed by Pink Floyd. The scene would have continued past convoys of mining trucks designed by the cr\u00e8me of European science fiction and surrealist artists, including Chris Foss, Moebius and H.R. Giger. We would see bands of space pirates attacking these craft and fighting to the death over their cargo, a life-giving drug known as Spice. Still the camera would continue forwards, past inhabited asteroids and the deep-space industrial complexes which refine the drug, until it found a small spacecraft carrying away the end result of this galactic economy: the dead bodies of those involved in the spice trade.\n\nThe shot would have been a couple of minutes long and would have established an entire universe. It was a wildly ambitious undertaking, especially in the pre-computer graphics days of cinema. But that wasn\u2019t going to deter Jodorowsky.\n\nThis scale of Jodorowsky\u2019s vision was a reflection of his philosophy of filmmaking. \u201cWhat is the goal of life? It is to create yourself a soul. For me, movies are an art more than an industry. The search for the human soul as painting, as literature, as poetry: movies are that for me,\u201d he said. From that perspective, there was no point in settling for anything small. \u201cMy ambition for Dune was for the film to be a Prophet, to change the young minds of all the world. For me Dune would be the coming of a God, an artistic and cinematic God.\n\n\u201cFor me the aim was not to make a picture, it was something deeper. I wanted to make something sacred.\u201d\n\nThe English maverick theatre director Ken Campbell, who formed the Science Fiction Theatre Company of Liverpool in 1976, also recognised that this level of ambition could arise from science fiction, even if he viewed it from a more grounded perspective. \u201cWhen you think about it,\u201d he explained, \u201cthe entire history of literature is nothing more than people coming in and out of doors. Science fiction is about everything else.\u201d\n\nJodorowsky began putting a team together, one capable of realising his dream. He chose collaborators he believed to be \u201cspiritual warriors.\u201d The entire project seemed blessed by good fortune and synchronicity. When he decided that he needed superstars like Orson Welles, Salvador Dal\u00ed or Mick Jagger to play certain parts, he would somehow meet these people by happenstance and persuade them to agree. But when pre-production was complete, he went to pitch the film to the Hollywood studios.\n\nJodorowsky pitched Dune in the years before the success of Star Wars, when science fiction was still seen as strange and embarrassing. As impressive and groundbreaking as his pitch was, it was still a science fiction film. They all said \u201cno.\u201d\n\nBy the time this genre was first named, in the 1920s, it was already marginalised. It was fine for the kids, needless to say, but critics looked down upon it. In many ways this was a blessing. Away from the cultural centre, science fiction authors were free to explore and experiment. In this less pressured environment science fiction became, in the opinion of the English novelist J.G. Ballard, the last genre capable of adequately representing present-day reality. Science fiction was able to get under the skin of the times in a different way to more respected literature. A century of uncertainty, relative perspectives and endless technological revolutions was frequently invisible to mainstream culture, but was not ignored by science fiction.\n\n* * *\n\nThe script for George Lucas\u2019s 1977 movie Star Wars was influenced by The Hero with a Thousand Faces, a 1949 book by the American mythologist Joseph Campbell. Campbell believed that at the heart of all the wild and varied myths and stories which mankind has dreamt lies one single archetypal story of profound psychological importance. He called this the monomyth. As Campbell saw it, the myths and legends of the world were all imperfect variations on this one, pure story structure. As Campbell summarised the monomyth, \u201cA hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.\u201d\n\nCampbell found echoes of this story wherever he looked; myths as diverse as those of Ulysses, Osiris or Prometheus, the lives of religious figures such as Moses, Christ or Buddha, and in plays and stories ranging from Ancient Greece to Shakespeare and Dickens. This story is now known as \u201cThe Hero\u2019s Journey.\u201d It is a story that begins with an ordinary man (it is almost always a man) in a recognisable world. That man typically receives a call to adventure, encounters an older patriarchal mentor, undergoes many trials in his journey to confront and destroy a great evil, and returns to his previous life rewarded and transformed. George Lucas was always open about the fact that he consciously shaped the original Star Wars film into a modern expression of Campbell\u2019s monomyth, and has done much to raise the profile of Campbell and his work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joseph Campbell believed a single archetypal story lay at the heart of all stories -- George Lucas was listening", "title": "The Hero\u2019s Journey: The idea you never knew had shaped \u201cStar Wars\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Joseph Campbell believed a single archetypal story lay at the heart of all stories -- George Lucas was listening", "title": "The Hero\u2019s Journey: The idea you never knew had shaped \u201cStar Wars\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/07/the_heros_journey_the_idea_you_never_knew_had_shaped_star_wars/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/star_wars2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Joseph Campbell believed a single archetypal story lay at the heart of all stories -- George Lucas was listening", "title": "The Hero\u2019s Journey: The idea you never knew had shaped \u201cStar Wars\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/star_wars2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Higgs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Dune, Editor's Picks, joseph campbell, Star Wars", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Jodorowsky pitched Dune in the years before the success of Star Wars, when science fiction was still seen as strange and embarrassing.\nAs impressive and groundbreaking as his pitch was, it was still a science fiction film.\nScience fiction was able to get under the skin of the times in a different way to more respected literature.\nScience fiction is about everything else.\u201dJodorowsky began putting a team together, one capable of realising his dream.\nA century of uncertainty, relative perspectives and endless technological revolutions was frequently invisible to mainstream culture, but was not ignored by science fiction."}
