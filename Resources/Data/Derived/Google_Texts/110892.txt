Story highlights Cruz typically asks audiences to distinguish between "campaign conservatives" and "consistent conservatives"

But Cruz's remarks Saturday were essentially a dare to those gathered here to look finely at opponents' histories on seven key battles

Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (CNN) Ted Cruz implored a Tea Party audience here on Saturday to examine closely the record of candidates like Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, warning a crowd not to get "burned" by fake brothers in arms even as he declined to utter his rivals' names.

The Texas senator typically asks audiences to distinguish between "campaign conservatives" and "consistent conservatives," but Cruz's remarks Saturday were essentially a dare to those gathered here to look finely at opponents' histories on seven key battles. In a retooled stump speech flush with Trump overtones and delivered right before Trump took the stage himself, Cruz offered a checklist of fights that he had led that his opponents -- like Trump -- hadn't.

"How many people here have been burned by politicians?" Cruz asked the crowd, hours after Cruz bashed Trump's record as more liberal than conservative. "The stakes in 2016 have never been higher. Our country is hanging in the balance. So I've got a very simple question for the folks here: How do we not get burned again?"

Cruz then listed off seven fights he had led, describing each as a "time for choosing," a reference to Ronald Reagan's iconic 1964 speech : fighting for gun rights, traditional marriage, defunding Planned Parenthood, fighting against Obamacare, a nuclear Iran, "amnesty" for undocumented immigrants and government intervention for Wall Street and other favored industries.
