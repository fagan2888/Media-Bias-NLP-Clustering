You'll pay full price for that insurance without an employer subsidy. You might consider buying your own insurance on the marketplace instead.\n\nConsumer Reports has a few things you need to consider before you pick a plan:\n\nDuring your 60-day grace period you should definitely check out your options on the marketplace to see what kind of financial help you can get, and select some plans you think you might like. When you give your income information to the marketplace, you will also find out whether you may qualify for Medicaid for yourself or CHIP for your children. Then you can compare your marketplace options to the COBRA plan. In most situations the marketplace plan will probably be cheaper than COBRA. But there are other things to consider, too: If it's later in the year, you may have met your work plan's deductible, whereas if you start a new plan, you'll have to meet the new deductible from scratch. Be sure to take this into consideration when you run the numbers.\n\nIf you are in the middle of treatment for a serious condition, check to see whether your providers take part in any marketplace plans.\n\nHit the link for other things you'll need to think about during the grace period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLosing Health Insurance | Consumer Reports\n\nPhoto by Betsssssy .", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health insurance, health, medicine, obamacare, Lifehacker", "author": "Dave Greenbaum", "og": {"site_name": "Lifehacker", "description": "When you leave your job, federal law requires your employer to let you stay on your existing health insurance.
