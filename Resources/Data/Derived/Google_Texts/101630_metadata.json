Slowly but steadily, though, laws are being put in place to protect nursing moms. The Affordable Care Act requires most insurance plans to include coverage of lactation support products and services. It also requires most large employers to provide women time and space to pump breast milk at work.\n\nBut laws across the country are still a patchwork on lots of other breastfeeding issues, according to a new report in Health Affairs. Here, seven things to know about how Americans treat breastfeeding.\n\n1. Civic duty still stands\n\nOnly 17 states exempt or postpone jury duty for nursing mothers. And, weirdly, Idaho, which has almost no breastfeeding protections on the books, is one of them.\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\n2. Cover up\n\nIllinois specifies that nursing in a place of worship \u201cshall follow the appropriate norms within that place of worship.\u201d Bring a shawl?\n\n3. Forget about a pumping party\n\nCalifornia allows breastfeeding in any public location \u201cexcept the private home or residence of another.\u201d We have so many questions.\n\n4. Legal protections largely there\n\nName and shame: Idaho and Puerto Rico are the only states/territories where there\u2019s no law on the books saying women can breastfeed in public.\n\n5. But \u2026\n\nIn 21 states, including liberal Vermont and California, you may still be ticketed for public indecency or lewd conduct for nursing in public, since indecency laws don\u2019t specifically exempt it.\n\n6. Workplaces lag behind\n\nAbout half of states don\u2019t have laws related to breastfeeding in the workplace, even though research shows workplace accommodations mean that new moms breastfeed for longer.\n\n7. Nice work, Illinois\n\nIllinois has the most laws in place to protect and promote breastfeeding, according to the Health Affairs study. Idaho, on the other hand, has the fewest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Laws across the country are still a patchwork on breastfeeding issues, according to a new report, but Illinois is winning in protecting nursing moms.", "og": {"site_name": "STAT", "description": "Laws across the country are still a patchwork on breastfeeding issues, according to a new report, but Illinois is winning in protecting nursing moms.", "title": "7 weird realities about the state of breastfeeding in America", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Breastfeeding_GettyImages-453075656-1024x576.jpg", "height": 576}, "updated_time": "2016-03-17T13:16:39-04:00", "url": "https://www.statnews.com/2016/03/17/breastfeeding-laws-states/", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "twitter": {"description": "Laws across the country are still a patchwork on breastfeeding issues, according to a new report, but Illinois is winning in protecting nursing moms.", "creator": "@lraffens", "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Breastfeeding_GettyImages-453075656-1024x576.jpg", "title": "7 weird realities about the state of breastfeeding in America", "site": "@statnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 933808010032702, "pages": 1456948254627841}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/statnews/", "section": "Health", "tag": "breastfeeding", "published_time": "2016-03-17T13:16:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-17T13:16:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "breastfeeding"}, "article_summary": "Nice work, IllinoisIllinois has the most laws in place to protect and promote breastfeeding, according to the Health Affairs study.\nCover upIllinois specifies that nursing in a place of worship \u201cshall follow the appropriate norms within that place of worship.\u201d Bring a shawl?\nForget about a pumping partyCalifornia allows breastfeeding in any public location \u201cexcept the private home or residence of another.\u201d We have so many questions.\nBut laws across the country are still a patchwork on lots of other breastfeeding issues, according to a new report in Health Affairs.\nAnd, weirdly, Idaho, which has almost no breastfeeding protections on the books, is one of them."}
