But how? The group's president, Tim Phillips explains. (Jeff Simon/The Washington Post)\n\nMichigan, along with red states like North Carolina, has become a critical front in the war over Obamacare. Americans for Prosperity is spending huge money on ads against Dem Senate candidate Gary Peters, to demonstrate a close race in a blue-leaning state and reinforce the narrative that Republicans are broadening the Senate map.\n\nIn the case of Michigan, however, AFP\u2019s aggressive engagement could backfire. And in an interview with me, Rep. Gary Peters signaled how Dems will aggressively work to make this happen.\n\nIn Michigan, GOP governor Rick Snyder, with some GOP support from the state legislature, has implemented the state\u2019s own version of the Medicaid expansion. It is set to take effect this spring and expand coverage to well over 400,000 people.\n\nAFP campaigned against the Medicaid expansion, and it\u2019s working to block it in places like Louisiana and Nebraska. AFP has even said it will continue campaigning against Republican legislators in Michigan who supported the expansion, to punish them. Critical to AFP\u2019s agenda is to block the expansion from moving forward or succeeding wherever possible.\n\nThe GOP Senate candidate, Terri Lynn Land, is for full Obamacare repeal. So when the expansion kicks in for huge numbers in Michigan, who will she side with \u2014 AFP\u2019s agenda, or that of GOP governor Rick Snyder? Will she support or oppose the expansion?\n\nThis gives Dems a way to turn the issue back on her, by painting her as extreme and a tool of out of state interests in a blueish state where the expansion could prove popular. Peters signaled he will do just that.\n\n\u201cThe Medicaid expansion is going to help well over 400,00 people here, while the Koch brothers\u2019 agenda is to stop these folks from getting health care,\u201d Peters told me. \u201cOn this issue, you have to make a choice. Terri Land\u2019s support comes from the far right and the Tea Party. Her strident stand that we must repeal the ACA alone would mean hundreds of thousands would no longer have access to critical coverage.\u201d\n\nAsked if the ACA was a problem for him, Peters defended the law, suggesting he won\u2019t let attacks drive a wedge. \u201cThere are problems with implementation, and we need to make sure it\u2019s fixed and working right,\u201d Peters said. \u201cBut the ACA takes us in the direction we need to go. It\u2019s a core belief of mine that everybody, no matter who you are, should have access to affordable health care.\u201d\n\nAsked if it was a political mistake to write to TV stations demanding documentation for AFP\u2019s cancer victim ad \u2014 as some claim \u2014 Peters suggested AFP attacks would continue meeting an aggressive response. \u201cThese ads are coming from out of state billionaires trying to determine our next Senator,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they put ads on TV, they should have documentation for what they claim.\u201d\n\nThis may not be the only place AFP involvement backfires. The AFP also opposed the flood insurance bill in Louisiana that Mary Landrieu championed, a huge issue there, which could rebound against her GOP challenger. And the Medicaid expansion will be debated in Louisiana this spring, with AFP lobbying against it.\n\nAsked for a response, a Land spokesperson said: \u201cTerri sides with Michigan families, and they are hurting because of Congressman Peters\u2019 deceptive tactics to sell ObamaCare. Michigan families deserve to know whether big banker Gary Peters sides with Harry Reid, who said on the Senate floor that Michigan families who are losing their doctor, losing their insurance plans, and paying higher prices are liars.\u201d\n\nMy follow up question \u2014 does Land support repealing the Medicaid expansion? \u2014 was not immediately answered.\n\nBut when the expansion does kick in, it could render the true implications of AFP\u2019s agenda harder to escape. AFP is spending tens of millions on a campaign dramatizing the fear and uncertainty Obamacare is supposedly inflicting on unsuspecting Americans (who tend to be middle aged women). But when the expansion takes hold, it will become clearer that AFP\u2019s active agenda is to take away from untold numbers of people precisely the same economic security and peace of mind the group claims the law is taking from its victims \u2014 even as AFP\u2019s televised victims\u2019 tales are turning out to be half-baked, misleading, or played by actors or GOP activists.\n\n************************************************\n\nUPDATE: Terri Land responds at length.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Does the Republican Senate candidate in Michigan side with AFP, or the state's GOP governor?", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Does the Republican Senate candidate in Michigan side with AFP, or the state's GOP governor?", "title": "How Americans for Prosperity\u2019s Obamacare attacks could backfire on GOP", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/02/27/how-americans-for-prosperitys-obamacare-attacks-could-backfire-on-gop/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2012/12/GYI0064573464.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/02/27/how-americans-for-prosperitys-obamacare-attacks-could-backfire-on-gop/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "americans for prosperity, americans for prosperity cancer victim ad, obamacare, Michigan senate race, 2014 senate races,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "americans for prosperity, americans for prosperity cancer victim ad, obamacare, Michigan senate race, 2014 senate races,"}, "article_summary": "In Michigan, GOP governor Rick Snyder, with some GOP support from the state legislature, has implemented the state\u2019s own version of the Medicaid expansion.\nAmericans for Prosperity \"wants to hold accountable\" Democrats who support Obamacare.\nAFP campaigned against the Medicaid expansion, and it\u2019s working to block it in places like Louisiana and Nebraska.\nAnd the Medicaid expansion will be debated in Louisiana this spring, with AFP lobbying against it.\nIn the case of Michigan, however, AFP\u2019s aggressive engagement could backfire."}
