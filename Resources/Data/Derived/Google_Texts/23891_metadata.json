We all know those who at 75 are far more vigorous than others who are couch potatoes at 40.\n\nIf Emanuel\u2019s point is that living beyond 75 is unwise given the odds that society will reap less achievement per resources invested, then that frightening anti-humanist argument can be extended to almost any category.\n\nShould we do away with health care for those with chronic debilitating diseases on the theory that society inordinately gives them too much time and capital and gets very little in return?
