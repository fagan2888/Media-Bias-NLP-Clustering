Because I did 60 charity events. I went out for three full years.\n\n\u201cShe has not contributed to any of them.\n\n\u201cThe spouse of every Prime Minister since Barton has done charity work.\u201d\n\nBut the Prime Minister\u2019s office hit back last night, releasing details of the gifts and corporate hospitality afforded to Mr Mathieson when his partner Julia Gillard was Prime Minister \u2014 including valuable sporting memorabilia and tickets to major sporting events.\n\nMrs Abbott\u2019s spokeswoman last night outlined a host of charity and community events the first lady had attended in recent months.\n\n\u201cSince the election last year, she has increased her community work and has attended a range of recent events for organisations including: KidsExpress children\u2019s charity, the Royal Easter Show Society charity lunch, personally launching the story of breast cancer advocate Mrs Krystal Barter \u201cThe Lucky One\u201d, the Deb Bailey Motor Neurone Disease Foundation, two charity bicycle rides, a citizenship ceremony, a commissioning service for religious teachers and volunteers, three local ANZAC Day service, an ethnic business awards dinner and a local multicultural festival,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cThese events are in addition to those she attends with the Prime Minister.\u201d\n\nThe spokeswoman said Mrs Abbott had a long history of community involvement and supported organisations including the Royal Blind Society and Girl Guides.\n\n\u201cThis community involvement has been part of her life as she has worked part-time at a local Sydney childcare centre and, along with Tony, raised their three daughters,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThose familiar with Margie Abbott know her quiet and understated approach is part of her genuine desire to draw attention to the charities and organisations she is involved with rather than herself.\u201d\n\nMr Mathieson, who did not work when Ms Gillard held the office of Prime Minister, appeared to relish his role as first bloke, travelling extensively, attending functions and supporting charity events.\n\nHe is an ambassador for Kidney Health Australia, a patron of the Australian men\u2019s Sheds Association and is involved with the Indigenous Diabetes Association in Alice Spring and mental health group beyondblue.\n\nHe was also one of the former government\u2019s Men\u2019s Health Ambassadors.\n\nIn January last year he was forced to apologise after making a joke to the West Indies cricket team about prostate cancer and Asian women.\n\n\u201cI was attacked for every charity event I did, I was just trying to do my best as a men\u2019s health ambassador,\u201d Mr Mathieson said.\n\n\u201cI tried to do the best I could as a country boy from Shepparton, I didn\u2019t have much time to have garden parties.", "article_metadata": {"description": "FORMER first bloke Tim Mathieson has launched an extraordinary attack on Margie Abbott saying the first lady is not doing
