Clay has been used medicinally since prehistoric times, and is still used by indigenous people around the world. It was used in clay baths as a form of \u201cmud therapy,\u201d and various types include kaolin, smectite, bentonite, montmorillonite, and Fuller\u2019s earth.\n\n\u201cI ended up drinking clay,\u201d Kravitz said, \u201cbecause it cleans out your body and fills you up. I was eating like a Mason jar of pureed vegetables a day and running.\u201d But this diet caused her to feel \u201cawful,\u201d like a \u201cspace cadet,\u201d she said, noting that she wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone do it themselves.\n\nBentonite clay is composed of aged volcanic ash and has been used to treat conditions in traditional medicine, with the largest deposit found in Benton, Wyo., which is where it received its name. Advocates of clay cleanses claim Bentonite clay is able to clean out the liver, colon, and skin, as well as \u201cbalance bacteria\u201d in the digestive system and strengthen the immune system. Various other claims include its ability to treat food allergies, food poisoning, viral infections, and even parasites. Though the clay is filled with certain minerals like montmorillonite, magnesium, and nearly 67 other trace minerals, not much scientific evidence exists to support the many claims about its health benefits.\n\nSome studies have shown, however, that certain antibacterial clays are actually effective in treating diseases. In 2010, a study about the medicinal use of clay minerals wrote in its conclusion, \u201cIn this era when bacteria are developing antibiotic resistance to existing pharmacological agents, the potential for discovery of new broad-spectrum antibacterial agents, such as natural clay minerals, to combat pathogenic bacteria would be particularly advantageous.\u201d\n\nBut what about weight loss? Despite lack of solid scientific evidence, some advocates of \u201cclay cleanses\u201d believe it rids the body of \u201ctoxins.\u201d AboutClay writes: \u201cThe clay's immediate action upon the body is directly on the digestive channel. This involves the clay actually binding with the toxic substances and removing them from the body with the stool.\u201d\n\nThe fact is, until there is better scientific evidence about \u201cclay cleanses,\u201d be aware that some studies have shown that instead of helping weight loss, eating clay can actually cause some adverse effects, like abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. \u201cMayoClinic.com reports that most detoxification diets last somewhere between seven and 10 days, but notes that evidence of the diets' success in removing toxins is not scientifically proven,\" LiveStrong warns on its website. \"Using a detox diet to lose weight is not the healthiest way to shed a few pounds. MayoClinic.com reminds dieters that the healthiest diets include a combination of lean protein, whole grains, fruits and vegetables.\u201d\n\nKravitz noted that losing weight for the role reminded her of her own struggle with eating in the past. \u201cI think all women [struggle with weight],\u201d she told Us Weekly. \u201cThere are a bunch of images that are thrown in our faces all the time about what we\u2019re supposed to look like at 14, 15, 16. It\u2019s confusing. I think every woman can identify with that struggle.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "zoe kravitz, clay cleanse, detox diet", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Though there is little scientific evidence behind it, some celebrities undertake a \"clay cleanse\" in order to lose weight.", "title": "Zoe Kravitz Drinks \u2018Clay\u2019 To Lose Weight For Her Role In \u2018The Road Within\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/drinking-clay-lose-20-pounds-zoe-kravitz-does-cleanse-play-anorexic-road-within-289224", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/21/clay-cleanse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Though there is little scientific evidence behind it, some celebrities undertake a \"clay cleanse\" in order to lose weight.", "title": "Zoe Kravitz Drinks \u2018Clay\u2019 To Lose Weight For Her Role In \u2018The Road Within\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/drinking-clay-lose-20-pounds-zoe-kravitz-does-cleanse-play-anorexic-road-within-289224", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/21/clay-cleanse.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/21/clay-cleanse.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-21T11:07:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-21T11:07:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Though there is little scientific evidence behind it, some celebrities undertake a \"clay cleanse\" in order to lose weight."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5db5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI ended up drinking clay,\u201d Kravitz said, \u201cbecause it cleans out your body and fills you up.\nZoe Kravitz, the 25-year-old actress who plays an anorexic and bulimic girl in the film \u201cThe Road Within,\u201d underwent an \u201cawful\u201d cleanse in order to lose 20 pounds for the role.\nClay has been used medicinally since prehistoric times, and is still used by indigenous people around the world.\nIt was used in clay baths as a form of \u201cmud therapy,\u201d and various types include kaolin, smectite, bentonite, montmorillonite, and Fuller\u2019s earth.\n\u201cI tried to do it the healthiest way as possible, even though it\u2019s not healthy to do.\u201d Kravitz drank clay \u2014 something that other celebrities have used in the past to assist in weight loss."}
