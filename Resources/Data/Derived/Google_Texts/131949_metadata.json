I feel most of us want to just move forward,\u201d said Joan Brown, who would receive $83,000 of the $95,000 she requested.\n\nUnlike the 21 cases the board decided Tuesday, none of the victims who were heard Wednesday asked for compensation for noneconomic losses.\n\nThe largest settlement offered on either day was $3.2 million for Scott Appel, whose wife, Ann, died in the blaze. Samuel Lucas and his sister, who lost their parents, would receive $408,000 if the legislature accepts the board\u2019s recommendation.\n\nIn both of those cases, the board rejected the recommendation of a Judicial Arbiter Group, which wanted the victims to receive payment for the deaths and other noneconomic losses.\n\nState statute bars the board from recommending payment for noneconomic losses to the legislature, said state Attorney General John Suthers.\n\nEdgar and Mary Allen Schneider, who originally asked the state to pay $1 million, reached a settlement with Suthers\u2019 office, and the board will recommend that they receive $300,000.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough, but we knew beforehand that it wasn\u2019t going to be good,\u201d Edgar Schneider said after Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\n\nThe Forest Service set the fire March 22, 2012, but didn\u2019t properly extinguish it. Schneider called 911 when he saw smoke from the blaze on March 26, when the blaze had escaped its boundaries.\n\nHe was told it was a controlled burn, and he went to play golf.\n\nLater, the couple saw flames devouring trees as fire raced up a ridge toward their home.\n\nThe Forest Service should never have started the burn during a dry period when winds were high, Schneider said.\n\n\u201cI think they should have went to jail. I would be in jail right now if I did that,\u201d he said.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "North Fork fire victims say board payment recommendations too low", "title": "North Fork fire victims say board payment recommendations too low", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/09/north-fork-fire-victims-say-board-payment-recommendations-too-low/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140408__CDXXFIREANNIV_CFW_15908xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140408__CDXXFIREANNIV_CFW_15908xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-09T12:52:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:42:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "State statute bars the board from recommending payment for noneconomic losses to the legislature, said state Attorney General John Suthers.\nUnlike the 21 cases the board decided Tuesday, none of the victims who were heard Wednesday asked for compensation for noneconomic losses.\nThe Colorado State Claims Board will recommend that the legislature award more than $1 million to five additional victims of the Lower North Fork fire, bringing the total for 26 victims to about $12.5 million.\nIn both of those cases, the board rejected the recommendation of a Judicial Arbiter Group, which wanted the victims to receive payment for the deaths and other noneconomic losses.\nSchneider called 911 when he saw smoke from the blaze on March 26, when the blaze had escaped its boundaries."}
