Bernie Sanders discussed racial justice issues on Wednesday with a prominent supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement that disrupted two of the Vermont independent\u2019s presidential campaign events with protests.\n\nDeRay McKesson, part of the Campaign Zero effort to end police violence in America, tweeted after the hour-long meeting that he and others told Sanders \u201ccommunity policing\u201d is \u201ccode for surveillance in some communities of color.\u201d\n\nSanders has pushed for investments in community policing and increased civilian oversight of police departments as part of his approach to addressing racial justice issues and physical violence.\n\n\u201cIn the end, I think he got it,\u201d McKesson tweeted.\n\nMcKesson, who also has met with officials from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, lauded Sanders for his \u201ccandor\u201d and \u201cwillingness to be pushed\u201d on his policy and approach. He said he and others also asked Sanders to address police abuse of civil asset forfeiture and said he anticipates Sanders will address that issue in his platform.\n\nMcKesson wrote that there were moments during the meeting where they didn\u2019t agree.\n\n\u201cImportantly, he was willing to be pushed and he was,\u201d tweeted McKesson, founder and co-editor of the Ferguson Protestor Newsletter.\n\nSanders said in a statement he looks forward to continuing a dialogue with Campaign Zero and other communities of color to address \u201cdeeply entrenched racial and economic problems in our country.\u201d On Thursday, he plans to introduce legislation to ban private prisons, reinstate the federal parole system and reduce the number of immigrants held in detention.\n\nWe just finished the hour-long meeting w/ @BernieSanders re: #CampaignZero, his racial justice plan, & #AskBernie. pic.twitter.com/Lb9HiYPCW3 \u2014 dr.* deray mckesson (@deray) September 16, 2015\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that our country must be aggressive in addressing institutional racism and a broken criminal justice system,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders has increased his focus on racial justice and the need to combat poverty among African Americans as he attempts to connect with black and Hispanic voters. Last weekend, he made his second trip as a candidate to South Carolina, the first southern primary state, where the Democratic primary electorate is made up largely of African Americans.\n\nHe campaigned with author and civil rights activist Cornel West, another Black Lives Matter supporter. West said disruptions from the group will stop as people realize Sanders is committed to racial justice.\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn, South Carolina\u2019s only Democrat in Congress, said during a recent interview that Black Lives Matter protesters were \u201cunfair\u201d to Sanders and wouldn\u2019t have targeted him had they known his record.\n\n\u201cNobody did more on their matters in the (Affordable Care Act) than Bernie Sanders did,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cThe tremendous increase in community health centers \u2014 that was Bernie\u2019s bill in the Senate and my bill in the house. We worked together on it for years.\u201d\n\nClyburn said he and Sanders also worked together to get funding for community health centers in the economic stimulus package.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got that kind of a record,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know, you just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nContact Nicole Gaudiano at ngaudiano@gannett.com.
