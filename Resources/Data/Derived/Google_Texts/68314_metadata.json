(AP) \u2014 Surfers catching waves and mountain bikers pedaling through forests are used to the occasional low flying pelican or diving hawk, but these days outdoor recreationalists can find what\u2019s up in the air isn\u2019t a bird at all, it\u2019s a drone.\n\nThis week top drone-makers, along with investors, regulators and inventors, are gathering in one of the most popular regions for outdoor activity in the U.S., California\u2019s Central Coast, to show off their devices, hear about new uses for airborne robots, and hit the waves and trails.\n\nDrones Data X Conference Santa Cruz, from May 1 to 3, will also feature experts explaining how unmanned-aerial vehicles can map remote areas or rescue hikers or swimmers.\n\nFederal regulators, who are still sorting out drone rules, will be on hand with updates on regulations about whether operators need to keep a drone within their line of sight, how high they can go and whether they can fly directly above a person.\n\n\u201cDrones are in a bit of their Wild West period right now, but in the future they\u2019ll be used to transport people, medicine, goods; anything done on a highway will just as well be done by air,\u201d conference organizer Philip McNamara said.\n\nSpending on unmanned aerial vehicles is projected to double over the next decade, from about $6.4 billion a year to $11.5 billion a year, according to industry analyst Teal Group.\n\nMcNamara said about 90 percent of the venture capital flowing toward drone technologies comes from the nation\u2019s high tech hub, Silicon Valley, about 30 miles from the conference. Santa Cruz economic development director Bonnie Lipscomb said the city hopes some firms will like what they see, from sandy beaches to redwood forests, as well as a university and tech startups.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Technology and outdoor sports converge at drone conference", "title": "Technology and outdoor sports converge at drone conference", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Technology and outdoor sports converge at drone conference", "title": "Technology and outdoor sports converge at drone conference", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/26/technology_and_outdoor_sports_converge_at_drone_conference/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/extreme-sports-drones.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Technology and outdoor sports converge at drone conference", "title": "Technology and outdoor sports converge at drone conference", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/extreme-sports-drones.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Martha Mendoza", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Drones Data X Conference Santa Cruz, from May 1 to 3, will also feature experts explaining how unmanned-aerial vehicles can map remote areas or rescue hikers or swimmers.\nMcNamara said about 90 percent of the venture capital flowing toward drone technologies comes from the nation\u2019s high tech hub, Silicon Valley, about 30 miles from the conference.\nSanta Cruz economic development director Bonnie Lipscomb said the city hopes some firms will like what they see, from sandy beaches to redwood forests, as well as a university and tech startups.\nSpending on unmanned aerial vehicles is projected to double over the next decade, from about $6.4 billion a year to $11.5 billion a year, according to industry analyst Teal Group.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSanta Cruz, Calif.
