A provision that grants special license plates to Colorado lawmakers could be repealed under a proposal by a state lawmaker.

Rep. Chris Holbert, R-Parker, said the plates, which are passed out to all 100 lawmakers, are largely symbolic yet have prevented some lawmakers from receiving photo radar tickets and notices of parking violations.

“They’re decorations but they can give lawmakers an unfair advantage when it comes to traffic violations,” said Holbert, who is championing the bill after he saw an investigative report last year by CBS4 Denver which revealed more than a dozen legislative plates that have racked up a total of $2,100 in fines and penalties that were never paid.

“It’s not right,” added Holbert of the provision that was adopted in 1963.

The license plates display the House or Senate district number of the lawmaker. There are no tags on the license plates because each are assigned to the specific lawmaker and not the vehicle they drive. Colorado’s Department of Motor Vehicle does not incorporate the plates into its database.

Not all lawmakers use the license plates, but also don’t believe it’s necessary to completely abolish them.

“I support the concept of holding legislators accountable for their traffic infractions,” said Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, whose car is not outfitted with the special plates. “The plates do help constituents identify who their lawmaker is. I think repeal of the provision is using a blunt instrument on a problem that needs a scalpel approach.”

The bill is set to be heard in the coming weeks in the House Transportation & Energy Committee. Suggested changes to the DMV system, said Holbert, could be offered as rival legislation.
