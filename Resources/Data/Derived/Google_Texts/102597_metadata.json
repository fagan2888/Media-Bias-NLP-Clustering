The subject: his adorable daughter, North, with wife, yes, another two words I never thought I\u2019d write \u2014 Kim Kardashian.\n\nIn this case, headlines are blaring something generally similar to this one from TMZ: \u201cKanye West: I Fear Electrocution by Drone,\u201d And this from CNET: \u201cKanye West: Will a paparazzi drone electrocute my daughter?\u201d Yet, he is right to be concerned, because in context, it\u2019s something that could actually happen.\n\nMr. West\u2019s concern stems from the proliferation of private drones armed with cameras being used to spy not only on celebrities, but on us regular folks, as well. The Federal Aviation Administration has regulations for businesses on their use of drones, but for a person who identifies as a \u201chobbyist,\u201d the law is vague, and arguably nonexistent.\n\nThe concern about a drone electrocuting his daughter came in a deposition in a court case concerning a paparazzi from which Rolling Stone magazine reported this exchange, \u201cIs your daughter stalked by, like, drones?\u201d Mr. West asked the paparazzo\u2019s lawyer, Nate Goldberg. \u201cAre there drones flying where she\u2019s trying to learn how to swim at age 1? Wouldn\u2019t you like to just teach your daughter how to swim without a drone flying? What happens if a drone falls right next to her? Would it electrocute her?\u201d\n\nThat is an excellent point, and not a casual concern. The FAA estimates there will likely be 7,500 or more hobbyist drone operators within five years. While many of those drones will be flown to capture lovely scenic video, we\u2019re seeing the tendency to spy on, harass or otherwise take unwanted photographs, especially of women and girls.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reports that in one case, a woman in Hermosa Beach, Calif., complained to a lifeguard that a drone was hovering above her daughter while sunbathing; a woman at a Virginia beach had the same violating experience and realized the drone was snapping pictures of all the women on the beach.\n\nBeing looked at on the beach is inevitable, and we accept that, but this is about women and girls being photographed and filmed without their consent. In Connecticut, Forbes reports, a woman allegedly assaulted a drone operator for what she thought was his filming of women and girls on the beach. She was arrested and now faces one year in jail if convicted. The drone operator? He was assured he could continue his, um, hobby as there are no laws against flying and filming in public places.\n\nThat has to change.\n\nJennifer Lynch, a senior attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based digital legal advocacy group, told The Los Angeles Times, \u201cOnce drones become widely used in our society, there\u2019s going to be a lot of concern,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re so in-your-face. It\u2019s easy to see the drone. It\u2019s easy to recognize the privacy implications.\u201d\n\nFor women especially, and the irreversible impact of photographs and video on the Internet, the issue of basic privacy is a legitimate concern. We have \u201cpeeping Tom\u201d laws across the nation for a reason. We recognize that some stranger staring at your daughter through a window, or following your 15-year-old around the beach, is frightening and unacceptable behavior. Why should it be acceptable if a jerk uses the proxy of a drone?\n\nThe Justia law blog brings up one family\u2019s experience in Seattle, which should disturb everyone: \u201d I looked out my third-story window to see a drone hovering a few feet away. My husband went to talk to the man on the sidewalk outside our home who was operating the drone with a remote control, to ask him to not fly his drone near our home. The man insisted that it is legal for him to fly an aerial drone over our yard and adjacent to our windows. He noted that the drone has a camera, which transmits images he viewed through a set of glasses. He purported to be doing \u201cresearch .\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just people being harassed. \u201cIn April, volunteers at Zion National Park in Utah watched a drone buzz over a herd of bighorn sheep, separating the adults from the young. That\u2019s harassment,\u201d said National Park Service spokesman Jeffrey Olson. \u201cThose are the kinds of things that have been going on,\u201d reported The Los Angeles Times.\n\nLast October, a drone in Manhattan delivered a rather harrowing experience to a New Yorker minding his own business just outside of the train station. According to The New York Post, a drone \u201cfell from the sky after accidentally hitting the side of a building, where it almost struck a man as it crash-landed near Grand Central Station.\u201d\n\nNow imagine Mr. West\u2019s concern about a drone videotaping his toddler learning to swim in the family pool. At their home. Which has a wall and comes with some expectation of privacy. To say nothing of the legitimate concern of the danger of a powered vehicle crashing into that pool.\n\nFortunately for those in Los Angeles, a private operator recently flew his drone directly over the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s Hollywood division parking lot. Let\u2019s just say the police were not happy, and now according to The Los Angeles Times, the LAPD is committed to working with \u201cthe city attorney\u2019s office and city officials to update local laws \u2014 perhaps pertaining to peeping Toms and trespassing \u2014 to include language specifically addressing drones.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s about time. This isn\u2019t brain surgery, and laws are already on the books. Every locality should act and do so quickly.\n\nTammy Bruce is a radio talk-show host, author and Fox News contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I like drones when they're bombing terrorists, not when they're used by stranger \"hobbyists\" to surreptitiously spy on and film unsuspecting Americans.", "Author": "Tammy Bruce", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "I like drones when they\u2019re bombing terrorists, not when they\u2019re used by stranger \u201chobbyists\u201d to surreptitiously spy on and film unsuspecting Americans.", "title": "BRUCE: Drones: From bombing terrorists to destroying your right to privacy?", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/11/bruce-drones-from-bombing-terrorists-to-destroying/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/06/lapd-dronesjpeg-012b3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/06/lapd-dronesjpeg-012b3.jpg", "title": "BRUCE: Drones: From bombing terrorists to destroying your right to pri", "description": "I like drones when they're bombing terrorists, not when they're used by stranger \"hobbyists\" to surreptitiously spy on and film unsuspecting Americans.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Kanye West, Nate Goldberg, The Los Angeles Times, Kim Kardashian"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1316\"", "article_summary": "Fortunately for those in Los Angeles, a private operator recently flew his drone directly over the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s Hollywood division parking lot.\n\u201cThose are the kinds of things that have been going on,\u201d reported The Los Angeles Times.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:I like drones when they\u2019re bombing terrorists, not when they\u2019re used by stranger \u201chobbyists\u201d to surreptitiously spy on and film unsuspecting Americans.\n\u201cAre there drones flying where she\u2019s trying to learn how to swim at age 1?\nI\u2019m about to write four words that I never thought I would: Kanye West is right."}
