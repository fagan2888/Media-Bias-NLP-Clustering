A lot of people need it,\" said county commissioner, Ken Cornell.\n\nCornell says he's happy to see the effects of the CHOICES health care program still live on. The commission voting Tuesday on how best to spend the $8 million left behind.\n\n\"CHOICES was a program that the voters voted on to tax themselves a relatively small amount to create a pool of money that would pay for the working poor to afford health insurance,\" said county commissioner, Robert Hutchinson.\n\nIn 2005, Alachua county started the healthcare program funded by a .25 percent sales tax that ended in 2012.\n\nThe program, aimed at helping the working uninsured, provided health care to more than 4,000 people in Alachua county.\n\n\"Right about the time when the money ran out, is when the Affordable Care Act kicked in,\" said Hutchinson.\n\nWith the end of CHOICES, Alachua county commissioners were left with about $8 million. 8 million that commissioner Hutchinson said was kept on purpose.\n\n\"When the program ended, they had to keep a certain buffer in there because you never know when there's gonna be a big claim at the end of an insurance program,\" said Hutchinson.\n\nTuesday morning, Alachua county commissioners decided how they will be spending that extra 8 million. Using that money over 10 years, helping fund non-profit healthcare organizations throughout the county.\n\n\"This is really for providing funding for the working poor which is really what CHOICES was,\" said Cornell.\n\nThis year, the commission will be funding 9 different organizations with $465,000. Candice King's agency ACORN was given more than $120,000.\n\n\"We applied for that program basically to reinstate some services. Dental services, and to support a disease management program,\" said King.\n\n\"We're now going to be actually utilizing these moneys and putting them into the community to provide services that the taxpayers have asked for,\" said Cornell.\n\nWhen asked why it took almost 2 years for these funds to be used, commissioner Hutchinson said it was simply a matter of timing.\n\n\"When we quit paying people to get medical care, those bills take months to roll in. So there was a kinda of natural gap in the way that insurance gets funded and when bills get paid,' said Hutchinson.\n\nCommissioners say the more than $400,000 awarded this year will not have an affect of future taxpayer dollars.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "ALACHUA COUNTY, Fla-- When the CHOICES health services program ended in 2013, it left $8 million behind.\nWith the end of CHOICES, Alachua county commissioners were left with about $8 million.\nCornell says he's happy to see the effects of the CHOICES health care program still live on.\nTuesday morning, Alachua county commissioners decided how they will be spending that extra 8 million.\nA lot of people need it,\" said county commissioner, Ken Cornell."}
