I\u2019m privileged to have a responsible employer and to belong to a union that fought for its members\u2019 right to enjoy decent retirement benefits. Many of my friends aren\u2019t so lucky.\n\nMy employer contributes 5 percent of my annual salary to my account, and I\u2019m pitching in with another 5 percent. That amounts to the 10 percent retirement savings rate financial experts commonly recommend.\n\nWith this simple action, I\u2019ve entered a class in the economy that unfortunately excludes members of nearly 40 million U.S. households with no retirement accounts at all.\n\nAnd most Americans who have saved something don\u2019t have enough socked away. The typical working family has merely $2,500 in retirement savings. Households approaching retirement have just $14,500.\n\nThe retirement savings crisis that\u2019s engulfing millions of baby boomers is already looming for members of my generation.\n\nMost working millennials \u2014 people between the ages of 14 and 34 \u2014 have nothing saved for retirement. Between skyrocketing rents (especially in cities like Washington, D.C., where I live), mountains of student debt and stagnant wages, we\u2019re struggling to get by, let alone save for our future. How can we avoid having to work into our 70s?\n\nThe growing gap between Americans with and without retirement savings is compounded by another trend: Only 1 out of 5 of us are participating in traditional defined-benefit plans, also known as pensions.\n\nThose plans, which maintain reasonable standards of living for many of today\u2019s seniors, have largely been replaced by notoriously unstable defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). Even when employers like mine contribute some of the money that goes into them, these plans shift the largest burden for retirement planning and saving onto employees themselves, away from their employers.\n\nAs a financial planning student, I can\u2019t emphasize enough the importance of starting to save for retirement early. By embarking on this journey now, I\u2019ll be able to take advantage of 30-plus years of compound investment interest and growth that can add up to a more secure retirement. But for most Americans, the savings you can accumulate by doing everything right still won\u2019t be enough to sustain you in retirement.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\nThere\u2019s one group of workers who continue to have relatively decent retirement plans provided by their employers: union members. More than 3 out of 4 union workers participate in an employer-sponsored pension. In contrast, just 1 out of 6 non-union workers has that important benefit.\n\nAll workers, including millennials who don\u2019t belong to unions, can change this picture, especially if we come together and exercise our collective power. Organizing a union isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s the best way to fundamentally change the benefits you receive at work.\n\nApproximately a quarter of people with significant retirement savings still don\u2019t expect to have enough saved by the time they stop working, and most Americans now expect to retire at 66, up from 63 in 2002. At the same time, more people than ever are counting on Social Security benefits to be able to afford to retire at all.\n\nIf my generation is ever going to be able to retire, we\u2019ll need to solve the retirement crisis before it\u2019s too late. That means being informed about and taking advantage of all available workplace benefits. But that won\u2019t change things for the people with few or no workplace benefits at all.\n\nWe need to do what we can to make sure all employers share in the massive responsibility of saving for retirement and stop shifting that immense burden onto all working Americans. And we need to protect and expand Social Security as a program that we can count on to be there for us. We surely will need it.\n\n\u2014 Ethan Miller, a labor rights activist and communicator, lives in Washington, D.C. He is a Jobs With Justice communications assistant. JwJ.org.
