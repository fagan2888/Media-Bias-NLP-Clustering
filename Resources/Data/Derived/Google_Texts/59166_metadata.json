Work on the installation is expected to be completed by the end of spring.\n\nFunding for the project has been provided by a $100,000 public-safety grant from the Carteret Business Partnership.\n\n\"Investing in public safety has always been a top priority for my administration, and I am happy to say that investment is paying off,\" said Reiman. \"According to recently released information from the New Jersey State Police, total crime in Carteret is down by over 16 percent. While any crime is too much, advancements in our prevention and reporting capabilities will help ensure this rate continues to decline.\"\n\nThe emergency notification towers, similar to ones seen on college campuses, feature one-touch 911 access, mass communication capabilities, and a 360 degree camera that is activated when the tower is in use. The security camera system will transmit video over a wireless spectrum, providing connectivity between the Carteret Police Department and the park. In turn, emergency dispatchers will be able to stream live and record video directly to the police vehicles as needed.\n\nReiman said the borough also has increased the size of its police force and number of walking beats, increased the minimum level of staffing, and upgraded technology in the police department by installing a Computer Aided Dispatch system that assists 911 operators.\n\nAs a result, Reiman said the borough has seen a 21 percent decrease in robberies, an 11 percent drop in assaults, a 38 percent drop in motor-vehicle thefts and a 18 percent decrease in forcible entry and thefts.\n\n\"The men and women of the Carteret Police Department work tirelessly to keep Carteret a safe place to call home, and for that, we are tremendously grateful,\" added Sitarz. \"It is our privilege to be able to equip them with the most effective tools to 'serve and protect' the community.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1I9B53v", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Several security utilities have been added in the borough, including emergency notifications towers and a camera system at Bishop Andrewz Park in the Chrome section", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Several security utilities have been added in the borough, including emergency notifications towers and a camera system at Bishop Andrewz Park in the Chrome section", "title": "Security cameras added to Carteret park", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/middlesex-county/2015/05/04/security-cameras-added-carteret-park/26882903/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Several security utilities have been added in the borough, including emergency notifications towers and a camera system at Bishop Andrewz Park in the Chrome section", "title": "Security cameras added to Carteret park", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6eefd2272a69fde46ef091800b9eedb880542604/c=0-472-450-922&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/04/Bridgewater/B9317220613Z.1_20150504152156_000_G06AMILV6.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Security systems, Carteret, park, towers, security cameras"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc30\"", "article_summary": "The security camera system transmits video between the Carteret Police Department and the park.\nThe security camera system will transmit video over a wireless spectrum, providing connectivity between the Carteret Police Department and the park.\nSeveral security utilities have been added in the borough, including emergency notifications towers and a camera system at Bishop Andrews Park in the Chrome section.\n\"The men and women of the Carteret Police Department work tirelessly to keep Carteret a safe place to call home, and for that, we are tremendously grateful,\" added Sitarz.\n\"According to recently released information from the New Jersey State Police, total crime in Carteret is down by over 16 percent."}
