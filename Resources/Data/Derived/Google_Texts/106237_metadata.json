It\u2019s no mystery why. Conservatives often say that we should care not about equality of outcomes but about equality of opportunity. But if inequality bears an inverse relationship to mobility, then even the right has to care about income disparity.\n\nThat\u2019s why Obama said \u201cinequality\u201d only three times in his speech but \u201copportunity\u201d 12 times. And it\u2019s why Republicans have lately at least pretended to care about income inequality, discarding Mitt Romney\u2019s stance that to talk about it was to engage in \u201cclass warfare,\u201d and that it was best discussed \u201cin quiet rooms.\u201d\n\nSome experts, though, dispute that income inequality has any bearing on upward mobility. And just this month two important studies by Harvard and Berkeley\u2019s Equality of Opportunity Project complicated the discussion in significant ways.\n\nIs inequality bad for opportunity? Has Obama been correct when he\u2019s said that the \u201cladders of opportunity into the middle class\u201d that he referred to in Tuesday\u2019s speech get harder to climb as the rungs grow farther apart?\n\nBefore the Harvard-Berkeley studies, an honest answer would have been, \u201cYeah, probably, but there\u2019s room for disagreement.\u201d Now one is obliged to add: \u201cAnd not in the way Obama previously thought.\u201d\n\nBefore plunging into what\u2019s changed, let\u2019s be clear on what has not changed: current social mobility in the US is quite low. You still can\u2019t argue (as Rep. Paul Ryan was doing as recently as 2011) that extreme inequality is OK because it\u2019s the price Americans pay for high mobility. If that\u2019s the price, then Americans are getting cheated.\n\nThe best measure of mobility is the extent to which one person\u2019s relative position in the income distribution differs from that of his or her parents at a comparable age. If it differs a lot, then mobility is high. If it differs only a little bit, then mobility is low. Think of it as a kind of non-biological heritability.\n\nAs recently as 1988, economic experts believed that in the US., this heritability was low\u2014only about 20%. But starting in the early 1990s better data became available showing income heritability to be at least twice that\u201440 to 50%. One expert calculated that for American males, income was more heritable than height or weight. This meant that far from being exceptionally mobile, the US was, relative to comparable nations, exceptionally immobile, trailing, for instance, France, Spain, Germany, and even Canada.\n\nAll of that\u2019s still true.\n\nWhat\u2019s not true, the Harvard-Berkeley studies indicate, is that the US has become any less mobile during the 35 years that income inequality has been growing. Mobility was pitiful in 1979 and it remains pitiful today, mainly because it\u2019s even more difficult here than in similar countries to start out poor and end up affluent. But mobility isn\u2019t, apparently, any more pitiful than it\u2019s been for at least the past 43 years. Thus when Obama said last month that \u201calongside increased inequality, we\u2019ve seen diminished levels of upward mobility,\u201d he was wrong. (He didn\u2019t repeat it in Tuesday\u2019s speech.) We\u2019ve seen a continuation of weak levels of mobility that predated the inequality boom.\n\n\u201cUpward mobility has stalled,\u201d the president said, but it\u2019s been stalled, the new studies say, since the Nixon administration, and possibly since the Truman administration. Mobility in the US, though quite high at the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th\u2014high enough to inspire Horatio Alger and James Truslow Adams, who coined the phrase \u201cthe American Dream\u201d\u2013has been unremarkable and unchanging for anyone born after 1971 and possibly after 1952. It just took Americans an embarrassingly long time to notice.\n\nHow, then, can one still say there\u2019s a probable connection between income inequality and mobility? Because changes over time are only one metric. There are also changes across geography to consider.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly touted \u201cthe Great Gatsby Curve,\u201d a chart devised two years ago by Alan Krueger, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, drawing largely on research by Miles Corak, a Canadian economist who\u2019s currently a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation. Plotting income heritability against income inequality for various countries, this scatter diagram finds that the two rise roughly in tandem\u2014i.e., as income inequality grows, mobility declines.\n\nThe Great Gatsby chart was more suggestive than dispositive. Among its problems was that it compared complex data collected in different ways in different countries. But the Harvard-Berkeley papers made essentially the same calculations not for different countries, but for different job markets (\u201ccommuting zones\u201d) within of the US. \u201cThe authors,\u201d Corak told msnbc in an e-mail, \u201cconfirm that a Great Gatsby Curve exists across space within the US, in addition to across countries.\u201d\n\nScott Winship, an economist at the Manhattan Institute and conservative inequality gadfly, disagrees. The Harvard-Berkeley studies, he told msnbc by e-mail, \u201cfind that there is no association across U.S. labor markets between income concentration at the top and mobility.\u201d The top one percent today receive nearly one-quarter of all income in the US. In some job markets it\u2019s higher; in some it\u2019s lower. But according to the Harvard-Berkeley studies, the variation doesn\u2019t affect mobility.\n\n\u201cThe administration,\u201d Winship continued, \u201chas been desperately searching for a way to say what the evidence does not\u2013that rising inequality has hurt upward mobility.\u201d The new research \u201cbolsters those of us who have argued not that inequality is definitely benign, but that there\u2019s little basis for saying it has been harmful.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s right, Corak or Winship? Actually, they both are.\n\nRising income concentration for the top one percent is not the country\u2019s sole inequality problem. Equally troublesome is what the Harvard-Berkeley scholars call \u201cmiddle-class inequality\u201d\u2014a divide between people who have college (or, increasingly, graduate) degrees and those who don\u2019t. The main causes of growing middle-class inequality are the decline in private-sector union membership, stagnant high school graduation rates, and the ever-growing cost of higher education.\n\nThe Harvard-Berkeley studies find \u201ca robust negative correlation\u201d between the middle-class type of inequality and \u201cmobility across generations.\u201d As with the Great Gatsby curve, they observe that places in the US with higher income inequality are less mobile.\n\nMoreover, although Corak concedes that the Harvard-Berkeley studies don\u2019t show a relationship at the local level between mobility and income concentration for the top one percent, he thinks further study could reveal a national one. It may well be, he argues, that the one percent\u2019s disproportionate influence over the federal government\u2013\u201csetting broad policy like the progressiveness of the tax system,\u201d or \u201cthe size and capacity of the federal government to level the playing field across states\u201d\u2014has prevented mobility from increasing.\n\nStill, Corak says, \u201cSome of the rhetoric of politicians will have to change. You hear Obama, Rubio and others saying that mobility has declined.\u201d Now, \u201cthis is not so clear.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "\u201cInequality has deepened and upward mobility has stalled,\u201d Obama likes to say.
