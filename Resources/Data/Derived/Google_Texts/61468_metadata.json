State officials will anxiously await an anticipated Supreme Court ruling on the law's tax credit premium subsidies offered in states without their own health insurance exchanges.\n\nAs a result, more Americans will likely deal with the law at an individual level, which has so far polarized views of the ACA in the court of public opinion.\n\nIn October, Gallup reported that 27 percent of Americans believe provisions of the healthcare law have hurt their families, an 8 percent increase from the end of 2013. Over the same period, people reporting that the ACA helped them also increased, from 10 to 16 percent.\n\nHealth policy experts named several potential health care struggles on the horizon, noting that as more everyday people interact with the Affordable Care Act, government leaders will be increasingly pressured to simplify its implementation.\n\n\"As more and more people have personal experiences (with the law), I'm certain that some of them will be positive. Health insurance is cheaper with the (tax) subsidies,\" making coverage available to people who couldn't afford it before, said Edmund Haislmaier, senior research fellow in health policy studies at The Heritage Foundation. \"But the political issue is whether or not those positive experiences outweigh the negative.\"\n\nEmployer requirement\n\nAlthough the ACA's employer mandate was at the center of some of the loudest outcries when the law was first passed, the first wave of the mandate's enactment is expected to come off with little fanfare, experts said.\n\nAs of Jan. 1, employers with more than 100 full-time workers will be required to offer them health insurance. Businesses will face penalties if they do not cover at least 70 percent of their eligible employees. In 2016, the threshold will increase to 95 percent.\n\nCounter to early critiques of the law, Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation, does not believe the employer mandate will meaningfully shift overall employment numbers from full-time to part-time. He said that most larger employers already have a health benefit system in place that satisfies the requirement.\n\nAfter all, employers with more than 100 workers \"generally need to offer health benefits to attract a workforce,\" he said.\n\nWhat could change is insurance offerings to spouses, Levitt said, noting that the ACA requires coverage options for children, but not wives or husbands. The logic behind the coverage distinction is that an employee's spouse could access insurance and tax subsidies through state or federal insurance exchanges.\n\nKaiser's December Health Policy Tracking Poll reported that 60 percent of Americans view the employer mandate favorably, compared with 38 percent who shared an unfavorable impression.\n\nHowever, researchers described public opinion as \"malleable,\" finding that many respondents adjust their answers when offered more information about the requirements and penalties.\n\nTherefore, the rollout of the employer mandate could emerge as a key area for both supporters and opponents of the ACA to add people to their side of the debate.\n\nAlthough Haislmaier agreed that January's initial enactment likely won't make many waves, he said that the Obama administration still has work to do to ease the transition for business owners.\n\n\"It's a very difficult thing to implement,\" he said, describing government leaders' ongoing effort to define who counts as a full-time employee.\n\nThe ACA considers any employee who works 30 hours or more per week as full-time, a distinction that's self-explanatory in many offices. But Haislmaier noted that a career as common as substitute teaching can cause significant confusion, given the inconsistent work schedule.\n\nIndividual mandate\n\nHaislmaeier said that the ACA's individual health insurance mandate will continue to be in the spotlight even as the impacts of employer requirements capture researchers' attention.\n\nLast year's rollout was marred by technological glitches frustrating nearly anyone who tried to sign up. This year, the next few months will again test people's patience with ACA-related changes to the U.S. tax code \u2014 adjustments that many recipients of ACA tax subsidies are likely unprepared to face, Haislmaier noted.\n\n\"It's going to be the mother of all tax reconciliations,\" he said, because anyone who received a subsidy will be asked to report their income for each of the months he or she was covered by a marketplace insurance plan.\n\nLinda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute Health Policy Center, called the individual tax reconciliation process \"a very significant issue,\" explaining that the same people best served by the ACA \u2014 Americans with low to moderate incomes who are often paid by the hour \u2014 also \"tend to have a considerable amount of fluctuation in income throughout the year.\"\n\nWorkers who signed up through the ACA insurance marketplace with one income estimate but didn't adjust their personal information after a job change could end up owing the government money. It could be a problem not only for the individual, but also for the Internal Revenue Service, which, according to Blumberg, has some catching up to do when it comes to determining how best to impose individual mandate penalties.\n\nAccording to Haislmaier, one of the quirks of the law is that it explicitly weakened the IRS' ability to collect even the most basic fines associated with the individual mandate: the penalty owed by people who spent all or part of 2014 uninsured.\n\n\"Unlike other kinds of tax debt, the IRS cannot use liens, asset forfeiture, jail or anything like that\" to collect ACA-related tax penalties, he said. Its only option is to subtract the penalty from a potential tax refund.\n\n**State issues and broader concerns **\n\nAnother aspect of ACA implementation to track in 2015 is how state lawmakers respond to the Supreme Court's ruling on King v. Burwell.\n\nThe case concerns tax subsidies available to insurance seekers who can't afford health coverage at the marketplace price. The group includes anyone whose household income falls below 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nIf the lawsuit is decided in favor of the plaintiffs, individuals in states without their own exchanges would lose access to the subsidies, a situation that Levitt said has major implications for both the employer and individual mandates.\n\n\"If the Supreme Court rules that subsidies can only be offered in states with state-run exchanges, a state choosing to create a marketplace is in effect choosing the employer mandate as well,\" he said, because employer penalties can only be triggered if workers, in their application for individual subsidies, report that insurance wasn't offered to them.\n\nOverall, the country enters 2015 with ongoing confusion and unrest surrounding the ACA, Haislmaier said, with supporters and opponents alike waiting to see whether public reception grows more positive or negative over time.\n\n\"Proponents of the law bet on the fact that, over time, as people got more familiar with it, positive experiences would outweigh negative,\" he said. \"That's what we're going to need to watch for this year.\"\n\nEmail: kdallas@deseretnews.com Twitter: @kelsey_dallas", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://national.deseretnews.com/article/3170/what-to-expect-from-the-affordable-care-act-in-2015.html", "image": "https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/bb95f29854?resize=width_760&c=17&a=7f3f30c4", "description": "The next year will bring with it a new set of complications related to the employer and individual health insurance mandates.", "title": "What to expect from the Affordable Care Act in 2015"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce65a\"", "article_summary": "In 2015, employers will have to navigate new health insurance requirements and individual taxpayers who received government health care will face income tax filing changes.\nAs of Jan. 1, employers with more than 100 full-time workers will be required to offer them health insurance.\n5 photo s SlideshowThe new year will bring new challenges for Americans interacting with the Affordable Care Act, even as administrators put 2014's disastrous rollout of the landmark health care law behind them.\nHealth policy experts named several potential health care struggles on the horizon, noting that as more everyday people interact with the Affordable Care Act, government leaders will be increasingly pressured to simplify its implementation.\nThe logic behind the coverage distinction is that an employee's spouse could access insurance and tax subsidies through state or federal insurance exchanges."}
