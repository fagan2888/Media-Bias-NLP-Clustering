She explains:\n\nSo I say there is a big parallel between Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton\u2013aside from their initials! Young feminists need to understand that this abusive behavior by powerful men signifies their sense that female power is much bigger than they are! These two people, Clinton and Cosby, are emotionally infantile\u2013they\u2019re engaged in a war with female power.\n\nShe also described the Emma Sulkowicz rape story (read our coverage here) as a case of \u201cmattress feminism:\u201d\n\nPerpetually lugging around your bad memories\u2013never evolving or moving on! It\u2019s like a parody of the worst aspects of that kind of grievance-oriented feminism. I called my feminism \u201cAmazon feminism\u201d or \u201cstreet-smart feminism,\u201d where you remain vigilant, learn how to defend yourself, and take responsibility for the choices you make. If something bad happens, you learn from it. You become stronger and move on. But hauling a mattress around on campus?\n\nFor more punchy Paglia quotes, watch Nick Gillespie\u2019s recent interview with the noted cultural critic, which includes her epic takedown of Hillary Clinton.
