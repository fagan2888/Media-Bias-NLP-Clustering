The Better Life Initiative aims to pinpoint progress in society in ways that go beyond just GDP.\n\nInterestingly enough, Americans didn\u2019t value income as highly as satisfaction \u2014 which might surprise some of us who view this country as a workaholic one that worships 60-hour work weeks. Americans actually ranked satisfaction, health, education, work-life balance, the environment, safety, housing, and jobs higher than income, even though American income ranks as one of the highest in the world.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is slightly different from other OECD countries,\u201d said Romina Boarini, head of the Measuring Well-Being and Progress Section at the OECD. \u201cThings such as income and civic engagement are not necessarily rated very highly in the U.S.\u201d\n\nThis is possibly because in the U.S., like other first-world countries, many people already have a decent level of income and it isn\u2019t as important to survival. Developing countries, like Ukraine, have a different view: Income was ranked as more important than other aspects.\n\nQuality Of Life vs. Income\n\n\u201cIn rich countries, it is almost always the case that people rate income as not being very important,\u201d Boarini said. \u201cWhat it means is, when you have satisfied your basic needs in terms of income, you tend to believe there are things that matter much more than income. In very wealthy countries, people are not concerned by income anymore. They want quality of life.\u201d\n\nShe added that people in richer countries crave life satisfaction and social connection more so than income. \u201cIt\u2019s not that income does not matter, it\u2019s just much less [important] than in poor countries,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, despite ranking as No. 1 for housing and income/wealth, the U.S. ranked much lower than other countries for work-life balance (getting 29th place out of 36 places), education (19th place), and environmental quality (also 19th place). Because most American workers have long hours, they\u2019re less able to attend to work-life balance and personal care compared to other more laid-back and leisurely countries. In addition, our education falls far below other countries, particularly among young people.\n\n\u201cWhat we see for the United States, performance is really excellent in [indices] such as income, wealth, and housing and all the essential material aspects of well-being,\u201d Boarini said. \u201cBut where things don\u2019t go very well is actually work-life balance, because Americans work a lot. They really don\u2019t compare very well with other OECD countries.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it. It's very possible that Americans rank life satisfaction higher than income, because we already have income, but we have less leisure, personal care time, and satisfaction in our workaholic lives than people in other countries.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "life satisfaction, health, first-world country", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Richer countries are more likely to rank life satisfaction and social connection as more important than income or health.", "title": "Why Americans Care More About Life Satisfaction Than Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/americans-care-more-about-life-satisfaction-health-or-income-because-we-live-first-336324", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/03/working.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Richer countries are more likely to rank life satisfaction and social connection as more important than income or health.", "title": "Why Americans Care More About Life Satisfaction Than Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/americans-care-more-about-life-satisfaction-health-or-income-because-we-live-first-336324", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/03/working.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/03/working.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-03T14:27:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-03T14:27:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Richer countries are more likely to rank life satisfaction and social connection as more important than income or health."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0b6\"", "article_summary": "Americans actually ranked satisfaction, health, education, work-life balance, the environment, safety, housing, and jobs higher than income, even though American income ranks as one of the highest in the world.\nThey want quality of life.\u201dShe added that people in richer countries crave life satisfaction and social connection more so than income.\nIt's very possible that Americans rank life satisfaction higher than income, because we already have income, but we have less leisure, personal care time, and satisfaction in our workaholic lives than people in other countries.\n\u201cBut where things don\u2019t go very well is actually work-life balance, because Americans work a lot.\nAmericans are known to be workaholics, which is why they rank high in income and material goods, but low in work-life balance."}
