Cornish villagers warned that escaped snake called Popeye may be hiding inside a coat\n\nPopeye went missing from its tank in Torpoint, Cornwall, last Tuesday\n\nOwner Charly Honey, 22, has warned it could be hiding in coat sleeve\n\nBut insisted python was 'only' an 18in baby and posed no serious risk\n\n\n\nNeighbours in a small town are braced for a nasty surprise - after a python went missing and its owner warned it could be hiding in a coat sleeve.\n\nCharly Honey insisted Popeye was \u2018only\u2019 an 18in baby and posed no serious risk to the public.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got a puppy and a two-year-old stepdaughter and we\u2019ve looked everywhere,\u2019 said the 22-year-old, from Torpoint in Cornwall.\n\nNeighbours in Torpoint (pictured), Cornwall, have been warned a missing python may be hiding in a coat sleeve\n\n\u2018They turn up in the strangest of places, like the arm of a coat. But I can\u2019t find her anywhere.\u2019\n\nPopeye \u2013 named because it has lost an eye \u2013 was safe in its tank last Tuesday when its owner gave it a mouse to eat.\n\nBut when Miss Honey returned a little later, she found the mouse untouched and the snake missing.\n\nShe said she would usually be confident of finding the three-year-old pet in the house, but the doors had been left open because of the hot weather.\n\n\u2018The neighbours are not happy, and that\u2019s understandable, but she\u2019s of no risk to anyone,\u2019 added Miss Honey.\n\nAmbush predators: Pythons are non-venomous but adults can eat animals the size of a cat (file picture)\n\n\u2018She\u2019s only small, she\u2019s still a baby really. When she\u2019s fully grown she\u2019ll be around six foot long.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re starting to panic a bit. In the winter they go for the heat but it\u2019s so warm she could have gone anywhere. I put another mouse in the tank in the hope that she would come back but she didn\u2019t.\n\n\u2018If she\u2019s found I\u2019d ask people not to touch her. If they\u2019re brave they can put her in a pillow case.\u2019\n\n\n\n' The neighbours are not happy, and that\u2019s understandable, but she\u2019s of no risk to anyone. She\u2019s only small, she\u2019s still a baby really'\n\nCharly Honey\n\n\n\nMiss Honey said Popeye had escaped once before, but it had happened when the python was being looked after by someone else during a house move.\n\nPythons are native to Australia, Africa and Asia and are ambush predators \u2013 meaning they remain motionless and strike suddenly at passing prey.\n\nThey are non-venomous but have sharp backward-curving teeth which are used to grab prey before killing them by constriction, leading to asphyxiation.\n\nAdults typically eat animals equivalent to the size of a domestic cat but some larger species have been known to devour adult deer.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Missing,python,sleeve,Cornish,villagers,warned,escaped,snake,called,Popeye,hiding,inside,coat", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2707871/Missing-python-sleeve-Cornish-villagers-warned-escaped-snake-called-Popeye-hiding-inside-coat.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Popeye the python went missing from its tank in Torpoint, Cornwall, last Tuesday after its owner Charly Honey gave it a mouse to eat and left the room.", "title": "Cornish villagers warned snake may be hiding inside a coat sleeve", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2707871/Missing-python-sleeve-Cornish-villagers-warned-escaped-snake-called-Popeye-hiding-inside-coat.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/28/article-2707871-200CBB6600000578-625_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2707871/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2707871/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2707871, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Missing,python,sleeve,Cornish,villagers,warned,escaped,snake,called,Popeye,hiding,inside,coat", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-07-27T23:54:21.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Andrew+Levy+for+the+Daily+Mail", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-07-28T10:09:43.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Missing python sleeve Cornish villagers warned escaped snake called Popeye hiding inside coat"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Popeye the python went missing from its tank in Torpoint, Cornwall, last Tuesday after its owner Charly Honey gave it a mouse to eat and left the room.", "title": "Cornish villagers warned snake may be hiding inside a coat sleeve", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2707871/Missing-python-sleeve-Cornish-villagers-warned-escaped-snake-called-Popeye-hiding-inside-coat.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/28/article-2707871-200CBB6600000578-625_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Popeye the python went missing from its tank in Torpoint, Cornwall, last Tuesday after its owner Charly Honey gave it a mouse to eat and left the room."}, "article_summary": "Missing python up your sleeve?\nNeighbours in Torpoint (pictured), Cornwall, have been warned a missing python may be hiding in a coat sleeve\u2018They turn up in the strangest of places, like the arm of a coat.\nCornish villagers warned that escaped snake called Popeye may be hiding inside a coatPopeye went missing from its tank in Torpoint, Cornwall, last TuesdayOwner Charly Honey, 22, has warned it could be hiding in coat sleeveBut insisted python was 'only' an 18in baby and posed no serious riskNeighbours in a small town are braced for a nasty surprise - after a python went missing and its owner warned it could be hiding in a coat sleeve.\n\u2018I\u2019ve got a puppy and a two-year-old stepdaughter and we\u2019ve looked everywhere,\u2019 said the 22-year-old, from Torpoint in Cornwall.\nCharly Honey insisted Popeye was \u2018only\u2019 an 18in baby and posed no serious risk to the public."}
