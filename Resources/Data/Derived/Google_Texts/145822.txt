Detectives have been on scene most of the day at a home invasion that happened this morning on the west side.

One person was in the house in the 1400 block of North Hualpai Road – near Speedway and Silverbell – when several people forced their way in, according to Sgt. Pete Dugan, a spokesman for the Tucson Police Department.

The intruders assaulted the man who was home, Dugan said. He was later taken to the hospital with serious injuries.

It's unclear whether the victim knows his assailants, and nobody is in custody, Dugan said.

TPD detectives are continuing to investigate.
