In fact, he fiercely questioned author Peter Schweizer last month about his book \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d making unilateral statements that the book was hogwash.\n\n\u201cAs you know, the Clinton campaign says you haven\u2019t produced a shred of evidence that there was any official action as secretary that supported the interest of donors,\u201d Stephanopoulos said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done investigative work here at ABC News, found no proof of any kind of direct action. And an independent government ethics expert at the Sunlight Foundation Bill Allison wrote this: \u2018There\u2019s no smoking gun. No evidence that the changed policy is based on donations to the foundation. No smoking gun.\u2019 Is there a smoking gun?\u201d\n\nToday, after the revelations, Schweizer said: \u201cReally quite stunned by this, a massive breach of ethical standards. He fairly noted my four months working as a speech writer for George W. Bush. But he didn\u2019t disclose this?\u201d according to Bloomberg News.\n\nPHOTOS: Best combat rifles of all time\n\nIn a statement to Politico Thursday, Stephanopoulos apologized, saying he should have told ABC News and its viewers.\n\n\u201cI made charitable donations to the Foundation in support of the work they\u2019re doing on global AIDS prevention and deforestation, causes I care about deeply,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that my contributions were a matter of public record. However, in hindsight, I should have taken the extra step of personally disclosing my donations to my employer and to the viewers on air during the recent news stories about the Foundation. I apologize.\u201d\n\nAs the chief anchor and political correspondent for ABC News, as well as the co-anchor of ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and host of \u201cThis Week,\u201d the former communications director and senior adviser to President Clinton presents \u201cnews\u201d nearly daily.\n\nBut unlike Brian Williams, the disgraced NBC News anchor who sought glory by exaggerating his wartime escapades, Stephanopoulos concealed his donations to the politically powerful Clintons while at the same time debunking an author who wrote critically about the very foundation to which he donated.\n\nThis time, however, the liberal mainstream media likely will not crucify one of its own, as they did Williams. The fate of the liberal agenda is squarely in the hands of Hillary Clinton, and the MSM will move to protect her in whatever way they must.\n\nWhat\u2019s also interesting about the donations: Stephanopoulos got an interview with Bill Clinton the same year he donated to the Clinton Foundation. And the controversy swirling around the Foundation \u2014 foreign money pouring in without transparency \u2014 brings up the same questions: What was Stephanopoulos hoping to get from the Clintons for his donations?", "article_metadata": {"description": "With word emerging today that ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos gave \"$50,001 to $100,000\" to the Clinton Foundation, the network will soon face the Brian Williams Quandary -- is its top \"newsman\" trustworthy when delivering news.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With word emerging today that ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos gave \u201c$50,001 to $100,000\u201d to the Clinton Foundation, the network will soon face the Brian Williams Quandary \u2014 is its top \u201cnewsman\u201d trustworthy when delivering news.", "title": "JOSEPH CURL: Is George Stephanopoulos the next Brian Williams?", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/14/next-brian-williams/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/14/gs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/14/gs.jpg", "description": "With word emerging today that ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos gave \"$50,001 to $100,000\" to the Clinton Foundation, the network will soon face the Brian Williams Quandary -- is its top \"ne", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "JOSEPH CURL: Is George Stephanopoulos the next Brian Williams?"}, "Author": "Joseph Curl", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, George Stephanopoulos, Abc News, Sunlight Foundation, Clinton Foundation"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc54d\"", "article_summary": "What\u2019s also interesting about the donations: Stephanopoulos got an interview with Bill Clinton the same year he donated to the Clinton Foundation.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:With word emerging today that ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos gave \u201c$50,001 to $100,000\u201d to the Clinton Foundation, the network will soon face the Brian Williams Quandary \u2014 is its top \u201cnewsman\u201d trustworthy when delivering news.\nIn dozens and dozens of stories and interviews on the Clintons, the chief anchor never mentioned his hefty gifts.\nThis time, however, the liberal mainstream media likely will not crucify one of its own, as they did Williams.\nPHOTOS: Best combat rifles of all timeIn a statement to Politico Thursday, Stephanopoulos apologized, saying he should have told ABC News and its viewers."}
