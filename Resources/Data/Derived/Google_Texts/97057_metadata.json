She's been teaching in Wichita for nine years. She saw this year's proposed budget and likes what she sees.\n\n\"I hope the contract passes,\" said Laske. \"I think it's a very fair contract.\"\n\nThe proposal includes a 3.5 percent pay and benefits increase for teachers, including a 2 percent raise. Lynn Rogers of the school board said it's long overdue.\n\n\"Last year was a one percent bonus, a one time bonus and the last couple years before that we didn't really do a whole lot,\" said Rogers.\n\n\"There were several years where we were frozen and we didn't get a raise,\" Laske added. \"I think it was four years where we didn't move or anything.\"\n\nThe overall budget for the 2014-2015 school year is $683 million dollars, that's about $60 million more than last year's.\n\n\"Really, it's the first time in about 5 years the state has finally come up with the money that they are supposed to,\" said Rogers.\n\nRogers said the state is coming up with money for equalization. It will allow Wichita's total mill levy to go down, moving money from its general fund to capital outlay. Which is money to be spent on repairs or upgrades.\n\n\"So while the budget is going up, the local tax payers are not going to be paying anything additional,\" added Rogers.\n\nThe proposal also hopes to boost the districts technology, renovations and per student funding to name a few. Laske said that plus the teacher incentives will help keep Wichita's best educators in the district.\n\n\"In order to attract high quality teachers that we need to pay teachers like professionals,\" said Laske.\n\nBoard members are set to vote to publish the proposed budget Monday night. A final vote and public hearing will be held on August 25.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Wichita Schools proposed budget for the upcoming school year could mean good news for teachers and property taxes.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "The Wichita Schools proposed budget for the upcoming school year could mean good news for teachers and property taxes.", "title": "UPDATE: Wichita teachers approve contract ahead of BOE vote", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-Schools-budget-proposal-270702621.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/3BE/545/3BE5453137B24FD1B176777A33C98523", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/4F6/CDE/4F6CDE3AEC9348A7B210503E4CA3C555.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The Wichita Schools proposed budget for the upcoming school year could mean good news for teachers and property taxes.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-Schools-budget-proposal-270702621.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Wichita-schools.jpg", "title": "UPDATE: Wichita teachers approve contract ahead of BOE vote", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Wichita teachers approve contract ahead of BOE vote", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Wichita teachers approve contract"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc31\"", "article_summary": "The United Teachers of Wichita and Wichita Public Schools have reached a tentative agreement on a proposed contract.\nThe Wichita Schools proposed budget for the upcoming school year could mean good news for teachers and property taxes.\nWichita School Board members said a new state funding is finally kicking in after more than 5 years and teachers could be where the overdue change begins.\nBoard members are set to vote to publish the proposed budget Monday night.\nThe Board of Education will vote on the contract at a board meeting Monday evening."}
