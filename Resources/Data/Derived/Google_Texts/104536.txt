Former HUD Assistant Housing Secretary and investment advisor Catherine Austin Fitts reveals her thoughts on the ever-rising debt ceiling what Obamacare is really about (and thats not socialized healthcare) why over $4 trillion missing from federal programs may not be incompetence, but a covert strategy how to protect yourself from the constant devaluation of the US dollar and what exactly the Popsicle Index measures and why it matters.

Here are a few excerpts:

I dont see Obamacare as something designed to offer healthcare. I think the question comes down to a bigger one, which is, are we going to create a society where one hundred percent of everything is digitized and under central control?

Who is the governance system, and why are they behaving the way they are behaving? What we see is literally a psychopathic effort and intensitywhether it is in the energy area, whether it is in the currency area, whether it is in the food area, whether it is in the healthcare areato get 100% central control and to use digital means to do it, and the question is why?

Well, you have a complete breakdown of internal financial controls in the US government. You had over $4 trillion of what is called undocumentable adjustments and to this day, [these agencies] have never, as required by law, produced audited financial statements.

In my experience, government is not incompetent at all. Gridlock is a cover story, incompetence is a cover story. There is a plan, you just cant see what it is.
