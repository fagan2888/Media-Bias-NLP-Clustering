The mother of a girl with mental and physical disabilities has sued Dallas ISD, alleging that her daughter was raped by another student with a disability.

The daughter, identified in the suit as T.W., has cerebral palsy and brain damage and was in special education classes at Kimball High School. The girl was 14 years old but functioned at the level of a 9-year-old, according to the suit filed this week in federal court.

T.W. reported in 2013 that another student, identified as 20-year-old V.A., had grabbed her buttocks and hugged and kissed her, even though she told him to stop, the lawsuit states. She also alleged that he repeatedly tried to pull her into a restroom at the back of the special education classroom.

After the girl complained, the suit states, the school moved V.A.’s seat in the classroom to directly in front of the restroom. Therefore, it says, he had easy access to the restroom in January 2014 when he followed the girl there, forced her to have oral sex and raped her.

DISD could not be reached for comment Thursday.

“They should have heeded the complaints that she and others made about the boy,” said Hal Browne, an attorney for the girl’s family. “They shouldn’t have put her in harm’s way by putting this man in front of the restroom when he’d already told her he would drag her in there.”

The girl has transferred to another school, a change the suit says was “extremely difficult and disruptive” for a student with a disability.

The girl’s mother is suing DISD for compensatory and punitive damages.
