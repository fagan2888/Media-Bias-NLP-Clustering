The great operas, symphonies, stories, plays, dances \u2014 they last beyond the eras of the artists who create them, crossing generations, continents, the stages of history.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s a billowy thing to say in relation to any single production of any particular work, but a night at the Central City Opera makes that quality of art palpable. The 1878 theater is old, at least in American years, and delicately preserved, and so the music it presents today can take on the feel of the music of yesterday, even of the centuries.\n\nThe current production of \u201cLa Traviata,\u201d which opened Saturday, understands that power in the this tiny venue and makes the most of it. The setting of Verdi\u2019s tragedy is the mid-1800s, about the time Central City was coming into its own as a boom town, growing with enough confidence to construct a sturdy performance hall near the top of its tallest hill.\n\nThe timing adds to the opera a dose of authenticity its story lacks otherwise in the current age. The plot is driven by a need to follow strict social rules that are long gone, to heed the will of God, who, for better or worse, is less influential in matters of personal choice than he was when Francesco Maria Piave wrote the original libretto.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice coincidence and director Elise Sandell goes with the flow delivering a traditional staging that respects the quirks of the room it is playing.\n\nShe crams the singers on stage, which in Central City is just a few feet from the first row, and has none of them holding back. The volume is loud, the acting aggressive; this is the kind of in-your-face production that is only possible in such a compact house and one of the reasons Central City stands apart as a venue.\n\nPeter Harrison\u2019s exaggerated sets follow suit. The first act is a glittery grouping of candelabras and gilded mirrors. The second has 70 windows, floor-to-ceiling, and all brightly illuminated from behind, followed by seven steer skulls (for some reason) painted gold and hung along the wall as decoration.\n\nThe costumes sparkle, too. Jewels gleam, sequins glisten. There\u2019s a lot of light on stage.\n\nThis all puts a lot of pressure on the singers to measure up, and not just to their immediate surroundings. If Central City is timeless, then it is the titles and the building that remain consistent, performers come and go. It\u2019s not easy to be memorable.\n\nUltimately, they are here. Ellie Dehn started well Saturday evening and ended better as Violetta, one of opera\u2019s most familiar heroines. Her confidence seemed to expand as Violetta\u2019s troubles \u2014 and the role\u2019s demand for versatility \u2014 increased. Tenor Ryan MacPherson embodied all of Alfredo\u2019s haughtiness and regrets. They were are good match.\n\nBaritone Troy Cook did what smart singers do with the scene-stealing music Verdi wrote for Alfredo\u2019s overbearing father Giorgio, he stole each scene he was in.\n\nStill, it was a night when the venue starred in the show. Conductor and CCO Music Director John Baril has mastered the way the orchestra and singers can mix in this cozy place, so there were no technical distractions.\n\nThe spotlight was on the venue itself, the quirky little opera house in the hills, where past and present collide.\n\nRay Mark Rinaldi: 303-954-1540, rrinaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/rayrinaldi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Central City Opera\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata,\u201d sentimental and right at home", "title": "Central City Opera\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata,\u201d sentimental and right at home", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/12/central-city-operas-la-traviata-sentimental-and-right-at-home/", "image": {"width": 495, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150713__traviatap1.jpg", "height": 330}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150713__traviatap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-12T21:40:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T00:47:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d19\"", "article_summary": "If Central City is timeless, then it is the titles and the building that remain consistent, performers come and go.\nShe crams the singers on stage, which in Central City is just a few feet from the first row, and has none of them holding back.\nMaybe that\u2019s a billowy thing to say in relation to any single production of any particular work, but a night at the Central City Opera makes that quality of art palpable.\nThe setting of Verdi\u2019s tragedy is the mid-1800s, about the time Central City was coming into its own as a boom town, growing with enough confidence to construct a sturdy performance hall near the top of its tallest hill.\nThe current production of \u201cLa Traviata,\u201d which opened Saturday, understands that power in the this tiny venue and makes the most of it."}
