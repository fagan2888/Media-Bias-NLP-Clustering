The ACA also requires certain large employers \u2013 generally those with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees \u2013 to annually file information returns with the IRS and furnish statements to individuals relating to the coverage that the employer offers, or does not offer, to its full-time employees. These reporting requirements are first required for the 2015 calendar year.\n\nNew deadlines\n\nThe deadline for furnishing 2015 statements to individual insureds and/or employees was extended from February 1, 2016, to March 31, 2016. The deadline for filing the 2015 returns with the IRS was extended from Feb. 29, 2016 to May 31, 2016, for those filing via paper; and from March 31, 2016, to June 30, 2016, for those filing electronically.\n\nNon-compliance penalties\n\nWe were all happy to see the deadlines extended, and likely quickly shifted our focus on to other year-end and first quarter deadlines. It is very important though, especially because the IRS gave us some more time, to meet the new deadlines. Indeed, employers and other coverage providers that do not comply with the extended deadlines are subject to financial penalties unless they can show reasonable cause for missing the deadlines.\n\nWhen the IRS extended the deadlines, it indicated that it will take into account certain factors in evaluating whether there is reasonable cause, including whether the employer gathered and transmitted the reporting data to an agent for submission to the IRS, whether the employer tested its ability to transmit the information to the IRS prior to the deadline, and whether the employer is working to meet the reporting requirements for 2016.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "EmployerLINC", "description": "About a month ago, and just months before the reporting deadlines required under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were set to go into effect, the Internal Rev", "title": "EmployerLINC  \u2013  ACA reporting deadline extended \u2014 but employers should stay focused to avoid penalties", "url": "http://employerlinc.com/2016/01/aca-reporting-deadline-extended-but-employers-should-stay-focused-to-avoid-penalties/", "image": "http://employerlinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IRS-building.jpg", "type": "article"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Non-compliance penaltiesWe were all happy to see the deadlines extended, and likely quickly shifted our focus on to other year-end and first quarter deadlines.\nIndeed, employers and other coverage providers that do not comply with the extended deadlines are subject to financial penalties unless they can show reasonable cause for missing the deadlines.\nNew deadlinesThe deadline for furnishing 2015 statements to individual insureds and/or employees was extended from February 1, 2016, to March 31, 2016.\nAbout a month ago, and just months before the reporting deadlines required under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were set to go into effect, the Internal Revenue Service gave us all a late Christmas present and announced that it would extend the deadlines.\nIt is very important though, especially because the IRS gave us some more time, to meet the new deadlines."}
