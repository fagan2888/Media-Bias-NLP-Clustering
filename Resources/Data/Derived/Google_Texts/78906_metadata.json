But he warned that the market may already be near saturation.\n\n\"The gating mechanism will probably be retailers reaching the point where adding more tap lines does not add to the craft beer sales,\" Koch said.\n\nFollowing Boston Beer's report, Cowen and Company Susquehanna, RBC and Jefferies cut their price targets for the stock.\n\nAnalysts had expected first-quarter revenue of $198 million, according to Thomson Reuters data. EPS was 53 cents, far below the 96 cents Wall Street expected.\n\nThe company's stock recently traded at about 22 times expected earnings, below its five-year average of around 25. Molson Coors Brewing Co trades at about 25 times earnings.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Boston Beer Company shares slumped on Friday after the brewe", "title": "Boston Beer slumps as Wall Street loses thirst", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/22/Boston-Beer-slumps-Wall-Street-loses-thirst", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-stocks_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/22/Boston-Beer-slumps-Wall-Street-loses-thirst", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-stocks_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Boston Beer Company shares slumped on Friday after the brewe", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In the March quarter, Boston Beer launched Samuel Adams Nitro White Ale, Samuel Adams Nitro IPA, Samuel Adams Nitro Coffee Stout and Samuel Adams Rebel Grapefruit IPA.\n\"The gating mechanism will probably be retailers reaching the point where adding more tap lines does not add to the craft beer sales,\" Koch said.\nOn a conference call with analysts, Boston Beer Chairman Jim Koch estimated that as many as 4,800 craft brewers are operating in the United States, a number he said could dramatically increase.\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Boston Beer Company shares slumped on Friday after the brewer of Sam Adams posted quarterly revenue below Wall Street's expectations and warned that it lost business to a growing legion of small craft brewers.\nFollowing Boston Beer's report, Cowen and Company Susquehanna, RBC and Jefferies cut their price targets for the stock."}
