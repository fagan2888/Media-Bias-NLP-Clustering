Ryan\n\nGov. Christie and his supporters have made it their mantra to attack citizens in public service in New Jersey for expecting the state government to honor the pension and benefit promises made to them going back decades. The governor\u2019s recent reference to \u201ca bloated, unaffordable entitlement system\u201d illustrates his disdain.\n\nSince the governor took office, public employees, who are merely asking for what they were promised, have faced a steady barrage of demagoguery from the governor. The attacks on pensions and health benefits have been a convenient issue for the governor to use to cover up the economic failures of his administration. This is the same governor who wrote to public school teachers in 2009 on his campaign website: \u201cNothing about your pension is going to change when I am governor.\u201d\n\nHis tactic has been to pit the voters against public workers. They are an estimated 770,000 people, ranging from active young employees who have just started their careers to those already retired and are now in their 70s, 80s, and beyond. They are current and retired union members and nonunion employees. They are police officers, firefighters, office managers, secretaries, teachers, maintenance workers, judges and clerks. They are Democrats, Republicans and independents. They all made or are now making uninterrupted \u2014 and if now active, increased \u2014 contributions to their pensions.\n\nThey aren\u2019t really any different from you. And their problem isn\u2019t much different than yours: ensuring that their employer makes good on the promises that were made to them.\n\nTwo letters in The Times last month help illustrate the common concerns that should unite rather than divide those in private and public employment. In \u201cWorkers are entitled to respectful language\u201d (Aug. 8), Paul Fowler wrote of Gov. Christie\u2019s \u201cbloated\u201d comment: \u201cIn my 44-year career in private industry, fringe benefits were never referred to as entitlements. They were always a key consideration in an individual\u2019s pay package. I think it is demeaning to any employee, whether private or public, to make such references.\u201d In a second letter, \u201cEnsure retirees\u2019 pensions are secure\u201d (Aug. 7), Harry Chapman referred to a practice known as \u201cpension stripping.\u201d He wrote: \u201cPension stripping is when companies sell off or transfer their retirees\u2019 pension plans to investment funds or insurers, converting them into annuities with little to no protections.\u201d The federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) was passed to protect pensions in the private sector by establishing funding ratios for private pension plans to ensure their fiscal solvency. The law required pension plan sponsors to pay insurance to the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to protect the pensions from default by companies that declare bankruptcy. Plans with poorer funding ratios are subject to more scrutiny.\n\nMr. Chapman\u2019s letter sounds the clarion call to alert current and future retirees in the private sector to the attempt by employers to circumvent ERISA. Thomas J. Healey, Gov. Christie\u2019s appointee to head his Pension and Health Benefit Study Commission, is co-author with Carl Hess and Kevin Nicholson of a 2012 study on underfunded public pensions. The authors discuss ERISA protections and point out that the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 added an \u201canti-cutback\u201d rule to ERISA protections intended to prevent private pension plans from reducing benefits already earned by employees.\n\n\u201cPension stripping\u201d transfers the risk from the employer to the employee and the insurance company or other entity holding the annuity to maintain the pension payment. It allows the employer to skip out on the insurance premium paid to the PBGC to guarantee the pension should the company go bankrupt.\n\nHowever, according to ProtectSeniors.org \u201cpension stripping,\u201d or \u201cde-risking,\u201d eliminates the protections of ERISA for retirees. Typically, companies offer a lump sum payment to retirees or transfer the funds, sometimes against the employee\u2019s wishes, to mutual fund or insurance companies. Edward Stone, counsel to the Association of BellTel Retirees Inc. and ProtectSeniors.org, in a letter posted on Pensionsponsors.com confirms that these transfers of funds mean retirees \u201close the protection of ERISA\u2019s fiduciary duty standards.\u201d\n\nPrivate-sector workers and public employees need to understand that they have a common interest in protecting their middle-class way of life and their future in retirement. The same forces that want to reduce or eliminate the employer\u2019s contractual responsibility for public employee pensions also want to reduce or eliminate employers\u2019 legal requirements for private-sector employee pensions. They don\u2019t care which comes first as long as they move toward their goal. Each step they can take in a downward spiral against one of these two groups brings them closer to their overall goal. In the private sector, they will say they have a responsibility to their shareholders to cut costs; in the public sector, they will make statements like Gov. Christie\u2019s \u201cbloated, unaffordable entitlement\u201d comment. Either way, those responsible for fulfilling their fiduciary responsibilities to their workers will search for legal loopholes to bail out of their obligations.\n\nPrivate- and public-sector workers need to say with one voice: Pensions and benefits are not an entitlement in the pejorative sense of the term used today \u2014 they are deferred compensation, pure and simple. They must be honored.\n\nThomas P. Ryan of Lawrence Township is a retired teacher of history and economics.\n\nFollow The Times of Trenton on Twitter @TimesofTrenton.
