If nothing is done, Kwanza will join these horrors in the firmament of American life.\n\nIt is a fact that Kwanzaa was invented in 1966 by a black radical FBI stooge, Ron Karenga -- aka Dr. Maulana Karenga -- founder of United Slaves, a violent nationalist rival to the Black Panthers. He was also a dupe of the FBI.\n\nIn what was ultimately a foolish gambit, during the madness of the '60s, the FBI encouraged the most extreme black nationalist organizations in order to discredit and split the left. The more preposterous the group, the better.\n\nBy that criterion, Karenga's United Slaves was perfect. In the annals of the American '60s, Karenga was the Father Gapon, stooge of the czarist police.\n\nDespite modern perceptions that blend all the black activists of the '60s, the Black Panthers did not hate whites. They did not seek armed revolution (although some of their most high-profile leaders were drug dealers and murderers). Those were the precepts of Karenga's United Slaves.\n\nUnited Slaves were proto-fascists, walking around in dashikis, gunning down Black Panthers and adopting invented \"African\" names. (That was a huge help to the black community: Three of the four suspects recently arrested for the fatal carjacking at the Short Hills, N.J., mall were named Basim, Hanif and Karif.)\n\nIt's as if David Duke invented a holiday called \"Anglika,\" which he based on the philosophy of Mein Kampf -- and clueless public school teachers began celebrating the made-up, racist holiday.\n\nWhether Karenga was a willing dupe, or just a dupe, remains unclear. Curiously, in a 1995 interview with Ethnic NewsWatch, Karenga matter-of-factly explained that the forces out to get O.J. Simpson for the \"framed\" murder of two whites included: \"the FBI, the CIA, the State Department, Interpol, the Chicago Police Department\" and so on. Karenga should know about FBI infiltration. (He further noted that the evidence against O.J. \"was not strong enough to prohibit or eliminate unreasonable doubt\" -- an interesting standard of proof.)\n\nIn the category of the-gentleman-doth-protest-too-much, back in the '70s, Karenga was quick to criticize rumors that black radicals were government-supported. When Nigerian newspapers claimed that some American black radicals were CIA operatives, Karenga publicly denounced the idea, saying, \"Africans must stop generalizing about the loyalties and motives of Afro-Americans, including the widespread suspicion of black Americans being CIA agents.\"\n\nNow we know that the FBI fueled the bloody rivalry between the Panthers and United Slaves.\n\nIn one barbarous outburst, Karenga's United Slaves shot to death two Black Panthers on the UCLA campus: Al \"Bunchy\" Carter and John Huggins. Karenga himself served time, a useful stepping-stone for his current position as a black studies professor at California State University at Long Beach.\n\nKarenga's invented holiday is a nutty blend of schmaltzy '60s rhetoric, black racism and Marxism. The seven principles of Kwanzaa are the very same seven principles of the Symbionese Liberation Army, another innovation of the Worst Generation.\n\nIn 1974, Patricia Hearst, kidnap victim-cum-SLA revolutionary, posed next to the banner of her alleged captors, a seven-headed cobra. Each snake head stood for one of the SLA's revolutionary principles: Umoja, Kujichagulia, Ujima, Ujamaa, Nia, Kuumba and Imani -- the exact same seven \"principles\" of Kwanzaa.\n\nKwanzaa praises collectivism in every possible area of life -- economics, work, personality, even litter removal. (\"Kuumba: Everyone should strive to improve the community and make it more beautiful.\") It takes a village to raise a police snitch.\n\nWhen Karenga was asked to distinguish Kawaida, the philosophy underlying Kwanzaa, from \"classical Marxism,\" he essentially said that, under Kawaida, we also hate whites. (Kawaida, Kwanzaa and Kuumba are also the only three Kardashian sisters not to have their own shows on the E! network.)\n\nWhile taking the \"best of early Chinese and Cuban socialism\" -- excluding, one hopes, forced abortions, imprisonment of homosexuals and forced labor -- Karenga said Kawaida practitioners believe one's racial identity \"determines life conditions, life chances and self-understanding.\" There's an inclusive philosophy for you.\n\nKwanzaa was the result of a '60s psychosis grafted onto the black community. Liberals have become so mesmerized by multicultural nonsense that they have forgotten the real history of Kwanzaa and Karenga's United Slaves -- the violence, the Marxism, the insanity.\n\nMost absurdly, for leftists anyway, they have forgotten the FBI's tacit encouragement of this murderous black nationalist cult founded by the father of Kwanzaa.\n\nKwanzaa emerged not from Africa, but from the FBI's COINTELPRO. It is a holiday celebrated exclusively by idiot white liberals. Black people celebrate Christmas.
