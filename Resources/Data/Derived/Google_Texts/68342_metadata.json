Another is inside of ambulances in Plano. Both are models of the kinds of changes to health care that we need to be successful.\n\nIn 2014, Baylor shaved 7 percent or $14 million off the cost of providing health care to its employees by initiating an innovative program that focuses more care on the highest risk employees.\n\nNow the hospital system has become one of several hundred programs around the country selected to expand a focused, coordinated care approach into the Medicare population it serves.\n\nThe program created under the Affordable Care Act is important because it attempts to single out the highest-risk patients in the Medicare population and get them preventive care that can help hold down their health care costs.\n\nPeople who are unable to manage their own health care, for any number of reasons, end up raising the price for all of us. Emergency rooms and ambulances become the doctor\u2019s office at enormous cost.\n\nIn the program Baylor is entering this year, the hospital will assign a single nurse to specific Medicare patients to help manage their care in ways that multiple doctors could never do. Imagine a patient with obesity, heart disease and diabetes who takes a half-dozen pills a day. If a nurse was able to track that person\u2019s health and push that person to maintain better daily habits, the entire system of care would benefit.\n\nUnder the program, Baylor will track more than 30 variables, including outcomes and costs. Any savings realized through the program are shared with health care providers as an incentive to participate. A portion of savings is also returned to taxpayers.\n\nThe program isn\u2019t without risk to the hospital. If, in its third year in the program, Baylor spends more than Medicare budgets for its pool of patients, the hospital must pay the difference to the taxpayer.\n\nIn Plano and other cities, meanwhile, paramedics are beginning to visit people with chronic conditions in hopes of monitoring and managing their care to lower calls to 911 and visits to the ER. This sort of program is becoming more common in this region and across the country in large part to help check costs associated with caring for high-risk patients.\n\nWe need programs like these to work, and we need ideas for more like them. No single, magical plan will solve our nation\u2019s problem with rising health care costs. It\u2019s probably too much to hope that we can ever steeply reduce the cost of health care, but we must slow the pace of growth for that cost or the price we pay as a society will be far too high.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It will take many more such efforts to keep the country from being hurt by the rising costs of care.", "og": {"description": "It will take many more such efforts to keep the country from being hurt by the rising costs of care.", "title": "Editorial: Two ideas to slow rise of health care costs deserve attention", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20150107-editorial-two-ideas-to-slow-rise-of-health-care-costs-deserve-attention.ece", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20150107-people_randy_travis_32099424.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/PEOPLE_RANDY_TRAVIS_32099424.JPG", "height": 658}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-01-08T02:34:38Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-01-08T02:34:38Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Editorial: Two ideas to slow rise of health care costs deserve attention\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20150107-editorial-two-ideas-to-slow-rise-of-health-care-costs-deserve-attention.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20150107-people_randy_travis_32099424.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/PEOPLE_RANDY_TRAVIS_32099424.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2125228\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-08T02:34:38Z\", \"section\": \"Editorials\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20150107-people_randy_travis_32099424.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/PEOPLE_RANDY_TRAVIS_32099424.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-01-08T02:34:38Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "No single, magical plan will solve our nation\u2019s problem with rising health care costs.\nPeople who are unable to manage their own health care, for any number of reasons, end up raising the price for all of us.\nSmart people have spent a lot of time and energy trying to figure out ways to hold the line on rising health care costs, from insurance premiums to ambulance calls to emergency room visits.\nBoth are models of the kinds of changes to health care that we need to be successful.\nAny savings realized through the program are shared with health care providers as an incentive to participate."}
