But this next selection is especially significant.\n\nThe choice of James M. Barrie\u2019s classic musical is laden with nostalgia for Baby boomers and the TV industry itself, notably NBC. The original 1954 Broadway stage production of the musical starred Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Richard as Captain Hook.\n\nWhen the show closed in 1955, NBC mounted a live TV broadcast of the show. It was seen by some 65 million viewers, the largest audience for a single night of programming at the time. It was rebroadcast in 1956. And 1960 \u2014 the first broadcast of a musical in color.\n\nJokes about who should play Peter (anyone but Miley) are in the air, but it\u2019s not clear NBC will stick with tradition and cast a female. Anne Hathaway? Kristen Chenoweth? Kristen Bell?\n\nAnd the over-the-top, foppish role of Hook could be a riot for all sorts of TV/Broadway pros.
