I had my own law office right on California Avenue. People charged with crimes handed me cash, in advance, over a big oak desk. Occasionally, I\u2019d make a couple of grand in an afternoon.\n\nBut soon, my body started giving out one part at a time. First a shoulder, then my lower back, knee cartilage, neck vertebrae. Two groin hernia surgeries later, at 33 years old, I could not lift a bag of groceries, or sit without an orthopedic pillow. After 10 years as a law student and lawyer, working in a profession I didn\u2019t like was taking its toll.\n\nI sold my practice and fled to San Miguel de Allende in the Mexican state of Guanajuato. My widowed Jewish mother in Mamaroneck, N.Y., took out a missing person ad on Mexican television to find me. No joke. I had told Mom that I was headed to Mexico, but after 10 days without word from me, she paid for the ad. A strange man poked my fanned-out map on a San Miguel street corner and said, \u201cI saw you on TV last night.\u201d\n\nMom and Dad had both been teachers, children of Russian and Polish immigrants, and they celebrated law as a step up. But my mother wasn\u2019t the one keeping me in an ill-fitting career. She just wanted to know I was alive.\n\nAfter two years in San Miguel de Allende, bored and broke, I returned to the Bay Area looking for work, but couldn\u2019t land a job in anything but law. Finally I took a civil attorney position in Oakland.\n\nFighting depression, I volunteered at a Sunday school. It couldn\u2019t hurt to see a few kids on the weekend. On a bright morning, I organized an outdoor game of Duck Duck Goose. \u201cI\u2019m wearing new white stockings to visit Grandma this afternoon,\u201d a 6-year-old girl told me. She had blond curls and big brown eyes. Chasing a boy around the circle, she slipped on some dirt, and fell hard, tearing the stockings. Before I knew it, she leapt up into my arms. My heart exploded with the joy of being needed. Next morning, I called my mother, and told her I was coming home.\n\n\u201cMom,\u201d I said, \u201cI may be here for a while. Not weeks \u2014 months.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMy mother arched her brow as we walked together through her Westchester neighborhood. New knees allowed her to keep up, as we circled the block.\n\n\u201cAre you finished with law?\u201d Mom asked. Pressure rose in my chest and throat, and I coughed.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what are you going to do? You\u2019re 37 years old.\u201d\n\nShe scanned my face as if taking the measure of a stranger.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take time to decide,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d she stopped walking, \u201cyou\u2019re ruining your life.\u201d\n\nStudying want ads one evening, the one that got my blood moving promised to train me as a party clown, and send me out at $25 per show. Years earlier, I\u2019d dreamed of becoming so weightless that I bounced off the ceiling. I could see myself in a billowy clown suit. After a free training session, I purchased the starter kit for $59 and waited for them to call.\n\nWithin a week, the company dispatched me to a party for a 7-year-old at a Ground Round restaurant in Yonkers. I applied colorful makeup, donned oversize shoes, orange wig, bag of tricks. It took a minute to decide on \u201cBobo\u201d as my name. I silly-walked up to a table of children in the party room. By the end of the performance, the birthday boy said to me, \u201cBobo, I love you.\u201d In the car later, I rested my head on the steering wheel. An unexpected feeling surfaced: happiness.\n\nIt turned out that I thrived in a sphere of creativity and spontaneity. The clown gig was short-lived: I donated the costume to Goodwill, picked up my old Martin guitar, and played the fool with music, writing songs like \u201cBossanova Boo-boo.\u201d\n\nPottery Barn Kids hired me for shows up and down the East Coast, at $450 an appearance, a step up from my first $25 gigs. The school, library and party shows kept coming. I wasn\u2019t making a lawyer\u2019s salary, but I was doing O.K. It was fun, and my body felt better. Toddlers were better company than felons.\n\nI\u2019ve been entertaining children now for almost two decades as a musician. No longer do I flash power-of-attorney to withdraw my $10,000 retainer from a jailed client\u2019s bank account. I wear jeans, and don\u2019t frequent Nordstrom. But most of the time, I like waking up in the morning.\n\nRobert Markowitz is working on a memoir.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150820032108, "BN": "opinionator", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/opinionator", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/opinionator/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "August 20, 2015", "keywords": "Clowns,Labor and Jobs,Legal Profession,Private Lives", "GBLC": "Private Lives", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/opinionator/Abandoning the Work I Hated ( 20150820 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Robert Markowitz", "SCG": "opinionator", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Robert Markowitz", "byl": "Robert Markowitz", "twitter": {"description": "When I gave up law and started being a clown, I knew what it meant to be happy.", "title": "Abandoning the Work I Hated", "url": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/abandoning-the-work-i-hated/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/08/20/opinion/20private/20private-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytopinionator", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003864625, "description": "When I gave up law and started being a clown, I knew what it meant to be happy.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "August 20, 2015", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "Private Lives", "published_time": 1440055268, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T07:21:08-04:00"}, "utime": 20150820072108, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150820, "pdate": 20150820, "des": "Clowns;Labor and Jobs;Legal Profession", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/08/20/opinion/20private/20private-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Opinionator", "description": "When I gave up law and started being a clown, I knew what it meant to be happy.", "title": "Abandoning the Work I Hated", "url": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/abandoning-the-work-i-hated/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/08/20/opinion/20private/20private-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/abandoning-the-work-i-hated/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Abandoning the Work I Hated", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/08/20/opinion/20private/20private-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1847\"", "article_summary": "I sold my practice and fled to San Miguel de Allende in the Mexican state of Guanajuato.\nAfter two years in San Miguel de Allende, bored and broke, I returned to the Bay Area looking for work, but couldn\u2019t land a job in anything but law.\nMy widowed Jewish mother in Mamaroneck, N.Y., took out a missing person ad on Mexican television to find me.\nAfter 10 years as a law student and lawyer, working in a profession I didn\u2019t like was taking its toll.\nWithin a week, the company dispatched me to a party for a 7-year-old at a Ground Round restaurant in Yonkers."}
