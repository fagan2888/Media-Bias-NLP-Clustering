The regiment, which began as a civilian volunteer battalion after the Maidan revolution last year, is stuck balancing the competing interests of building a military unit from scratch while sustaining continued combat operations.\n\nWith little time or resources available to mold civilians into soldiers, the Azov Regiment\u2019s training program focuses on developing the most essential skills and traits necessary to keep soldiers alive.\n\nThe director of the program is Mikael Skillt, a 38-year-old Swedish sniper who has been fighting in Ukraine for 14 months. Skillt said that pushing a recruit to his mental and physical limit is an effective way to predict how he will react under the pressures of combat.\n\n\u201cWe put them through stress tests to induce panic, and we see how they handle themselves,\u201d Skillt said. \u201cWe have to see how they react to stress before we send them into combat.\u201d\n\nAlong with a small cadre of Azov combat veterans chosen to be instructors, Skillt uses techniques such as burying soldiers alive for up to 20 minutes, pepper spray and water boarding to induce panic in the recruits.\n\nEach class starts with about 50 trainees, and the attrition rate is about 10 percent. The most recent class began with 55 recruits, 50 of whom completed training this past weekend. One of the dropouts was a French paratrooper, Skillt said.\n\nThe Spartan Test is a series of physical challenges\u2014including a 10-kilometer run, obstacle course and wrestling match\u2014all of which recruits must complete in under three hours.\n\nForty soldiers, comprising both recruits and soldiers returned from the front (as well as four Russians) participated in Saturday\u2019s Spartan Test. Only 23 finished.\n\n\u201cAll 40 will go to the East,\u201d Skillt said. \u201cBut 23 will go a little taller, a little prouder.\u201d\n\nThe Spartan Test is a rite of passage for the Azov Regiment. Its completion is not a prerequisite for front-line service, but a source of pride within a unit that eschews traditional military chains of command and calls its organizational structure a \u201cbrotherhood.\u201d Those who successfully complete the Spartan Test receive a pin and are eligible for specialized training programs like sniper school.\n\nThe Azov Regiment comprises foreign fighters from 19 different countries, including two Americans currently serving in the unit, according to Azov personnel. Because the rules of the most recent cease-fire ban the use of foreign fighters on both sides of the Ukraine conflict, most of Azov\u2019s foreign soldiers have either returned home or left the battlefield to continue serving as trainers.\n\nThe Kyiv training camp is in an abandoned industrial park on the city\u2019s outskirts. The owners of the property allow the Azov Regiment to use a section of the facility in exchange for protection against looters. The Azov camp is basic, with instructors living in residential trailers similar in size and shape to the Containerized Housing Units (CHUs) the U.S. military used on bases in Afghanistan and Iraq. And while the camp is within Kyiv\u2019s city limits, the area has been designated a special \u201ctactical area,\u201d allowing for live-fire training under special circumstances.\n\nThe makeshift camp was a flurry of activity this past weekend. Girlfriends and other supporters came out to cheer on Spartan Test participants while local volunteers were busy constructing camp facilities. After the event was over, there was a cookout sponsored by civilian supporters of the regiment.\n\n\u201cIt helps morale to see this kind of civilian support,\u201d Skillt said.\n\nSkillt is a former sniper in the Swedish military. While he has received media coverage in the past for his alleged far-right political ideology, he said images of Ukrainian protestors being gunned down by snipers in Kyiv during the 2014 Maidan revolution spurred him to fight in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate Russians, only Putin,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Azov Regiment has also come under scrutiny due to accusations of promoting Nazi ideology, with many pointing to the similarity of the group\u2019s symbol to the Nazi Wolfsangel.\n\nThe regiment has downplayed the claims, calling them Russian propaganda. Skillt acknowledged that some of Azov\u2019s members held far-right political beliefs, but said they were not representative of the group as a whole.\n\n\u201cAll of them are willing to die for their country,\u201d Skillt said. \u201cDoes their support mean any less if they are nationalistic?\u201d\n\nSkillt joined the Azov Regiment when the unit was still a civilian volunteer battalion with 120 soldiers\u2014only two of whom had any military experience.\n\n\u201cWe were a rough bunch,\u201d he added. \u201cAt first we just had shotguns and other small arms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the beginning we only had pistols,\u201d said Ivan Kharkiv, an Azov Regiment soldier in an earlier interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cNow the National Guard gives us all we need.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need weapons,\u201d he added. \u201cBut instructors are more important.\u201d\n\nThe unit was officially incorporated into the Ukrainian National Guard earlier this year, tightening government oversight on combat operations and training. Soldiers now receive a salary and government benefits for their service, and the government has also begun to equip the Azov Regiment with armored fighting vehicles and tanks.\n\nThe unit is still mostly autonomous, however. It retains control of its own training program and still independently plans and executes its combat operations in most circumstances. And unlike regular Ukrainian military units, which are heavily composed of draftees, Azov\u2019s soldiers are volunteers.\n\nSkillt said the volunteer mentality has made Azov more effective than most regular army units, despite its equipment and weapons shortfalls, and reliance on civilian donations for funding.\n\n\u201cI think this is how it was in World War II in America,\u201d Skillt said. \u201cOrdinary people who would never have been in the military under normal circumstances are ready to die for their country. These guys would do anything for their brothers; you will never see them running away from a fight.\u201d\n\nThe unit currently has about 1,000 soldiers and is training 50 new personnel every two weeks to achieve its desired force strength of 1,200, which is the benchmark required by the Ukrainian government for additional armored equipment delivery.\n\nThe unit\u2019s rapid growth has spurred its ad hoc training program, which Skillt was tapped to organize due to his prior military experience and performance on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not some fancy military school like West Point,\u201d Skillt said. \u201cIt\u2019s all beta testing, basically.\u201d\n\nDespite its manpower goals, Azov remains selective about its recruits. Some are turned away for psychological reasons, and with the help of the SBU (Ukraine\u2019s equivalent of the FBI) background checks are completed to weed out potential Russian spies.\n\nOne of the key challenges of creating soldiers from scratch in two weeks is educating them with the discipline and knowledge to operate according to the laws of war, as well as within the terms of the Feb. 12 cease-fire. In the opening months of the war, when Azov was not under formal government oversight, the group\u2019s conduct in battle was self-policed according to a \u201cwarrior code.\u201d\n\nBut a string of separatist executions of captured Azov soldiers has left many on the Ukrainian side with little faith in their chances of survival if taken prisoner. In one instance, Skillt described, separatists forced a captured Azov soldier to call his grandmother on his cell-phone so that she could listen to his execution.\n\n\u201cNow there is no surrender,\u201d Skillt said. \u201cIf we are wounded we fight to the death.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "At its training camp, the Ukrainian National Guard Azov Regiment holds its Spartan Test\u2014a three-hour training meant to test the strength of soldiers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "At its training camp, the Ukrainian National Guard Azov Regiment holds its Spartan Test\u2014a three-hour training meant to test the strength of soldiers.", "title": "A Ukrainian National Guard Unit Trains to \u2018Fight to the Death\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SpartanFeature.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-20T14:24:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1aKNai8"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "At its training camp, the Ukrainian National Guard Azov Regiment holds its Spartan Test\u2014a three-hour training meant to test the strength of soldiers.", "title": "A Ukrainian National Guard Unit Trains to \u2018Fight to the Death\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SpartanFeature.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-04-20T13:01:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T14:24:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, Azov Regiment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd839f\"", "article_summary": "Girlfriends and other supporters came out to cheer on Spartan Test participants while local volunteers were busy constructing camp facilities.\n\u201cBut 23 will go a little taller, a little prouder.\u201dThe Spartan Test is a rite of passage for the Azov Regiment.\nThe Azov Regiment comprises foreign fighters from 19 different countries, including two Americans currently serving in the unit, according to Azov personnel.\nThe owners of the property allow the Azov Regiment to use a section of the facility in exchange for protection against looters.\nThe ordeal is the capstone to a two-week-long whirlwind military training program, after which many recruits travel to the front lines for the first time."}
