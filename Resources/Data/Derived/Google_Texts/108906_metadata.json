The petition is the fifth one the Supreme Court has received on the HHS contraception mandate, making it likely that the Supreme Court will decide in the upcoming term whether these groups should be protected from the mandate.\n\nAs of Monday, a number of groups have written friend-of-the-court briefs in support of the order.\n\nBriefs were written by six different orders of Catholic nuns, a coalition of Orthodox Jewish Rabbis, 20 state governments, the ERLC, the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, National Association of Evangelicals, the Cato Institute and a multitude other religious and secular organizations, who urge the Supreme Court to not only review the nuns' case but also reverse the appeals court's decision.\n\n\"This strong show of support for the Little Sisters demonstrates just how important it is that the Supreme Court address the impact of the HHS mandate, particularly on religious groups,\" Mark Rienzi, Becket Fund senior counsel, said in a statement.\n\n\"It is especially significant that 20 state governments are supporting the Little Sisters at the Supreme Court.\"\n\nLast week, the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Little Sisters will not have to abide by the mandate while their lawsuit against the mandate continues.\n\n\"The Sisters consider it immoral to help the government distribute these drugs. But instead of simply exempting them, the government insists that it can take over their ministry's employee healthcare to distribute these drugs to their employees, while dismissing the Sisters' moral objections as irrelevant,\" Rienzi stated. \"In America, judges and government bureaucrats have no authority to tell the Little Sisters what is moral or immoral.\"\n\nLast year, the Christian arts supply chain Hobby Lobby was successful in their Supreme Court case against the HHS mandate.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has already granted interim relief from the HHS Mandate to religious groups five times,\" Rienzi added. \"The government has exempted thousands of businesses from the HHS Mandate, so why is it needlessly forcing religious institutions, nuns and homeless shelters to carry out its goals? The government already has its own exchanges to do that.\"\n\nAccording to the brief written by the Jewish rabbis, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals declined to protect the nuns' religious freedom because it found their explanation of their own religious objection the mandate \"unconvincing.\"\n\n\"RFRA neither requires nor allows courts to second-guess religious adherents' sincerely held religious beliefs,\" the brief states. \"In evaluating and ultimately rejecting the petitioners' claim that complying with the Health and Human Services Accommodation would substantially burden their religious exercise, the Tenth Circuit deviated from this precedent and significantly narrowed RFRA's protection.\"", "article_metadata": {"Description": "As the Little Sisters of the Poor are petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a federal court decision that forces the order of Catholic nuns to abide by the \"Obamacare\" contraception mandate, over 20 states, a group of Orthodox Jewish rabbis and a number of Evangelical and secular organizations are urging the high court to take up the case and protect religious liberty.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "Catholics, Evangelicals, Jews Join Forces, Ask Supreme Court to Take Obamacare Contraceptive Mandate Case", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "As the Little Sisters of the Poor are petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a federal court decision that forces the order of Catholic nuns to abide by the \"Obamacare\" contraception mandate, over 20 states, a group of Orthodox Jewish rabbis and a number of Evangelical and secular organizations are urging the high court to take up the case and protect religious liberty.", "title": "Catholics, Evangelicals, Jews Join Forces, Ask Supreme Court to Take Obamacare Contraceptive Mandate Case", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/catholics-evangelicals-jews-join-forces-ask-supreme-court-to-take-obamacare-contraceptive-mandate-case-143584/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/79034/little-sisters-of-the-poor.jpg", "author": "Samuel Smith", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/79034/little-sisters-of-the-poor.jpg", "description": "As the Little Sisters of the Poor are petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a federal court decision that forces the order of Catholic nuns to abide by the \"Obamacare\" contraception mandate, over 20 states, a group of Orthodox Jewish rabbis and a number of Evangelical and secular organizations are urging the high court to take up the case and protect religious liberty.", "site": "@ChristianPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Catholics, Evangelicals, Jews Join Forces, Ask Supreme Court to Take Obamacare Contraceptive Mandate Case"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/catholics-evangelicals-jews-join-forces-ask-supreme-court-to-take-obamacare-contraceptive-mandate-case-143584/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "Little&20Sisters&20of&20the&20Poor,National&20Association&20of&20Evangelicals,Becket&20Fund,,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2015-08-24T15:42:00-04:00", "modDate": "2015-08-24T15:42:00-04:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Little Sisters of the Poor, National Association of Evangelicals, Becket Fund,,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1012\"", "article_summary": "Last year, the Christian arts supply chain Hobby Lobby was successful in their Supreme Court case against the HHS mandate.\nThe petition is the fifth one the Supreme Court has received on the HHS contraception mandate, making it likely that the Supreme Court will decide in the upcoming term whether these groups should be protected from the mandate.\n\"It is especially significant that 20 state governments are supporting the Little Sisters at the Supreme Court.\"\n\"The Supreme Court has already granted interim relief from the HHS Mandate to religious groups five times,\" Rienzi added.\n\"In America, judges and government bureaucrats have no authority to tell the Little Sisters what is moral or immoral.\""}
