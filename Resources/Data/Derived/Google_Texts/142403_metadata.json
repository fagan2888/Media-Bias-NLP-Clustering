The newest deep fields, called Hubble \u201cFrontier Fields,\u201d use updated cameras on Hubble, and look even farther by taking advantage of the universe\u2019s own \u201cnatural\u201d telescopes, called gravitational lenses.\n\nGravitational lenses occur when very massive objects\u2014such as clusters of galaxies\u2014warp spacetime around them, causing light (and anything else) traveling nearby to take a curved path. Very distant galaxies that happen to lie behind these lenses from the perspective of Earth will appear magnified and brightened because of the gravitational warping of their light. Thus, the Frontier Fields use Hubble\u2019s own magnifying abilities in combination with the serendipitous magnification offered by gravitational lenses to look for the farthest objects ever glimpsed.\n\nThe new image is preliminary. In May Hubble will collect more data on this first field, bringing the photo\u2019s total exposure time to 103 hours, and over the next three years it will examine the other five Frontier Fields, which were chosen at spots where nature\u2019s most powerful gravitational lenses lie. \u201cWe\u2019re really interested in knowing what happened in that first billion years of the universe,\u201d Lotz says. \u201cThe thing that Frontier Fields is going to do is look for the galaxies that were basically small enough in those first billion years to turn into our Milky Way Galaxy. We want to know, when did galaxies like the Milky Way first come to be?\u201d\n\nThe project could resolve a puzzle about when the first galaxies formed in the universe. \u201cSome people have claimed to see a sharp drop-off of galaxies back in time,\u201d indicating that before a certain epoch essentially no galaxies were able to form, says Dan Coe of STScI, who collaborated on the Frontier Fields project. If that is the case, it could teach us about the dark matter that appears to contribute most of the matter in the universe. Galaxies are thought to form inside clouds of dark matter, and the properties of whatever makes up this dark matter would have determined when it first clumped into clouds and how big they were, enabling the first galaxies to form. \u201cThe Frontier Fields are going to determine fairly definitively one way or the other whether there is a sharp drop-off,\u201d Coe says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new deep-field photo of a \u201cblank spot\u201d in space unveils thousands of previously unseen primordial galaxies", "title": "Hubble telescope reveals deepest view of universe yet", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new deep-field photo of a \u201cblank spot\u201d in space unveils thousands of previously unseen primordial galaxies", "title": "Hubble telescope reveals deepest view of universe yet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/09/hubble_telescope_reveals_deepest_view_of_universe_yet_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/shutterstock_128469392.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new deep-field photo of a \u201cblank spot\u201d in space unveils thousands of previously unseen primordial galaxies", "title": "Hubble telescope reveals deepest view of universe yet", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/shutterstock_128469392.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Clara Moskowitz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Astronomy, Hubble Telescope, Science, Scientific American, Universe", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5f02\"", "article_summary": "The newest deep fields, called Hubble \u201cFrontier Fields,\u201d use updated cameras on Hubble, and look even farther by taking advantage of the universe\u2019s own \u201cnatural\u201d telescopes, called gravitational lenses.\n\u201cIt is the deepest view of the universe ever taken,\u201d says project leader Jennifer Lotz of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore.\n\u201cThe Frontier Fields are going to determine fairly definitively one way or the other whether there is a sharp drop-off,\u201d Coe says.\nGravitational lenses occur when very massive objects\u2014such as clusters of galaxies\u2014warp spacetime around them, causing light (and anything else) traveling nearby to take a curved path.\nThus, the Frontier Fields use Hubble\u2019s own magnifying abilities in combination with the serendipitous magnification offered by gravitational lenses to look for the farthest objects ever glimpsed."}
