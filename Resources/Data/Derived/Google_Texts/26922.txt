The Canadian County Sheriff's Office arrested Melvin Hibbs and Kyle Hibbs, of Blanchard, on complaints relating to the stolen equipment.

Authorities said the pair were found in possession of numerous items belonging to the Mustang Public School District.

Mustang police Chief Chuck Foley contacted the Sheriff's Office to begin the investigation.

"Not knowing whether the thefts originated from one of the schools in Mustang city limits, Chief Foley contacted my office, and inquired if we would be willing to take the case since all the schools fall within the Sheriff’s jurisdiction," said Randall Edwards, Canadian County Sheriff.

Investigators said the thefts happened at a storage building at the high school. Investigators searched Kyle Hibbs' residence and said they found several items belonging to the school district in his apartment.

According to the Canadian County Sheriff's Office, Melvin Hibbs surrendered to authorities and confessed to the crime.

"Not only did (Melvin) Hibbs confess to the thefts, but he told my investigators that he didn’t feel too bad about stealing the equipment, because his salary wasn’t very good for a plumber," Edwards said.

Melvin Hibbs faces charges of grand larceny and receiving and concealing stolen property. Kyle Hibbs faces charges of receiving stolen property.
