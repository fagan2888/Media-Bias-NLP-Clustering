It asks them to rate chains they\u2019ve patronized in the past three months on 16 attributes of customer satisfaction, including overall appeal to children.\n\nIn June, researchers found that Chick-fil-A satisfied 83 percent of customers on \u201coverall appeal to kids,\u201d edging out McDonald\u2019s at 79 percent.\n\nBeverly Cain, senior vice president of operations at Sandelman & Associates, attributed some of that success to Chick-fil-A\u2019s focus on family values rooted in its founder\u2019s evangelical Christian faith.\n\n\u201cThey are a chain that has long been known for its family values, so parents feel good about supporting Chick-fil-A,\u201d Cain told The Daily Signal.\n\nCain pointed to Chick-fil-A\u2019s expansion of play places and \u201ccow-centric, fun advertising,\u201d which she said could be more appealing to kids than some McDonald\u2019s ads.\n\nThe chicken chain also is the only one where a child can return or trade in a prize for a dessert. \u201cThat helps,\u201d Cain noted.\n\nThe Chick-fil-A website states that its Kids Meals offer prizes that \u201chelp bring grownups and kids together.\u201d This goes beyond plastic toys to include \u201cactivities, games and facts that stimulate young minds and help plant the seeds of good values.\u201d\n\nAdding to that, Cain said, Chick-fil-A consistently ranks high in categories such as cleanliness and friendliness, and is appreciated for \u201chighly appetizing\u201d food.\n\nThe outgrowth of a diner near Atlanta that founder S. Truett Cathy started in 1946 and a chicken sandwich that he perfected 18 years later, Chick-fil-A continued to expand year by year even as the chain stayed faithful to a tradition of being closed on Sundays.\n\nCathy, who died Sept. 8 at 93, believed his employees should have an opportunity to rest, spend time with loved ones and worship if they choose to do so.\n\nCertainly, Cain said, these factors all contribute to why Chick-fil-A is able to challenge a fast-food goliath like McDonald\u2019s in customer \u2014 including kiddie customer\u2013 satisfaction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Parents rate the fast-food chicken chain higher in \u201ckid appeal\u201d than McDonald\u2019s, research shows.
