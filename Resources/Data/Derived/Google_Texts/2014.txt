Frank Brown Park was filled with plaid colors for the 24th Annual Scottish Festival and Highland Games.

This is the first year that the event was held in Panama City Beach.

The festival featured vendors selling scottish cuisine, there were athletic competitions, a car show, and an Irish dance team from Panama City.

Event organizers say they are excited to have more room for the festival at Frank Brown Park.

"We're very happy to be out here at Frank Brown Park, explained Bill McCurdy, the Vice-President of the Scottish Festival. "The crowd is really spread out, but it's really getting thicker and thicker, as opposed to other smaller venues we had in the past."
