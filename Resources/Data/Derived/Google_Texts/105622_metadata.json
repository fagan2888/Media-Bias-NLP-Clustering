Eight passengers were killed in the crash and more than a hundred others were injured.\n\nInvestigators struggled to determine whether the train's operator, who survived the crash, had been using his cellphone in the moments prior to the derailment. The Amtrak engineer was eventually cleared of being distracted, but only after several weeks of the investigators combing his cellphone records.\n\nThe NTSB said this week that it has been calling for cameras in train engineer cabins since 1995.\n\n\"The NTSB continues to believe inward- and outward-facing audio and image recorders improve the quality of accident investigations and provide the opportunity for proactive steps by railroad management to improve operational safety,\" the agency wrote in a letter to Amtrak CEO Joe Boardman.\n\n\"We have been encouraged by the inclusion of these recommendations in previously proposed rail safety legislation, and we hope this can be part of a rail safety legislative proposal that may be considered by this Congress,\" the NTSB letter continued.\n\nThe full letter can be read here.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The agency said cameras would provide invaluable information to accident investigators.", "description": "The agency said cameras would provide invaluable information to accident investigators.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The agency said cameras would provide invaluable information to accident investigators.", "title": "NTSB recommends cameras for Amtrak trains after deadly crash", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247345-ntsb-recommends-cameras-for-amtrak-trains-after-deadly-crash", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/amtrak05132015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-09T13:00:05-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-09T13:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247345-ntsb-recommends-cameras-for-amtrak-trains-after-deadly-crash", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-09T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "National Transportation Safety Board, Amtrak, Amtrak derailment,Christopher Hart,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-09T10:00:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-09T13:00:05-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247345-ntsb-recommends-cameras-for-amtrak-trains-after-deadly-crash", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The agency said cameras would provide invaluable information to accident investigators.", "card": "summary", "title": "NTSB recommends cameras for Amtrak trains after deadly crash"}, "dcterms.title": "NTSB recommends cameras for Amtrak trains after deadly crash"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a76\"", "article_summary": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is recommending that Amtrak install cameras in the engineer cabins of its trains after a deadly crash in May.\nNTSB Chairman Christopher Hart said the cameras would provide invaluable information to investigators in an event like the recent Amtrak crash.\nThe Amtrak engineer was eventually cleared of being distracted, but only after several weeks of the investigators combing his cellphone records.\nThe NTSB said this week that it has been calling for cameras in train engineer cabins since 1995.\nInvestigators struggled to determine whether the train's operator, who survived the crash, had been using his cellphone in the moments prior to the derailment."}
