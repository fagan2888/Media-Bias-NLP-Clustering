NEW ORLEANS - A few thousand patients could be searching for new doctors soon after United Health Care and Ochsner were not able to come to an agreement on providing health services, through the company's 'Compass' plan, the two sides announced Friday.



The move would remove Ochsner providers for close to 3,000 United Health clients. People with private or company-supplied health insurance would not be affected.



United Health had already announced that it would end 'Obamacare' health coverage at year's end. Friday's announcement sped up that process by several months.



The two sides could still reach an agreement before the companies part ways on May 15. Without a new deal, Ochsner patients covered by United Health Care's 'Compass' program would have to find new providers.



Some exceptions may be made for pregnant women or people with acute conditions, according to State Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon.
