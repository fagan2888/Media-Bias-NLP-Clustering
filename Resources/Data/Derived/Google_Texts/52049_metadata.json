I\u2019ve mentioned in the past that one of Bates Motel\u2019s greatest successes is how it\u2019s guided by its Psycho roots, but it\u2019s not beholden to that story. Yet increasingly (though slowly), the show has angled itself towards that inevitable fate. Mainly, in Norman\u2019s (Freddie Highmore) descent in to true madness.\n\nWhile Vera Farmiga\u2019s Norma continues to be the shining star of the series, Norman\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior is starting to steal the show. Though his bursts of violence and fixation on the wrong parts of the murders that are committed (believing Norma to be responsible) are certainly creepy, nothing resonates as much as his uncanny valley portrayal of his mother. There are layers of things happening here, as Highmore is portraying Norman portraying Farmiga\u2019s take on Norma. It\u2019s gloriously twisted, especially when he nails her exact motions and physical habits, like shoving her hands into her pockets as a sign of defensiveness, and scoffing as she lowers her head and thinks of her next move.\n\nThe show has also has plausibly given a reason why Norman hasn\u2019t been locked up. Up until now, Norma has been in denial, but she can\u2019t be any longer. Now, Norman is 18, and won\u2019t sign the consent forms to be voluntarily committed, which creates a new predicament \u2014 as soon as Norma acknowledges there\u2019s a problem, there\u2019s nothing she can do about it. And in a topical turn, Norma laments how she can\u2019t afford to send Norman to a plush facility (rather than the 1950s B-movie horror of the state-run facility) because she doesn\u2019t have any health insurance.\n\nNorma and Norman\u2019s relationship remains at the core of Bates Motel, and the show has had varying success in building up other subplots around them. It\u2019s often had trouble finding things for Dylan (Max Thieriot) to do, but establishing a connection between him and Emma (Olivia Cooke) has given them both an emotional storyline with her lung transplant and beyond. That\u2019s especially helpful since Emma\u2019s long-lost mother returns in the season\u2019s first two episodes, and is a potential catalyst for some major confrontations among the core cast.\n\nIn fact, those first two episodes (the only ones available for review) play out like a movie, building to a haunting final act that resolves in an uncertain place for Norman, and where the show might go next. But if it pivots into more of a psychological exploration of Norman and tendencies to want to become Norma (and commit murders as her), that could certainly be intriguing, especially as a stop-gap. (Speaking of, the incestuous tendencies have been played down more than Season 3, but they\u2019re still lurking). We can\u2019t have Norman going full Psycho yet, especially since A&E has already renewed Bates through another season after this. But bodies are already piling up, and Norman\u2019s belief that the real Norma is responsible is a scary twist (especially for Norma, who now bares the brunt of his rage, confusion, and suspicion).\n\nBates Motel, more than anything, remains moody and atmospheric, and walks the line between the interplay of delusion and reality very well (especially for a show that\u2019s been doing it for this long). Farmiga is as beguiling as ever, too, as she cycles through Norma\u2019s modes of getting what she wants: lying, seduction, pleading, force. The Norma-Norman duo also continues to pull those around them into their web of secrets, with Sheriff Romero (Nestor Carbonell) getting the brunt of it, and starring in his own coverup to kick off the new season.\n\nIn the best way possible, Bates Motel is how it\u2019s always been. It\u2019s strange and off-kilter, it plays with truth and hints at extremely dark acts without usually showing the violence all the way through. Like Norman, we only get glimpses, and we aren\u2019t always sure the difference between fantasy and reality. Bates Motel is in many ways its own fantasy world, curated by Norma and Norman, yet it\u2019s often best when it grounds itself in emotional truths, like Norman\u2019s escape to Portland last year. In fact, though Norman\u2019s decent is the one we\u2019re most anticipating and fearing, it\u2019s Norma who is the one to watch, because she now has to come to grips with some damning truths about her son, their relationship, and what that means for her. And for viewers, it means more weirdness, mystery, and everything we\u2019ve come to expect from Bates before.\n\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Very Good \u2014 As ever\n\nBates Motel Season 4 premieres Monday, March 7th on A&E.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.id": 547674, "twitter": {"domain": "Collider", "description": "Allison Keene reviews A&E's Bates Motel Season 4, starring Vera Farmiga, Freddie Highmore, Olivia Cooke, Nestor Carbonell, and Max Thieriot.", "title": "Bates Motel Season 4 Review", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bates-motel-season-4-farmiga-highmore.jpg"}, "creator": "@keeneTV", "site": "@collidernews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.dek": "The new season is not without its glitches (as is always the case with this show), but it remains a ...", "sailthru.tags": "Reviews,Bates Motel,Bates Motel Season 4,Freddie Highmore,Vera Farmiga", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.2", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-04 6:03:31", "NextGEN": "1.3.3", "sailthru.title": "'Bates Motel' Season 4 Review: As Moody, Twisted, and Atmospheric As Ever", "verify-v1": "ag44RccQF3Xr4VqGQnxB+TOx8+rCP4SHaCwwGAtuWzc=", "sailthru.category": "Reviews", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://cdn.collider.com/mediumtile.png", "description": "Allison Keene reviews A&E's Bates Motel Season 4, starring Vera Farmiga, Freddie Highmore, Olivia Cooke, Nestor Carbonell, and Max Thieriot.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://cdn.collider.com/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://cdn.collider.com/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://cdn.collider.com/largetile.png", "fb": {"admins": 724601973, "app_id": 190932086012}, "msvalidate.01": "F97A06145E9767C313B356E7E5B833F3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom", "section": "Reviews", "tag": "Vera Farmiga", "published_time": "2016-03-04T06:03:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-04T06:31:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "Collider", "description": "Allison Keene reviews A&E's Bates Motel Season 4, starring Vera Farmiga, Freddie Highmore, Olivia Cooke, Nestor Carbonell, and Max Thieriot.", "title": "Bates Motel Season 4 Review", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bates-motel-season-4-farmiga-highmore.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-04T06:31:34+00:00", "url": "http://collider.com/bates-motel-season-4-review-as-moody-twisted-and-atmospheric-as-ever/", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "gsAKhpFeAT_1KIdd1PZiPoj3BdAcIipM2VNYcJKuQBU", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bates-motel-season-4-slice.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Very Good \u2014 As everBates Motel Season 4 premieres Monday, March 7th on A&E.\nIn the best way possible, Bates Motel is how it\u2019s always been.\nWe can\u2019t have Norman going full Psycho yet, especially since A&E has already renewed Bates through another season after this.\nNorma and Norman\u2019s relationship remains at the core of Bates Motel, and the show has had varying success in building up other subplots around them.\nIn its fourth season, A&E\u2019s Bates Motel has reached cruising altitude, where there is occasionally some turbulence (mostly with its side-stories about the ever-increasing metro area of White Pine Bay), but for the most part, entrenched fans should be happy with where it\u2019s going."}
