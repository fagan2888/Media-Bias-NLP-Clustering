California and Oregon automatically add people to the state voter rolls when they seek driver's licenses, but the Maryland plan would go well beyond that.\n\nA new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that just over half (51%) of Likely U.S. Voters oppose an automatic voter registration plan for their state like the one proposed in Maryland. Thirty-four percent (34%) favor a voter registration plan in their state that would automatically enroll anyone who applies for government social services or signs up for health insurance through an Obamacare-established exchange. Fifteen percent (15%) are undecided. (To see survey question wording, click here.)\n\n(Want a free daily e-mail update? If it's in the news, it's in our polls).
