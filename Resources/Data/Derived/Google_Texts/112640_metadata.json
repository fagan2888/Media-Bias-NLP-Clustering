Fran Spielman of the Chicago Sun-Times explains:\n\nChicago mayor Rahm Emanuel must be wondering why he bothered to get re-elected. The unfunded pension liability financial crisis that the Windy City has been ducking for years now just got a step closer to what everyone dreads: catastrophic property tax increases. After all, the average Chicago household owes $83,000 (as of 2013) as its share of the city\u2019s debt and unfunded pension costs, and paying that nut off is going to be painful for those residents who do not flee when the fan really gets its excrement coating.\n\nThe decision to drop the bond rating that determines city borrowing costs \u2014 from Baa2 to Ba1 with a negative outlook \u2014 comes just days after the state Supreme Court unanimously overturned state pension reforms and placed Emanuel\u2019s plan to save two of four city employee pension funds in similar jeopardy. The rating applies to $8.1 billion in general-obligation debt, $542 million in outstanding sales tax revenue debt and $268 million in outstanding and authorized motor fuel tax revenue. \u201cBased on the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s May 8 overturning of the statute that governs the State of Illinois\u2019 pensions, we believe that the city\u2019s options for curbing growth in its unfunded pension liabilities have narrowed considerably,\u201d Moody\u2019s wrote. \u201cWhether or not the current statutes that govern Chicago\u2019s pension plans stand, we expect the costs of servicing Chicago\u2019s unfunded liabilities will grow, placing significant strain on the city\u2019s financial operations absent commensurate growth in revenue and/or reductions in other expenditures.\u201d Moody\u2019s noted that the \u201cmagnitude of the budget adjustments\u201d that will be required to solve the combined, $30 billion pension crisis at the city and public schools are \u201csignificant.\u201d Chicago\u2019s tax base is \u201chighly leveraged by the debt and unfunded pension obligations\u201d of the city and overlapping governments, the rating agency said.\n\nChicago has already sold off many assets, such as parking meter revenue, an airport, and other revenue-producing assets. Now, with this downgrade, it will have to pay higher interest rates, and even worse, some complicated deals, rate interest swaps, it just completed are going to unwind:\n\nBudget Director Alex Holt said Tuesday the city plans to forge ahead with that plan, even though \u201cswaps that overlay variable rate debt\u201d could be called in immediately as a result of the double-downgrade. \u201cIf they do, there will be termination payments we\u2019ll need to make. But we were going to take out $200 million in variable rate debt anyway over the course of this year,\u201d Holt said. As for the city\u2019s ability to borrow to fund capital projects, Holt said, \u201cWe think the capital markets will continue to be available to us. We think investors still have confidence in the city.\u201d Moody\u2019s described the penalties in much more dire terms. \u201cImmediate credit challenges include potential draws on liquidity associated with rating triggers embedded in the city\u2019s letters of credit, stand-by bond purchase agreement, lines of credit, direct bank loans and swaps,\u201d Moody\u2019s wrote. \u201cThe current rating actions give the counterparties of these transactions the option to immediately demand up to $2.2 billion in accelerated principal and accrued interest and associated termination fees.\u201d\n\nChicago\u2019s financial crisis reflects decades of financing the Daley political machine with patronage jobs (such as that held by Michelle Obama\u2019s father) handed out to campaign supporters. In order to disguise the cost of these jobs, lavish pensions (to be paid for by future taxpayers) were handed out, and not funded. But the future is now, and Moody\u2019s recognizes it.\n\nIt is going to get very ugly when Chicago starts raising taxes to pay for its debt. Unquestionably, businesses and residents will flee, the tax base will decline, and the burden on the remaining residents and businesses will spiral. This is exactly what happened to Detroit. Pretending it won\u2019t happen to Chicago is dreaming.\n\nHat tip: Peter von Buol, Michael Bargo", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/05/chicago_debt_downgraded_to_junk_status.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2015-05/194571_5_.jpg", "title": "Blog: Chicago debt downgraded to junk status"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcbff\"", "article_summary": "The rating applies to $8.1 billion in general-obligation debt, $542 million in outstanding sales tax revenue debt and $268 million in outstanding and authorized motor fuel tax revenue.\nWe think investors still have confidence in the city.\u201d Moody\u2019s described the penalties in much more dire terms.\nIt is going to get very ugly when Chicago starts raising taxes to pay for its debt.\nFran Spielman of the Chicago Sun-Times explains:Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel must be wondering why he bothered to get re-elected.\nBut we were going to take out $200 million in variable rate debt anyway over the course of this year,\u201d Holt said."}
