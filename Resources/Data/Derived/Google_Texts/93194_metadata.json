She dreamed she was in a gulag across from one of her five children. The child would always ask her, \u201cMama, what were you doing when our country fell to tyranny?\u201d\n\nThose nightmares began after Loudon met Kitty Werthmann, a woman who lived through the Holocaust. She told Loudon many of the things President Obama was doing looked exactly like things she saw happen in her native Austria after Hitler annexed the country.\n\n\u201cEvery moment, every step, every interview, every book I\u2019ve written, everything I\u2019ve done from the day I met Kitty Werthmann has been so that I can answer that question should it ever arise 20 years from now,\u201d Loudon told a CPAC audience during her Saturday afternoon speech in the main ballroom.\n\nLoudon, who is the host of \u201cAmerican Trends with Dr. Gina\u201d and a WND columnist, told everyone in the crowd they should be prepared to answer that question too. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Americans will be sitting in gulags 20 years from now, but she insisted conservatives must keep that vision alive to remind themselves what they are fighting for.\n\nHillary for prosecution, not president! Join the sizzling campaign to put Mrs. Clinton where she really belongs\n\nDespite the talk of her nightmares, Loudon sounded a mostly upbeat tone during her 10-minute speech. She told the crowd she \u201cabsolutely\u201d believes conservatives will be able to unite by the end of this election cycle, despite the rift that has fractured their movement.\n\nShe pointed out conservatives did not want Bob Dole as their presidential nominee in 1996, but they joined with other Republicans and supported him when the general election came around. Conservatives also united around John McCain, Mitt Romney and both George Bushes.\n\n\u201cWe always came together even when it wasn\u2019t our nominee, even when we had fought hard for our conservative candidate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe came back together because that\u2019s who we are, because we know what we\u2019re fighting for.\u201d\n\nLoudon, who coauthored the book \u201cWhat Women Really Want,\u201d rejected the idea certain conservatives have divorced from the larger movement.\n\n\u201cThis is not a divorce among conservatives,\u201d she proclaimed. \u201cThis is our divorce from the establishment who put us in this position, and this is our divorce from the media elite who think they can control our minds.\u201d\n\nStory continues below\n\nRelated column:\n\nGod has coffee with Donald Trump, by Matt Barber\n\nRelated stories:\n\nCarson officially drops out at CPAC\n\nCarson officially drops out at CPAC\n\nCruz plays to fans in CPAC audience\n\nKasich channels Mister Rogers, Barney\n\nDonald Trump bails on speech at CPAC\n\nGohmert reveals real border guards\n\nTalk-radio star attacks Trump \u2013 without mentioning his name\n\n\u2018Da Coach\u2019 Mike Ditka gives Trump love, blasts Hillary\n\nLindsey Graham: Brokered convention not \u2018fair\u2019 to Trump\n\nGeorge Clooney slams Trump as \u2018xenophobic fascist\u2019\n\nTrump \u2018changing\u2019 and \u2018softening\u2019 on visas\n\nRomney says no to presidency but quizzed on Trump\n\nLoudon asked the audience to close their eyes while she read through a long list of things Obama has done, from pushing through Obamacare to telling business owners, \u2018You didn\u2019t build that\u201d to golfing after ISIS beheaded journalist James Foley.\n\n\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d she commanded. \u201cRealize what we\u2019re fighting together.\u201d\n\nBut despite what she termed the \u201ctyranny\u201d of Obama\u2019s eight years, Loudon asserted conservatives are actually winning today.\n\n\u201cDid you ever dream we would emerge from these eight years and their tyranny to be winning so much that somebody who was elected as a Tea Party candidate could then be labeled an establishment candidate?\u201d she asked, seemingly referring to Marco Rubio. \u201cHave we not made some accomplishments here?\n\n\u201cDid you ever dream that the tables would turn so much \u2026 that the number-one issue our candidates were fighting [against] is illegal immigration?
