Over the past few months, the Obama administration has been active in celebrity outreach in their efforts to pitch the Affordable Care Act, particularly to young Americans. For example, a cluster of Hollywood celebrities, including Michael Cera and Kal Penn , gathered at the White House in July to brainstorm ways to help spread the word about the health insurance exchanges that opened up for business on October 1 .

The Obamacare rollout is—to put it generously— not going so great . But at least Scarlett Johansson is still into it.

On Thursday, FoxNews.com published a story citing an unnamed "well-placed Hollywood agent" who claimed that many public-relations teams are advising their celebrity clients to take a break from promoting the ACA, due to problems surrounding Healthcare.gov. The White House did not respond to Mother Jones' request for comment on how they thought the campaign of celebrity Obamacare endorsements has been going lately.

Whether they're making a difference or not, Obamacare has a large contingent of vocal celebrity fans. Here are all the famous actors and pop stars who want you to sign up for Obamacare:
