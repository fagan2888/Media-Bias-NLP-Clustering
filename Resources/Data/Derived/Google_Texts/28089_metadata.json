Here are four smart strategies for handling the uncertainties of the year ahead.\n\nDon\u2019t make a rash move because of fear of the stock market, especially in your retirement account. Many articles have been written about how the positive upswing in the stock market is due to hit a downturn at some point, and quite a few prognosticators have pegged 2016 as that year. It\u2019s tempting to believe those arguments, and they may in fact be right, but there\u2019s one catch, and it\u2019s the one fundamental thing that everyone should keep in mind about investing.\n\nPast performance does not indicate future returns.\n\nIn short, no one knows for sure where the stock market is headed (aside from maybe a few billionaire hedge fund managers or institutional investors who have enough leverage to actually move the entire stock market a little, but they\u2019re not talking). Making a move this year out of fear of what might happen, especially in a long-term investment like a retirement account, is a bad choice. The truth is that the stock market is bound to fluctuate over time and, yes, some years won\u2019t be all that good. However, trying to time when the market will be high or low is a fool\u2019s game, because virtually no one can guess the peaks or the bottoms correctly.\n\nInstead, stick with your game plan. If you\u2019re heavily invested in stocks because you\u2019re far from retirement, stay there.\n\nThe presidential election won\u2019t change your money situation that much, so sit tight. Maybe you\u2019re afraid of the dollar being abandoned on the world stage because of a certain candidate being elected, or perhaps you fear higher taxes or anticipate lower taxes. The mere election of a particular presidential candidate this year might seem like it indicates great change, but the truth is that any change a candidate might cause will take several years to implement by the time the changes push through Congress, get signed into law and the effects begin to be felt. We also can\u2019t necessarily see the long-term ramifications of what a president might be able to do.\n\nSo sit tight with your money, even if a candidate who worries you gets elected to the highest office in the land. You may find that the apocalyptic fears you have are largely unfounded.\n\nTax penalties for the Affordable Care Act are going up sharply, so sign up for health insurance if you haven't already. One of the major provisions of the Affordable Care Act is a tax penalty for those who do not carry health insurance. In the first few years of the rollout, the penalty was pretty small: $95 per adult (or 1 percent of household income) in 2014 and $325 per adult (or 2 percent of household income) in 2015. This year? It\u2019s $695 per adult (or 2.5 percent of household income). There is a cap for a family, but that\u2019s $2,085 this year, up from $975 a year ago.\n\nIn other words, if you were willing to pay the penalty to avoid paying for health insurance in previous years, the amounts have gone up enough this time that you may want to reconsider that strategy. Nearly $700 for a single adult is a stiff penalty, one that would cover most of the cost of an entry-level health insurance policy for a healthy adult. Check out your state\u2019s exchange, and sign up by Jan. 31, so that you\u2019re not dinged with a big penalty.\n\nThe myRA is a new retirement savings option for people getting started and who are risk averse. In November 2015, the government quietly rolled out a new retirement plan run by the Treasury Department. It\u2019s an interesting variant on a Roth IRA for people who don\u2019t have a lot to invest and are afraid of losing that little amount in the stock market.\n\nThe myRA functions like a Roth IRA, meaning that you put money straight from checking or savings into the account, and you won\u2019t have to pay taxes on the money earned in that account provided you leave it alone and don\u2019t withdraw it until age 59 \u00bd. There are no minimum contributions, which is often a requirement for other Roth IRA plans. The money is put into a savings bond, which is a safe guaranteed account \u2013 you will never lose money in here and will always earn a return. However, the rate of return is fairly small \u2013 about 2.31 percent in 2014, which is higher than a savings account but far lower than what the stock market averages. Once your balance reaches $15,000 in that account, you can then convert it into a normal Roth IRA with all the investment options that come with it.\n\nThis is a great option for those who want to get started on retirement savings but can\u2019t afford to contribute much and are wary of risk or of a stock market fall in the near future. While the returns aren\u2019t great, a myRA doesn\u2019t have a minimum contribution level, and the money in the account is about as secure as can be.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that 2016 brings you all the money success that you dream of!", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"150129_FICO\",\"text\":\"Less than 1 percent of consumers are able to achieve a perfect FICO credit score.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Here's how to handle your finances in the year ahead.&nbsp;", "zone": "blogs/my-money/blogentries", "author": "Trent Hamm", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Here's how to handle your finances in the year ahead.&nbsp;", "title": "4 Simple and Smart Money Strategies for 2016", "url": "http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/articles/2016-01-05/4-simple-and-smart-money-strategies-for-2016", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/5e/10/333217844eeb922720f5f0305541/151223-moneyideas-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Here's how to handle your finances in the year ahead.&nbsp;", "card": "summary", "title": "4 Simple and Smart Money Strategies for 2016 - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "money-news", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/3e28d50/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F5e%2F10%2F333217844eeb922720f5f0305541%2Fresizes%2F500%2F151223-moneyideas-stock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "personal finance,money,savings,stock market,IRAs,presidential elections,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,health insurance,New Year,Reboot Finances: Goals [Consumer Advice],Trent Hamm", "published_at": "2016-01-05", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2016-01-05"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Zgokjj", "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Don\u2019t make a rash move because of fear of the stock market, especially in your retirement account.\nThe truth is that the stock market is bound to fluctuate over time and, yes, some years won\u2019t be all that good.\nThe myRA is a new retirement savings option for people getting started and who are risk averse.\nIn short, no one knows for sure where the stock market is headed (aside from maybe a few billionaire hedge fund managers or institutional investors who have enough leverage to actually move the entire stock market a little, but they\u2019re not talking).\nMaking a move this year out of fear of what might happen, especially in a long-term investment like a retirement account, is a bad choice."}
