It is estimated that approximately one and five Californians speaks English \u201cless than well\u201d. About 3 million Medi-Cal patients will need language services over the next five years.\n\nAt an event held on Friday, September 27, Assemblymember Toni Atkins, who has been a champion for AB 1263, asked the Governor to sign the bill that would immediately accept all available funds to for more medical interpreters. AB 1263, sponsored by Speaker John Perez, would draw down funds from the Affordable Care Act to create Communi-Cal, a state-wide interpreters program for Medi-Cal patients.\n\nThe 270 million dollars would help create an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 jobs in the state over the next three years. It would also create a state-wide standard for interpreters working with Medi-Cal patients.\n\nAssemblymember Atkins met with community members, patients and medical interpreters. As a way to honor people who have been denied access to an interpreter, she listened to their stories.\n\nOne of the honored patients were Minh and Hue Nguyen. Minh and Hue have been married for over twenty years.\n\nMrs. Nguyen says, \u201cI take care of him and he takes care of me.\u201d Minh and Hue both speak Vietnamese, and understand and speak English less than well. In 2012, Minh endured two consequential procedures to correct an initial incorrect surgery at Sharp Memorial Hospital. \u201cNot until after the 2nd procedure, were we given an interpreter.\n\nThe interpreter told me to call a priest to read Minh his last rights\u2026The interpreter gave us her card to use if we needed more help.\u201d Minh recovered at the hospital, all the while Hue at his side. \u201cHe would not eat. No one at the facility spoke Vietnamese, so I was the only one who cared for him.\u201d\n\nHue recalls an instance at Sharp when one of Minh\u2019s surgical openings began to leak a yellow discharge. \u201cI immediately called the interpreter who had given us her card and I could not get an answer.\u201d Hue was unsure of how serious the discharge was until her husband started shaking. Hue ran to the receptionist\u2019s desk yelling the only English word she knew \u201cHelp!\u201d The receptionist told Hue to call the interpreter. The interpreter arrived an hour later. Minh\u2019s dressing and state was not stabilized until five days after the occurrence.\n\nAssemblymember Atkins thanked her colleagues for helping get AB1263 to Governor Brown\u2019s desk but cautioned the work is not done. He has until October 13, 2013 to sign it.\n\nAshley Mates works for Interpreting for California, a statewide campaign involving interpreters, communities, and providers speaking up for real language access in health care.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://sandiegofreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/interpreting.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "About 3 million Medi-Cal patients will need language services over the next five years.\nAssemblymember Atkins met with community members, patients and medical interpreters.\nAB 1263, sponsored by Speaker John Perez, would draw down funds from the Affordable Care Act to create Communi-Cal, a state-wide interpreters program for Medi-Cal patients.\nIt would also create a state-wide standard for interpreters working with Medi-Cal patients.\nAt an event held on Friday, September 27, Assemblymember Toni Atkins, who has been a champion for AB 1263, asked the Governor to sign the bill that would immediately accept all available funds to for more medical interpreters."}
