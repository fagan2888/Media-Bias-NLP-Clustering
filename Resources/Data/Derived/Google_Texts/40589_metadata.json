They do most of their running on side-by-side treadmills in the basement of their Lakewood home before dawn, watching TV.\n\nThey love to watch Jimmy Fallon. Sometimes she makes him watch Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the bad morning for me,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s working for them, though. She won the Rock \u201cN\u2019 Roll Denver Marathon women\u2019s title Sunday in 2 hours, 58 minutes, 22 seconds. He finished seventh among the men in 2:47:05.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first time ever breaking three hours,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a goal of mine forever, and I can\u2019t believe I did it. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nThey do their weekend long runs outside, but they do the rest of their running on the treadmills before work, starting at 5:30 a.m. After running for 60-90 minutes they bike to work downtown.\n\nBrian has always liked running on the treadmill, a contraption some runners call the \u201cDreadmill\u201d when they are forced to run indoors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked it,\u201d he said. \u201cI got her into it. It\u2019s always just been easier to me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Treadmills help motivate Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll Marathon winner Monica Folts", "title": "Treadmills help motivate Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll Marathon winner Monica Folts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/19/treadmills-help-motivate-rock-n-roll-marathon-winner-monica-folts/", "image": {"width": 393, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141019__cd20ROCKNROLL_HHR_0672p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141019__cd20ROCKNROLL_HHR_0672p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-19T15:16:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T13:28:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc75c\"", "article_summary": "Brian has always liked running on the treadmill, a contraption some runners call the \u201cDreadmill\u201d when they are forced to run indoors.\nShe won the Rock \u201cN\u2019 Roll Denver Marathon women\u2019s title Sunday in 2 hours, 58 minutes, 22 seconds.\nMonica Folts and her husband, Brian Folts, have an unusual way of training for marathons, triathlons and even the Pikes Peak Ascent.\nThey do most of their running on side-by-side treadmills in the basement of their Lakewood home before dawn, watching TV.\nIt\u2019s amazing.\u201dThey do their weekend long runs outside, but they do the rest of their running on the treadmills before work, starting at 5:30 a.m. After running for 60-90 minutes they bike to work downtown."}
