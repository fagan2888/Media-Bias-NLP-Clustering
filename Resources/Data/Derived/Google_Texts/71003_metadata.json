The average employer premium for an individual is $490, according to the 2013 Kaiser Employer Benefits Survey.\n\nThe Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, more commonly known as COBRA, provides continuation of group health coverage to the recently unemployed and their families for a limited amount of time-typically 18 months.\n\nWith COBRA, the former employee has to pay the entire premium plus an administration fee of up to 2%. People with pre-existing conditions can usually keep the same doctors and hospitals that they\u2019ve been working with, but should expect to pay more than when they were employed since they no longer have an employer picking up part of the costs.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnder the ACA, insurers can\u2019t deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, which has made finding coverage for these people more affordable. What\u2019s more, Carrie McLean, director of customer care at eHealth.com, says the 10 essential health benefits that every policy has to include under the law makes individual plans more comparable to employer-sponsored coverage.\n\n\u201cMany people may prefer to stick with the health insurance plan they already know, and to maintain access to their preferred doctors,\u201d says McLean. \u201cMany people who have had insurance through their employer are not even familiar with individual health insurance and therefore are unaware of the rich options that exist in that market.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mahoney, people should take subsidies into account when weighing whether to pay for their existing insurance through COBRA or shop the exchanges. Subsidies are offered on plans on the exchanges for anyone making up to 400% of the federal poverty level. According to Kaiser Family Foundation, for an individual this tops out at around $45,000 per year, and for a family of four, this cuts off at around $94,000 per year.\n\nWhile the monthly premium is an important factor to weigh picking a health plan\u2014especially for the jobless\u2014it shouldn\u2019t be the only factor.\n\n\u201cIf you have a pre-existing medical condition, finding a plan you can afford with the doctors, hospitals and treatment facilities in network is really critical,\u201d says Richard Mann, senior vice president at Plansource, which helps employees review insurance plans. \u201cOftentimes, it\u2019s not the easiest thing to determine.\u201d\n\nIf you do decided to buy insurance on the individual market instead of going with COBRA, McLean recommends comparing the costs of the plan (premium, deductible and co-insurance), access to care and the quality of care.\n\nFor instance, if a currently-used doctor isn\u2019t in network, make sure a plan offers other top-accredited doctors to choose from. Mahoney recommends identifying any potential specialized care (like having a baby) to make sure a plan offers coverage. After all, paying out of pocket for specialists will get expensive, but paying for services that are never is a money drainer.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to play a more active role, but you\u2019ll have more choices,\u201d says Mahoney. \u201cIf electing COBRA you are really just checking a box. When buying health insurance it forces you to consider your needs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS,/FOX BUSINESS/CAREER,/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 06:21:14 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/06/17/cobra-vs-aca-exchanges-how-to-find-best-coverage-when-unemployed.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/06/17/cobra-vs-aca-exchanges-how-to-find-best-coverage-when-unemployed/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452252076031.jpg?ve=1", "description": "Up until recently, COBRA was the main health insurance provider for the newly-unemployed needing medical insurance.
