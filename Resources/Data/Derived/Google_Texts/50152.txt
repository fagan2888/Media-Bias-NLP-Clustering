Jimmy Kimmel mocked the Republican establishment and #NeverTrump movement on Wednesday with a fake attack ad, which he claimed was made by 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

“Mitt Romney in particular has his magic underwear in a bunch when it comes to Donald Trump,” Kimmel said. “He’s asking voters to stop what he calls ‘Trumpism’ and support Ted Cruz.”

Kimmel played his mock ad, featuring a Romney impersonator who compared the two current GOP front-runners.

“Republicans need to stand up to ‘Trumpism’ by supporting Ted Cruz,” the ad said. “The differences are clear: Donald Trump wants to build a wall and deport 11 million immigrants, so does Ted Cruz.”

The ad pointed out that Trump and Cruz hold similar positions on many issues, including tax cuts, abortion, gun control, and Obamacare — and they’re both universally disliked.

The ad did mention one major difference between the two candidates; Ted Cruz said he wanted to attack terrorists until “the sand glowed in the dark,” but Trump has not yet made his position clear on whether or not he wants the sand to glow.
