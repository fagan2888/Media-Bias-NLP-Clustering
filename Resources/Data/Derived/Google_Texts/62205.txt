"You know, I would have," Pryor responded. "Of course, I would want to see some changes back then, but I think on something like this, it's big, it's complicated, it's difficult. If you get 80 percent of this right, you've really done something. We probably did get 80 percent of it right." Watch the video below:

"A lot of our premiums have really shot up, those of us who have had to pay these premiums," said the KARK host. "Knowing now what you know now, would you have voted for this back then?"

Pryor: I Still Would Have Voted For Obamacare

Arkansas senator Mark Pryor, a Democrat up for reelection this year, told local station KARK-TV he would have still voted for Obamacare despite all the law's problems. A lot of our premiums have really shot up, those of us who have had to pay these premiums, said the KARK host. Knowing now what you know now, would you have voted for this back then? You know, I would have, Pryor responded. Of course, I would want to see some changes back then, but I think on something like this, it's big, it's complicated, it's difficult. If you get 80 percent of this right, you've really done something. We probably did get 80 percent of it right. Watch the video below: Pryor is facing Republican congressman Tom Cotton in what is considered one of the hottest Senate races of 2014. According to the Real Clear Politics poll average, Cotton leads Pryor by three points.
