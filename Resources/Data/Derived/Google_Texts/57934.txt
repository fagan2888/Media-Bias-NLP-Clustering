Congressional lawmakers have moved Ronald Reagan’s name a step closer to becoming the new dub for a section of Frenchman Mountain, located outside of Las Vegas.

House Natural Resource Committee members voted yes on a proposal from Rep. Joe Heck to rename one part of the hill “Mount Reagan,” the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Predictions are that the bill will slide through the House, but stall in the Senate under Majority Leader Harry Reid’s influence, the blog Newser reported.

Some Democrats on the committee took opportunity to pot shot the former Republican president, saying that it would make more sense to name Yucca Mountain after him. In 1987, Reagan signed into the law that the site would be a nuclear waste installation.

“[That] internationally known [site] is the best way he could be honored and commemorated by the people of Nevada,” said Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.
