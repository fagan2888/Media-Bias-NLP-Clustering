He said, \"We\u2019ve seen a pattern of children with disabilities not being referred for evaluation, primarily kids whose attendance, behavior and grades are of concern.\"\n\nFederal and state law require schools to identify and evaluate students who may need special education.\n\nColon described one student who struggled from first grade on. After sixth grade, which he failed the first time around, he was promoted directly to high school, where he failed every course during his freshman year, \"..and was repeating his ninth grade year when we became involved,\" Colon said. \"So he\u2019s one clear example of many missed opportunities by the district to refer the child, who was determined to be eligible for special education services.\u201d\n\nNow that there\u2019s been a determination of a pattern of violations, Bridgeport education officials must take corrective action for each of the six students named in the complaint. They must also create procedures across the district to identify and respond to kids who may be eligible for special education services.\n\nThis comes as Bridgeport is preparing for a new interim superintendent to lead the school district once Paul Vallas departs.\n\nEarlier this month, Hamden Schools Superintendent Fran Rabinowitz was unanimously approved for the post by Bridgeport\u2019s Board of Education. Part of her job will be to help the district find a permanent school chief. Rabinowitz has led Hamden\u2019s schools since 2007. Before that, she worked as an Associate Commissioner for the State Department of Education.\n\nAfter a turbulent time in Bridgeport, Paul Vallas will become Illinois Governor Pat Quinn\u2019s running mate in this year\u2019s gubernatorial election.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Education", "description": "The State Department of Education has determined that Bridgeport Public Schools have violated their obligation to students under the Individuals with", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/bridgeport-failed-identify-students-need-special-education", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201401/Classroom_chairs.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The State Department of Education has determined that Bridgeport Public Schools have violated their obligation to students under the Individuals with", "title": "Bridgeport Failed to Identify Students in Need of Special Education"}, "story_id": 267008287, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Diane Orson", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Bridgeport Failed to Identify Students in Need of Special Education"}, "nid": 16023, "datePublished": "2014-01-27", "keywords": "schools, Fairfield Region, special education, disabilities, The Daily", "wordCount": 338, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Federal and state law require schools to identify and evaluate students who may need special education.\nEdwin Colon of the Center for Children\u2019s Advocacy was one of the attorneys who filed a complaint on behalf of six Bridgeport students.\nBridgeport education officials must take corrective action for each of the six students named in the complaint.\nThey must also create procedures across the district to identify and respond to kids who may be eligible for special education services.\nThe State Department of Education has determined that Bridgeport Public Schools have violated their obligation to students under the Individuals with Disabilities Act."}
