On Wednesday, he will discuss balancing the right to free speech with what others may consider hate speech.\n\n\u201cThe attack on Charlie Hebdo symbolically said \u2018We are not going to let you speak freely and say things that are negative,\u2019\u201d Suarez said. \u201cI think we should go out of our way not to offend anyone, but on the other hand, I don\u2019t think we should welcome an outside element telling us and pushing us to revise our basic freedoms.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the presentations are:\n\n\u2014 \u201cGender and Sexual Diversity: Cultural and Legal Issues regarding Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and the Transgender Community.\u201d\n\nSpeaking will be Amara Kirby, Esq., Deputy Public Defender for the office of the Ventura County Public Defender.\n\nKirby has a decade of experience with Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Questioning (LGBTQ) legal and social concerns.
