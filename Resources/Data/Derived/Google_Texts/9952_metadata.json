A tape of the 911 call has been released, CBS News reports, calling the recording \"chilling.\"\n\nThe caller said, \"First get your hospitals up. The DC sniper is here in your city ... Get all your police ready and captivate. It's a cold one and you better win. I have a DC sniper that's driving into your city right now. One part methyl chloride three parts nitrate,\" according to Weehawken police.\n\nCBS says the caller could also have been saying, \"menthol chloride, three parts titrate,\" but the former is a nonexistent chemical and \"titrate\" is a verb, not a noun, meaning to measure the quantity of one chemical in a solution by adding another chemical to the point where a reaction occurs.\n\nThe phoned-in threat triggered a massive police response near tunnel on Tuesday, while two separate incidents then prompted notification of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, officials said.\n\nDuring the chaos, the tunnel was shut while Weehawken and Port Authority police searched for the caller but could not locate him.\n\nDuring the drama, some bus passengers bound for Hoboken had to get off their buses and walk the rest of the way, according to officials.\n\nAt 11:50 p.m. on Tuesday, Wallace, was arrested at 47th Street and 11th Avenue in Manhattan by PAPD detectives, Port Authority Police spokesman Joe Pentangelo told The Jersey Journal. Wallace was charged with making a terroristic threat and creating false public alarm, he said. He made his first court appearance Thursday.\n\nGo to NJ.com/Hudson to hear the 911 call.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Summer Dawn Hortillosa | The Jersey Journal", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "weehawken", "title": "Hear 'chilling' 911 call that triggered massive police response at Lincoln Tunnel", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Hear \\u0027chilling\\u0027 911 call that triggered massive police response at Lincoln Tunnel\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/06/hear_chilling_911_call_that_tr.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/06/15176808-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13191855\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-14T07:01:24Z\", \"author\": \"Summer Dawn Hortillosa | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"weehawken\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@njdotcom", "image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/06/15176808-small.jpg", "description": "You can now listen to a recording of the 911 call made by the suspect in the Lincoln Tunnel shooting scare on Tuesday.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@SummerHort"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, June 14, 2014,  3:01 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/06/15176808-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"summerhortillosa\", \"author_nickname\": \"Summer Dawn Hortillosa | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"9279113\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "You can now listen to a recording of the 911 call made by the suspect in the Lincoln Tunnel shooting scare on Tuesday.", "title": "Hear 'chilling' 911 call that triggered massive police response at Lincoln Tunnel", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/06/hear_chilling_911_call_that_tr.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, June 14, 2014,  3:01 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "You can now listen to a recording of the 911 call made by the suspect in the Lincoln Tunnel shooting scare on Tuesday."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddac1\"", "article_summary": "Donald Wallace, 39, allegedly made a hoax phone call to 911 saying a sniper was near the tunnel in Weehawken.\nYou can now listen to a recording of the 911 call made by the suspect in the Lincoln Tunnel shooting scare on Tuesday.\nThe phoned-in threat triggered a massive police response near tunnel on Tuesday, while two separate incidents then prompted notification of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, officials said.\nA tape of the 911 call has been released, CBS News reports, calling the recording \"chilling.\"\nDuring the chaos, the tunnel was shut while Weehawken and Port Authority police searched for the caller but could not locate him."}
