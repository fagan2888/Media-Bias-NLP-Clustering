It also raises the bar for Obama's new initiative, which he plans to make a hallmark of his eventual retirement.\n\nThat $200 million initiative, My Brother\u2019s Keeper, is aimed at \u2018creating opportunity for boys and young men of color.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe plain fact is, there are some Americans who in the aggregate are consistently doing worse in our society,\u201d Obama said during the announcement. \u201cGroups that have had the odds stacked against them in unique way[s] that require unique solutions, groups who have seen fewer opportunities that have spanned generations. And by almost every measure, the group that is facing some of the most severe challenges in the 21st century, in this country, are boys and young men of color.\u201d\n\nThe initiative clearly resonates with the African American community. The poll found that 84 percent of black voters think it will likely improve life for this group, but according to Rasmussen, \u201conly 34 percent of whites and 43 percent of other minority voters agree.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think? Will Obama\u2019s initiative deliver on its promise or is it just more hope and change?", "article_metadata": {"description": "hope and change..05/24/2016 10:21:39AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "hope and change.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Poll Finds Only 11% of Blacks Think Life for Young African Americans Has Improved Under Obama", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/03/05/poll-just-11-of-blacks-say-life-under-obama-is-better-for-young-africanamericans-n1804637", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/58/a3edcb79-506f-4a10-86e6-3bd646f788fa.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "hope and change.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Poll Finds Only 11% of Blacks Think Life for Young African Americans Has Improved Under Obama", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/03/05/poll-just-11-of-blacks-say-life-under-obama-is-better-for-young-africanamericans-n1804637", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/58/a3edcb79-506f-4a10-86e6-3bd646f788fa.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Poll Finds Only 11% of Blacks Think Life for Young African Americans Has Improved Under Obama, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40d8\"", "article_summary": "Will Obama\u2019s initiative deliver on its promise or is it just more hope and change?\nFive years into Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, only 11 percent of black voters say life has gotten better for black youths, a recent Rasmussen poll found, while 68 percent think things are about the same.\nIt also raises the bar for Obama's new initiative, which he plans to make a hallmark of his eventual retirement.\nThe poll found that 84 percent of black voters think it will likely improve life for this group, but according to Rasmussen, \u201conly 34 percent of whites and 43 percent of other minority voters agree.\u201dWhat do you think?\nThe poll puts the spotlight on dissatisfaction among some in the African American community that the nation\u2019s first black president hasn\u2019t focused enough on issues important to them."}
