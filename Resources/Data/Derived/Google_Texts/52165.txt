Schooners has turned their beach into a winter wonderland, for their annual "Last Locals Holiday Party and Toy Drive".

Schooners has been hosting this event for more than two decades but this is the 2nd time they moved it to the beach.

They provided live entertainment, bonfires, s'mores, and even a guest appearance by Santa Claus.

Guests are asked to bring an unwrapped toy and donations will benefit a local organization.

"One of the reasons we do this is to collect toys for the Children's Home Society and we had a very good turnout last night," explained Michael Whitmer, the General Manager of Schooners. "There's a giant over sized box that's gift wrapped like a package and you can drop your toys in on the way in. We had a very good response on that yesterday and I think we will again today."

The party wrapped up Saturday night.
