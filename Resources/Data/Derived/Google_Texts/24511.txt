Some young girls in the community had the chance to get dressed up for an exciting occasion Saturday evening.

The Meridian Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority held it's annual Debutante Ball, at Kahlmus Auditorium on the campus of Mississippi State in Meridian. 18 young women and their escorts participated in the ball. The participants are involved in several workshops leading up to the ball which organizers say is highly important.

"It's basically kind of grooming our ladies; junior and senior high school students," Meridian Alumnae Chapter President Gwendolyn Graham. "We are trying to help prepare them for that next step in life. We want them to be productive citizens in our communities that we serve. We're just trying to give them that nudge and encouragement they need to go forward."

The sorority also gave away over $5,000 in scholarships Saturday.
