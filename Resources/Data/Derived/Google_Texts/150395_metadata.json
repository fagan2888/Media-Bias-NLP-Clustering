In the most stunning example, exports of sea fish from the landlocked nation have doubled during the last three months \u2014 a sure sign that something curious is afoot.\n\nFood exports to Russia have been a major hard currency-earner for cash-strapped Belarus, worth $5.7 billion in 2013. This year\u2019s figures aren\u2019t available yet, but a sharp rise in imports of food from Europe signaled that the country, which is sandwiched between Russia and EU members Poland and Lithuania, quickly took advantage of Moscow\u2019s ban.\n\n\u201cLukashenko hopes to turn Belarus into a bridge between the East and the West, for which both sides will have to pay,\u201d said Alexander Klaskovsky, an independent Minsk-based analyst. \u201cLukashenko loves a proverb: A friendly calf sucks two mothers.\u201d\n\nWith Lukashenko friendly with the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia, Belarus has been able to serve as neutral ground for peace talks over the situation in Ukraine. Both Russia and the West would like Belarus to continue playing host to the negotiations.\n\nWith Russian President Vladimir Putin now in the West\u2019s bad books, Lukashenko is no longer a prime target of criticism despite his continuing crackdown on dissent and independent media. \u201cBelarus is undergoing a transformation from a pariah to a respectable player,\u201d Klaskovsky said.\n\nLukashenko is looking to take advantage of that. His government is currently in talks with the International Monetary Fund on a prospective new loan, and Lukashenko\u2019s economics minister recently attended a London conference intended to lure foreign investors.\n\n\u201cLukashenko realizes that the Kremlin subsidies will dwindle significantly because of Russia\u2019s economic downturn, so he\u2019s looking for other financial sources,\u201d said Yaroslav Romanchuk, the head of Mises Research Center in Minsk.\n\nThe Belarusian leader, who has been in power for two decades, is preparing to seek re-election in a vote set for next November, and the country desperately needs cash. Next year, Belarus has to pay $4 billion in foreign debts, a significant amount for a nation that only has $5.8 billion in hard currency reserves.\n\n\u201cLukashenko will make an imitation of democracy like he did every time when he badly needed cash,\u201d said Stanislav Shushkevich, Belarus\u2019 first post-Soviet leader turned opposition politician. \u201cThe West has quite a short memory.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Belarus enjoys bonanza amid Russia-West tensions", "title": "Belarus enjoys bonanza amid Russia-West tensions", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Belarus enjoys bonanza amid Russia-West tensions", "title": "Belarus enjoys bonanza amid Russia-West tensions", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/22/belarus_enjoys_bonanza_amid_russia_west_tensions/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/ukraine.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Belarus enjoys bonanza amid Russia-West tensions", "title": "Belarus enjoys bonanza amid Russia-West tensions", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/ukraine.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Yuras Karmanau", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Food exports to Russia have been a major hard currency-earner for cash-strapped Belarus, worth $5.7 billion in 2013.\nBoth Russia and the West would like Belarus to continue playing host to the negotiations.\n\u201cLukashenko will make an imitation of democracy like he did every time when he badly needed cash,\u201d said Stanislav Shushkevich, Belarus\u2019 first post-Soviet leader turned opposition politician.\nNext year, Belarus has to pay $4 billion in foreign debts, a significant amount for a nation that only has $5.8 billion in hard currency reserves.\n\u201cLukashenko loves a proverb: A friendly calf sucks two mothers.\u201dWith Lukashenko friendly with the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia, Belarus has been able to serve as neutral ground for peace talks over the situation in Ukraine."}
