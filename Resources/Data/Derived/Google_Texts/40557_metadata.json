No, not for Santa, who'll be long gone \u2014 for the full moon, which peaks at 6:11 a.m. ET, according to NASA. The last time there was a full moon Christmas Day was 1977, and it won't happen again until 2034. December's full moon is called the \"cold moon\" because, appropriately enough, \"it is the month when the winter cold fastens its grip and the nights become long and dark,\" according to the Farmer's Almanac.\n\nFull moon this Christmas is very rare.

Go west, my friend\n\nDreaming of a white Christmas? Your odds are good in Fairbanks, Alaska, which has seen snow on the ground every Christmas since weather record keeping began. Because of the warming effects of the strong El Ni\u00f1o climate pattern, many places that often have a good chance of seeing snow Christmas Day will miss out this year. Some cities in the central and eastern USA could see record high temperatures on Christmas Day. Despite Bing Crosby's White Christmas wishes (and ours), only 25% to 30% of the 48 contiguous states is typically snow-covered by Christmas, according to AccuWeather. Check the average chances for your city here.\n\nAmerica's new Christmas pastime: Shopping\n\nBlame the Internet. Christmas Day is typically the slowest retail sales day of the holiday season, but its popularity is growing. Why? Because of Web shoppers, especially those on their phones. If you're among those doing some shopping Friday, you won't be alone. This year, Christmas is expected to ring in $600 million in online sales, up from $550 million last year, according to Adobe Marketing Cloud.\n\nJust as Black Friday sales have infiltrated Thanksgiving, retailers are starting to push heavy discounts and clearance items on Christmas Day, targeting a surge in online and mobile shoppers.
