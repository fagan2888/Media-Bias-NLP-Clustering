MIAMI (AP) — A few dozen pieces of personal correspondence by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis have sold at a Florida auction along with photographs of the former first lady for $28,400 overall.

The items up for bidding Saturday at Palm Beach Modern Auctions included Onassis’ handwritten notes to interior designer Richard Keith Langham and Bill Hamilton, then the design director at Carolina Herrera. Onassis corresponded with both men about clothes and furnishings she was buying from the mid-1980s until her death in 1994.

The auction house says 1,100 people offered bids by phone, online and in person.

A book about Onassis’s restoration of the White House, which she signed for Langham, fetched the highest bid. It sold for $4,575. A pair of photographs of Onassis by society photographer Bob Davidoff sold for $2,200.
