After praising Cisneros as a standard-bearer for Latino officials, Van de Putte also had kind words for Cruz.\n\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d she said of Cruz when asked about the presidential race, though she acknowledged his views \u201care just exceedingly different. Such a gentleman in every encounter we had, even if we were opposite in the courtroom.\u201d\n\nVan de Putte was quick to point out one of those conflicts: a redistricting plan that she and other Texas Democrats fought strongly in 2003. The case eventually went to the Supreme Court, where Cruz as Texas solicitor general helped score a 5-4 win largely in favor of the plan.\n\n\u201cOh my God, he kicked our butt on that one,\u201d she said. But \u201che was probably one of the best constitutional lawyers that the state has had.\u201d\n\nVan de Putte has not always spoken positively of Cruz. Before running for lieutenant governor, she criticized Cruz for talking for hours on the Senate floor against the Affordable Care Act and triggering a federal government shutdown.\n\n\u201cSenator Cruz filibustered against people having health care,\u201d Van de Putte said at the time. She described Cruz as a \u201cWendy wannabe,\u201d referencing former state senator Wendy Davis, who filibustered a 2013 abortion restrictions bill that is being debated by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAfter losing the lieutenant gubernatorial race to Dan Patrick, Van de Putte announced her resignation from the state Senate in 2014 to launch an ultimately unsuccessful run for San Antonio mayor. She has not sought public office since but endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president last year.\n\nAfter complimenting Cruz, Van de Putte stressed that Hispanic Americans are diverse politically despite their common ethnicity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re strong Democrats, we\u2019re very strong Republicans. Some are very liberal, some are very conservative,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are from many different nationalities, but our commonality is the Spanish language. It\u2019s the belief that education can empower our families.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wMy9sZXRpY2lhLXZhbi1kZS1wdXR0ZS1oYXMtc29tZS1wcmFpc2UtZm9yLXRlZC1jcnV6LXRvLWEtcG9pbnQuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Elizabeth Koh", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Ted Cruz may have few friends in Washington, but he got a home state boost last night from an unlikely source.
