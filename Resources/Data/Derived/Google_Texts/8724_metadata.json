The last time the rate climbed that high was in 1940, when 36.2 percent of young women resided with family.\n\nRelated: More Millennials Are Living with Their Parents\n\nWhile the steep rate is a blast from the past, the reasons behind the shift are not.\n\nCollege students overall are much more likely to be living with family than young adults who aren\u2019t in school, and women are five times as likely to be pursuing a degree today than in 1940. More than a quarter of women ages 18 to 34 (27 percent) were enrolled in college in 2014.\n\nWomen are also remaining in the nest because they\u2019re pushing off marriage. In 2013, only 30 percent of young women were married, compared with 62 percent of young women in 1940. The average woman now gets married for the first time at age 27, according to Census data cited by Pew \u2014 6.5 years later than the average age in 1940.\n\nRelated: Are Boomerang Kids Overstaying Their Welcome?\n\nOther possible economic reasons include higher housing costs, rising student debt, wage stagnation and economic uncertainty \u2014 but unemployment should no longer be a factor.\n\n\u201cThe job market has gotten significantly better (for this group),\u201d Richard Fry, a senior economist at Pew, told the Associated Press. \u201cUnemployment has come down, more have jobs and some are even getting paid a bit more.\u201d\n\nThe trend is also similar among young men. The research found that 42.8 percent of young men are living at home, a greater percentage than their female peers but not one that surpasses the 1940 level of 47.5 percent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "You\u2019ve heard that the Great Recession forced many young Americans to put off leaving t", "title": "21st Century Regression: Record Share of Young Women Live with Mom and Dad", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/11/21st-Century-Regression-Record-Share-Young-Women-Live-Mom-and-Dad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02242014_Telecommuting_Working_From_Home.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/11/21st-Century-Regression-Record-Share-Young-Women-Live-Mom-and-Dad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02242014_Telecommuting_Working_From_Home.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@milliedent"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "You\u2019ve heard that the Great Recession forced many young Americans to put off leaving t", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In 2013, only 30 percent of young women were married, compared with 62 percent of young women in 1940.\nThe last time the rate climbed that high was in 1940, when 36.2 percent of young women resided with family.\nPew found that 36.4 percent of women aged 18 to 34 were living with family in 2014.\n\u201cUnemployment has come down, more have jobs and some are even getting paid a bit more.\u201dThe trend is also similar among young men.\nRelated: More Millennials Are Living with Their ParentsWhile the steep rate is a blast from the past, the reasons behind the shift are not."}
