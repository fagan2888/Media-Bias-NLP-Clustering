She worsened over the past 24 hours and vets decided they had to euthanize her, according to the zoo in Escondido.\n\n\"Nola was an iconic animal, not only at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, but worldwide,\" the park statement said.\n\nThe remaining three northern white rhinos, all elderly, are in a closely guarded preserve in Kenya.\n\nThe subspecies has been decimated by poachers, who kill the rhinos for their horns. The horns are in high demand in parts of Asia where some people claim they have medicinal properties for treating everything from hangovers to cancer.\n\nIn an effort to preserve the species, the San Diego zoo took possession earlier this month of six female southern white rhinos from South Africa.\n\nZoo researchers are working on developing northern white rhino embryos to be implanted in the six new arrivals, who will serve as surrogate mothers.\n\nResearchers have said they hope a northern white rhino calf could be born from a San Diego surrogate mother within 10 to 15 years.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Los Angeles Times, http://www.latimes.com/", "article_metadata": {"zone": "us/articles", "keyword": "Associated Press", "title": "Endangered white rhino dies at San Diego-area zoo", "og": {"url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2015/11/22/endangered-white-rhino-dies-at-san-diego-zoo", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "type": "article", "description": "SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 One of the last northern white rhinos in the world has died in San Diego.", "title": "Nola the endangered white rhino euthanized at San Diego-area zoo after series of illnesses"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 One of the last northern white rhinos in the world has died in San Diego.", "card": "summary", "title": "Endangered white rhino dies at San Diego-area zoo"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Nov. 22, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Collections: Top News,Collections: US,Associated Press", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 One of the last northern white rhinos in the world has died in San Diego."}, "article_summary": "SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 One of only four northern white rhinos believed left in the world died Sunday at San Diego Zoo Safari Park.\nResearchers have said they hope a northern white rhino calf could be born from a San Diego surrogate mother within 10 to 15 years.\n\"Nola was an iconic animal, not only at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, but worldwide,\" the park statement said.\nIn an effort to preserve the species, the San Diego zoo took possession earlier this month of six female southern white rhinos from South Africa.\nThe remaining three northern white rhinos, all elderly, are in a closely guarded preserve in Kenya."}
