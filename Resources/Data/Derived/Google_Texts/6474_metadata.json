Cameron Arthur and more than a dozen crew members sparked a series of fires with more than one thousand gallons of jet fuel. The Saturday morning blazes at Marine Corps Miramar Air Station sent plumes of black smoke into the air visible from surrounding communities.\n\nBut on the ground, Arthur said things were under control \u2014 the fuel fires were part of monthly training exercises to keep Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting unit members comfortable in their heavy gear.\n\nThe team practiced in a large concrete pit far from brush, Arthur said.\n\n\"What we're doing is basically using water to push the fuel \u2014 'cause the fuel sits on top of the water \u2014 and we're pushing the fuel along the fuselage of the aircraft to the back of the pit and then we're working together as a team to put that out,\" he said.\n\nThe unit rotated positions during the series of fuel fires to become familiar with each role. According to Arthur, flames reached 25 to 30 feet.\n\nThe crew burned a total of 1,200 gallons of jet fuel during the exercise, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Routine firefighting training on the ground at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar sent smoke in the air that was visible from nearby neighborhoods.", "author": "Tarryn Mento", "og": {"site_name": "KPBS Public Media", "description": "Routine firefighting training on the ground at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar sent smoke in the air that was visible from nearby neighborhoods.", "title": "Mirarmar Air Station Firefighters Train Against Jet Fuel Flames", "url": "http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/oct/19/mirarmar-air-station-firefighters-train-against-je/", "image": "https://kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/news/tease/2013/10/19/miramar-firetraining.jpg", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 0, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "KPBS", "fb": {"app_id": 131056773055}, "apiKpbs": "131919 %##% Mirarmar Air Station Firefighters Train Against Jet Fuel Flames", "keywords": "Military, Installations, MCAS Miramar, Public Safety, Fire Prevention", "verify-v1": "zHHWZpwcl/kpXf/ZbbmtRN41TWDeCfjQil8LGROx/LA=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bf9\"", "article_summary": "The crew burned a total of 1,200 gallons of jet fuel during the exercise, he said.\nCameron Arthur and more than a dozen crew members sparked a series of fires with more than one thousand gallons of jet fuel.\nThe unit rotated positions during the series of fuel fires to become familiar with each role.\nThe Saturday morning blazes at Marine Corps Miramar Air Station sent plumes of black smoke into the air visible from surrounding communities.\nBut on the ground, Arthur said things were under control \u2014 the fuel fires were part of monthly training exercises to keep Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting unit members comfortable in their heavy gear."}
