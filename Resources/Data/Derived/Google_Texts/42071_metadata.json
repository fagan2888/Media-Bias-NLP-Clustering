The Board further scheduled a joint conference call \u201cto discuss the matter of mandatory notices as they pertain to a related proceeding.\u201d\n\nPatent Owner had filed two papers titled \u201cPatent Owner\u2019s Supplemental Mandatory Notice Pursuant to 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.8.\u201d Filed with the first was a \u201ccopy\u201d of a public version of a \u201cNotice Regarding Initial Determination on Violation of Section 337 and Recommended Determination on Remedy and Bonding\u201d issued by an administrative judge in a related ITC proceeding. And filed with the second was a \u201cfull copy\u201d of the Initial Determination. In response, Petitioner filed its own \u201cPetitioner\u2019s Supplemental Mandatory Notice Pursuant to 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.8 . . . identifying and discussing the Initial Determination.\u201d\n\nThe Board found that Patent Owner \u201cmisused the filing of a Mandatory Notice under 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.8(b)(2) with regard to related matters by specifically highlighting and discussing the substantive contents of Judge Essex\u2019s Initial Determination,\u201d which triggered \u201cPetitioner to engage in the same.\u201d The Board explained:\n\nAn appropriate notice simply would have noted that Judge Essex had issued an Initial Determination in the related proceeding involving U.S. Patent No. 8,220,934. Patent Owner should not have turned the Mandatory Notice into a briefing opportunity to advocate the conclusion it urges in the matters pending before the Board. And the Notice of, and copy of, the Initial Determination should not have been filed without prior Board authorization.\n\nThus, the Board expunged the Supplemental Mandatory Notices.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MasterImage 3d, Inc. et al. v.
