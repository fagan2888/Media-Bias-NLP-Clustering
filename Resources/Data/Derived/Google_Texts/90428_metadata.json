for everything from narcissism to crimping sales of sugary sodas to stalling the housing market with their aversion to mortgage debt.\n\nBut it turns out millennials are performing far better than those supposedly older and wiser in one key metric of economic health: saving up for a rainy day.\n\nAccording to a new survey by Bankrate.com, less than a quarter of Americans have the recommended six-month savings cushion.\n\nAmericans age 18 to 30, however, are the group most likely to set aside five months\u2019 worth of expenses.\n\n\u201cConsumers learned something from the recession, and it does seem likely that millennials learned the most,\u201d said Scott Hoyt, senior director of consumer economics at Moody\u2019s Economy.com.\n\n\u201cThey are heading out into the job market when there are no jobs there, and they\u2019ve watched their parents suffer declines in asset prices.\u201d\n\nMillennials\u2019 rainy-day funds stand in sharp contrast to those of Americans ages 30 to 49, who are more likely than any group to have no emergency savings.\n\nGreg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com, said 30- to 49-year-olds want to save, but in a tough economy, many are unable to replenish funds drawn down after a job loss or other financial setback.\n\nHe recommends that consumers deposit money each month directly into savings as if paying a bill, rather than waiting to see if any funds are left over at the end of the month.\n\nMillennials\u2019 rainy-day savings funds also tend to be fairly modest, said McBride, since their expense base tends to be lower than older Americans who have mortgages, cars and children.\n\nThe fact that millennials are establishing good savings habits now, however, bodes well for their futures.\n\nBankrate says it surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1,004 adults who live in the continental US.\n\nMoody\u2019s Hoyt said that while there are not a lot of good data on generational savings trends, Bureau of Economic Analysis data show that the personal savings rate has recovered from the pre-recession borrowing binge.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description":
