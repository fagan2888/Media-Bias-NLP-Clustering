(Photo: Rich Pedroncelli, AP)\n\nAUSTIN, Ind. \u2014 From the start of the HIV outbreak here, health officials emphasized that nothing set Scott County apart from many other rural communities where opioid drug use had become an epidemic.\n\nThis could happen anywhere, people were told.\n\nMany people here had viewed HIV as a big-city disease, something that might afflict people in San Francisco or New York. But Austin is a small city of about 4,000 people 40 miles north of Louisville, Ky.\n\nThen in February 2015, the first 30 cases of HIV were reported. By mid-March, the number had climbed to 55.\n\nState health officials, the governor and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were looking for answers. Few public health crises have unfolded so rapidly.\n\nNow, a year later, the outbreak is at 190 cases. But the sickness runs deeper.\n\nPoverty envelops this city. Empty storefronts dot the main street. Many homes are boarded up or have makeshift tarps instead of windows. Fewer than 10% of Austin's residents have earned a college degree.\n\nOne out of five residents lives below the poverty level, more than 1.5 times the rate in Indiana.\n\nDrug use here is still rampant. Some users shoot up alongside their children or even their children\u2019s children.\n\nIn the winter, as many as 20 users may huddle in a home, gathering in the one building that has heat for the day. The power of addiction is so great that even the sensation of a prick from an empty needle can bring relief.\n\nYet people have hope.\n\nThe response to the HIV crisis has focused attention and brought services to an area long left in the shadows.\n\n\u201cI think we have a lot of really good things that came out of the HIV outbreak,\u201d said Brittany Combs, public health nurse at the Scott County Health Department neighboring Scottsburg, Ind. \u201cWe still have a long way to go.\u201d\n\nSubstance-abuse experts often describe five stages of recovery, each critical to long-term success. The many users in Austin are not alone in facing the arduous task, person after person here says.\n\nThe city itself is in recovery.\n\nStage 1: Awareness\n\nEveryone in Austin knew drugs were a problem. They just did not understand how great that problem was.\n\nWhat they did know was that poverty and despair had increased as resources had decreased, said Carolyn King, a community consultant who has worked in social services in Scott County for several years.\n\nThe home of one of the nation\u2019s largest private-label soup processing companies, Austin once had numerous low-skilled jobs. Over time, many of those jobs were automated or replaced with higher-skilled positions.\n\n\u201cIt was not like we didn\u2019t know there was an IV drug problem in rural America, but we just kind of ignored it.\u201d Dr. William Cooke, Austin, Ind.\n\nDuring the first decade of this century, social service after social service agency closed its doors: Early childhood services. Head Start. Workforce training. A domestic violence initiative. Even the thrift store had to close because people had no money.\n\n\u201cIt was a devastating time in this community,\u201d King said.\n\nOther amenities disappeared \u2014 restaurants, dentist offices, the grocery store.\n\nDr. William Cooke arrived in 2004. The New Albany, Ind., native considered West Virginia or Kentucky before choosing Austin; no other community he visited seemed to need medical services as desperately.\n\nOne red flag: After graduation, high school seniors would flock to his office looking for the only way they knew to earn an income: Could you file a disability form for me?\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t understand that disability was something they get when they\u2019re disabled,\u201d said Cooke, who opened his Foundations Family Medicine office blocks from where many drug users live.\n\nDrug abuse was common. Scott County had the highest per capita use of OxyContin in Indiana. Floyd County, a Louisville suburb that was No. 2 on the list, had a rate half as high.\n\nMedical professionals recognized the problem. At one point, doctors at ScottMemorial Hospital would prescribe only three days\u2019 worth of some pain pills at a time, King said.\n\nTo dissuade residents from frequenting clinics that all too freely dispensed medications, Cooke hired a pain specialist. He offered alternative pain management therapies such as physical and massage therapy.\n\nNothing helped.\n\nIn 2012, the British global news service Reuters wrote a piece about how Opana, a new painkiller, had replaced OxyContin as the drug of choice after a new manufacturing process made the latter more difficult to crush and dissolve for use intravenously. The dateline? Austin, where in three months nine people had fatally overdosed on prescription drugs.\n\nOpana also was reformulated to help prevent abuse, but addicts still found a way.\n\nDoctors at Scott Memorial Hospital, where Cooke also works, saw more and more patients come in with abscesses, hepatitis and a heart infection called endocarditis \u2014 all from intravenous drug use. For a few years, doctors realized that HIV could be the next infection to take hold, but they could do little to intervene.\n\n\u201cWe would scratch our heads as a medical community once in a while and say, \u2018Why don\u2019t we see more HIV than we do?\u2019 \u201d Cooke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of time. It was something we just kind of knew.\u201d\n\nLike many other rural communities in the United States, Scott County had few options to deal with the problem, no services, no money. The nearest methadone clinic was 40 miles away, and many people who could have benefited had no reliable transportation to get there.\n\nThose who used slipped further from sight, and those who did not found it easier to forget the users existed than to help them.\n\n\u201cIt set up this environment where there was this subculture of individuals that were hiding, disconnected from the rest of the community,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cIt was really frustrating. \u2026 It was not like we didn\u2019t know there was an IV drug problem in rural America, but we just kind of ignored it.\u201d\n\nMany of those who used lived within a few blocks of one another in a neighborhood of one-story homes, many with boarded-up windows and doors. Often several generations of a family used together. Few held steady jobs.\n\nFor the most part, they, like many of the residents of Austin who are not addicted to drugs, were poor and white.\n\nJesse McIntosh, 23, started using marijuana with friends when he was 13. In 10th grade, Austin High School kicked him out for skipping class.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I knew was to use. That was the only people I knew.\u201d Jesse McIntosh, Austin, Ind., native\n\nHe slid further into drug abuse, starting with Percocet, then OxyContin and then Opana. He started off snorting Opana, but then, like many of his friends, McIntosh started injecting it.\n\nNot for fun, he did it to ease his addiction pains.\n\nA cycle of drug use, drug-related arrests, jail and release followed.\n\nEach time he was incarcerated, he would go through withdrawal, and as soon as he was free, he would go right back to using drugs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I knew was to use,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the only people I knew.\u201d\n\nNo one worried about contracting HIV. People shared needles. People would reuse the same needle until it broke.\n\nThen a health worker in neighboring Clark County noticed something unusual. In December 2014, the number of HIV cases began to rise.\n\nPublic health workers routinely investigate every case of HIV, interviewing the newly diagnosed and asking them about anyone they might have inadvertently infected. Quickly, health investigators realized that these new cases all had something in common: The people had used intravenous drugs.\n\nIn mid-January, the local workers alerted the Indiana State Department of Health. They were seeing an unusually high number of HIV cases.\n\nStage 2: Action to address the problem\n\nPublic health nurse Combs knew drug use was common among some people, but she rarely came into contact with users as she educated people about immunizations and communicable diseases and ran a clinic for the elderly.\n\nAs testing for HIV spread, she rapidly gained a clearer sense of the scope of the problem.\n\nDisease investigators went to one house shared by six people. All tested positive for HIV.\n\nHealth officials held a conference call with the New York State Health Department, which had weathered a hepatitis C outbreak among intravenous drug users in a rural health program. The New York experts kept touting the benefits of a clean needle exchange program.\n\nBut Indiana law banned such programs.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what else you can do to stop the spread, the New York experts said.\n\n\u201cAnd we were like, 'Crap, we have a major problem,'\u201d Combs said.\n\nIndiana Department of Health officials had daily discussions about the pros and cons of a needle exchange program, said Dr. Jerome Adams, the state health commissioner.\n\nThe CDC strongly advocated one.\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence previously said he was opposed to a needle exchange as anti-drug policy. But in this instance, a needle exchange would not be used to prevent the use of drugs but to help stop the spread of HIV.\n\nPublic health nurse Brittany Combs restocks needles March 24,2016, at a needle-exchange program in Austin, Ind. (Photo: Kelly Wilkinson, The Indianapolis Star)\n\nAfter weeks of discussion, on March 25, 2015, Pence declared a public health emergency for Scott County that allowed for a needle exchange. Two days later, the Department of Health reported that 81 people had tested positive for HIV.\n\nUsers who were not HIV positive realized they were lucky. McIntosh, who had entered treatment in Indianapolis a few months before the HIV outbreak, breathed a deep sigh of relief.\n\n\u201cI thank God in heaven that I dodged the HIV,\u201d he said. \u201cI shared needles with a lot of people, and Lord knows that I didn\u2019t do anything to prevent it.\u201d\n\nEach week, as health officials reached out to test those who had been in contact with previously diagnosed individuals, the number of cases rose. At the peak of the epidemic, 22 new cases were being diagnosed each week.\n\nAustin found itself in an unenviable spotlight. Media trucks descended from around the world to document an HIV outbreak that government officials called unprecedented.\n\nAt one point, Adams said the CDC was providing President Barack Obama with daily updates about the situation.\n\nStage 3: Exploration of recovery\n\nIndiana wanted the response to address more than the HIV epidemic, more than drug addiction. The idea was to develop a system to help those who were addicted and ill in as many facets of their lives as possible.\n\nAlthough state health officials would not start from scratch, they knew the challenges ahead would be difficult.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re shifting from episodic-based care to population-based care,\" Adams said. \"When we deal with an outbreak of mumps, let\u2019s vaccinate everyone. Let\u2019s put the fire out and move on.\"\n\n\u201cIn Scott County, it\u2019s about looking at those indicators that put them at risk for this HIV outbreak,\" he said. \"The HIV outbreak is really just a beacon that shined a light on the underlying health factors.\u201d\n\nMost of those affected had no health insurance. Most would be eligible for the state\u2019s Healthy Indiana Plan, which would cover the cost of care, drugs and potentially substance abuse counseling.\n\nBut enrolling them would not be easy. Many lacked even an ID to sign up.\n\nThe state opened a one-stop shop that would offer a variety of services, including HIV testing, immunizations, and substance abuse and counseling referrals. The shop also would help people get birth certificates.\n\nThose who tested HIV positive could seek medical care that would provide drugs capable of reducing their viral load and ending their ability to pass the infection to others. Those at risk who still used would have access to clean needles to help prevent them from catching the disease.\n\nSexual partners of those who were HIV positive could start medicine known to help prevent HIV infection.\n\nFree needles are available at a needle-exchange program as part of the Scott County Health Department's response to an HIV outbreak linked to intravenous drug use in Austin, Ind. (Photo: Kelly Wilkinson, The Indianapolis Star)\n\nHowever, all of this hinged on effectively reaching those who were infected and at risk.\n\n\u201cThere was no handbook on how we could respond. We had to build it,\u201d said Pamela Pontones of the Indiana State Department of Health, who served as incident commander.\n\nHealth officials and city leaders knew that to stem the crisis, they would need a communitywide approach. Some steps, such as creating recovery groups, would be relatively simple.\n\nOther steps would be far more challenging. They would need to address problems that had long plagued Austin, such as a lack of jobs, affordable housing and public transportation.\n\n\u201cThis problem runs deep, and metaphorically the soil has to be addressed,\u201d said Lori Croasdell, coordinator of the Coalition to Eliminate the Abuse of Substances in Scott County. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is address the soil. \u2026 We\u2019re trying to make that soil rich again.\u201d\n\nStage 4: Early recovery\n\nThe city even had to combat the perception that everyone who lived there had a drug problem. Other school districts' students mocked the Austin Eagles as the \u201cAustin Needles,\u201d Croasdell said.\n\nHowever, for the most part the national response was positive. The CDC dispatched health officials to help track contacts of those diagnosed, as did many other state health departments. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation in May established a partnership to help Cooke care for those who were HIV positive.\n\nWithin a few months, fewer new cases were found each week. By mid-June, the once-steady stream of new diagnoses had trickled to a few a week with a total of 170 cases diagnosed.\n\n\u201cPeople will go to the needle-exchange program, and then after a period of time \u2014 we\u2019re not the first visit, we\u2019re not the second visit, but after a period of time \u2014 they will get the courage to walk across the hall and come over to us and say, \u2018Hi, I have had enough.'\u201d Shonita Fink, LifeSpring Health Systems\n\n\u201cWe caught it real time, and we stopped it real time, which is phenomenal,\u201d Cooke said.\n\nIn late June, the Scott County Health Department moved the one-stop shop and needle exchange from west of downtown near Interstate 65 to Cooke\u2019s former office near Main Street, closer to the neighborhood where many drug users live.\n\nLate in the summer, LifeSpring Health Systems addiction and behavioral health center opened an office next door. The office\u2019s proximity to the needle exchange helps encourage some users to take that first step, said Shonita Fink, a LifeSpring therapist.\n\n\u201cWhat I have found is that people will go to the needle-exchange program, and then after a period of time \u2014 we\u2019re not the first visit, we\u2019re not the second visit, but after a period of time \u2014 they will get the courage to walk across the hall and come over to us and say, \u2018Hi, I have had enough,' \u201d Fink said.\n\nObjections to needle-exchange programs include concerns that they merely encourage users to continue to use. The people of Scott County are learning that it might not be as simple as that.\n\nSome who use the needle-exchange program might still be using but use less often than they did before, King said. Eventually, those people might reach the point where they decide to quit.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re getting 10 needles instead of 15, you\u2019re reducing harm,\u201d King said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be an all or nothing thing. \u2026 We\u2019ve got to celebrate little steps, and we\u2019re seeing people trying. But it\u2019s a very difficult disease.\u201d\n\nAfter a year of providing clean needles, Combs has seen some people enter recovery. Some have succeeded. Some stopped using only to return.\n\nThen come those somewhere in between.\n\nA man who once used is now addicted to sticking a clean, empty needle in his arm. As soon as that empty needle goes in, he tells Combs he relaxes.\n\nStage 5: The hardest part\n\nOne year after the outbreak, health officials can log many successes. Since mid-July, only 14 new cases of HIV have been diagnosed, Pontones said.\n\nClose to half of those diagnosed are virally suppressed, which means they cannot spread the disease to others, Indiana health officials say.\n\nPublic health nurse Jackie McClintock, operating a mobile needle-exchange program, talks March 24, 2016, with an IV drug user in Austin, Ind. (Photo: Kelly Wilkinson, The Indianapolis Star)\n\nCooke believes the percentage may be even higher. Out of the 120 people with HIV for whom he cares, at least 88% are virally suppressed, he said.\n\nAustin now has support and recovery programs, run by local people and people from elsewhere. Every Friday, trained lay recovery coaches with Mental Health America of Indiana\u2019s Project Empowerment Effect Recovery Services program drive from Indianapolis to run a recovery group at a local church.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just about bringing hope and serenity and peace and letting them know that there\u2019s people out here who care for them,\u201d said Michelle Steel, PEERS project coordinator.\n\nAlthough McIntosh is not an official recovery coach, he also drives each Friday to participate. He now works as a salesman \u2014 his boss, too, is in recovery \u2014 is engaged to be married and plans to earn his high school equivalency degree.\n\nSome weeks he sees former friends at the recovery meetings. Some are succeeding.\n\nOthers, of whom he steers clear, still use drugs.\n\n\u201cThe more time passes, the more support I feel like is going to be down there, and the more I feel recovery is going to be part of daily life down there,\u201d he said.\n\nMultiple challenges persist. Meeting basic needs, such as housing and employment, is no simple task.\n\nThis winter, Combs suddenly couldn\u2019t find many of her clients in the places they had been living. Then she happened upon a house she had never visited before and found 20 people huddled there.\n\nThat house was the one that had heat and electricity that day, she learned.\n\nAlthough Cooke reports great success among his patients, Combs struggles to ensure that needle-exchange clients stay up to date with their HIV medicines.\n\nCombs and her colleague, public health nurse Jackie McClintock, even will pick up prescriptions for those with no transportation or money for refills.\n\n\u201cPretty much everyone in the community has someone they know or a family member that has an addiction problem.\u201d Jessica Clay, Austin, Ind.\n\nCombs is concerned that this on-again, off-again approach to medicine could lead to drug resistance. On a recent trip to the CDC, she met a scientist who studies anti-retroviral resistance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be calling you in a few years,\u201d she was told.\n\nGaps exist in substance-abuse therapy. Inpatient rehab means a four- to six-week wait.\n\nNo methadone clinics exist in the area to help those who fear withdrawal without it. Many of the doctors certified to provide another alternative, suboxone, do not accept Medicaid and can treat only 100 patients a year, leading to a suboxone black market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating to not have the services we need available when you have people saying every day, 'We want to quit,' and you can\u2019t help them quit,\u201d Combs said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be fixed overnight. There\u2019s no way.\u201d\n\nTrust has been building, but work still needs to be done.\n\nIn early February, law enforcement announced a major Opana bust, the culmination of an investigation that began in June. At first, many in the community predicted that those who used would simply switch to heroin as the street price of Opana skyrocketed.\n\nInstead, people switched to methamphetamine, a stimulant.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense,\u201d Combs said. \u201cBut it\u2019s what they have available, and it\u2019s something to keep them from withdrawing.\u201d\n\nHealth officials tried to be proactive about helping those in the community who might be going through withdrawal without access to the drug. The hospital set up a protocol to help those who were withdrawing, encouraging them not to lie about their symptoms but to be honest about the fact that they were in withdrawal.\n\nAustin, Ind., population 4,000, has been the epicenter of an HIV outbreak linked to intravenous drug use. (Photo: Kelly Wilkinson, The Indianapolis Star)\n\nNo one went, though. They were too scared, Combs said.\n\nBut slowly, slowly, people are starting to ask for help, to bring their problems out into the open.\n\nTherein lies Austin\u2019s hope, said Jessica Clay, one of the city's few small-business owners. In spring 2015, just as the outbreak hit, she and her husband started selling produce from a roadside stand on Main Street.\n\nAttitudes have changed in the past year as the city\u2019s drug problems have been brought into the open, she said. Before the HIV outbreak, people never talked about such challenges.\n\n\u201cPretty much everyone in the community has someone they know or a family member that has an addiction problem,\u201d said Clay, 30, who used methamphetamine for six years as a teen and young adult.\n\nIf a family member had cancer, people wouldn\u2019t hide that. They would talk about it and openly seek help.\n\nThat\u2019s what needs to happen with the sickness of addiction, Clay said, so people can go through rehab and return to Austin to help the community prosper.\n\nSigns exist that Austin is improving. Clay and her husband have expanded River\u2019s Edge Country Market to a building and opened a small restaurant. A Pizza King just opened up.\n\nClay looks forward to when the many empty storefronts along Main Street are filled with locally owned small shops.\n\n\u201cWe have a great town that\u2019s went through a really tough time,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t wait to see where it\u2019s going in the future.\u201d\n\nFollow Shari Rudavsky on Twitter: @srudavsky.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1S40T5b", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "From the\u00a0start of the HIV outbreakhere, health officials emphasized that nothing set Scott County apart from many other rural communities where opioid drug use had become an epidemic.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "From the\u00a0start of the HIV outbreakhere, health officials emphasized that nothing set Scott County apart from many other rural communities where opioid drug use had become an epidemic.", "title": "190 people in this Indiana town diagnosed with HIV", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2016/04/10/190-people-austin-ind-diagnosed-hiv/82869826/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From the\u00a0start of the HIV outbreakhere, health officials emphasized that nothing set Scott County apart from many other rural communities where opioid drug use had become an epidemic.", "title": "190 people in this Indiana town diagnosed with HIV", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dfa62c5b3a414003045730fe541611a23d6887d9/c=977-0-2896-1919&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635958204181687620-AP-Overprescribing-Painkillers.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/HIV", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/HIV", "title": "190 people in this Indiana town diagnosed with HIV", "author": "Shari Rudavsky", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa7175356998af2df16bec57fbc71c731fd90040/c=1165-0-2604-1919/local/-/media/2016/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635958204181687620-AP-Overprescribing-Painkillers.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3a44817c9c8c0f8596b5a4f79c64925a28c1a5b6/c=977-0-2896-1919/local/-/media/2016/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635958204181687620-AP-Overprescribing-Painkillers.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bb709fa84bb70333f413ed0dffa913ded37c7f12/c=922-252-2993-1809/local/-/media/2016/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635958204181687620-AP-Overprescribing-Painkillers.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fd437ff5ec73f24ea8cf18018eab425d244bdaef/c=859-497-2993-1703&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635958204181687620-AP-Overprescribing-Painkillers.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-10T17:16:01.830000-04:00", "shorthed": "190 people in Austin, Ind. diagnosed with HIV", "articleid": 82869826, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/11fb179ebfcc127d1abf2cd2cecf40b25a9bf7c2/c=859-497-2993-1703/local/-/media/2016/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635958204181687620-AP-Overprescribing-Painkillers.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e290a5aab1de8257e8440b7a35fcad1c47567cf/c=1830-243-2769-1919/local/-/media/2016/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635958204181687620-AP-Overprescribing-Painkillers.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Indiana, HIV, Austin,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd74ed\"", "article_summary": "Close to half of those diagnosed are virally suppressed, which means they cannot spread the disease to others, Indiana health officials say.\nMcIntosh, who had entered treatment in Indianapolis a few months before the HIV outbreak, breathed a deep sigh of relief.\n\u201cIn Scott County, it\u2019s about looking at those indicators that put them at risk for this HIV outbreak,\" he said.\nThe CDC dispatched health officials to help track contacts of those diagnosed, as did many other state health departments.\nScott County had the highest per capita use of OxyContin in Indiana."}
