At the same time, listeners should not look for insults everywhere, and should place words in context so as to understand intent,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy and Suvashree Dey Choudhury; Editing by Rafael Nam and Jacqueline Wong)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's two-year old government is seeking to bolster an econom", "title": "Won't be euphoric if India is fastest-growing large economy: central bank chief", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Wont-be-euphoric-if-India-fastest-growing-large-economy-cenbank-chief", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/imf-g20_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Wont-be-euphoric-if-India-fastest-growing-large-economy-cenbank-chief", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/imf-g20_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's two-year old government is seeking to bolster an econom", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Without citing specific instances, Rajan said previous governments had become too complacent by periods of high growth, saying India still remained a relatively poor country.\n\"As a central banker who has to be pragmatic, I cannot get euphoric if India is the fastest-growing large economy,\" Rajan said in a speech to banking and finance students in the western city of Pune.\nRajan noted his intent was to signal that India's \"outperformance was accentuated because world growth was weak,\" while also chastising those who stir controversy by misinterpreting his comments.\nRajan said the government had created a platform \"for strong sustainable growth,\" but said it would need to ensure it stays on that path.\nThe Reserve Bank of India governor has cut interest rates by 150 basis points since the start of 2015 to a more than five-year low, but is under pressure to ease further."}
