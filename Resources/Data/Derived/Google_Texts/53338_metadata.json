The spot, which was released on Friday, notes Abbott\u2019s partial paralysis as the result of a 1984 accident, over which he sued and was awarded over $10 million in damages. Critics on both sides of the aisle have roundly condemned the Davis campaign for the attack, which includes an empty photo of a wheelchair (Abbott uses one) as a backdrop to claims of Abbott\u2019s hypocrisy \u2014 bullet-pointed examples of the candidate ruling against an amputee, a rape survivor and the victims of surgical malpractice. But Davis and her aides have stood by the advertisement so far, and show no signs of saying sorry.\n\n\u201cIn 1984, Greg Abbott sought out and received justice following a horrible injury, rightly so,\u201d Davis said at a press conference on Monday, Politico reports. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad, he deserved justice for the terrible tragedy that he endured \u2026 But then he turned around and built his career working to deny the very same justice that he received to his fellow Texans rightly seeking it for themselves.\u201d\n\nDavis went on to reiterate the point of the ad \u2014 to call out Abbott\u2019s hypocrisy \u2014 by asserting that the attorney general \u201chas built a career kicking the ladder down behind him and denying to others the very same justice that he both deserved and received.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cWe need to call this what it is \u2014 hypocrisy,\u201d Davis added. \u201cBut there is example after example of it, harming the people that he is supposed to be fighting for.\u201d\n\nBut, in addition to unnecessarily depicting the wheelchair and making Abbott\u2019s disability part of the campaign, the problem with the picture Davis paints in her ad is that it tackles the wrong issue. As the American Prospect points out, the spot\u2019s portrayal of Abbott\u2019s record is a mostly accurate one, based rightly on the attorney general\u2019s decades-long history of attempting to shutter courthouses to those in need of justice. \u201cAbbott\u2019s record on disability issues is absolutely legitimate, since it has been part of his work as attorney general,\u201d Paul Waldman writes. \u201cThis is an issue on which he has received criticism before, including on the specific question of whether people who are disabled should be able to sue for compensation. His own history would seem relevant to that issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bringing up Greg Abbott's disability wasn't necessary -- and hypocrisy is the least of the GOPer's offenses", "title": "Wendy Davis\u2019 attack ad was bad \u2014 and made a valid point poorly", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bringing up Greg Abbott's disability wasn't necessary -- and hypocrisy is the least of the GOPer's offenses", "title": "Wendy Davis\u2019 attack ad was bad \u2014 and made a valid point poorly", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/13/wendy_davis_attack_ad_was_bad_and_made_a_valid_point_poorly/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/wendy_davis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bringing up Greg Abbott's disability wasn't necessary -- and hypocrisy is the least of the GOPer's offenses", "title": "Wendy Davis\u2019 attack ad was bad \u2014 and made a valid point poorly", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/wendy_davis.jpg", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Kutner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, disabilities, Governor, hypocrisy, Texas, Wendy Davis", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda72\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2014 elections, disabilities, Governor, hypocrisy, Texas, Wendy Davis, Politics NewsTexas state senator and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis is making no apologies for a new attack ad directed at her Republican opponent, Attorney General Greg Abbott.\n\u201cIn 1984, Greg Abbott sought out and received justice following a horrible injury, rightly so,\u201d Davis said at a press conference on Monday, Politico reports.\n\u201cAbbott\u2019s record on disability issues is absolutely legitimate, since it has been part of his work as attorney general,\u201d Paul Waldman writes.\nBut Davis and her aides have stood by the advertisement so far, and show no signs of saying sorry.\n\u201cThis is an issue on which he has received criticism before, including on the specific question of whether people who are disabled should be able to sue for compensation."}
