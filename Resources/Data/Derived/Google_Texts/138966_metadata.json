Those people spoke on condition of anonymity because no official announcement has been made.\n\nThe union asked Goodell to remove himself from that role because it said he lacked impartiality and that Goodell would be called as a witness. NFL lawyers, however, have recommended to Goodell that he should not recuse himself.\n\nWATCH: NFL rejects request for Roger Goodell to withdraw from Tom Brady appeal\n\nNo date has been set for the appeal, although the collective bargaining agreement calls for it to be heard within 10 days. However, both sides can agree on delaying a hearing, which would need to be held by Wednesday without any requested delays.\n\nBrady was suspended for the first four games of the 2015 season after a league-sanctioned report by attorney Ted Wells found the New England quarterback \u201cat least generally aware\u201d of a scheme to illegally deflate footballs used in the AFC title game win over Indianapolis. On Wednesday at the spring owners meetings, Goodell said he was aware of the union\u2019s request but had not yet had time to examine it.\n\nSince then, league lawyers were able to look it over and make their recommendation he remain on the case.\n\nBut it seemed clear Wednesday that he planned to oversee the appeal hearing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my job here to make sure we\u2019re doing everything to protect the integrity of the game, protect our policies, protect our procedures,\u201d Goodell said then. \u201cWe have a process that has been negotiated with the union that has been in place for decades. It\u2019s my responsibility and it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve had in place for a long time.\u201d\n\nTroy Vincent, the league\u2019s executive vice president of football operations, handed down the suspension to three-time Super Bowl MVP Brady, one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars. Vincent also fined the Patriots $1 million and stripped them of a first-round draft pick next year and a fourth-rounder in 2017.\n\nOn Tuesday, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, among the NFL\u2019s most powerful and influential men, said he will not appeal those penalties.\n\nBut Brady has hired attorney Jeffrey Kessler, who has taken on the league in a variety of other cases through the years, and could take his case to court should his punishment not be reduced after appeal.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Roger Goodell won\u2019t recuse himself from Tom Brady appeal", "title": "Roger Goodell won\u2019t recuse himself from Tom Brady appeal", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/22/roger-goodell-wont-recuse-himself-from-tom-brady-appeal/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150520_020810_tom-brady.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150520_020810_tom-brady.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-22T15:04:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T04:14:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 Roger Goodell will hear Tom Brady\u2019s appeal of his four-game suspension for his role in the deflated footballs scandal.\nWATCH: NFL rejects request for Roger Goodell to withdraw from Tom Brady appealNo date has been set for the appeal, although the collective bargaining agreement calls for it to be heard within 10 days.\nGoodell will not withdraw from what the commissioner considers his responsibility of hearing the appeal, according to several people with knowledge of the decision.\nThe union asked Goodell to remove himself from that role because it said he lacked impartiality and that Goodell would be called as a witness.\nOn Tuesday, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, among the NFL\u2019s most powerful and influential men, said he will not appeal those penalties."}
