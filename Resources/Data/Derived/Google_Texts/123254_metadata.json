It specializes in reaching out to \u201cpart-way home\u201d students, those that had taken some college courses but because of life or family choices before obtaining a degree.\n\n(Click here to read a previous article about WGU\u2019s foray into North Carolina.)\n\nIt costs students approximately $3,000 for unlimited classes during a 6-month period and uses a competency-based model, where students can get credits for classes if they already know the material and can pass a test showing that.\n\nHere in North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory is in favor of bringing WGU to the state, and had a meeting at the Executive Mansion in November with Robert Mendenhall, the CEO of the Utah-based University.\n\nIn their proposal, House members suggested letting students attending WGU to tap into a $90 million pool of state money used for need-based aid to students attending private colleges in the state.\n\nThe Senate took a different approach, and would give the Utah-based college $2 million in state money to set up shop here, with the possibility of drawing down $5 million more if private funds are also raised.\n\nAs expected, WGU has both proponents and critics.\n\nIt\u2019s hailed by supporters as a fairly low-cost way for older students who may be busy working to finish their degrees, while critics say it offers an inferior education and undermines existing offerings at universities and community colleges.\n\nThe $6,000 annual cost for a year at WGU is much lower than what for-profit online colleges like the University of Phoenix and Strayer University can cost.\n\nBut it is on par, or close to what UNC system institutions charged this year in tuition and fees, which range from $4,655 a year at Elizabeth City State University to $8,407 at N.C. State University for the 2015-16 school year.\n\nWGU currently has a six-year graduation rate of 38 percent, a rate they hope to increase, which is much lower than the 63.1 percent that graduate from UNC institutions in six years.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s thrilled at the prospect of WGU coming to the state.\n\nJohn Fennebresque, the chair of the University of North Carolina\u2019s Board of Governors, says the state\u2019s existing higher education institutions can do more for North Carolina-based students than WGU can.\n\nHe attended the November meeting McCrory had with WGU in November.\n\n\u201cWe can do all that within the (UNC) system,\u201d Fennebresque said in an interview this week with N.C. Policy Watch. He added, \u201cI saw nothing that they offer that we don\u2019t or can\u2019t do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28d7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe can do all that within the (UNC) system,\u201d Fennebresque said in an interview this week with N.C.
