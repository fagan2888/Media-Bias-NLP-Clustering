And it\u2019s holding our economy back.\u201d\n\nTurning to Obama\u2019s foreign policy mess, Boehner alleged that the crises in Gaza, Iraq and Ukraine are a \u201cresult of the president\u2019s apology tour five years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe went to Europe and he went to the Middle East and apologized for American leadership and apologized for America being strong,\u201d the Ohio representative detailed. \u201cAnd, look at the result. When America leads and America is strong, the world is a much safer place. World leaders are begging me everyday, \u2018Why can\u2019t you lead? We need America to lead.\u2019 The world wants us to lead, but the president just won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why Obama won\u2019t lead, Boehner answered simply, \u201cHe\u2019s just really not prepared for the job.\u201d\n\nThe speaker of the House also explained that the problem with Washington is rooted directly in a White House that is unorganized, ineffective and unwilling to work with lawmakers in Congress.\n\nHe admitted that the House will likely proceed with its lawsuit against the president for his overuse of executive power come Labor Day.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit we\u2019re about to file, probably right after Labor Day, is intended to rebalance the relationship between the Congress and the executive branch,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me versus the president, it\u2019s not about Republicans versus Democrats. The president has the authority to do executive actions but he doesn\u2019t have the authority to rewrite laws, which, in my view, on a number of occasions he has.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think, working with some legal scholars, that we may have a real serious shot here,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite the obvious seriousness with which Boehner regards the lawsuit, Obama has rudely dismissed it as a \u201cstunt.\u201d\n\nObama is currently on a 15-day vacation in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, the longest summer getaway he has taken during his time as president.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a radio interview with Scott Hennen of KTGO in North Dakota on Friday that President Obama isn't effectively leading the country because he wasn't \"prepared for the job.\"", "title": "John Boehner: Obama wasn't 'prepared for the job' of president -...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/08/boehner1-600x334.jpg", "height": 334}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/08/17/john-boehner-obama-wasnt-prepared-job-president/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "obama-lawsuit-executive-power", "published_time": "2014-08-17T15:59:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-17T15:59:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbdc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s really about leadership, and while the president thinks that giving a speech is leadership, it really isn\u2019t,\u201d explained Boehner.\nHe admitted that the House will likely proceed with its lawsuit against the president for his overuse of executive power come Labor Day.\nWhen America leads and America is strong, the world is a much safer place.\n\u201cThis lawsuit we\u2019re about to file, probably right after Labor Day, is intended to rebalance the relationship between the Congress and the executive branch,\u201d Boehner said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about me versus the president, it\u2019s not about Republicans versus Democrats."}
