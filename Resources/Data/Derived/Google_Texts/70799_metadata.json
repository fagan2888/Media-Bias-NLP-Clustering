Here\u2019s why.\n\nImagine that you\u2019re an optimistic third-year medical student walking into the ER. Your first patient says to you, \u201cI don\u2019t want any niggers touching me.\u201d There you are in your brand new white coat\u2014the apotheosis of your and your parents\u2019 hopes and dreams\u2014but still, to this patient, you\u2019re a nigger. You try to ignore the sting in your eyes\u2014the shame of it. You suck it up, say nothing, and move on.\n\nThis kind of thing has happened to me from time to time\u2014even as a studious, light-skinned offspring of a white father and black mother; even as a person who has \u201cno discernable negro accent\u201d; even as a person who was schooled since I was knee-high to respond to the question of what race I am by saying, \u201cHomo sapiens sapiens because there is no such thing as race.\u201d\n\nBut it turns out that to a lot of people, I\u2019m still a nigger.\n\nOver time, I learned to please people\u2014like anyone would\u2014despite their obvious disappointment when they see that I\u2019m black. I got good at being what people need me to be. But it slowly transformed me into something I couldn\u2019t foresee\u2014a sort of Dr. Bojangles\u2014delighting everyone with my expressive face and tap dancing feet. And although I have been an Obama supporter, it\u2019d be disingenuous if I didn\u2019t conclude that we\u2019re faced with the fascinating paradox that the signature policy of the first black president may indeed serve to increase our racial divides.\n\nIt\u2019s simply a fact of life: Some people are racist. What can you do but adapt and soldier on?\n\n\n\nAfter all, even the most well-intentioned people have unconscious racial biases. In fact, researchers have developed a test that demonstrates that most of us\u2014some 70% or more\u2014 have implicit racial bias, no matter how free of prejudice we think we are.\n\nYet, the influence of race was completely ignored when the government tied patient satisfaction scores to doctor\u2019s pay. We have to ask: In what way will a doctor\u2019s race be financially rewarded or penalized by our government?\n\n\u201cYou only have to be a minority doctor to see why the\u2026 [patient satisfaction] score is heavily stacked against you,\u201d one internist reported in a recent Medscape article, \u201cIs Placating Patients Putting Medicine in Peril?\u201d \u201cIf you [work] in a predominantly majority area...for minority doctors, the [patient satisfaction] score has really been a major disaster.\u201d\n\nAs physician-health-care blogger Dr. Jan Gurley wrote about her experience at Harvard Medical School, \u201cA medical school [classmate\u2019s]\u2026experience was often very different than mine because she is African-American, and I am white. The conversation with a patient often began with being forced to explain that no, she wasn\u2019t there to empty the trash.\u201d\n\nIn fact, patients\u2019 racism against providers has been called medicine\u2019s \u201copen secret,\u201d but it\u2019s difficult to address because patients don\u2019t usually walk through the door snarling racial epithets. As one African-American physician confided to me, \u201cAlthough most racial slurs are not as direct as \u2018I don\u2019t want any niggers touching me,\u2019 it still means the same when one hears \u2018Are you the doctor?\u2019 or \u2018When will the real doctor be here?\u2019\u201d\n\nThese so-called \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d are a frequent occurrence for many black doctors. My own career has been punctuated by several stupefying moments where patients start talking about niggers\u2014in private behind the curtain or, humiliatingly, in full view of the trauma team. But for black doctors to get to the top 1 to 2% in patient satisfaction\u2014like I did when I worked in assembly-line medicine\u2014it requires a certain talent to combat those relentless micro-aggressions.\n\nAnd that talent involves developing empathy for the racist. I might observe, for example, the patient\u2019s face fall with disappointment, the brow knit with worry when they lay eyes on me. While I field their questions about how well I did in school, I\u2019ll reassure them they aren\u2019t dealing with any ordinary Negro\u2014amazing them with flourishing displays of medical knowledge and boundless kindness. It\u2019s an exhausting and unrelenting Bojangles\u2019 routine\u2014requiring every ounce of intellectual and emotional skill to both soothe and delight\u2014and it\u2019s repeated anew three or four times an hour. It\u2019s a lot to ask of anyone\u2014let alone someone earning $10 for the patient visit. I\u2019d wager that most white doctors don\u2019t experience patient care quite like this. But it would be wrong to imply that white and so-called \u201cmodel minority\u201d physicians aren\u2019t also the victims of patient racism.\n\nIndeed, while Mrs. Obama exhorts us to talk about racism, we might start by accepting that we all have racial biases. And we all have racial biases because human beings are pattern-forming creatures. But in my experience, the least racist people openly acknowledge that they have those \u201cpatterns\u201d and work hard to correct them when they are wrong or unfair.\n\nBias against black doctors is indeed unfair, because studies have failed to show that a physician\u2019s race affects patient outcomes. On the other hand, numerous studies have shown that patients are more satisfied with doctors of the same race. Indeed, one study showed that black patients with black doctors were 140% more likely to rate their physician as excellent than if they had a doctor of another race. White patients with white doctors were 63% more likely to say they felt their doctor listened well. And Hispanic patients with Hispanic physicians were 74% more likely to feel satisfied overall with their care.\n\nThis implies that under the current patient satisfaction scheme, all physicians\u2014not just black physicians\u2014may be penalized financially on the basis of race.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

A hard-working doctor (of any race) has rendered careful, considerate care to a complicated patient. Yet a relative who gets the patient satisfaction form in the mail who might be pissed off at, say, the hospital parking fees\u2014or maybe doesn\u2019t like the color of the doctor\u2019s skin\u2014will determine how well the doctor gets paid, or even if he keeps his job.\n\nAnd apparently that\u2019s OK with our government.\n\nIt should go without saying that our government has no business promoting a program like this and it should be stopped. But it\u2019s on track to get worse with Obamacare\u2019s \u201cpay for performance\u201d that will withhold even more Medicare payments for low patient satisfaction scores. This financial threat is already causing unethical administrators to pressure doctors to compromise their professional standards to order unnecessary meds and tests to bump satisfaction scores.\n\nIf administrators already engage in this unscrupulous behavior, we have to wonder if race will influence future hiring policies. Even for hospitals serving minority populations\u2014if black patients are more than twice as likely to think a black doctor is excellent\u2014it wouldn\u2019t make any sense to hire white doctors at all.\n\nObamacare, with its focus on patient satisfaction, will penalize doctors on the basis of race, and may very well racially segregate doctors who swore a solemn oath to provide health care to all our citizens. It\u2019s not that far-fetched, because even from the physician\u2019s perspective, it simply doesn\u2019t make sense to opt to take care of patients who are biased against them. Indeed it\u2019s been shown that the patients who tend to give lower scores to physicians are those characterized by \u201cminority race, psychological distress\u2026not having a regular health care provider, not having health insurance.\u201d\n\nSo while disadvantaged minorities with these characteristics are often most in need of good medical care, the government has misaligned the economic incentives to take care of them. \u201cPaying doctors on the basis of popularity would create, for the first time in any profession, a system that financially rewards racism and bias,\u201d wrote Dr. Gurley in \u201cHow Paying Doctors for Patient Satisfaction is Racist.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, in an increasingly transparent world, patient satisfaction scores could deliver useful information. But this program is not good enough for the American people. Indeed, the surveys could help physicians improve cross-cultural communication\u2014instead of financially penalizing them for even trying. But by tying patient satisfaction to hospital and physician pay\u2014the government has invoked the law of unintended consequences.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Obamacare, Health, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201405260945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/tech-and-health", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Health, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "How Obamacare Will Screw Black Doctors", "tags": "Obamacare:Industryterm,topic:lifestyle/health,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "By tying doctor pay to patient satisfaction scores, Obamacare\u2019s \u2018pay for performance\u2019 system is going to disproportionately hurt minority doctors.
