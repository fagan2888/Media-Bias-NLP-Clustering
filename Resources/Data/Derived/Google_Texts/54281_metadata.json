This week, workers will fully adjust the system \u201cfor optimal performance,\u201d the letter says.\n\n\u201cAll the major components for the water treatment plant are now on-site,\u201d according to the Thursday notification.\n\nThe 3 million-gallon Aug. 5 Gold King spill above Silverton left the EPA facing immense criticism as yellow-orange contaminants flowed from the Animas River across the southwest. In the disaster\u2019s wake, the agency has been working to address the still-leaching mine and other area portals that are releasing contaminants.\n\nThe temporary system, erected by Alexco Environmental Group Inc., is expected to operate throughout the winter and is capable of working in minus-20-degree temperatures.\n\nIt will remove about 85 percent of \u201cmetals of concern,\u201d according to the EPA, and discharged water will have a pH ranging from 6 to 9.\n\n\u201cThis plant is not designed to output drinking-quality water,\u201d the notification says.\n\nThe EPA says the new system will only address contaminants still flowing from the Gold King. While it will make some improvement to Cement Creek, the agency says the system is \u201cnot intended to be a solution to the broader problem of a discharging mine in the Upper Animas.\u201d\n\nThe EPA says it is compiling data with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Bureau of Land Management and local stakeholders regarding long-term solutions.\n\n\u201cMines in the area have been releasing contaminated mine wastewater into the environment for decades, and addressing the situation is a complicated problem,\u201d the letter says. \u201cThe Red and Bonita Mine, for example, continues to discharge at 350 (gallons per minute) directly into Cement Creek.\u201d\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or @JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "EPA: Gold King Mine water treatment operations have begun", "title": "EPA: Gold King Mine water treatment operations have begun", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/17/epa-gold-king-mine-water-treatment-operations-have-begun/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150818__20150819_A18_CD19ANIMASEFFECTSJPICp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150818__20150819_A18_CD19ANIMASEFFECTSJPICp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-17T09:46:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T07:41:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Animas River-Spill"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc536\"", "article_summary": "The Environmental Protection Agency has begun water treatment operations at the site of the Gold King Mine spill, officials said last week.\nIn a notification to congressional delegations obtained by The Denver Post, the EPA was slated to begin running water through a temporary treatment system on Friday.\n\u201cAll the major components for the water treatment plant are now on-site,\u201d according to the Thursday notification.\nThe 3 million-gallon Aug. 5 Gold King spill above Silverton left the EPA facing immense criticism as yellow-orange contaminants flowed from the Animas River across the southwest.\nThe EPA says the new system will only address contaminants still flowing from the Gold King."}
