But the guards failed to grasp the need to take Wandji to hospital, the watchdog committee that monitors Japan\u2019s detention centers said in a report last March to the national Immigration Bureau, which is part of the Justice Ministry. The report was reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe watchdog report drew attention to what it said was the heavy prescription of drugs to detainees. At the time he died, Ghadimi had been prescribed 15 different drugs, including four painkillers, five sedatives \u2013 one a Japanese version of the tranquilizer Xanax \u2013 and two kinds of sleeping pills, the report said. At one point during his incarceration, he was on a cocktail of 25 different pills.\n\n\u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say he was in a so-called \u2018drugged-up state,\u2019\u201d Teruichi Shimomitsu, a doctor and retired member of the watchdog body, wrote in a letter last May to then-Justice Minister Yoko Kamikawa.\n\nNaoaki Torisu, a senior Justice Ministry official responsible for overseeing immigration detention centers, said parts of the committee\u2019s report were \u201cunclear.\u201d\n\n\u201cDetainees take pills prescribed according to their medical needs,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cI cannot grasp the exact intent behind the committee\u2019s statement.\u201d\n\nTwo psychiatrists cited in a November 2014 national Immigration Bureau report said the Iranian\u2019s medications did not cause him to choke.\n\nThe prescription of sedatives and antidepressants is common in Japan\u2019s detention centers, say doctors and detainees. Some inmates told Reuters they were given sedatives after arguing with guards or other detainees. Others said they became dependent on the drugs as they faced indefinite detention.\n\nChecks are needed to ensure doctors do not prescribe \u201cmassive amounts\u201d of sedatives to keep \u201crebellious\u201d detainees quiet, Shimomitsu wrote in his letter to then-Justice Minister Kamikawa.\n\nThe Justice Ministry\u2019s Torisu disputed that sedatives were used to pacify troublesome detainees. \u201cPsychiatrists prescribe them because they are deemed medically necessary,\u201d he said.\n\n(Edited by Peter Hirschberg)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - In the 13 months before Niculas Fernando died in a Japanese immigrat", "title": "Special Report: Death, drugs and detention in Japan's immigration system", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/08/Special-Report-Death-drugs-and-detention-Japans-immigration-system", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/japan-detention_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/08/Special-Report-Death-drugs-and-detention-Japans-immigration-system", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/japan-detention_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - In the 13 months before Niculas Fernando died in a Japanese immigrat", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "TOKYO (Reuters) - In the 13 months before Niculas Fernando died in a Japanese immigration detention center in 2014, three other men suffered the same fate.\nThe watchdog report drew attention to what it said was the heavy prescription of drugs to detainees.\nLike Fernando, Wandji died after being moved to an observation cell so his condition could be monitored.\n\u2022 Saeid Ghadimi, a 33-year-old Iranian, choked on food and died on March 29, 2014, at the East Japan Immigration Detention Center in Ibaraki prefecture, a sprawling complex set among rice paddies northeast of Tokyo.\n\u2022 Anwar Hussin, 57, a Rohingya from Myanmar, died on Oct. 14, 2013, after suffering a stroke while being held at the same detention center as Fernando."}
