The Court\u2019s effort to do its job stands in stark contrast to the Senate\u2019s, and may actually be working.\n\nSecond, if the presidential race does come down to Clinton vs. Trump, all this stalling may be just that\u2014stalling the inevitable. Maybe Garland will be confirmed in November in order to avoid a Justice Obama or other Hillary Clinton nominee. Maybe Clinton will put up a progressive next February, with the Senate having flipped to a Democrat majority\u2014perhaps driven by opposition to Trump. Either way, maybe this constitutional blip won\u2019t really matter that much in terms of the composition of the court.\n\nMost importantly, though, the #nevergarland/#doyourjob mess may finally accomplish something no presidential candidate has managed to do in the last 50 years: get Americans to care about who\u2019s on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe baseline is low. Most Americans cannot name more than a single Supreme Court justice\u2014a 2012 survey found that two-thirds couldn\u2019t name even one. A 2015 Gallup poll found that 44% of Americans had either never heard of Justice Scalia, or had no opinion of him.\n\nAnd with political opinions already polarized, elections are generally decided based on core issues: it\u2019s the economy, stupid \u2013 plus foreign policy/war, a few social issues (this year, immigration and race; other years, homosexuality), and personality.\n\nNot surprisingly, when Americans are polled about the issues most important to them, the Supreme Court tends to be at the bottom of the list.\n\nThis, of course, is infuriating to people who are civically engaged, who have, over the years, made eloquent cases for the Supreme Court being the most important issue at stake in presidential elections. In recent years, the Supreme Court has transformed our electoral system (mostly for the worse), made same-sex marriage a national right, saved Obamacare, and issued hundreds of lesser-known but crucial rulings on criminal law, corporate law, environmental law, and labor law. Except for the President, Supreme Court justices are probably the most powerful individuals in American government.\n\nThe unimportance of the Court to voters also belies the specious request by Senate Republicans to \u201clet the people decide\u201d the next nominee. Of course, the people already decided in 2012 when they re-elected President Obama to a four-year term. But really, they never decide; except for a few anti-abortion conservatives who would surely vote Republican anyway, the Supreme Court is not on their minds at all.\n\nCould this year be different?\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet, of course. Julia Azari at FiveThirtyEight argues that the effect will be limited, because people\u2019s minds will be made up anyway, and the Court issue will follow, rather than lead, those opinions.\n\nI think there\u2019s reason for more optimism, though. Three reasons, in fact.\n\nFirst, even if the net effect on the election result is limited, it\u2019s at least likely that the Supreme Court will be a higher profile issue, which could boost its importance in the long term, even if it doesn\u2019t swing the 2016 election results.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

It\u2019s ridiculous that Americans know so little and care so little about the Supreme Court, and changing that situation is more important than how it cuts in any particular election. I wouldn\u2019t say that the net benefit to democracy is worth the disservice to democracy that the Senate is now creating, but it is, at the very least, an unintended side benefit.\n\nSecond, responding to conservative concerns that this thrice-married, greed-driven New Yorker is insufficiently religiously pious and/or socially conservative, Donald Trump has promised to put extreme conservatives on the Supreme Court: not just justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade and same-sex marriage, but ideologues like Judge William Pryor, who has said Roe created a right to murder unborn children, and Judge Diane Sykes, who has issued several rulings to the right of Supreme Court precedent on taxpayer support for religious groups that engage in discrimination.\n\nTrump has even offered to outsource much of the evaluation process to the Heritage Foundation, the right-wing think tank funded by the Coors family, the Koch Brothers, the Bradley Foundation, the Scaife Foundation, and the Olin Foundation\u2014the leading funders of America\u2019s far-right infrastructure, the Tea Party, the opposition to Obamacare, the successful effort to erase campaign finance regulations and voting rights laws, and so on.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation and its various affiliates have supported the government shutdown in 2013, opposed all attempts at immigration reform, and pushed the virulent opposition to Obamacare, even though Heritage wonks originally invented the individual mandate back in 1989.\n\nIn other words, a Trump-packed court would not simply tilt to the right, but fall over itself to the right, taking the country with it. And with an open spot on the Court, this issue would be an immediate, rather than an abstract, one.\n\nThird, to the extent the Senate\u2019s obstructionism is properly understood as Republican obstructionism, it could help defeat the myth that \u201cthe system is broken\u201d due to vague, non-partisan \u201cWashington gridlock.\u201d That myth are false, and they have led to the populist revolts of both Trump and Sanders, each of whom blame \u201cthe system\u201d rather than Republican obstructionism.\n\nBut \u201cthe system\u201d didn\u2019t bring us Citizens United; Republican activists, funders, judges, and legislators did. \u201cThe system\u201d hasn\u2019t blocked health insurance for millions of Americans; Republican governors have, by refusing to accept Obamacare even at the expense of their own constituents. And \u201cthe system\u201d isn\u2019t responsible for the stalemate on Judge Garland. President Obama did his job, and the Republican majority in the Senate chose not to do its, under the thinnest of flim-flam pretexts.\n\nTo the extent that this accurate narrative, rather than \u201cthe system is broken,\u201d can take hold, it can work to the advantage of those trying to do the job of governance, rather than those in the Senate and on the campaign trail who wish to torpedo it.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "jaymichaelson"}, "keywords": "Google, Merrick Garland, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201604291033, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "If nothing else, raising the visibility of the Supreme Court as a key election issue can help rouse the American public from its irresponsible indifference to it.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Why the Merrick Garland Fight Is Good for Democracy", "tags": "syndication:syndication-google,entity:person/merrick-garland,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Why the Merrick Garland Fight Is Good for Democracy\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/29/why-the-merrick-garland-fight-is-good-for-democracy.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2016/04/29/why-the-merrick-garland-fight-is-good-for-democracy/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/48730881.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2016/04/29/why-the-merrick-garland-fight-is-good-for-democracy\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-04-29T10:33:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Jay Michaelson\",\"tags\":[\"syndication-google\",\"merrick-garland\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Google, Merrick Garland, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jay Michaelson", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2016-04-29T10:33:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jay-michaelsonhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2016/04/29/why-the-merrick-garland-fight-is-good-for-democracy", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "If nothing else, raising the visibility of the Supreme Court as a key election issue can help rouse the American public from its irresponsible indifference to it.", "title": "Why the Merrick Garland Fight Is Good for Democracy", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/29/why-the-merrick-garland-fight-is-good-for-democracy.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2016/04/29/why-the-merrick-garland-fight-is-good-for-democracy/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1461926448507.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jay-michaelson", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "Except for the President, Supreme Court justices are probably the most powerful individuals in American government.\nMost Americans cannot name more than a single Supreme Court justice\u2014a 2012 survey found that two-thirds couldn\u2019t name even one.\nMaybe Garland will be confirmed in November in order to avoid a Justice Obama or other Hillary Clinton nominee.\nNot surprisingly, when Americans are polled about the issues most important to them, the Supreme Court tends to be at the bottom of the list.\nJulia Azari at FiveThirtyEight argues that the effect will be limited, because people\u2019s minds will be made up anyway, and the Court issue will follow, rather than lead, those opinions."}
