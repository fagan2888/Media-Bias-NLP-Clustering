Never one to shy away from hot-button issues, the 66-year-old comic shared his candid thoughts on the recent shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., Bill Cosby\u2019s never-ending rape allegations and, of course, Bernie Sanders \u2014 because socialism.\n\nMuch of Black\u2019s passion, however, came out while discussing P.C. culture. Particularly, in relation to recent news that Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock have stopped performing at colleges because of the overbearing political correctness that \u201ckids these days\u201d have.\n\nBlack, we learn, is not above doing the college circuit (You listening, overbearingly P.C. college students?).\n\nThe excerpts below have been lifted from The Daily Beast\u2019s interview which you can read in full here.\n\nBlack says that college political correctness is definitely a thing \u2014 but not to the extent that Seinfeld and Rock claim it is: \u201cI think that some [college kids] are too politically correct, but I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a sweeping thing,\u201d Black says. \u201cIf I feel it\u2019s in the audience, I just go after them. I just go after them for what they\u2019re trying to pull. You don\u2019t pull that kind of shit at a comedy show. I just turn it around on them\u2026 When I walk onto a college campus, I know there are certain things\u2014and I never know what it is\u2014where they\u2019re not gonna laugh the way other audiences laugh. And as soon as that happens, I go right after them and tell them why they missed the joke, and why it doesn\u2019t apply. And that they can take that bullshit and go leave it at the door\u2014and I explain it to them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Black has a much different approach to college shows than Seinfeld: He just tells everyone not to \"pull that sh*t\"", "title": "Lewis Black disagrees with Jerry Seinfeld: \u201cI have not felt that deep-seated sense of political correctness\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Black has a much different approach to college shows than Seinfeld: He just tells everyone not to \"pull that sh*t\"", "title": "Lewis Black disagrees with Jerry Seinfeld: \u201cI have not felt that deep-seated sense of political correctness\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/24/lewis_black_disagrees_with_jerry_seinfeld_i_have_not_felt_that_deep_seated_sense_of_political_correctness/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-20-at-8.36.57-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Black has a much different approach to college shows than Seinfeld: He just tells everyone not to \"pull that sh*t\"", "title": "Lewis Black disagrees with Jerry Seinfeld: \u201cI have not felt that deep-seated sense of political correctness\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-20-at-8.36.57-AM.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Colin Gorenstein", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Chris Rock, inside out, Jerry Seinfeld, lewis black", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfdd3\"", "article_summary": "Particularly, in relation to recent news that Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock have stopped performing at colleges because of the overbearing political correctness that \u201ckids these days\u201d have.\nBlack says that college political correctness is definitely a thing \u2014 but not to the extent that Seinfeld and Rock claim it is: \u201cI think that some [college kids] are too politically correct, but I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a sweeping thing,\u201d Black says.\nTopics: Chris Rock, inside out, Jerry Seinfeld, lewis black, Entertainment NewsLewis Black, the \u201ccomedic firebrand\u201d who voices \u201cAnger\u201d in Pixar\u2019s latest home-run \u201cInside Out,\u201d recently spoke with The Daily Beast about a number of headline-news items sweeping the blogosphere.\nAnd that they can take that bullshit and go leave it at the door\u2014and I explain it to them.\u201d\nBlack, we learn, is not above doing the college circuit (You listening, overbearingly P.C."}
