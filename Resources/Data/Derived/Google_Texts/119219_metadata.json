A Swiss Guard tells him how his favorite soccer team, San Lorenzo, is doing back in his home city of Buenos Aires.\n\nDespite the pontiff\u2019s apparent resistance to technology, the Vatican has recently moved to become more active online and in multimedia.\n\nPapal accounts on social media site Twitter now send out messages in nine languages, while an adviser to the Vatican in May said the Holy See should start providing more multimedia content.\n\nLM/AMB END SCAMMELL", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Institutions, Catholic, Internet, Pope Francis, pornography, technology, Vatican", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "VATICAN CITY (RNS) Pope Francis has decried the \u201cfilth\u201d of online pornography and warned people against wasting time on their computers.", "title": "Pope warns against being \u2018too attached to the computer\u2019", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/08/pope-warns-attached-computer/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shutterstock_102766751.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rosiescammell"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/08/pope-warns-attached-computer/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/08/pope-warns-attached-computer/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "VATICAN CITY (RNS) Pope Francis has decried the \u201cfilth\u201d of online pornography and warned people against wasting time on their computers."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0791\"", "article_summary": "VATICAN CITY (RNS) Pope Francis has decried the \u201cfilth\u201d of online pornography and warned people against wasting time on their computers.\nDespite the pontiff\u2019s apparent resistance to technology, the Vatican has recently moved to become more active online and in multimedia.\nA Swiss Guard tells him how his favorite soccer team, San Lorenzo, is doing back in his home city of Buenos Aires.\n\u201cThere are two different elements here: method and content,\u201d he said, according to Vatican Radio.\nSpeaking aboard the papal plane after his visit on Saturday (June 6) to Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s capital of Sarajevo, the pontiff took a two-pronged approach to modern technology."}
