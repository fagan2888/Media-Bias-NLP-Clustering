It hasn\u2019t held up as well as the song. And that prompted bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel write a piece for the Atlantic headlined \u201cWhy I Hope to Die at 75.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the time I reach 75, I will have lived a complete life,\u201d he wrote. Emanuel went on to say that he doesn\u2019t actually intend to check out at 75, but he does intend to forego any extraordinary measures that would artificially extend his life. He doesn\u2019t want to become a burden on those younger than him.\n\nGood for him, I say. But then I\u2019m a conservative\n\nAs for all of those people who objected to Emanuel\u2019s piece on the grounds that there should be no limits on end-of-life spending under Medicare, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call them. They\u2019re certainly not conservatives.\n\nThey were all over the internet last week repeating some variant on this mantra: \u201cEnd-of-life decisions should be between the patient and the doctor.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s like saying your decision on what sort of car to buy should be between you and your car dealer. Fine - if you\u2019re paying for it. Buy yourself a Porsche.\n\nBut if I\u2019m paying for it, you\u2019re getting a Ford Taurus \u2013 and a used one at that.\n\nBy that standard, there would be about 10,000 Tauruses on the road for every Porsche. Most of these people are under the mistaken impression they\u2019ll be paying their own way when they\u2019re over 65. Nonsense. In America, those on Medicare do not pay anywhere near the full cost of their insurance. And that is causing it to go bankrupt.\n\nThat comes from a more serious work on the topic released last week, a 500-page study titled \u201cDying in America\u201d by the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\u201cDespite popular misconceptions, Medicare is funded by current contributions and revenues,\u201d the study states. \u201cIn general, beneficiaries have not fully \u2018paid in\u2019 during their working years for the benefits they later \u2018take out.\u2019 In 2010, for example, a one-income, average-wage couple took out more than $6.00 in Medicare benefits for every $1.00 paid in.\u201d\n\nIf the government\u2019s picking up 83 percent of your medical bills, it\u2019s silly to say the government should have no say in what services you receive. Yet that\u2019s what a writer on the putatively conservative American Thinker site did last week. M. Catharine Evans attacked the study\u2019s authors for suggesting that patients should be counseled on cheaper options when they\u2019re ready to check out.\n\n\u201cA lot of God-fearing Americans do not want a bunch of right-to-die doctors deciding when life should end or engaging in death conversations with their children,\u201d Evans wrote.\n\nFine. Pay your own hospital bill. Nobody\u2019s stopping you. But unless you\u2019re one of the Buffetts \u2013 Warren or Jimmy \u2013 you probably can\u2019t afford $100,000 or so a week to be treated in an intensive care ward as you await your appointment with St. Peter.\n\nHowever the idea that the government should pick up that tab represents nothing more than an endorsement of the system in effect in Townshend\u2019s country, socialized medicine. The difference is that in England they accept that in return for low costs they get low-quality care. They get Mini-Cooper care on a Mini-Cooper budget. Here, people want Porsche-level care on a Taurus budget.\n\nThis point is lost on the sort of boobs who are given voice on the internet. The comments on that American Thinker article quickly descended into a violation of \u201cGodwin\u2019s Law,\u201d the rule that the thread must stop whenever a commenter descends into Nazi comparisons. Of the hundreds of commenters, only one made sense:\n\n\u201cThe best medical care gets better (and more expensive) every year,\u201d the guy wrote. \u201cTen thousand people a day turn 65. Good thing printing presses and paper are no longer needed to mint money, we would run out of ink.\u201d\n\nExactly. If we ever returned to the gold standard - as Republican Senate candidate Jeff Bell proposes in his uphill battle against incumbent Cory Booker - we\u2019d have to make massive cuts to Medicare. Add a balanced budget amendment and Medicare simply couldn\u2019t continue to exist in its present form.\n\nBut that won\u2019t happen. The politicians will keep pandering to my generation. As for future generations, they better hope they die before they get old.\n\n\n\nCOMMENTS PLEASE STICK TO THE TOPIC: I noted that a lot of commenters are going off on tangents about private insurance, Obamacare, etc. Those comments belong elsewhere. This column is about Medicare and Medicaid, as is the report I noted. You can find a copy of it here.\n\ndying in america.pdf\n\nIt's 500 pages and I don't expect you to read the whole thing. But please read at least the summary and some chapter headings before commenting.\n\n.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "columns, obamacare, paul-mulshine, opinion", "title": "My generation is kidding itself about Medicare: Mulshine", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"My generation is kidding itself about Medicare: Mulshine\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/09/my_generation_is_kidding_itself_about_medicare_mulshine.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/01/-4b0856d94f6f939f.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14038322\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-09-28T11:46:44Z\", \"author\": \"Paul Mulshine | The Star Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@politics\",\"@river\",\"columns\",\"obamacare\",\"paul-mulshine\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/01/-4b0856d94f6f939f.JPG", "creator": "@Mulshine", "description": "Most of my fellow baby boomers are under the mistaken impression that they've paid the cost of their Medicare coverage; in fact Medicare is a welfare program and they're passing the bill to the next generation.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, September 28, 2014, 10:29 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2014/01/-4b0856d94f6f939f.JPG\", \"author_name\": \"pmulshin\", \"author_nickname\": \"Paul Mulshine | The Star Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"2371\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Opinion\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Most of my fellow baby boomers are under the mistaken impression that they've paid the cost of their Medicare coverage; in fact Medicare is a welfare program and they're passing the bill to the next generation.", "title": "My generation is kidding itself about Medicare: Mulshine", "url": "http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/09/my_generation_is_kidding_itself_about_medicare_mulshine.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/01/-4b0856d94f6f939f.JPG", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.mulshine"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, September 28, 2014,  7:46 AM", "article_author": "Paul Mulshine | The Star Ledger", "Description": "Most of my fellow baby boomers are under the mistaken impression that they've paid the cost of their Medicare coverage; in fact Medicare is a welfare program and they're passing the bill to the next generation."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fd5\"", "article_summary": "Fine - if you\u2019re paying for it.\nIn America, those on Medicare do not pay anywhere near the full cost of their insurance.\nAdd a balanced budget amendment and Medicare simply couldn\u2019t continue to exist in its present form.\nThis column is about Medicare and Medicaid, as is the report I noted.\n\u201cDespite popular misconceptions, Medicare is funded by current contributions and revenues,\u201d the study states."}
