Sydney Trains says it is \u201cunaware of any other residual signage\u201d.\n\nAt St James station, a locked steel gate from the southern disused platform leads to a tunnel which was intended as an air raid shelter. According to NSW Environment and Heritage it includes concrete blast doors and walls and \u201chistoric graffiti dating from the war years\u201d.\n\nAlthough Sydney was never bombed from the air, Mr Quint said people may have hurried to the tunnels during drills or following the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour in May, 1942.\n\nOther bomb shelters still dot Sydney, including at Cockatoo Island, the Eveleigh railway workshops and Luna Park Reserve.\n\nAt Waterloo Town Hall, now used as a library, a bomb shelter at the rear of the building was converted into an office.\n\nBill Phippen, of the Australian Railway Historical Society NSW, said to uncover something as ephemeral as a sign painted on a wall was unusual. \u201cIt\u2019s quite amazing that after 100 coats of paint, it\u2019s still there,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "It was painted at an anxious time when the threat of Japanese bombing raids hung in the air and train commuters had more to worry about than minding the gap.", "title": "Bomb shelter sign points to Sydney's anxious past", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/bomb-shelter-sign-points-to-sydneys-anxious-past-20140724-zwc6y.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/z/x/f/s/v/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zwc6y.png/1406454897117.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/z/x/f/s/v/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zwc6y.png/1406454897117.jpg"}, "description": "It was painted at an anxious time when the threat of Japanese bombing raids hung in the air and train commuters had more to worry about than minding the gap.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bomb shelter sign points to Sydney's anxious past"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "It was painted at an anxious time when the threat of Japanese bombing raids hung in the air and train commuters had more to worry about than minding the gap."}, "article_summary": "War relic: Commuters pass the air raid shelter sign uncovered at Town Hall station.\nAt Waterloo Town Hall, now used as a library, a bomb shelter at the rear of the building was converted into an office.\nDeep, unused railway tunnels at several inner-city stations were considered ideal bomb shelters during World War II.\nAdvertisement\u201cIt would become a landmark at Town Hall station \u2026 we want to see this safeguarded.\u201dA Sydney Trains spokesman said the sign is temporarily sealed off until heritage advice is obtained.\n\u201cIt is very important evidence of the use of \u2026 railway stations as emergency shelter during World War II, and in fact it may be the only evidence,\u201d he said."}
