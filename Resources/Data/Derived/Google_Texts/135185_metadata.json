Similarly, about twice as many Republicans (34%) as Democrats (18%) closely followed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress last Tuesday.\n\nThere are smaller partisan differences in interest in the week\u2019s other stories. For instance, comparable percentages of Democrats (26%) and Republicans (22%) paid very close attention to arguments at the Supreme Court over the Affordable Care Act; 30% of Democrats and 24% of Republicans very closely followed news about the Department of Justice report on race and policing in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nThe new national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted March 5-8 among 1,000 adults, finds wide racial and ideological differences in interest in the Ferguson report. Roughly four-in-ten blacks (42%) followed news about the report very closely, compared with 18% of whites and 13% of Hispanics. Nearly half of liberal Democrats (46%) paid very close attention to the Ferguson report, making it the top story of the week for liberal Democrats.\n\nBy contrast, 29% of conservative Republicans followed the Justice Department report on Ferguson very closely. The top stories of the week for conservative Republicans are news about Clinton\u2019s emails (44% following very closely) and Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress (43%).\n\nAs is typically the case, there are substantial age differences in news interest, with adults 50 and older paying more attention than those under 30 to the week\u2019s stories. But young people expressed especially low interest in stories about Netanyahu and Clinton\u2019s emails: Just 3% followed news about Netanyahu\u2019s address to C0ngress very closely, while just 4% said the same regarding news about Clinton\u2019s emails as secretary of state. Among those 50 and older, 29% followed news on Netanyahu\u2019s speech very closely and 22% tracked Clinton\u2019s emails very closely.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Survey Reports", "datasets": "march-5-8-2015-weekly-survey", "news_keywords": "publications,survey reports", "generator": "WordPress 4.5", "og": {"site_name": "Pew Research Center for the People and the Press", "description": "Survey Report From news about the economy to controversy over Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and the trial of the Boston marathon bomber, no single story dominated t", "title": "Far More Interest Among Republicans Than Democrats in Clinton Emails, Netanyahu", "url": "http://www.people-press.org/2015/03/09/far-more-interest-among-republicans-than-democrats-in-clinton-emails-netanyahu/", "image": {"width": 260, "identifier": "http://www.people-press.org/files/2015/03/News-interest-web-graphic-3.9.15.png", "height": 260}, "type": "article"}, "topics": "News Interest", "parsely-metadata": "{\"project\": \"\"}", "keywords": "publications,survey reports", "theme-color": "#D1A730", "date": 20150309, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pewresearch", "published_time": "2015-03-09T14:17:55+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Survey Report From news about the economy to controversy over Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and the trial of the Boston marathon bomber, no single story dominated t", "title": "Far More Interest Among Republicans Than Democrats in Clinton Emails, Netanyahu", "url": "http://www.people-press.org/2015/03/09/far-more-interest-among-republicans-than-democrats-in-clinton-emails-netanyahu/", "image": {"src": "http://www.people-press.org/files/2015/03/News-interest-web-graphic-3.9.15.png"}, "site": "@pewresearch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Survey Report From news about the economy to controversy over Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and the trial of the Boston marathon bomber, no single story dominated t"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe0e\"", "article_summary": "Far More Interest Among Republicans Than Democrats in Clinton Emails, NetanyahuLiberal Democrats More Likely to Track Ferguson ReportSurvey ReportFrom news about the economy to controversy over Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and the trial of the Boston marathon bomber, no single story dominated the public\u2019s news interest last week.\nTwo stories drew far more interest from Republicans than Democrats: 34% of Republicans followed reports about Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email address as secretary of state very closely, compared with just 16% of Democrats.\nSimilarly, about twice as many Republicans (34%) as Democrats (18%) closely followed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress last Tuesday.\nAmong those 50 and older, 29% followed news on Netanyahu\u2019s speech very closely and 22% tracked Clinton\u2019s emails very closely.\nNearly half of liberal Democrats (46%) paid very close attention to the Ferguson report, making it the top story of the week for liberal Democrats."}
