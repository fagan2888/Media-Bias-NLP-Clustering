In other words, vendors will come up with a solution to keep Washington from dictating the terms. Not clear yet what the final product will look like, but the vendors haven't been enthusiastic about congressional language on the subject. Allscripts, athenahealth, Cerner, eClinicalWorks, Epic, GE Healthcare, Greenway, Healthland, McKesson, MEDITECH, MEDHOST and NextGen Healthcare are all involved in the process.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSome health IT experts question whether the effort will be productive. Intermountain CIO Marc Probst, who attended an Oct. 2 meeting in Utah with the companies, doesn't think so. \"There's too many diverse interests associated with it,\" Probst said last week. \"Asking this group of people to solve interoperability is like asking the United Nations to come away with a global language.\"\n\nKLAS said that John Halamka, CIO of Beth Israel Deaconess, and other health IT leaders had created measures that would form the basis of the project. But Halamka has said he doubts interoperability can be measured. \u201cI would love to know ... because I don\u2019t know,\u201d Halamka told the Health IT Standards Committee in May. \u201cI know, we\u2019ll send C-CDAs and count the number you send; that will achieve a good result. Well look at meaningful use Stage 2 and the number of folks who sent C-CDAs to themselves or to what I\u2019m going to call electronic garbage cans as opposed to [someone else ]. Let\u2019s measure care coordination, close loop referrals or some other positive outcome.\u201d Halamka was responding to language in the House\u2019s 21st Century Cures Act that would decertify EHRs or penalize providers for failing interoperability measures.\n\n#LetDoctorsBeDoctors MOVEMENT LAUNCHES: Animated athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush has helped launch letdoctorsbedoctors.com, a social media campaign to enable doctors and tech companies to share stories about better ways to design and use EHRS. \u201cWe will bring that feedback to Washington to help influence developing health IT policy initiatives, including legislative efforts currently underway to improve the interoperability and usability of EMRs,\u201d Bush wrote in an op-ed published Monday by U.S. News & World Report. The campaign is reminiscent of the American Medical Association's \u201cBreak the Red Tape\u201d push this summer. Among the highlights from Bush\u2019s piece: \u201cHealth care is the only industry that has managed to lose productivity while going digital.\u201d\n\n\u2014 athena's Bush, in a keynote before the Hospital of Tomorrow event in Washington on Monday, noted progress in efforts to ease the flow of patient information. \"Somehow, starting in the first quarter of last year, hospitals and systems started to say yes,\" he said. More of them have connected their EHR systems to athenahealth's, allowing its clients to see more data when they need it. He praised meaningful use Stage 2 as an \"essential enabler\" of interoperability. \u201cBush isn't satisfied,\u201d Pro eHealth\u2019s Darius Tahir reports. \u201cHe aspires to another stage of interoperability, \u2018open platforms,\u2019 where developers can build software atop hospitals' EHRs, which he compared to travel site Kayak's ability to offer airlines' tickets directly on its web page.\u201d\n\neHealth tweet of the day: @kevinmd: This epic EHR video may save our sacred relationship with patients #LetDoctorsBeDoctors http://bit.ly/1Rkaxiq\n\nWelcome to Tuesday morning eHealth where your scribe continues to be dismayed by the coming cold weather and Washington's first frost of the year.

Ben Sasse on Monday vowed to block all HHS nominations. The Nebraska Republican wants the Obama administration to answer questions about failed nonprofit health insurers under the Affordable Care Act. Eight, including the one in Sasse\u2019s home state, have collapsed in recent weeks. Sasse wrote HHS in August seeking answers to several questions about the co-ops, but they haven't responded, he says. The letter: http://1.usa.gov/1M27sFJ\n\nSENATE NOT ACTING ON OBAMA NOMINEES: Our congressional team had this to report last week about Obama nominees pending before the Senate: As of earlier this month, \u201cthe current GOP Senate has moved 107 of Obama's picks, according to a Congressional Research Service report obtained by POLITICO. By comparison, the 2007 Democratic regime confirmed 192 of Bush's civilian nominees. Furthermore, Democrats say this Senate is on pace to confirm the fewest civilian nominees since the end of Ronald Reagan's presidency, the earliest records tracked on congressional databases.\u201d Their story: http://politi.co/1NH7fI5\n\nELLMERS\u2019 TOUGH REELECTION FANNED BY AFFAIR RUMORS: It appears that rumors about an alleged affair between House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Renee Ellmers, one of the few members of Congress who has shown interest in health IT, might harm the North Carolinian\u2019s hopes for re-election, our POLITICO colleagues report. Ellmers faces a tough primary challenger in the conservative second district. \u201cIf the rumors are true, then the [Ellmers] race gets instantly incredibly competitive. If they\u2019re not true, then it doesn\u2019t change that it\u2019s still competitive,\u201d said Carter Wrenn, a North Carolina Republican consultant who worked on Ellmers\u2019 2010 campaign. \u201cIf you come back here in February and no one\u2019s got ads on TV in her race, then she\u2019s probably going to win. But if someone is, she\u2019s got a real race and she could lose.\u201d The full story: http://politi.co/1LwPoOc\n\nON THE MOVE: In what would be a major coup for the health IT lobbying world. House Energy & Commerce health subcommittee staffer Robert Horne is leaving the committee to work for the Health IT Now Coalition and its sister lobbying organizations, our Darius Tahir reports. Both Horne and a spokesman for the Energy & Commerce Committee declined to comment. Horne was the main staffer behind the scenes pulling the strings on the House\u2019s 21st Century Cures Act.\n\nCISA ON DECK THIS WEEK?: The on-again, off-again cyber-threat info sharing bill currently pending in the Senate could come to the chamber floor as soon as this week. The Senate, which returns to session today, will begin consideration of an immigration bill with the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act to follow, according to a whip notice sent Monday. CISA, as it\u2019s known for short, creates safe-harbors to share information about cybersecurity threats and is supported by HIMSS, CHIME, the Federation of American Hospitals and HITRUST. It\u2019s been awaiting a vote on the Senate floor since July but keeps being delayed.\n\nSURVEY SAYS \u2014 CONSUMERS DON\u2019T USE DIGITAL YET: A survey of approximately 4,000 consumers from early-stage investor Rock Health indicates that people aren\u2019t quite on-board with digital health. Seventy-one percent of patients have searched for basic health information online \u2014 details on drugs, for example. Fifty-one percent have looked up online reviews of doctors. But adoption falls down after that, and only 7 percent of respondents have used telemedicine. (A similar percentage has used direct-to-consumer genetic services.)\n\nThere\u2019s good news for digital health entrepreneurs in here, though. The survey argues that the unhealthy are beginning to adopt many digital health services. Buyers of wearables are now more likely to be unhealthy than healthy, for example. And consumer satisfaction with telemedicine is high \u2014 over 70 percent in each of the categories (text, video, audio) measured.\n\nCARDIOLOGISTS TAKE TO THE HILL: More than 400 members of the American College of Cardiology will take to Capitol Hill today as part of their annual policy conference to discuss a number of issues, including \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 EHRs, interoperability and payment reform. The heart doctors want usable EHRs, clinically relevant standards and EHR vendor transparency. They also want Congress and the Obama administration to work with doctors to implement the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act and its Merit-based Incentive Payment System.\n\nMARK YOUR CALENDAR: The FCC\u2019s next Connect2Health Task Force event will take place next Tuesday and Wednesday in Detroit, with FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn attending. The meeting will examine urban health disparities, broadband as a social determinant of health and other issues.

The logic for mandatory FDA funding is equally straightforward,\u201d the letter states. \u201cIf FDA is given additional responsibilities without additional resources, the stage will be set for slowdowns, not faster speeds, in the review of new medical products.\u201d The letter: http://politico.pro/1W2EESf\n\nWHAT WE'RE CLICKING:\n\nBaby Boomers remain a challenge in mHealth adoption: http://bit.ly/1NR8KU6\n\n5 ways to fuel patient engagement: http://bit.ly/1LGkw1n\n\nTelemedicine isn\u2019t the future \u2014 it\u2019s now: http://bit.ly/1RSDuml\n\nTips, comments, suggestions?
