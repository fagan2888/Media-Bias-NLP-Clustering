Ted Cruz of Texas on Wednesday invited President Obama to come back from overseas and insult him to his face, and challenged Mr. Obama to a debate over the White House\u2019s Syrian refugee policy.\n\n\u201cMr. President, if you want to insult me, you can do it overseas, you can do it in Turkey \u2014 you can do it in foreign countries. But I would encourage you, Mr. President: Come back and insult me to my face,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, in video captured by NBC News. \u201cLet\u2019s have a debate on Syrian refugees right now. We can do it anywhere you want. I\u2019d prefer it in the United States and not overseas where you\u2019re making the insults.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to toss a cheap insult when no one can respond, but let\u2019s have a debate,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.\n\nIn the wake of the Paris attacks, Mr. Obama has criticized Republicans who are advocating that the U.S. turn away Muslim refugees from Syria.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person who\u2019s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefitted from protection when they were fleeing political persecution \u2014 that\u2019s shameful,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a press conference in Turkey this week. \u201cThat\u2019s not American. That\u2019s not who we are. We don\u2019t have religious tests to our compassion.\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, has said that Christians fleeing the region should be allowed to come into the United States, but not Muslims. Mr. Cruz\u2019s father fled Cuba and eventually ended up in the United States after living in Canada.\n\n\u201cI will say it\u2019s fairly remarkable that President Obama has now chosen two days in a row to attack me directly,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cHe just called me offensive; the day before he called me un-American.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, I think that\u2019s really quite rich that he chose to make both of those insults on foreign soil while he was abroad attacking me, and attacking everyone else in this country who believes we should not be bringing in tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees that the Obama administration cannot vet to determine whether or not they are ISIS terrorists,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.\n\n\u201cI gotta tell you \u2014 it is utterly unbefitting of the president to be engaging in those kind of personal insults and attacks,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
