People need simpler choices, as well as guidance that will nudge them toward the best plan for their needs.\n\nThat\u2019s what 401(k)s are designed to do\u2014though it took years for plans to evolve. As the traditional employer-managed defined benefit pension began to disappear, the early generations of 401(k)s and other defined contribution plans presented workers with new and complicated sets of investment choices.\n\nEmployees were so overwhelmed that many did nothing, leading Congress to pass reform laws to simplify 401(k) decisions, including providing default plan choices and using auto-enrollment\u2014putting employees into plans unless they opt out. Today many employers are going a step further by turning 401(k)s into pension-like plans, removing the need for decisions unless workers choose to make them.\n\n\n\nBut health insurance is still stuck in an old-school 401(k) world. Obamacare exchanges have created extensive menus of plan choices that many consumers don\u2019t understand. The exchange concept has also become popular among employer plans for both current workers and retirees. Exchange providers, led by big employee-benefits firms, are signing up lots of health insurers to offer employers and their workers extensive sets of plan choices.\n\nThe confusion extends to Medicare, as consumers are often required to choose among 30, 40 or more Medicare Advantage plans or Part D prescription drug plans. They are simply overmatched by the task, research shows.\n\nAs with 401(k)s, the primary problem consumers face with health insurance choices is that they don\u2019t understand how the policies work, studies show. Nor do they understand the industry jargon\u2014in the case of health insurance, that may mean even basic terms like deductibles and co-payments.\n\nConsider this alarming study: A Fortune 100 company offered 48 new health insurance plans to more than 50,000 employees. All of the plans were offered by the same health insurer and offered identical coverage. They differed only by premiums, deductibles and other cost-sharing variables.\n\nIn roughly 80% of their selections, workers made bad decisions\u2014opting for the low-deductible but high-premium plans that cost them more money yet provided no additional insurance protection. Lower-income and female employees made particularly bad choices.\n\nThe amounts of wasted money often equaled 40% or more of the employee\u2019s annual premium expenses. Employees who chose low-deductible plans paid $631 more on average in premiums, but saved only $259 a year in out-of-pocket costs compared with available higher-deductible plans.\n\nEven more discouraging, when researchers went back and told employees about their mistakes, it had very little effect. More than 70% of employees did not understand insurance well enough to make an informed choice. Further, it had never occurred to the workers that their employer would include lousy choices in its plan offerings, the researchers found.\n\nImproving insurance literacy is crucial in helping employees understand how to make better choices. But as behavioral research with 401(k)s has shown, the most effective solution is to reduce the number of plan choices and their complexity.\n\n\u201cThe promise of recent reforms that expand choice and aim to increase provider competition is premised on the assumption\u2014challenged by our research\u2014that enrollees will make sensible plan choices,\u201d the researchers concluded.\n\nSo how can you be a better health care consumer? Justin Sydnor, one of the researchers and an economist at the University of Wisconsin business school, suggests the dreaded school math-class crucible: the story problem. First consider how much you expect to spend on health care. Then calculate whether your total payments would be higher with a low-deductible plan or a high-deductible plan. Asking people to compare premiums with out-of-pocket expenses helped set his research subjects on the right course.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure how to estimate your future health care spending (and that\u2019s true for most people), run several calculations based on varying medical costs, Syndor says. For example, what would your out-of-pocket costs be if your health expenses were, say, $2,000 or $5,000 or $10,000 over the next year? You also can seek help from their employer\u2019s health plan administrator or from the free counseling available for Obamacare and Medicare enrollees.\n\nPhilip Moeller is an expert on retirement, aging, and health.
