â€” North Carolinians could have three insurance carriers to choose from when enrollment under the Affordable Care Act reopens in November.

The state Department of Insurance has approved individual plans from UnitedHealthcare for the online marketplace, but they still need to be approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services because the federal government operates the exchange.

During the initial Affordable Care Act enrollment period last fall, only Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and Coventry Health Care offered individual insurance through the exchange in North Carolina.

DOI spokeswoman Kerry Hall said state regulators have already approved Blue Cross individual plans for 2015 but are still reviewing Coventry plans and small-group plans proposed by Blue Cross.

Rates for the various plans won't be public until enrollment begins on Nov. 15.
