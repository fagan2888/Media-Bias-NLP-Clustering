When Andrew Walls, an employee of Delaware Surgery Center, found out he would have to undergo a colonoscopy back in October 2012 he decided the medical center he worked for was his best option. Walls is now suing his former employer over the emotional distress he suffers after going under anesthesia and waking up from this operation wearing pink women’s underwear.

"When the plaintiff recovered from the effects of the anesthesia administered by defendants, he awoke to realize that while he was unconscious pink women's underwear had been placed on his body," Walls’s attorney Gary Nitsche explains in a lawsuit filed with the New Castle County Superior Court. "When the plaintiff initially presented for his colonoscopy he had not been wearing pink women's underwear and at no time did the plaintiff voluntarily, knowingly or intentionally place the pink women's underwear upon himself."

The lawsuit does not explain the intent behind dressing Walls in pink lingerie other than to harass or embarrass him. When asked to comment on the suit this past Wednesday, Jennifer Anderson, surgery director at Delaware Surgery Center, told DelawareOnline, "We just found out about this yesterday afternoon." Nitsche claimed that his client should be rewarded compensation after suffering mental anguish, lost wages, and loss of earning capacity due to “severe emotion stress.”

“The defendant's extreme and outrageous conduct went beyond all possible bounds of decency,” Nitsche said in the suit. He also went on to say Walls’s colleagues at the surgery center, “failed to maintain proper policies and procedures for the care of patients with respect to not engaging in extreme and outrageous conduct.” Although Walls was an employee of Delaware Surgery Center when he underwent the procedure, it is unclear when he left the center and if he did so under his own volition.
