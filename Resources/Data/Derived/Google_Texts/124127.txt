Huffington Post is reporting that a New York Magazine infographic is shedding light on advancements in technology and stem-cell research which are making it possible for women to soon be able to receive prosthetic vaginas.

Journalist Matthew Giles attempted to explain to the site exactly how the whole process works:

“You’re taking cells from external genitalia and you’re creating … this scaffolding that you place the cells on, and then you implant it to actually create the cavity, and the body takes to it.”

He reveals two of the four women that have undergone the process at Wake Forest University have been able to menstruate.

Although Giles says clinical trials are “far off”, Dr. William Wagner, Director of the McGowan Insitute for Regenerative Medicine explains that the prosthetic vaginas only take a few weeks to grow in the lab, but doctors may be able to achieve faster results by placing the stem cells and scaffolding into “the incubator of the body” to grow.

Back in April, four young women with missing or abnormal vaginas were implanted with lab-grown vaginas made from their own cells which have proven to be indistinguishable from natural vaginas and have grown with the women who got the implants as teens as they’ve matured. These women reported normal vaginal function as they got older and became sexually active.

Admittedly science amazes and terrifies me, but I’m glad those who show an actual medical need for prosthestic vaginas like transgenders and women who have undergone some type of female genital mutilation now have a chance at an enjoyable sex life and can feel less self-conscious about their lady parts.

Do you think science is getting ahead of itself or is this a step in the right direction?
