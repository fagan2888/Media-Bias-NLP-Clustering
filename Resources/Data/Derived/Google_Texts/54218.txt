There will be no insurance industry left in three years. That is by design. You’re going to make insurance unaffordable for everyone — which is what they want. Because if there’s no private insurance left, what’s left? Government-centered, government-run, single-payer health care.

This is horrible for our country ... an absolute tragedy ... It breaks my heart folks to see this literal tragedy happen to this country ... Obamacare is going to cost this country two and half million jobs minimum."

ObamaCare is only making our economy worse, driving up health costs and making it harder for small businesses to hire.

I think that what’s going to come out of ObamaCare is worse than anybody can imagine. I think it will lead to bankruptcy in the states that are fully embracing it.

In a 2013 interview with CNBC's Larry Kudlow, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker argued that Obamacare was hampering the economic recovery. "They made a promise that nobody could actually deliver on, not just in terms of the website, but on the overall policy of Obamacare, which is an abysmal failure," Walker told Kudlow, adding, "It's not only a failure for Obamacare, it is continuing to be a wet blanket on the recovery of the nation's economy." "Firm after firm telling the White House, the administration this isn't going to work," Walker went on. "It's either one of those things where there not listening to the facts, or they're not being informed, in either case, it's troubling." "Troubling," Kudlow chimed in, "No CEO experience whatsoever."

Rush Limbaugh, 2/6/2014 John Boehner, 7/15/2012 Rand Paul, 2/20/2015 Scott Walker, 2/20/2015 There are definitely two sides to our politics today, and they are "right" and "wrong." In a sane world, that whole "wrong" crowd would never have a platform or be treated seriously again.
