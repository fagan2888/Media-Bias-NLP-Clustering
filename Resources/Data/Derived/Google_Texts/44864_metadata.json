We\u2019ve rated their fortunes on a scale of one turkey (least thankful) to three turkeys (most thankful). Happy Thanksgiving!\n\nOne Turkey\n\nJeb Bush: He is 2015\u2019s biggest flop. Unassertive in debates, unprepared for the modern confrontational campaign style, looks often as if he\u2019d rather be elsewhere. Ensnared himself in his brother\u2019s Iraq mess. Showing signs of life but, despite $100 million war chest, needs significant spike in support to survive Iowa and New Hampshire. Running a potentially fatal fifth in the state he governed.\n\nJohn Kasich: Good press notices for moderate presentation of conservative views won\u2019t help with GOP voters. Resisted pandering to populist anti-government, anti-immigrant outcry. But one-state focus on New Hampshire worked for John McCain in 2008 only because he started as the GOP favorite.\n\nChris Christie: Probably should have run in 2012. Despite assertiveness, has struggled to escape fallout from George Washington Bridge stoppage fiasco, image as a bully and home state disapproval. Also stressing New Hampshire, where Trump continues to dominate.\n\nCarly Fiorina: Brief spurt from confronting Trump\u2019s sexist comments faded when dramatic debate assertions about fetal experiments and female job loss proved untrue. Despite frequent strong audience receptions, can\u2019t match top contenders in money or organization.\n\nLindsey Graham: Like Kasich, might suffer from attempts at rationality. Benefit from assertive national security positions offset by moderate immigration stance. Never gained traction.\n\nRand Paul: Too isolationist and civil libertarian for hawkish, security conscious GOP. Luckily, can fall back on Senate re-election race.\n\nMike Huckabee: Second time not a charm.\n\nMartin O\u2019Malley: Outmaneuvered by Sanders to be top Clinton rival, despite innate strengths as a younger Democrat with governing experience. Clinton might be lucky he\u2019s not her main rival.\n\nTwo Turkeys\n\nMarco Rubio: Poised to become the establishment favorite when the field narrows. Wisely shepherded financial and human resources for maximum impact when it counts. Performed well in all four debates. Generational message resonates. Despite strongly conservative stances on abortion and climate change, and an immigration flip-flop, the GOP candidate Democrats fear most. His immediate challenge: Score an early victory, perhaps in South Carolina or Nevada.\n\nTed Cruz: Superior organizing in the first four states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada \u2014 and his college-honed debating skills have tempered initial judgments that he\u2019s too conservative to be nominated or elected. Benefiting in evangelical-dominated Iowa from failures of early dropouts Scott Walker and Bobby Jindal, weaknesses of Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum and increasing doubts about Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s policy chops. Confrontational style and a less-than-warm personality still pose long-term problems.\n\nDonald Trump: The unexpected GOP headliner \u2014 so far. Bombastic style captured anti-Washington GOP grass roots sentiment, driving support to levels only he could have imagined. Smart, charismatic, and willing to spend his millions. His savaging of rivals stirred resentment but often contained truths. Questions remain about his ability to expand support, his temperament and his lack of governmental experience. But has potential to sweep early tests.\n\nDr. Ben Carson: Another unexpected favorite, especially among evangelicals, who are influential in Iowa caucuses, South Carolina primary and March 1 Southern tests. Inspiring life story, low-key anti-Trump demeanor and an aura of niceness all helped. But exaggerations undercut that autobiography, and increased focus revealed weak command of issues. May have peaked.\n\nHillary Clinton: Started as strong Democratic front-runner. Still strong Democratic front-runner after effective debate performances, Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal, bravura show against overeager Benghazi inquisitors. Increased focus on foreign policy helps, as does rival Bernie Sanders\u2019 discomfort with it. Benefits as experienced, strong leader. But legal problems still lurk, ethical concerns hurt, and many voters simply don\u2019t like her.\n\nBernie Sanders: From curiosity to folk hero, struck a chord with Democratic Party\u2019s left wing and younger voters. Doppelganger Larry David reinforced kindly curmudgeon image. But doesn\u2019t control own destiny and having trouble expanding support. It\u2019s unlikely Democrats will nominate a 73-year-old Socialist. Would remain relevant by winning Iowa or New Hampshire, but could also face quick defeat there.\n\nThree Turkeys\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Another tough year, in which he seemed more contained than ISIS and France's Hollande and Russia's Putin looked like stronger leaders. Despite that he has more to be thankful for. He bolstered his legacy with long-sought agreement curbing Iranian nuclear development, and his cherished Affordable Care Act continued to survive Supreme Court tests and GOP legislative assaults. The best part: The end is in sight, just 14 months away.\n\nCarl P. Leubsdorf is the former Washington bureau chief of The Dallas Morning News.
