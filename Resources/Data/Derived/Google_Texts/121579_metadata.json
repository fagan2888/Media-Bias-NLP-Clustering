Almost two-thirds of Americans surveyed for a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll believe it is in the nation\u2019s interest to confront ISIS, while just 13 percent disagreed with such action.\n\nThough plainly enraged by the beheading of two American journalists by an ISIS fighter last month, the depths of the American public\u2019s tolerance for additional war is unclear. On the one hand, recent polling has shown Americans to be significantly more hawkish when asked about ISIS in particular.\n\nRelated: Why Taking on ISIS Could Be a Huge Fiscal Fiasco\n\nHowever, in a Gallup survey released yesterday, when Americans were asked to rank the top problems facing the U.S., terrorism barely cracked the top ten, with only 4 percent of respondents identifying it as the biggest issue facing the country. The \u201csituation in Iraq\u201d fared worse, with only 3 percent identifying it as a top concern. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found that a plurality of Americans (40 percent) would prefer to see the country play less of a role in world affairs, though the number was down from 47 percent in April.\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon (R-CA), in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute on Thursday said that while he supports Obama\u2019s move against ISIS and hopes it will succeed, he believes the president has underestimated the difficulty of the task.\n\n\u201cI sense that he may have allowed politics to limit our chances for success,\u201d McKeon said, partly because of the nation\u2019s doubts about committing troops to another foreign conflict. \u2018\u201dNow, most of us cringe at the term \u2018boots on the ground,\u2019 he said. \u201cBut we need to talk about what \u201cboots on the ground\u201d actually means. Some have taken it to mean large occupying forces in a hostile land. That\u2019s a red herring. In fact the best way to ensure that we never have to drop an entire maneuver corps into Iraq is to be smart about using the right boots on the ground today.\u201d\n\nRelated: GOP Dilemma \u2013 Support Obama on ISIS or Blame Him for Mideast Mistakes\n\n\u201cThe president wants to use a light footprint now in hopes that he doesn\u2019t need a heavy footprint later,\u201d McKeon said. He acknowledged that Obama has already sent in Special Forces operators, but he insisted that more manpower will be required. \u201cI want our coalition to go all-in now, so that we do not risk having to use enormously more blood and treasure later,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn a discussion after his speech, McKeon was asked about the impact recent cuts to Defense spending have had on the military and whether the effort against ISIS would add to the strain on the troops. McKeon said that readiness has already been seriously damaged by sequester cuts, and that the addition of two new missions within the space of a week \u2013 bombing ISIS and assisting with the Ebola crisis in West Africa \u2013 will result in a military stretched dangerously thin.\n\nAt some point, McKeon said, the administration will either have to stop adding missions or stop withdrawing resources from the Pentagon.\n\nA GOP Congressional aide said that momentum to undo the sequester seems to be building in the House.\n\n\u201cFor the last six months separate and aside from the mechanism of sequester\u2026there has been an increasing bipartisan acknowledgement that DOD was too much of the bill payer,\u201d the aide said. \u201cWe have unintentionally done damage to the health of the force. There is a growing consensus among members that they need to find a way to reverse that.\u201d\n\nRelated: 9 Ways the White House Plans to Defeat ISIS\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney, who spoke at AEI yesterday, voiced similar concerns about the state of the military, decrying the recent \u201cmassive reductions\u201d in Defense spending.\n\n\u201cIn this very time of hasty withdrawals, continuous disengagement, and such self- congratulation for all of it, we have also seen dramatic and devastating drawdowns in the military power of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nCalling for \u201ca new commitment to restoring our nation\u2019s military preparedness,\u201d Cheney said, \u201c[T]he defense budget is different from every other part of our federal budget. In most other areas, you start with questions like, what do we have and what can we afford? When you are looking at the defense budget of the United States, you start with the question: what do we need?\n\n\u201cBut that kind of careful thought is not what is driving the massive defense reductions now underway. And whatever the thinking behind these decisions, it bears little relation to a strategic environment that is complex, demanding, and becoming more dangerous by the day.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The president\u2019s decision to lead a NATO-backed military campaign against ISIS coincide", "title": "Americans Want ISIS Destroyed, But Do They Want Another War?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/11/Americans-Want-ISIS-Destroyed-Do-They-Want-Another-War", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/09012014_ISIS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/11/Americans-Want-ISIS-Destroyed-Do-They-Want-Another-War", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/09012014_ISIS.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The president\u2019s decision to lead a NATO-backed military campaign against ISIS coincide", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe25f7\"", "article_summary": "On the one hand, recent polling has shown Americans to be significantly more hawkish when asked about ISIS in particular.\nThough plainly enraged by the beheading of two American journalists by an ISIS fighter last month, the depths of the American public\u2019s tolerance for additional war is unclear.\nAlmost two-thirds of Americans surveyed for a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll believe it is in the nation\u2019s interest to confront ISIS, while just 13 percent disagreed with such action.\nCalling for \u201ca new commitment to restoring our nation\u2019s military preparedness,\u201d Cheney said, \u201c[T]he defense budget is different from every other part of our federal budget.\nWhen you are looking at the defense budget of the United States, you start with the question: what do we need?"}
