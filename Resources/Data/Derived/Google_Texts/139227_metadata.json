Because information took a long time to process, Blue Cross Blue Shield ended up paying out claims for customers who did not have active health plans.\n\nVermont Gov. Peter Shumlin\u2019s administration recently made upgrades to Vermont Health Connect that should let staff make changes to customer accounts automatically.
