I believe my parents had a right to know who was coming into their home.\n\nMy husband says she has not had issues for a while and that I have prejudiced them against her forever. Was I wrong on this?\n\nA: You both have valid perspectives, so the true wrong here is the lack of communication before your decision was made.\n\nFrom your description here, your sister-in-law\u2019s past history could be anything from youthful mistakes to chronic criminal activity or even a mental health problem, with each scenario requiring a different level of discretion. A conversation between you two would have served these nuances well, and perhaps your husband could have offered an alternative to full disclosure: like a buddy that kept a close eye on her.\n\nYou and your husband have the right to have big decisions involving a relative\u2019s well-being talked about respectfully and thoroughly \u2014 especially important once you have that baby.\n\nQ: A friend of mine is so unbelievably needy that I just can\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nStuff, errands, favors, time \u2014 I used to offer things just to be nice, and not only would she take me up on them each and every time, but she would ask for something further or exploit my generosity.\n\nI feel like I am always meeting her needs and she is never bothering to ask about mine.\n\nA: Repeat after me: I shall not offer any favor that I would grumble about fulfilling. And: \u201cjust to be nice\u201d means just that, and requires actually wanting to be nice (or at least faking it convincingly).\n\nIn addition, you\u2019ve got to learn to say no. It\u2019s a difficult skill, but flexing that muscle is a favor not just to yourself, but also to the friend that otherwise you will swiftly begin to resent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t do that for you this week.\u201d \u201cI wish I could help, but I have to say no.\u201d Then a breath. Don\u2019t justify or embellish: Simply borrow from Nancy Reagan and Just Say No.\n\nHopefully, this will allow you to enjoy her company again. If not, it\u2019s time to re-evaluate if she\u2019s capable of being the friend you need.\n\nAndrea Bonior, a clinical psychologist, writes a weekly mental health advice column for The Washington Post\u2019s Express and is author of \u201cThe Friendship Fix.\u201d For more information, visit www.drandreabonior.com.
