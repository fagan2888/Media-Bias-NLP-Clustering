President Barack Obama is planning to travel to La Crosse, Wisconsin, Thursday – this will be his first visit to the city since being elected.

The White House confirmed his visit to the La Crosse Tribune saying, “the president will travel to the La Crosse, Wisconsin, area for an event on the economy.”

WEAU reports his visit was originally scheduled to take place last week, but was rescheduled due to a conflict.

Obama is coming off what has been described as the best 10 days of his presidency after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Obamacare and same-sex marriage.

His eulogy for Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was among the nine killed during Bible study at a South Carolina church earlier this month, also drew rave reviews, the Post Crescent reports.

Obama last visited La Crosse on October 2008, during his first presidential campaign, the La Crosse Tribune notes.

This will also be the first time a sitting U.S. President has visited La Crosse since 2004, when George W. Bush made an appearance, the newspaper adds.
