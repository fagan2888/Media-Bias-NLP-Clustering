Biden criticized voter ID laws Monday, saying progress on civil rights and economic justice depend on minorities having unimpeded access to the ballot booth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never thought we\u2019d be fighting the fight again on voting rights,\u201d Mr. Biden said in Washington at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast hosted by the National Action Network. \u201cThis has been the ultimate fight because our opponents know, they know, the single most dangerous thing to give us is the right to vote.\u201d\n\nThe vice president criticized efforts in North Carolina and Alabama \u2014 he didn\u2019t mention his native state of Pennsylvania \u2014 where Republicans have pushed for laws requiring photo IDs to vote. In Pennsylvania, a judge on Friday threw out the state\u2019s voter ID law, although the ruling could be appealed to the state Supreme Court.\n\nMr. Biden noted that King wrote in 1965 that voting \u201cis the foundation stone for political action.\u201d He urged his audience to guard against \u201cnew attempts by states and localities to limit ballot access without the full protection of the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time we take stock,\u201d Mr. Biden said, adding that Washington is \u201con the brink\u201d of major social change such as immigration reform and wage laws that depend on preserving the right for all to vote.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re on the brink of bringing 11 million people out of the shadows onto a path to citizenship, making us not only a more humane country but a more economically successful country,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the process of guaranteeing that no one who works 40 hours a week will have to continue to live in poverty. We\u2019re going to raise that minimum wage.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think we\u2019re in the final stages of rectifying the injustice of income inequality between women and men. Not only is it unjust for women to make 77 cents on the dollar compared with a man, it\u2019s stupid economically. It\u2019s against our economic interests. And it\u2019s way past time that we stop arguing about whether every American has the right to adequate affordable health care. Thanks to Barack Obama, that fight is over and we are not going back. Period.\u201d\n\nThe president is making economic equality a major theme of his policies this year as he promotes Democratic initiatives in the midterm elections. Mr. Obama, as he did last year, is pushing for an increase in the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $10.10.\n\n\u201cAs in the past, we shall overcome,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cBut let me remind you all, it all rests ultimately on the ballot box.\u201d\n\nThe vice president also took the Supreme Court to task for its 2012 ruling that gutted Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires certain states with a history of voter discrimination to get pre-clearance from the Justice Department before making changes to existing voter laws.\n\nMr. Biden said dissenting Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u201cgot it right when she said throwing out the existing process when it\u2019s working and continues to work is \u2018like throwing away an umbrella in a rainstorm because you\u2019re not getting wet.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now we\u2019re in a hailstorm,\u201d the vice president said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama will meet with the Presidential Commission on Election Administration, which Mr. Obama appointed in March to review issues such as long lines on Election Day in certain voting precincts. The panel issued a report last month that said nearly half of Americans live in voting districts where long lines were a problem in the 2012 general election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vice President Joseph R.
