A draft of the letter was released Monday to a group of health care reporters at the National Library of Medicine. Dr. Clement McDonald, lead author of the study and director of the NLM Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, presented the letter, \u201cThe Use of Internist's Free Time by Ambulatory Care Electronic Medical Record Systems.\u201d\n\nThe findings came from a 19-question survey that the American College of Physicians sent in December 2012 to 900 ACP members and 102 non-members. They received a 53.6 percent response rate; respondents had used 61 different EMR systems.\n\nThe mean loss for trainees was lower than the average, at 18 minutes a day. \u201cWe can only speculate as to whether better computer skills, shorter (half-day) clinic assignments with proportionately less exposure to EMR time costs, or other factors account for the trainees\u2019 smaller per-day time loss,\u201d the study read.\n\nTime taken to fill out records at the Veteran's Affairs department was also less, even though the agency has come under criticism as military and veteran patients died while waiting to be seen by health care providers. The agency's Computer Patient Record System was associated with the least amount of time lost, an average of 20 minutes a day. McDonald says part of the reason for this is that the agency adopted the technology much earlier than the rest of the health care industry.\n\nHospitals, clinics and individual providers have moved more slowly toward digital use than other industries, such as banking or shopping. President Barack Obama championed electronic health care records during his first presidential campaign, then pushed their implementation to lay the groundwork for the nation\u2019s health care reform package.\n\nTo encourage adoption of the technology, doctors and hospitals were given $27 billion in the 2008 economic stimulus, a flood of money the government tried to use to jump-start the economy during the Great Recession.\n\nThe money, distributed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was intended to encourage health care organizations to adopt electronic records, and penalize them through lower Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements if they did not comply. The law requires health care providers to demonstrate not only that they are using electronic health records, but that those records meet requirements outlined by the government.\n\nHealth care providers are using iPads more frequently, and some have taken on Google Glasses. McDonald says he would like to see health care providers record patient visits, so they can take their diagnosis home to go over it with family members, when they are not overwhelmed in a doctor's office or hospital with the information they have just been given.\n\nThere still are numerous disconnects for implementation, however. Different digital record systems do not work with each other, for example, and doctors can miss visual cues when they are looking at a computer instead of at a patient. Some patients do not understand the systems and think doctors are checking their email during an appointment.\n\nTo avoid this, some doctors will talk to patients while scribes type information into a computer, but that is less cost-effective. \u201cHumans like to do things quickly and efficiently,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cYou can\u2019t always do something magically faster with technology.\u201d\n\nProponents of electronic health records say they have the potential to reduce medical errors, better coordinate care, and save time. Some say the technology, however, hasn't reached that point. \u201cIt simply takes longer [to enter patient information into a computer],\" says McDonald, who is a proponent of EHRs and was among a group which created the first system in the country. \"There is already so much to do and you have to look at patient safety.\u201d Deep consequences can come out of one typo, he adds, and adding another data point carries additional time cost.\n\nMcDonald expected the results from the study because he has heard complaints from doctors who said they were spending extra time with EHRs after work, he says.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "public health", "title": "Doctors Complain of Time Wasted on Electronic Health Records", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A new study shows that technology has slowed doctors' work.", "title": "Doctors Say Electronic Records Waste Time", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/08/doctors-complain-of-time-wasted-on-electronic-health-records", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/11/f62bc76520e186a73584732a75309e/10223FE_PR_090326health_electronic_records.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "A new study shows that technology has slowed doctors' work.", "card": "summary", "title": "Doctors Complain of Time Wasted on Electronic Health Records"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 8, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,Pulse,picks,health care,Affordable Care Act,doctors,public health", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A new study shows that technology has slowed doctors' work."}, "article_summary": "President Barack Obama championed electronic health care records during his first presidential campaign, then pushed their implementation to lay the groundwork for the nation\u2019s health care reform package.\nThe law requires health care providers to demonstrate not only that they are using electronic health records, but that those records meet requirements outlined by the government.\nA draft of the letter was released Monday to a group of health care reporters at the National Library of Medicine.\nHealth care providers are using iPads more frequently, and some have taken on Google Glasses.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t always do something magically faster with technology.\u201dProponents of electronic health records say they have the potential to reduce medical errors, better coordinate care, and save time."}
