When it comes to Twitter, actor Nick Searcy is a beast at going after the left, and his no-holds-barred feed is not for the faint of heart.

Most recently, the star of FX’s “Justified” used his unique brand of ire to target Mike Dickinson, a Virginia Democrat trying to unseat House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Desperate to attract attention to his candidacy, Dickinson attacked the tea party Saturday with this tweet:

I 100% agree with Alan Grayson- the KKK and Tea Party one in the same — DickinsonForCongress (@VoteMike2014) February 22, 2014

It was an odd strategy considering few in the tea party care for Cantor.

Garbage collector’s patriotic gesture brings resident to tears

While Dickinson’s sentiment won favor with the far-left wingnuts who gravitate toward Grayson, Searcy took exception, warning Dickinson as only he can that there could be consequences for making such ridiculous statements.

In the process, Searcy also reminded the Democrat that he once supported U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.

Twitchy captured this tweet:

Say I’m in the Klan again,guy who supported Robert Byrd, and my bitches will slap the shit out of you! @VoteMike2014 pic.twitter.com/eW7sx4zGdC — Yes, Nick Searcy! (@yesnicksearcy) February 22, 2014

The actor was not the only one willing to refresh Dickinson’s memory. Consider these tweets:
