Corporate heads for David’s Bridal shops have reportedly sent out notices to their employees that due to Obamacare, their full-time services will no longer be needed.

The employees are being shifted into part-time status, The Daily Caller reported. Store managers can’t discuss the situation, the news outlet said, and have referred all calls for information to the headquarters office, located in Pennsylvania.

But at least one Twitter poster confirmed the situation and so did a handful of store employees, The Daily Caller reported.

She wrote about her daughter, who works for the company: “David’s Bridal just cut a bunch of employees down to 30 hours a week & no healthcare. My daughter’s one, so hits home now!”

Another source told The Daily Caller that at least some of the employees — the company has 2,500 in 300 stores — were told that they had to either accept the new work terms, or quit.
