O'Keefe, who previously held executive positions at EthicsPoint and ShopIgniter, became CEO in April.\n\nInvestors in the current round include Chuck Kilo, chief medical officer at Oregon Health & Science University, and Craig Froude, managing principal at the Portland investment firm Aequitas Capital.\n\nAkeLex is working to tap into technological and industry transformations. The \"Internet of Things\" \u2013 connected devices, like fitness wristbands, making their way into everyday life \u2013 make it possible to track and analyze growing volumes of information. And the Affordable Care Act has created new demand for health care services.\n\nAkeLex, O'Keefe said, aims to help meet that demand by using technology to contain costs.\n\n\"Similar to Sarbanes-Oxley,\" he said, \"the Affordable Care Act is a catalyst for change.\"\n\n-- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "akelex, startups, tom o'keefe, business", "title": "AkeLex, Portland startup focused on enabling medical technology, closes $1.5 million round", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "The 10-person company aims to corral the stream of information coming from online devices to help health care providers quickly make sense of it.", "title": "AkeLex, Portland startup focused on enabling medical technology, closes $1.5 million round", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2014/08/akelex_portland_startup_focuse.html", "image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/silicon-forest/photo/tomokeefe-mugjpg-829c6252637f455f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 10-person company aims to corral the stream of information coming from online devices to help health care providers quickly make sense of it.", "title": "AkeLex, Portland startup focused on enabling medical technology, closes $1.5 million round", "image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/silicon-forest/photo/tomokeefe-mugjpg-829c6252637f455f.jpg", "creator": "@rogoway", "site": "@Oregonian", "card": "summary"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, August 08, 2014,  1:11 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "OregonLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, August 08, 2014, 10:26 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The 10-person company aims to corral the stream of information coming from online devices to help health care providers quickly make sense of it."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd823\"", "article_summary": "The company has just closed its first investment round, a $1.5 million investment to help it prove the commercial viability of its so-called clinical decision support software.\nAnd the Affordable Care Act has created new demand for health care services.\nPortland startup AkeLex aims to corral that information to help health care providers quickly make sense of it \u2013 offering diagnoses and medical advice to patients without spending a lot of time interpreting the data.\n\"We want to help medical assistants, nurses and doctors alike perform at a much higher level with the help of technology,\" said Tom O'Keefe, AkeLex's chief executive.\nThe ten-person business is a mix of medical and technology professionals, including founder Stephen Datena, a surgeon, and Robert Beck, a co-founder of Sequent Computer Systems."}
