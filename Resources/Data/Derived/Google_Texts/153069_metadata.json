A 5-1 result in a World Cup would affect any player...but it's another motivation for the next match.\"\n\nSpanish newspapers greeted the defeat with 'humiliation' and 'nightmare' written large across their front pages but the mood in the media room at the Atletico Paranaense training ground outside Curitiba was as mild as the weather outside.\n\nThe Spanish flag billowed under overcast skies, with a training session scheduled for the late afternoon when conditions were cooler.\n\nMaybe, some suggested, that was the problem with Spain training in the more temperate south for a match in the heat of Salvador. The Dutch have based themselves in steamier Rio de Janeiro.\n\nRamos, whose side play Group B rivals Chile next on Wednesday, refused to make any excuses or seek them.\n\n\"We are training here in good temperatures, in good conditions and with good facilities,\" he said. \"You have to accept it. If we'd won, you wouldn't have been talking so much about this subject.\"\n\nSpain, he said, remained fully motivated and determined to reward the army of fans who chanted their support as they boarded their late night flight from Salvador with cries of 'Yes we can'.\n\nGoalkeeper Iker Casillas, who shouldered much of the blame for the defeat after Spain had scored the opening goal, was bearing up well.\n\n\"I see him super-motivated, super-convinced that we can do it, that we have to turn a page and go forward,\" declared his Champions League winning club team mate.\n\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Justin Palmer)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alan Baldwin", "Author": "Alan Baldwin", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Sergio Ramos declared he was not going to spend another second beating himself up over Spain's 5-1 World Cup defeat to the Netherlands but, like Dutch strikers the night before, the questions kept on coming.", "title": "No time for regrets, says Spain defender Ramos", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140614&t=2&i=907694540&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA5D0BY", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Finance", "sailthru.tags": "US, SOCCER, WORLD, ESP, RAMOS", "sailthru.title": "No time for regrets, says Spain defender Ramos", "keywords": "US,SOCCER,WORLD,ESP,RAMOS,World Cup,Spain,Brazil,Netherlands,Olympics,Sport,Soccer", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;SOCCER;WORLD;ESP;RAMOS;World Cup;Spain;Brazil;Netherlands;Olympics;Sport;Soccer", "WT.cg_n": "Finance -
