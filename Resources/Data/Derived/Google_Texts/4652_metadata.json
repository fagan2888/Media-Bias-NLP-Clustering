The keyboardist and founder of Emerson, Lake & Palmer was found dead by his girlfriend on Thursday night in the couple\u2019s Santa Monica, California house with a single bullet shot to the head.\n\nThe piano player had been depressed as a result of a nerve problem that affected his right hand and severely impaired his ability to play the keyboard. Still, he was slated to perform next week in Japan.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer received its first and only Grammy nomination in 1972 for Best New Artist. They lost to Carly Simon. The progressive rock band was best known for its hits, \u201cNut Rocker,\u201d \u201cFanfare for the Common Man,\u201d \u201cLucky Man,\u201d \u201cTarkus,\u201d and \u201cKarn Evil 9.\u2033\n\nOn their official Facebook site, the band wrote, \u201cWe regret to announce that Keith Emerson died last night at his home in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, aged 71. We ask that the family\u2019s privacy and grief be respected.\u201d Band member Carl Palmer stated on his personal page, \u201cI am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of my good friend and brother-in-music, Keith Emerson.\u201d\n\nPalmer went on to call his bandmate \u201ca gentle soul whose love for music and passion for his performance as a keyboard player will remain unmatched for many years to come. He was a pioneer and an innovator whose musical genius touched all of us in the worlds of rock, classical and jazz. I will always remember his warm smile, good sense of humor, compelling showmanship, and dedication to his musical craft. I am very lucky to have known him and to have made the music we did, together.\u201d Gossip Cop has reached out to the band\u2019s management regarding the situation, but we have yet to hear back.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Keith Emerson, keyboardist and founder of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head in what's likely now a suicide investigation.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"site_name": "Gossip Cop", "description": "Keith Emerson shot himself in the head in what's likely now a suicide investigation.
