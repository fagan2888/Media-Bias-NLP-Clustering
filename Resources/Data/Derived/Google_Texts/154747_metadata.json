Balakler describes it as a classic David and Goliath story that focuses on Kelo, a single mother who had her Connecticut house seized by the city of New London and turned over to private developers.\n\nKelo\u2019s fight against eminent domain abuse resulted in the landmark Kelo v. City of New London decision that was handed down by the Supreme Court in 2005. Even though Kelo had lost, the decision brought attention to eminent domain abuse around the country. (Read Reason's archive on the Kelo case.)\n\n\u201cThe silver lining is that it was such an outrageous decision that everyone was talking about it,\u201d says Balaker. \u201cI don\u2019t think people would be talking about eminent domain abuse had she won.\u201d\n\nNick Gillespie sat down with Balaker at Freedom Fest in Las Vegas to talk about the film\u2019s production and what Balaker hopes to achieve by telling Suzette Kelo\u2019s story to a broader audience.\n\nAbout 8:30 minutes.\n\nProduced by Meredith Bragg. Edited by Alexis Garcia. Camera by Bragg, Paul Detrick, and Zach Weissmueller.
