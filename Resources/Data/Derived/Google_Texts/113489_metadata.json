More were expected on Saturday, as dozens of buses on the Hungarian side of the border lined up in the village of Beremend.\n\n\u201cWe forced them, by sending people up there. And we'll keep doing it,\u201d Milanovic told reporters in the northeastern town of Beli Manastir, from where many of the buses and several trains left on Friday for the short trip to Hungary.\n\nHungarian soldiers are racing to build a fence like the one on the border with Serbia along a stretch of the Croatian frontier too, and have already rolled out coils of razor wire.\n\nOn Croatia\u2019s western flank, some 1,200 migrants have crossed into Slovenia, like Hungary a member of Europe\u2019s Schengen zone of border-free travel. Large crowds were building on Saturday at border crossings, kept back by riot police who briefly fired pepper spray late on Friday.\n\nSlovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar said he would discuss with Slovenia\u2019s neighbors the possibility of creating a \u201ccorridor\u201d through the country if the influx became too much.\n\n(Additional reporting by Maja Zuvela in TOVARNIK, Croatia, Gergely Szakacs in BEREMEND, Hungary, Thomas Escritt in BUDAPEST, Igor Ilic in ZAGREB and Marja Novak in LJUBLJANA; Writing by Matt Robinson; Editing by Toby Chopra)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BELI MANASTIR, Croatia (Reuters) - Croatia said on Saturday it had \u201cforced\u201d Hungary to", "title": "Croatia says 'forcing' Hungary to take in migrants", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/19/Croatia-says-forcing-Hungary-take-migrants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-croatia_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/19/Croatia-says-forcing-Hungary-take-migrants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-croatia_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BELI MANASTIR, Croatia (Reuters) - Croatia said on Saturday it had \u201cforced\u201d Hungary to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17ea\"", "article_summary": "On Croatia\u2019s western flank, some 1,200 migrants have crossed into Slovenia, like Hungary a member of Europe\u2019s Schengen zone of border-free travel.\nBELI MANASTIR, Croatia (Reuters) - Croatia said on Saturday it had \u201cforced\u201d Hungary to take in thousands of migrants and would continue sending them to its northern neighbor, amid deepening discord and disarray in Europe over the biggest westwards migration in decades.\nOver 20,000 migrants, many of them Syrian refugees, have streamed into Croatia since Hungary on Tuesday barred their route to the European Union through its southern border with Serbia with a metal fence, tear gas and water cannon.\n(Additional reporting by Maja Zuvela in TOVARNIK, Croatia, Gergely Szakacs in BEREMEND, Hungary, Thomas Escritt in BUDAPEST, Igor Ilic in ZAGREB and Marja Novak in LJUBLJANA; Writing by Matt Robinson; Editing by Toby Chopra)\nSome 3,000 entered Hungary by bus and train on Friday."}
