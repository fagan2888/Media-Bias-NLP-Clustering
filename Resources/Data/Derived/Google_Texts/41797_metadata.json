Bowe Bergdahl until after the election shows that Democrats think the American people are \u201cfools\u201d on Saturday\u2019s \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\n\n\u201cFor some reason it [delaying unpopular policies until after the election] seems to be working. As the Obamacare waiver seems to be working. I was having dinner with a bunch of conservatives last night, they\u2019re aware of Obamacare, but they have jobs, they\u2019re not like me, self-employed. So even they don\u2019t understand what is coming with Obamacare\u201d she said.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCoulter added that the decision to delay the results of an investigation into whether Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl deserted his platoon was \u201clike everything else. Surprise! After the election, suddenly you won\u2019t have insurance, and it\u2019s going to hit right about the same time all the border surge kids bringing in the Enterovirus will be paralyzing or killing your kids.\u201d And \u201cwhy aren\u2019t we getting it? What is taking so long? Isn\u2019t this disturbing to people, that all of these things won\u2019t happen until after the election? Another thing we aren\u2019t going to find out, an investigation we won\u2019t get until after the election, is the results of the Ferguson grand jury. I mean, are the American people fools. Certainly the democrats think they are, and if they don\u2019t pay attention and vote Republican, then maybe they are.\u201d\n\nCoulter concluded by pointing to the success of Republicans who have made immigration an issue like Scott Brown in New Hampshire and Tom Cotton in Arkansas compared to the struggles of Thom Tillis in North Carolina.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Coulter: Democrats Think Americans Are 'Fools'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Coulter: Democrats Think Americans Are 'Fools'", "title": "Coulter: Democrats Think Americans Are 'Fools' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/10/25/Coulter%201025%20Thumbnail.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/10/25/coulter-democrats-think-americans-are-fools/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Coulter: Democrats Think Americans Are 'Fools'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/10/25/Coulter%201025%20Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Coulter: Democrats Think Americans Are 'Fools' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "FOX NEWS, Tom Cotton, Twitter,Breitbart TV,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-10-25T22:42:54-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb235\"", "article_summary": "Bowe Bergdahl until after the election shows that Democrats think the American people are \u201cfools\u201d on Saturday\u2019s \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCoulter added that the decision to delay the results of an investigation into whether Sgt.\n\u201cFor some reason it [delaying unpopular policies until after the election] seems to be working.\nI was having dinner with a bunch of conservatives last night, they\u2019re aware of Obamacare, but they have jobs, they\u2019re not like me, self-employed.\nAnother thing we aren\u2019t going to find out, an investigation we won\u2019t get until after the election, is the results of the Ferguson grand jury."}
