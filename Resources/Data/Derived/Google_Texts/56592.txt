Some horrible website no one has ever heard of has ranked the worst places to live in Wisconsin, and central Wisconsin ranks high on the list.

The website Roadsnacks.net, a content farm that apparently specializes in listing the 10 worst places in various states, claims to have considered population density, unemployment rates, median income, crime rates, housing vacancies and education to make its rankings, but its formula is opaque and probably bogus.

Anyway here is the stupid list which no one should take the least bit seriously:

1. Merrill

2. Rhinelander

3. Beloit

4. Ashland

5. Marinette

6. Wisconsin Rapids

7. Waupaca

8. Rice Lake

9. Antigo

10. Racine

11. Stevens Point

12. Green Bay

13. Milwaukee

14. Baraboo, Wausau, Chippewa Falls (three-way tie)

What do you think, Internet? Are we going to sit here and let Roadsnacks.net, whose “about us” page explains that its mission is to “use data to create bite-sized snacks of shareable information about places and cities,” push us around? Or does this site have a point with these rankings?
