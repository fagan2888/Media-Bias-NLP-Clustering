If it was not about controlling the masses, why in dog\u2019s name do those religion\u2019s deity and holy books include death sentences for failure to worship an unseen deity imposed on all humanity? Pain of death, either immediate or in the bizarre concept of afterlife, is a powerful motivator and although there is not yet a threat of mass extermination of non-believers like in the Christian bible\u2019s Old Testament, fundamentalist Christians still insist on imposing negative consequences for failure to comply with their edicts.\n\nThe idea that certain actions fundamentalist Christians oppose on religious grounds warrant immediate and life-long consequences is the driving force behind the religious right\u2019s opposition to both abortion and contraceptive use. On the day the Supreme Court ruling in Hobby Lobby was announced, a Christian extremist, Erick Erickson, gleefully announced that now, \u201cMy religion trumps your (women) right to sex without consequences.\u201d A similar concept drove the opposition to including contraception coverage in the Affordable Care Act that House Republicans believed warranted an all-male panel of clergy to testify that yes, women having sexual relations without lifelong consequences was an abomination their Puritanical sensibilities would not comport.\n\nThe inspiration for Hobby Lobby, and 71 other \u201creligious\u201d corporations, to sue for a religious exemption of the contraception mandate is not about abortion, but about controlling women and inflicting consequences for not adhering to their Puritanical belief that women in their employ, can not, and will not, have sexual relations without paying a heavy price. In fact, the idea of forcing women, on pain of harsh consequences, to adhere to strict religious and moral behavior defined by sententious and severe piety is why fundamentalist Christianity is every bit as harsh as Islamic Sharia Law\u2019s control over women.\n\nControlling women\u2019s morality was not always the Christian Right\u2019s cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, but as is always the case, they did seek to control a large segment of the population and enforce another form of biblical purity. Prior to imposing their Puritanical morality on women, the \u201cmoral majority\u2019s primary mission\u201d was fighting for Aryan racial purity according to, like the Mormon Church, the biblical edict that \u201cblack skinned\u201d people were accursed by god. The religious right shifted their outrage and fight against racial segregation to abortion and contraception when the Supreme Court decision in Green v. Kennedy in 1970 stripped the tax-exempt status from private Christian schools known as \u201csegregation academies\u201d that openly barred black students continued unabated despite the Brown v. Board of Education ruling.\n\nIt did not take long for the religious right to shift from enforcing biblical racial purity to imposing Puritanical moral purity targeting American women. Before shifting to control women\u2019s sexuality, the Christian Right followed their god of the Old Testament\u2019s issuance that there is NO living being until it breathes air. In fact, the official position of the religious right was that a woman\u2019s choice to use contraception or abortion was a personal decision between a woman and her physician; the \u201cpro-choice\u201d position the religious right now opposes vehemently.\n\nThe concept of controlling women and imposing lifelong consequences for having sex was apparently settled in 1965 when Planned Parenthood of Connecticut won a U.S. Supreme Court victory, Griswold v. Connecticut, that finally and completely rolled back state and local laws that had outlawed the use of contraception by married couples. Indeed, the same Puritanical mindset that drives the religious right\u2019s attempt to control women, and their sexuality, today erupted immediately after dependably effective birth control pills were made available. The argument that religion \u201ctrumps\u201d a woman\u2019s right to have sexual relations without consequence embraced by the conservative Christian Supreme Court and religious right today was rampant until Griswald, and then Green v. Kennedy, when the moral majority found abortion as a new means of political power. The election of an African American man as President, gave the racist moral majority an assist in marshaling racial animus against Obama to their cause to control women and the Court\u2019s ruling is having a profound effect.\n\nThe High Court\u2019s ruling on Monday is already inciting Christian organizations to exert their newfound control over the population as reported here when Catholic and Christian \u201cfaith leaders\u201d issued a letter to President Obama demanding religious exemption to discriminate against gays. The faith leaders insisted that Hobby Lobby informs the President that he must now give \u201cdeference to Christian prerogatives\u201d in any future Presidential action. On Thursday, yet another conservative Christian High Court birth control order sided with a religiously \u201caffiliated\u201d non-profit group after it appealed, and won, an exemption to provide contraception coverage in health insurance prescription plans. The former acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration said of the Hobby Lobby and most recent attack on women that \u201cAfter today, it is clear that women\u2019s access to contraception is by no means guaranteed given the administrative complexities the court has now imposed.\u201d The High Court\u2019s newest emergency ruling ceding control over women, their sexuality, and reproductive health to Christians and is a portent of the pain the Republican religious right is about to unleash in their indisputable and Puritanical war on women.\n\nThe idea of anti-contraception being an integral part of the Christian right agenda was implied in Justice Alito\u2019s writing for the Hobby Lobby decision. And to no-one\u2019s surprise, Justice Scalia\u2019s wife is a \u201chardline anti-choice activist\u201d that certainly influenced his vote to authorize Christian corporations to withhold contraceptive coverage from prescription drug plans. At the Right to Life conference, a featured speaker, Joy Pinto, mercilessly attacked contraceptives as \u201cthe real war on women\u201d she claimed was \u201ccoming from the pit of Hell\u201d comparing birth control to \u201cwhen Eve bit the apple.\u201d A preeminent Christian anti-choice website, Life News, could barely contain its glee at the prospect of Christians legally depriving women of contraception and stated, \u201cFertility is a natural condition of a woman\u201d and that \u201cstifling ovulation with birth control\u201d is an abomination to god. However, the Christian opposition to birth control is not about fertility, but about controlling women\u2019s sexuality by imposing harsh consequences unless they intend to give birth.\n\nIt is important for all women, even hardcore conservatives, Catholics, and so-called \u201cgood\u201d Christians, to remember that the Puritanical religious right makes no distinction in their war on women who use contraception. Their goal is simply to exert their control and force every woman in America to either become celibate or perpetual birth machines; the consequence of having sexual relations without contraceptives. American women should never delude themselves that imposing their Puritanical morality is reserved for single women, because there was no special dispensation in the Court\u2019s ruling to protect married women\u2019s access to contraceptives. The Christian Right, including the United States Council of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), makes no secret that their goal is ultimate control over all women, married and single alike.\n\nOver the past five years, the preponderance of opinions among liberals was that religion cannot exert its will over the government or the people because \u201cit is unconstitutional,\u201d or they just did not care about religion, or that recent victories for gay rights proved the religious right was in decline and impotent. Well, now it is constitutional, and the recent victories for gay rights are being challenged on the grounds of the High Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby ruling. It has not been four days since the decision was announced and religious \u201caffiliated\u201d groups quickly sought, and won, the right to withhold contraceptives from women\u2019s prescription plans and the White House has been warned to give deference to \u201cChristian prerogatives\u201d in any Presidential action.\n\nIf anyone thinks this is not a monumental escalation in the religious war against Americans, particularly women, then why are men not being denied prescription coverage for penis pumps, erection-inducing pills, or over-the-counter condoms? This is a religious assault on women, and gays, that the religious right will expand according to Christian Dominionism to seize control over all aspects of American society. At a time when many Americans are expressing patriotic fervor, they should temper that patriotism with the reality that there is a powerful and constitutionally backed group expressing what is arguably the most dangerous threat to America; religious fervor. History shows when religious zeal is expressed by fundamentalist Christians, it is an existential threat that the Court just gave its blessing and constitutional authority to proceed with extreme prejudice. This is not going to end well for any American woman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The inspiration for Hobby Lobby, and 71 other \"religious\" corporations, to sue for a religious exemption of the contraception mandate is not about abortion, but about controlling women and inflicting consequences for not adhering to their Puritanical belief that women in their employ, can not, and will not, have sexual relations without paying a heavy price.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The inspiration for Hobby Lobby, and 71 other \"religious\" corporations, to sue for a religious exemption of the contraception mandate is not about abortion, but about controlling women and inflicting consequences for not adhering to their Puritanical belief that women in their employ, can", "title": "The Right's Push to Deny Birth Control Is All About Controlling Women", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/07/05/rights-push-birth-control.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/image4.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-05T17:25:11+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,birth control,Christian right,Christian views on contraception,Constitution,contraception,health insurance prescription plans,Hobby Lobby,Hormonal contraception,Joy Pinto,medicine,Planned Parenthood,Religious Right,Religious War on Women,scalia,Theocracy,U.S. Supreme Court,United States Council of Catholic Bishops,War on Women,White House,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-07-05T17:25:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-05T17:25:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "birth control, Christian right, Christian views on contraception, Constitution, contraception, health insurance prescription plans, Hobby Lobby, Hormonal contraception, Joy Pinto, medicine, Planned Parenthood, Religious Right, Religious War on Women, scalia, Theocracy, U.S. Supreme Court, United States Council of Catholic Bishops, War on Women, White House"}, "article_summary": "Indeed, the same Puritanical mindset that drives the religious right\u2019s attempt to control women, and their sexuality, today erupted immediately after dependably effective birth control pills were made available.\nBefore shifting to control women\u2019s sexuality, the Christian Right followed their god of the Old Testament\u2019s issuance that there is NO living being until it breathes air.\nHowever, the Christian opposition to birth control is not about fertility, but about controlling women\u2019s sexuality by imposing harsh consequences unless they intend to give birth.\nThe idea of anti-contraception being an integral part of the Christian right agenda was implied in Justice Alito\u2019s writing for the Hobby Lobby decision.\nThis is a religious assault on women, and gays, that the religious right will expand according to Christian Dominionism to seize control over all aspects of American society."}
