This doesn\u2019t just apply to Boston. It applies access the board to every part of the country,\u201d Mr. Obama said. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s no industry that hasn\u2019t been touched since this technology revolution.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials highlighted the efforts of Louisville, Ky.\u2019s \u201cCode Louisville\u201d program, which helps train and place software developers in local tech jobs.\n\nAs part of the new TechHire program, the city will launch a new coding bootcamp and partner with local educational institutions. The new program will encourage other municipalities to create similar programs and efforts.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "President Barack Obama on Monday announced a new job training campaign aimed at getting more Americans work in the technology sector.", "title": "Obama Announces Training Campaign for Tech Jobs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/03/09/obama-announces-training-campaign-for-tech-jobs/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Obama Announces Training Campaign for Tech Jobs", "description": "President Barack Obama on Monday announced a new job training campaign aimed at getting more Americans work in the technology sector.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Byron Tau", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "President Barack Obama on Monday announced a new job training campaign aimed at getting more Americans work in the technology sector.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-03-09T16:09:04-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/03/09/obama-announces-training-campaign-for-tech-jobs/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-53621", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "President Barack Obama on Monday announced a new job training campaign aimed at getting more Americans work in the technology sector.", "title": "Obama Announces Training Campaign for Tech Jobs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/03/09/obama-announces-training-campaign-for-tech-jobs/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-53621", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-09T16:48:06-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb94\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama on Monday announced a new job training campaign aimed at getting more Americans work in the technology sector.\nHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s no industry that hasn\u2019t been touched since this technology revolution.\u201dAdministration officials highlighted the efforts of Louisville, Ky.\u2019s \u201cCode Louisville\u201d program, which helps train and place software developers in local tech jobs.\n\u201cI want Americans to win the race for the kind of discoveries that release new jobs, he said.\nThe president also said that technology jobs were not just clustered in high tech corridors like Silicon Valley or the Route 128 tech corridor in Massachusetts, but that they were located at companies in every community in the country.\nThe TechHire initiative combines in-person coding, programming and technology training at universities and community colleges with online education and \u201cboot camps\u201d run by municipalities, local governments and community groups."}
