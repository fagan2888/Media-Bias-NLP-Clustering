Morgan Chase & Co. are only a few of the financial institutions in the process of selling large portfolios on the secondary market or considering such sales, joining early movers such as Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group.\n\nFurther discussions around bank sales began to increase after regulators released the final draft of the Volcker Rule in December, giving financial institutions the final wording on bans from making certain investments deemed to be risky, such as private equity and hedge funds. The deadline for compliance is July 21, 2015, although financial institutions may seek extensions beyond that date.\n\n\u201cWith final rules implemented [in December] and compliance required by 2015, we\u2019re going to see a pickup in activity,\u201d said Rudy Scarpa, a partner on the secondary team at investment management firm Pantheon.\n\nHowever, Volcker isn\u2019t the only motivator. Pricing for private equity assets continues to further swing in favor of sellers, thanks to a combination of strong fundraising by secondary firms and solid performance of underlying private equity portfolios.\n\nAnd given that bids based on portfolio valuations lag at least a quarter, some buyers may end up paying an overall discount amid rising performance numbers.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the fundamental profile of a deal,\u201d said Jeff Keay , a managing director with HarbourVest Partners . \u201cBut on the margin, it can give a buyer a bit more comfort about what may optically feel like a high price.\u201d\n\nFor more on the private equity secondary pipeline, check out this month\u2019s issue of Private Equity Analyst.
