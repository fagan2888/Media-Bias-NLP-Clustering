Despite a healthy gain in sales, trouble in the Medicaid market resulted in a quarterly loss for health insurer WellCare Health Plans Inc. and gobbled a large chunk out of its stock price Friday, as shares plunged by more than 22% at one point.

WellCare’s /quotes/zigman/341770/delayed /quotes/nls/wcg WCG second-quarter performance left shares down more than 20% in recent action to $61.40. It also had a chilling effect on other Medicaid insurers, with several dropping 5% or more.

WellCare said it experienced higher-than-expected expenses in starting its Florida Managed Medical Assistance program. The company said the expenses are expected to negatively hit earnings by $1.05 to $1.15 a share compared with earlier forecasts.

The company also recorded an “unfavorable development” of medical payments amounting to 74 cents a share during the quarter, more than 10 times what it had for the same period a year ago. It also reported a 35-cent charge to earnings revolving around the purchase of its Easy Choice Health Plan.

WellCare said its net loss was $7.5 million, or 17 cents a share, for the quarter ended June 30. A year ago, the company reported profits of $46.9 million, or $1.07 a share. Revenue for the Tampa, Fla.-based company was $3.15 billion against last year’s $2.33 billion.

Though sales came in ahead of the $3.01 billion forecast from analysts polled by FactSet, the expectation was that WellCare would realize profits of 90 cents a share. The company said its adjusted loss was 7 cents a share.

WellCare’s troubles hit shares of other Medicaid insurers, including Centene Corp. /quotes/zigman/292665/delayed /quotes/nls/cnc CNC , which was off 6.5% in recent action, and Molina Health Plans Inc. /quotes/zigman/317140/delayed /quotes/nls/moh MOH , which fell more than 5%.
