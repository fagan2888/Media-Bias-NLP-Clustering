The occasion for such an incendiary comparison? Unlike Obama, who did not attend an anti-terror solidarity rally in Paris this weekend, Hitler did think it \u201cimportant\u201d to get to the city, Weber wrote, in a reference to Germany\u2019s 1940 occupation of Paris:\n\nConservatives may spend a great deal of time asserting that Obama is a dirty socialist, but Weber, a Tea Partyer elected to succeed longtime Texas Rep. Ron Paul in 2012, is but the latest conservative to link Obama with the fascist dictator. Here are six others.\n\nLouie Gohmert\n\nIn a 2010 House floor speech, America\u2019s favorite bumbling conservative, who has represented an east Texas-based congressional district since 2005 but failed spectacularly in his bid to become House Speaker this month, approvingly cited conservative polemicist Thomas Sowell\u2019s comparison of Nazi Germany with America in the Obama era.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a brilliant man named Thomas Sowell,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t vote for Barack Obama in 2008, but I sure would have voted for Thomas Sowell. This man, well, his article says quite a lot. His editorial says here \u2014 and it\u2019s just been posted this week \u2014 but it says, \u201cWhen Adolph Hitler was building up the Nazi movement in the 1920\u2019s\u201d \u2014 and I\u2019m quoting from Thomas Sowell in his editorial: \u2018leading up to his taking power in the 1930s, he deliberately sought to activate people who did not normally pay much attention to politics.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Such people were a valuable addition to his political base, since they were particularly susceptible to Hitler\u2019s rhetoric and had far less basis for questioning his assumptions or his conclusions. \u2018Useful idiots\u2019 was the term supposedly coined by V.I. Lenin to describe similarly unthinking supporters of his dictatorship in the Soviet Union,'\u201d Gohmert continued, reading from Sowell\u2019s op-ed.\n\n\u201cAnd this isn\u2019t in the article,\u201d Gohmert concluded, \u201cthis is my comment \u2014 but we do have useful idiots today, who are heard to say, \u2018Wow, what we really need is for the president to be a dictator for a little while.\u2019 They know not what they say.\u201d\n\nPaul Broun\n\nBefore Obama even took the oath of office, then-Georgia Congressman Paul Broun warned in November 2008 that the president-elect could usher in a \u201cradical\u201d dictatorship.\n\n\u201cIt may sound a bit crazy and off base, but the thing is, he\u2019s the one who proposed this national security force,\u201d Broun said, referring to an Obama proposal for a civilian force to aid the military. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to bring attention to the fact that we may\u2013 may not, I hope not \u2013 but we may have a problem with that type of philosophy of radical socialism or Marxism.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas congressman Randy Weber is only the latest to make the demented comparison", "title": "7 conservatives who have compared Obama to Hitler", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Texas congressman Randy Weber is only the latest to make the demented comparison", "title": "7 conservatives who have compared Obama to Hitler", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/13/7_conservatives_who_have_compared_obama_to_hitler/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/louie_gohmert2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Texas congressman Randy Weber is only the latest to make the demented comparison", "title": "7 conservatives who have compared Obama to Hitler", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/louie_gohmert2.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Adolf Hitler, Barack Obama, Conservatives, drudge report, Glenn Beck, Louie Gohmert, Matt Drudge, Milton Wolf, Nazi Germany, Paul Broun, randy weber, Republicans, Rick Santorum, thomas sowell", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f5f\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Adolf Hitler, Barack Obama, Conservatives, drudge report, Glenn Beck, Louie Gohmert, Matt Drudge, Milton Wolf, Nazi Germany, Paul Broun, randy weber, Republicans, Rick Santorum, thomas sowell, Politics NewsTexas Republican Congressman Randy Weber came under withering criticism last night after he posted a tweet comparing President Obama with Adolf Hitler.\n\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t vote for Barack Obama in 2008, but I sure would have voted for Thomas Sowell.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a brilliant man named Thomas Sowell,\u201d Gohmert said.\nLenin to describe similarly unthinking supporters of his dictatorship in the Soviet Union,'\u201d Gohmert continued, reading from Sowell\u2019s op-ed.\n\u201cIt may sound a bit crazy and off base, but the thing is, he\u2019s the one who proposed this national security force,\u201d Broun said, referring to an Obama proposal for a civilian force to aid the military."}
