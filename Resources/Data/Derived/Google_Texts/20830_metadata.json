Trump scored a major victory in Massachusetts in late February, surprising many who thought he would have trouble winning in a state with more moderate Republicans.\n\nBut the party switching there pales by comparison to the magnitude of what is taking place in Pennsylvania. Terry Madonna, a professor of political science at Franklin & Marshall College in Pennsylvania, said on Monday that \u201cI don\u2019t know when we\u2019ve ever had\u201d a situation in which 170,000 people shifted from one party to another or went from being an independent to a member of one or the other parties.\n\n\n\nTrump has a good chance of winning narrowly in Pennsylvania, but that may not translate into a needed passel of delegates.\n\nRelated: Trump vs. Cruz Is Turning Into a Bare-Knuckled Bar Fight\n\nThat\u2019s because the Pennsylvania GOP has one of the most permissive primary election laws regarding how national delegates must vote on the first ballot at the convention this summer. Unlike most other states, 54 of the 71 national delegates elected in Pennsylvania \u2013 three from each of 18 congressional districts \u2013 are not obliged to support the candidate who garners the most votes statewide in the April 26 primary.\n\nThat means if Trump beats Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich of Ohio in the primary contest, three quarters of the 71 total delegates chosen could vote for Cruz or Kasich on the first ballot if they see fit.\n\nTrump narrowly leads Kasich, 33 percent to 30 percent, in a new Franklin and Marshall College poll, while Cruz trails with just 20 percent. In the Democratic contest, meanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton holds a substantial lead over her rival, Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont, 53 percent to 28 percent.\n\n\"There are a reasonable number of scenarios where Pennsylvania becomes the center of a contested convention,\" Charlie Gerow, a Republican strategist and a candidate for national delegate, told The Morning Call newspaper in Allentown.\n\nRelated: The Five Most Endangered Senate Republicans\n\n\n\n\u201cPennsylvania is a big wild card in the Republican process,\u201d added Kyle Kondik, a University of Virginia political expert in an email today. \u201cMost of the delegates will go to the convention unbound and may be more inclined to back an alternative to Trump.\u201d\n\nAs for all the party-switching going on, Kondik said, \u201cRepublican presidential voters who have been registered as Democrats for years finally decided to take the plunge and become an actual Republican.\u201d Many states, like Kentucky and West Virginia, have many more registered Democrats than Republicans, \u201ceven though those states are reliably Republican in presidential elections,\u201d Kondik explained. \u201cAlso, voters just have more interest in the Republican primary this year and are choosing to vote in it instead of the Democratic primary.\n\nIn short, Pennsylvania could end up playing an outsized role in the selection of the GOP nominee. While 17 of the 71 national delegates will be bound by the outcome of the statewide beauty contest, the remainder will be free to vote as they see fit.\n\nRelated: Trump Might Win the Nomination, but Cruz Won the GOP\n\nTrump is likely to win the nomination and has so far collected 739 of the 1,237 delegates he will need to prevail at the convention. However, Cruz and Kasich \u2013 with the backing of more establishment Republican leaders -- are aiming to deny him the crown.\n\nA fight by Trump, Kasich and Cruz over the allegiance of the vast majority of Pennsylvania delegates could be intense in what already has become a dirty and nasty GOP presidential campaign.\n\nMadonna recalled that former President Gerald Ford was just 150 unpledged delegates shy of the majority he needed to win the nomination over Ronald Reagan at the 1976 GOP convention. Ford ultimately prevailed on the first ballot after considerable arm-twisting.\n\n\u201cThey were negotiating with the delegates for trips on the presidential yacht, visits to the White House; they were doing everything,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of wooing this time.\u201d\n\nRelated: For Now, Democrats Savor a Clinton-Trump Matchup this Fall\n\nWe are already seeing not only wooing but hardball politics to try to nail down delegate allegiance. Over the weekend, Trump threatened to sue Cruz\u2019s campaign for picking off 10 more of the 41 national delegates from Louisiana than he was technically entitled to after Trump won the popular vote in the March 5 primary.\n\n\u201cJust to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming,\u201d Trump tweeted on Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Pennsylvania is looming as one of the real wildcards of the presidential season \u2013in te", "title": "Here\u2019s Why Pennsylvania Could Swing the GOP Nomination", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/28/Here-s-Why-Pennsylvania-Could-Swing-GOP-Nomination", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12222012_GOP_v_GOP_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/28/Here-s-Why-Pennsylvania-Could-Swing-GOP-Nomination", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12222012_GOP_v_GOP_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Pennsylvania is looming as one of the real wildcards of the presidential season \u2013in te", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In short, Pennsylvania could end up playing an outsized role in the selection of the GOP nominee.\nA fight by Trump, Kasich and Cruz over the allegiance of the vast majority of Pennsylvania delegates could be intense in what already has become a dirty and nasty GOP presidential campaign.\nTrump has a good chance of winning narrowly in Pennsylvania, but that may not translate into a needed passel of delegates.\nBut the party switching there pales by comparison to the magnitude of what is taking place in Pennsylvania.\nPennsylvania is looming as one of the real wildcards of the presidential season \u2013in terms of the outcome of its upcoming presidential primary and the role its GOP delegates will ultimately play this summer at the national convention."}
