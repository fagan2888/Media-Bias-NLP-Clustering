However, at forty-three, he likely has a long political career ahead of him. And, as a senator from Florida, a state with twenty-nine electoral votes, Rubio may be a contender for the vice-president slot. So it\u2019s worth getting to know him.\n\nHis campaign announcement is a good place to start. A positive is that Rubio chose the symbolism of freedom as his backdrop:\n\nI chose to make this announcement at [Miami\u2019s] Freedom Tower because it is a symbol of our nation\u2019s identity as the land of opportunity. . . . For almost all of human history, power and wealth belonged only to a select few. Most people who have ever lived were trapped by the circumstances of their birth, destined to live the life their parents had. But America is different. Here, we are the children and grandchildren of people who refused to accept this.\n\nRubio\u2019s speech was short on policy details, but he did offer a broad outline of some of his main goals: He wants to \u201creform our tax code, reduce regulations, control spending, modernize our immigration laws and repeal and replace ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nRefreshingly, Rubio does not toe the anti-immigrant line so common among conservatives. Instead, he favors legislation that, although flawed, would move in the direction of a rights-respecting immigration policy.\n\nRegarding taxes, as James Pethokoukis points out, Rubio would modestly cut the \u201ctop tax rate on labor income . . . to 35 percent from 40 percent\u201d and expand tax credits; however, I\u2019ve seen no indication that he\u2019d get serious about cutting federal spending.\n\nOn health care, with what would Rubio \u201creplace\u201d ObamaCare? As Forbes summarizes, Rubio would (among other things) expand tax credits for health insurance, repeal the mandate that insurance companies provide coverage to those with preexisting conditions, and replace that mandate with a \u201csubsidized high-risk pools for those who can\u2019t find coverage elsewhere.\u201d In some respects Rubio\u2019s plan moves slightly closer to a free market; in other respects it expands federal health-care welfare. In any event, Rubio\u2019s plan is a far cry from the ideal.\n\nRubio made grand and vague promises about creating \u201ca 21st century system of higher education.\u201d U.S. News & World Report fills in some of the details of his plans in this area, which involve tweaks to federal student loans and other minor changes. But why is higher education even a federal issue? Why is it even a government issue? Apparently Rubio is far too conventional to raise such questions.\n\nThe most disturbing aspect of Rubio\u2019s announcement is his deference to religious conservatives. (Rubio is a Catholic and was a Mormon during his childhood.) Rubio explained the \u201cAmerican miracle\u201d by people being \u201cunited by a common faith in their God given right to go as far as their talent and work would take them.\u201d In other words, Rubio does not believe that rights are objective principles grounded in reality and grasped through reason; he holds that rights are divine commands handed down from a mystical realm and grasped through faith. He thus implies that rights are not rationally defensible, which is, to put it mildly, not a strong defense of rights.\n\nNor was Rubio merely pandering to religious conservatives with his remarks. Consider his 2012 remarks regarding abortion delivered at an event organized by the seriously religious Susan B. Anthony List:\n\nThis is an issue that, especially for those that enter the public arena and refuse to leave our faith behind, speaks to more than just our politics. It speaks to what we want to do with the opportunity we have been given in our life, to serve and to glorify our Creator. . . . Virtually every faith condemns the practice of abortion, recognizes that life is a gift from the Creator and compels followers to believe that as well, as a basic tenet of their faith.\n\nReligion is not merely a sideline to Rubio\u2019s political career and ambitions; it is, by his own account, his central motivation.\n\nMy read is that, as president, Rubio would halfheartedly seek to modestly rein in taxes and (some) regulations while energetically devoting his energies to advancing his faith-based agenda. For advocates of reason, rights, and liberty, that is a bad mix.\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio's campaign announcement indicates he would reign in some taxes and regulations, and energetically pursue his faith-based agenda.", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.3", "og": {"site_name": "The Objective Standard", "description": "Marco Rubio's campaign announcement indicates he would reign in some taxes and regulations, and energetically pursue his faith-based agenda.", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s Presidential Campaign Launch: Good and Bad - The Objective Standard", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 720, "identifier": "https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Marco-Rubio-Gage-Skidmore.jpg", "height": 330}, "updated_time": "2015-04-17T15:24:49-04:00", "url": "https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/2015/04/marco-rubios-presidential-campaign-launch-good-and-bad/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marco Rubio's campaign announcement indicates he would reign in some taxes and regulations, and energetically pursue his faith-based agenda.", "creator": "@ObjectiveStndrd", "image": "https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Marco-Rubio-Gage-Skidmore.jpg", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s Presidential Campaign Launch: Good and Bad - The Objective Standard", "site": "@ObjectiveStndrd", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 407490669404205}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/the.objective.standard", "section": "Individual Rights & Law", "tag": "Presidential Election", "published_time": "2015-04-17T06:30:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T15:24:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=4.0, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "marco rubio, campaign launch, presidential election, 2016, objectivism, ayn rand, personal freedom, individual rights, capitalism, economy, education, politics, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf67b\"", "article_summary": "On health care, with what would Rubio \u201creplace\u201d ObamaCare?\nBut why is higher education even a federal issue?\nReligion is not merely a sideline to Rubio\u2019s political career and ambitions; it is, by his own account, his central motivation.\nAnd, as a senator from Florida, a state with twenty-nine electoral votes, Rubio may be a contender for the vice-president slot.\nHis campaign announcement is a good place to start."}
