The government estimates that the new plan, effective in mid-December, will help 5 million borrowers.\n\nThe new program expands the existing Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plan, which applied only to borrowers who took loans out on or after Oct. 1, 2007.\n\nRelated: There\u2019s a New Way to Reduce Student Loan Payments\n\nThe program covers direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans for undergraduates and Direct PLUS loans for graduate and professional students.\n\nDiscretionary income is defined by the government as the difference between your income and 150 percent of the poverty guideline for your family size and state.\n\nAdditionally under the plan, any remaining debt after 20 years will be forgiven for those who borrowed for undergraduate study. For those who borrowed for graduate study, the debt will be forgiven after 25 years.\n\nThe plan also provides a new interest subsidy designed to prevent balances from growing for those borrowers whose income-based payments don\u2019t cover the accruing interest.\n\nThe REPAYE plan comes after President Obama issued a presidential memorandum in June 2014 to the Department of Education requesting new regulations to help borrowers with onerous student debt. The department issued the final regulation for the REPAYE plan in October.\n\nBorrowers interested in the program can apply online with the Federal Student Aid.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Any American with federal student loans can take advantage of a program that caps thei", "title": "Worried About Student Loans?
