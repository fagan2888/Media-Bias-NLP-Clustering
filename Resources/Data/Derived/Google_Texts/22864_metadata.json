Just as Jews probably wouldn\u2019t like a Hitler Day or New Yorkers wouldn\u2019t like a Bin Laden Day, no matter how much time has passed, that person is still representative of atrocities that happened to their communities,\u201d resolution organizer Matt Remle said. \u201cThe attempted genocides that happened over the past 500 years have failed, and that\u2019s one of the ideas behind Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day. We\u2019re still here. This is who we are. We are relearning our languages, our culture and spirituality, despite everything we\u2019ve gone through over the past 500 years.\u201d\n\nThe council\u2019s resolution also encourages Seattle Public Schools to include \u201cindigenous people\u2019s history\u201d in its teaching curriculum.\n\nRELATED: Columbus Day Is Out in Seattle Public Schools; Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day Is in\n\nThe resolution proclaims that it is \u201cCity policy to participate in the annual Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day celebrations and activities.\u201d City departments are called upon to work with the Office of Civil Rights and the Seattle Human Rights Commission to maximize participation. This is in support of Mayor Ed Murray\u2019s new racial equity focus.\n\nMayor Ed Murray stated that he was inspired by the Minneapolis City Council vote in April to create an \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day.\u201d Seattle is now the second major U.S. city to take similar action. In addition, South Dakota replaced Columbus Day with Native Americans Day. Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington do not celebrate Columbus Day.\n\nRELATED: Minneapolis Replaces Columbus Day With Indigenous Peoples Day\n\nA major celebration is planned for Monday, October 13 at 4 p.m. at City Hall in the Bertha Knight Landes Room to commemorate a date now officially set aside to \u201ccelebrate the thriving cultures and values of Indigenous Peoples in our region.\u201d The public is welcome to attend Mayor Ed Murray\u2019s signing of the declaration at the occasion.\n\nUnited Indians of All Tribes will be holding a public event to celebrate the region\u2019s indigenous people from 6 to 9 p.m. at the historic Daybreak Star Center in Discovery Park.
