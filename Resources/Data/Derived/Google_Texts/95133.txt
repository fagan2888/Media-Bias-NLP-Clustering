Obamacare – an overreaching government takeover

Republican Party of Pennsylvania Chairman Rob Gleason released the following statement regarding the United States Supreme Court decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. “Today’s Supreme Court ruling should serve as a reminder that Obamacare is an overreaching government takeover of our health care system,” Gleason said.



“Today’s decision is a victory for our First Amendment rights in the face of intrusive laws such as Obamacare. Religious freedom is one of the bedrocks of our society, and today’s decision was a strong defense against President Barack Obama and the Democrats’ attempt to impose their far-left agenda on Americans.

“Secretary Tom Wolf claims that Obamacare is a ‘step in the right direction’. Instead of standing up for religious freedom, Tom Wolf believes that Pennsylvanians ‘need’ a complete government takeover of healthcare. The greatness of America lies in its freedoms and the Obama-Wolf vision of more invasive government is being rejected by Pennsylvanians.

“We hope that today’s decision will cause Secretary Wolf to reevaluate his support for Obamacare and its disastrous consequences.”
