Wonder why no Clinton campaign staffers have appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe?” It is an intentional blackout until Hillary agrees to come on the show herself, Joe Scarborough told Politico.

"The rule was put in place for Hillary's campaign because while just about every other candidate came on, the Clinton team kept trying to put out surrogates and staffers,” host Joe Scarborough told POLITICO. “We finally said 'not until the candidate comes on herself.' And then some suggested we have Jeb [Bush's] people on a month or so ago, but we held to the same policy."



The same goes for everyone in the race, Scarborough explained. On the Republican side, Ben Carson, John Kasich and Marco Rubio have yet to appear, so until then, the host said, none of their campaigns will have a chance to speak for their candidate.

The “Morning Joe” hosts haven’t exactly been very flattering of Clinton. After hearing reports that her campaign had basically manufactured a campaign event in April, Mika Brzezinski criticized Hillary for her lack of authenticity. Then, in September, Joe and Mika picked apart Clinton’s “apology” video as flat and forced. Oh and then there was that time the panel mocked Hillary for wearing what looked like an “orange jumpsuit” to a press conference on her emails.

I don’t get the Clinton campaign strategy. I mean, are her proxies really any better?
