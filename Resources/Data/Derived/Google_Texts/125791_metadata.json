We might need more time.\u2019\n\n\n\nState Openings used to be held in November or December, or, in a General Election year, when the new Parliament first assembled.\n\n\n\nBut since 2012 it had been expected that the ceremony would take place on the first Wednesday or Thursday after the May Day recess. The 2012 ceremony took place on May 9, while the 2013 date was May 8.\n\n\n\nThe speech may be delayed because the coalition partners cannot agree on 'sexy' policies to announce\n\nAn additional complication this year is that the local and European elections being held on May 22 could see the Tories pushed into third place behind UKIP \u2013 giving the Prime Minister an incentive to use the Queen\u2019s Speech as a \u2018relaunch\u2019.\n\n\n\nThe Minister added that the Tories\u2019 continuing internal feud over Europe was another reason why the State Opening might have to be delayed.\n\n\n\nLast night a Downing Street spokesman said no decision had been made to delay the Speech. He added: \u2018The date is not set in stone. The timing is entirely in our gift.\u2019\n\n\n\nA Tory source said: \u2018If we hold it before the elections we are accused of breaching purdah, if we hold if afterwards we are accused of delaying it.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Queens,speech,delayed,Cameron,coalition,sexy,tell,claims,Tory,minister", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2541992/Queens-speech-delayed-Cameron-coalition-sexy-tell-claims-Tory-minister.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "The speech, setting out the Government's legislative programme as part of the State Opening, has taken place in early May since 2010.", "title": "Queen's speech could be delayed because they have nothing to tell us", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2541992/Queens-speech-delayed-Cameron-coalition-sexy-tell-claims-Tory-minister.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/19/article-2541992-09BEF03D000005DC-514_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2541992, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Queens,speech,delayed,Cameron,coalition,sexy,tell,claims,Tory,minister", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-01-19T00:09:02.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Glen+Owen+And+Brendan+Carlin", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-01-19T10:13:10.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Queens speech delayed Cameron coalition sexy tell claims Tory minister"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "The speech, setting out the Government's legislative programme as part of the State Opening, has taken place in early May since 2010.", "title": "Queen's speech could be delayed because they have nothing to tell us", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2541992/Queens-speech-delayed-Cameron-coalition-sexy-tell-claims-Tory-minister.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/19/article-2541992-09BEF03D000005DC-514_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "The speech, setting out the Government's legislative programme as part of the State Opening, has taken place in early May since 2010."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42fe\"", "article_summary": "The Queen's speech sets out the Government's legislative programme as part of the State Opening of parliamentOne senior Tory Minister said the potential delay had arisen because the Prime Minister had \u2018ripped up\u2019 the proposed programme of legislation for not being \u2018sexy\u2019 enough.\nThe Minister added that the Tories\u2019 continuing internal feud over Europe was another reason why the State Opening might have to be delayed.\nThe speech, which sets out the Government\u2019s legislative programme as part of the State Opening, has taken place in early May since the Coalition introduced fixed-term Parliaments in 2010.\nQueen's speech could be delayed because coalition has nothing 'sexy' to tell us, claims Tory ministerSpeech traditionally sets out Government's legislative programmeTakes place in May since the Coalition introduced fixed-term ParliamentsCommons officials told the date might have to be 'moved back' to JuneDavid Cameron could be forced to postpone this year\u2019s Queen\u2019s Speech because the Government is short of \u2018sexy\u2019 policies that can be agreed with the Lib Dems, a Minister claimed last night.\nLast night a Downing Street spokesman said no decision had been made to delay the Speech."}
