TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - The Florida Department of Education says that the math tests taken by nearly 550,000 students won't count this school year.

The department sent out a memo this week to school districts telling them the results from end-of-course exams in Algebra I, Geometry and Algebra II will not be available until September.

State officials told districts to calculate final grades without the test grades. The tests are supposed to count for 30 percent of the grade.

The reason for the delayed results is that a testing law passed this spring by the Florida Legislature requires an independent study of several new standardized tests.

Legislators called for the study following the troubled rollout this year of new tests that are tied to standards modeled largely after Common Core.
