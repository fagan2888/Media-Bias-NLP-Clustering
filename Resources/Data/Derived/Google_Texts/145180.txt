The Rev. Franklin Graham sent Christians a blunt message during a recent Oklahoma State Evangelism Conference, telling them in no uncertain terms that they need to get more involved in politics — that those with unbiblical views need the pushback.

“Get involved in politics,” he said, Tea Party News Network reported. “[The] gays and lesbians are in politics [and] all the anti-God people are.”

Mr. Graham went on to say that Christianity and politics do mix and that a church that involves itself in the political matters of the day isn’t violating any biblical principles.

“I’m here to tell you, church, God loves each and every one, and Christ died for our sins, and we’ve got a responsibility to take this message to the ends of the Earth,” Mr Graham said, TPNN reported. “And I want to encourage you to take a stand in your communities. Get involved in government. Get involved in politics. Who says we can’t be in politics? The gays and lesbians are in politics, I can tell you that. All the anti-God people are in politics. They’re there.”

Mr. Graham also said that communism and progressivism are godless political belief systems that put faith in government before faith in God.

“Secularism and communism are the same thing,” Mr. Graham said, TPNN reported. “They’re godless. They’re anti-Christ. So now we have the secularists who’ve taken control of our country. They’ve taken control of Washington.”
