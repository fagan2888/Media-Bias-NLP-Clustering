The mandate requiring individuals to be insured goes into effect Jan. 1.\n\nIn November, Louisiana health officials declined to create a state-run exchange, leaving it to the federal government to operate a marketplace for Louisiana residents.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has said it plans to finalize agreements with insurers and release rates later this month.\n\nAbout 1 in 5 people in Louisiana are uninsured. But people already covered can also turn to the marketplace for options. The Urban Institute estimated that as many as 317,000 would participate in Louisiana's exchange, with more than 209,000 -- or about two-thirds of them -- qualifying for subsidies.\n\nFive groups have applied to participate in Louisiana's federally operated health insurance exchange: - Humana\n\n- Coventry\n\n- Blue Cross Blue Shield\n\n- Vantage\n\n- Louisiana Health Cooperative\n\nHumanaCoventryBlue Cross Blue ShieldVantageLouisiana Health Cooperative\n\nHow it will work\n\nThe health reform law established four levels of coverage, allowing consumers to compare plans. The levels -- bronze, silver, gold and platinum -- are based on the percentage of costs covered by the insurance plan: 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent and 90 percent. Although individuals are required to be covered next year, there are many exceptions.\n\nThose with household incomes of 100 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level will qualify for subsidies to help offset the cost of required insurance coverage, including people who are currently insured. That's $11,490 to $45,960 per year for a single person and $23,550 to $94,200 for a family of four.\n\n\n\nWhile the federal Department of Health and Human Services has authority over Louisiana's exchange, the state Department of Insurance is reviewing and must approve the proposed plans.\n\nInsurance Commissioner Jim Donelon said he welcomes the addition of the Louisiana Health Cooperative to the marketplace. The cooperative is a new kind of non-profit, member-directed insurer created under the health reform law.\n\n\"We have a desperate need for more competition in our health insurance market,\" Donelon said.\n\nIn 2005, Donelon said, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the major player in the state, held 45 percent of the market. Today, the company's market share is 75 percent.\n\nHe said that isn't meant to diminish Blue Cross Blue Shield, a quality company with a good record. But more options are needed.\n\n\"My top priority in the insurance marketplace would be to get more competition any way I can in the health insurance arena,\" Donelon said.\n\nWhile some government officials promote the idea of competition on the exchanges, insurance companies have calculated whether it's worth it to join in. Some companies have opted to sit out, at least for now. United Healthcare, which the Department of Insurance says has more than 10 percent of Louisiana's market, did not apply to the exchange.\n\nDonelon said he predicts the process of rolling out the exchange in Louisiana will go smoothly and on-time. \"I think there will be a gradual uptake from shoppers, and it will become more and more popular as people learn they may qualify for a tax credit or a subsidy and the only way to access that is to buy your coverage through the exchange,\" he said.\n\nHis major concern, he said, will be how shoppers navigate the complicated nuances of the law, such as the formulas for whether someone qualified for a subsidy or a tax credit.\n\n\"The number one concern I have is the complexity of the choices that consumers will have to make, that's my primary concern at this point,\" Donelon said.\n\nTrying to make it easy\n\nFour organizations in the state were granted federal money to train and deploy people able to give eligible residents the in-person assistance they may need to enroll.\n\n\n\nSouthern United Neighborhoods in New Orleans, Martin Luther King Health Center in Shreveport, Southwest Louisiana Area Health Education Center in Lafayette and Capital Area Agency on Aging District II in Baton Rouge received nearly $1.8 million between them from the so-called \"Navigator Grant\" program.\n\nMargaret \"Bootsie\" Durand, executive director of the Southwest Louisiana Education Center, which received nearly $1.1 million, said her agency plans to deploy people across the state and has a goal of holding on-site presentations in every community of more than 5,000 people.\n\n\"Navigators will carry laptops with printers and we'll enroll people on-site,\" she said.\n\nBut with only weeks to go before the enrollment period begins, such organizations are up against a tight deadline. On Thursday, Durand said she wasn't ready yet to even say how many boots-on-the-ground folks her organization would employ using the grant funds.\n\nKey dates under the health reform law: Oct. 1: Health insurance marketplace open enrollment begins\n\nJan. 1: Health coverage begins\n\nMarch 31: Open enrollment ends\n\nThe marketplace will be accessible at Health insurance marketplace open enrollment beginsHealth coverage beginsOpen enrollment endsThe marketplace will be accessible at www.healthcare.gov\n\nMichael Bertaut, healthcare economist and exchange coordinator for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, said his firm has spent tens of millions of dollars over the past five years preparing to take part in the exchange, despite any concerns about the uncertainty of a new marketplace. He said the company considered it \"almost business malpractice\" not to participate. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana is a nonprofit organization.\n\n\"We think that it would it be an opportunity that we just can't pass up because we have a lot of customers, hundreds of thousands of customers, who could potentially benefit from the marketplace, from shopping with federal subsidies,\" Bertaut said.\n\nHe said consumers will be offered Blue plans on the exchange statewide, in every zip code, with an average of five to 10 plans on the table, or as many as 20 plans in some areas.\n\nVantage is a doctor-owned plan based in Monroe that has focused on northeast Louisiana. Humana and Coventry, which was recently acquired by Aetna, operate across the state on a smaller scale than Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nThe Louisiana Health Cooperative was formed by Ochsner Health System and other business entities with a $65 million loan from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. More than half of its governing board will be made up of members, a co-op spokesman said.\n\n\"We're a non-profit health plan, meaning any revenues over and above costs will go back into our health plan to hopefully help keep our members costs down as well as in programs to keep our members well\" through preventive care, spokesman Jim Pittman said.\n\nThe cooperative is headed by Republican state Rep. Greg Cromer, chairman of the House insurance committee.\n\n\n\nPittman said the cooperative has been putting together a network of hospitals and doctors and using grassroots efforts through meetings and social media to get word out about the co-op.\n\nLeaders of the organization met last month over lunch with members of Jeremiah Group, a coalition of the city's religious congregations, at Christian Unity Baptist Church. Tanzania Jones, community outreach coordinator for the co-op, told pastors about the online marketplace and encouraged them to pass the word on to their uninsured congregants.\n\n\"At some point in our lives, this will be as mainstream as Medicare,\" Jones said.\n\nUnder the law, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management is tasked with taking steps to ensure competition on the exchanges by contracting with private insurers to offer two nation-wide plans. Donelon said in Louisiana, one of the national plans is being offered through Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nAn exchange for small businesses is also slated to open in October. Only businesses with 50 or fewer employees have the option to buy insurance on the exchange in the first year. The Obama administration delayed to 2015 a mandate requiring businesses with 50 or more employees to offer affordable coverage or pay penalties.\n\nBeginning next year, plans must cover what the law deems essential benefits: ambulatory care, emergency service, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance abuse services, prescription drugs, rehabilitation, lab tests, preventive care and pediatric care.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "barack obama, bobby jindal, health care reform, jim donelon, louisiana health care, business", "title": "In Louisiana's health insurance exchange, five companies seek to offer plans", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"In Louisiana\\u0027s health insurance exchange, five companies seek to offer plans\", \"link\": \"http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2013/09/in_louisianas_health_insurance.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/health4jpg-f4401447da7f36a1.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11191129\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-06T20:31:43Z\", \"author\": \"NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"tags\": [\"@frontpage\",\"barack obama\",\"bobby jindal\",\"health care reform\",\"jim donelon\",\"louisiana health care\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@nolanews", "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/health4jpg-f4401447da7f36a1.jpg", "description": "In three weeks, millions of the nation's uninsured will be able to go online and shop for health insurance.It will mark the most visible implementation of the much debated Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act since it was signed into...", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@nolanews"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, September 07, 2013,  4:54 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.nola.com/news_impact/photo/health4jpg-f4401447da7f36a1.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"nola-tp\", \"author_nickname\": \"NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"author_id\": \"10500083\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Orleans Business News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "In three weeks, millions of the nation's uninsured will be able to go online and shop for health insurance.It will mark the most visible implementation of the much debated Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act since it was signed into...", "title": "In Louisiana's health insurance exchange, five companies seek to offer plans", "url": "http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2013/09/in_louisianas_health_insurance.html", "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/health4jpg-f4401447da7f36a1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NOLA.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, September 06, 2013,  3:33 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "In three weeks, millions of the nation's uninsured will be able to go online and shop for health insurance.
