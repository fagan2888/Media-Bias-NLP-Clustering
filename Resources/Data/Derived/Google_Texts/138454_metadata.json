Washington may have fallen asleep\n\nEmail Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters.\n\nA 25-year-old man plowed his white Volkswagen Jetta through the guardrail on Grandview Avenue in Mt. Washington midday Saturday, plummeting about 100 feet down the steep hillside.\n\nAn eight-member rescue crew used rope linked to a fire truck's aerial ladder and two telephone poles to hoist the victim \u2014 who was conscious and able to give a thumbs-up signaling he was OK \u2014 onto Grandview where the road bends near Shaler Street.\n\nSeveral witnesses who saw the vehicle go over the hillside called 911 about 12:15 p.m., Pittsburgh Emergency Medical Services District Chief Amera Gilchrist said.\n\nThe four-door sedan came to a stop wedged against several trees, narrowly missing a gap to the right that could have sent the vehicle tumbling toward a trail and railroad tracks at the base of the hill.\n\n\u201cHe is very lucky,\u201d Gilchrist said. \u201cHe was alert and oriented ... and scraped up pretty good, but pretty stable.\u201d\n\nPolice did not release the name of the man, who they believe fell asleep at the wheel. No skid marks were visible on the street.\n\nHe climbed out of the vehicle on his own, then with assistance made it up to a ledge from which rescuers put a harness around him to lift him off the hillside and onto a stretcher. He was taken to UPMC Mercy, Uptown, for treatment.\n\n\u201cUnless there's a fire or you're in immediate danger, it's best to stay in the vehicle and let our paramedics and rescue crews rescue you,\u201d Gilchrist said. \u201cHe could've risked falling further down the hill ... and potentially cost him his safety and the safety of our personnel.\u201d\n\nAbout 15 feet of the turquoise guardrail overlooking the Ohio River and Downtown was ripped out. Public works crews expected to put up safety barricades.\n\nNatasha Lindstrom is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
