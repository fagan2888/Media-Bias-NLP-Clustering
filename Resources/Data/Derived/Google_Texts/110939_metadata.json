The answer is, right now they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThat is about to change, at least in part. Provisions in the Affordable Care Act of 2010 require that some quality information be made available for about 5,400 ambulatory surgical centers approved to receive Medicare reimbursement nationally \u2014 including at least 35 in San Diego County. These are facilities for surgeries and procedures that typically do not require an overnight stay.\n\nThe federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, said that later this month it will release eight new quality scores for these facilities. The Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Collaboration, an industry trade group, reports a national average for some measures based on voluntary reporting from some facilities, whose overall scores are shown in parentheses below. Some centers\u2019 rates will be much higher, and some zero.\n\nPatient burns (.024 per 1,000)\n\nPatient falls (.122 per 1,000)\n\nPatients who underwent surgery on the wrong site or wrong side; surgery that was performed on the wrong patient; and patients who underwent the wrong procedure or received the wrong implant (.035 per 1,000)\n\nPatients who required transfer from the facility to a hospital (.998 per 1,000)\n\nPatients who did not receive intravenous antibiotics within an appropriate timeframe to prevent infection (10 per 1,000)\n\nThe percentage of health care workers who received an influenza vaccination.\n\nTwo measures intended to show overutilization of colonoscopies, which carry higher risks in older people. These measures reflect whether patients had a follow-up colonoscopy within appropriate intervals, which is at least 10 years for those who had a normal prior colonoscopy and at least three years for someone who had a polyp finding.\n\n\u201cFor so long, so much in the health care system has been behind the curtain, not even known to the people who are doing the work,\u201d said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, director of the Yale Center for Outcomes Research & Evaluation, which developed some of the measures under contract with CMS. The surgery centers \u201care a big area in the system that\u2019s avoided much scrutiny, and it\u2019s time to understand its level of performance.\u201d\n\nAdded David Hopkins, senior adviser to the Pacific Business Group on Health in San Francisco: \u201cCMS is so serious about this (because) so much surgery has moved outpatient, to ASCs. That\u2019s why this is so important. It\u2019s time for ambulatory surgical centers to be held accountable for their outcomes, just like hospitals are.\u201d\n\nSurgery center facts \u2022 In 2014, 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries received care in more than 5,400 ambulatory surgical centers nationally, at a cost of $3.1 billion to the federal government. \u2022 Medicare has approved about 3,500 types of procedures for payment when they are performed in an ambulatory surgical center. \u2022 The number of centers grew between 1.5 percent and 1.9 percent per year from 2009 to 2014, or between 76 and 103 facilities a year. \u2022 From 2009 to 2013, Medicare payments to ambulatory surgical centers paid under fee-for-service contracts increased 2.6 percent per year, and 3.1 percent in 2014. \u2022 Medicare does not require cost data from ambulatory surgical centers as it does from hospitals. The federal Medicare Payment Advisory Commission recommends that the data should be submitted. \u2022 Ambulatory surgical centers are increasingly performing more difficult procedures, which have been migrating from inpatient settings. \u2022 The California Business and Professions Code requires that whenever a patient is referred to a surgical center in which a physician or the physician\u2019s immediate family has a significant beneficial interest, defined as 5 percent or $5,000, that interest must be disclosed either in writing or through the posting of a conspicuous sign in an area likely to be seen by all patients who use the facility.\n\nConsumers will be able to tell a lot, for example, from statistics that show how often a patient needed to be transferred from a surgery center to a hospital, said Leah Binder, president and CEO of the Leapfrog Group, which annually publishes hospital safety scores. The rate of transfers to hospitals may indicate that physicians had poor oversight of patient suitability for care in an outpatient facility or had little oversight of the competency of those doctors allowed to practice there.\n\n\u201cThe center that treated Joan Rivers is the perfect example of why we need these numbers,\u201d Binder said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t die at the ASC, she died in a hospital after being transferred.\u201d That center, Yorkville Endoscopy in Manhattan, was denied Medicare reimbursement and lost its accreditation last year, although it apparently is re-approved.\n\nQuality reporting for ambulatory surgical centers will in some ways be a moment of truth, said Jim Lott, former executive vice president of the California Hospital Association who is now a health care consultant and professor. \u201cIt definitely will put a crimp on their marketing. And it will level the playing field a little bit in the competition between hospitals and ASCs.\u201d\n\nAlso coming under scrutiny is how the Medicare agency monitors quality in the surgery centers. The Office of the Inspector General in the Department of Health and Human Services thinks the issue is so important that it announced in its 2016 work plan that it will publish \u201can analysis of Medicare\u2019s quality oversight of ASCs.\u201d\n\nThree prior inspector general reports discovered multiple problems, with one calling CMS\u2019 oversight \u201ca system in neglect.\u201d\n\nThe federal data release doesn\u2019t include information about centers not approved for Medicare reimbursement and which rely on private payer reimbursement or self-pay.\n\nDr. David Shapiro, vice chairman of the Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Collaboration, a trade group for these centers, said nearly all of them track their patients and know if there are problems. He believes the centers do a good job on prevention, but when CMS asked them to show the data that proved they were providing better care, \u201cindeed, we didn\u2019t have it,\u201d Shapiro said. That led to an agreement that a quality program was needed.\n\n\u201cSurgeons aren\u2019t shy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will pick up the phone and be very diligent about informing us if there were any problems with their patients postoperatively at any point after their discharge.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo this point, these ASCs may not have been measuring any of these unless they\u2019ve been required to. So this is a good way to get them started,\u201d said Dr. Karl Bilimoria, director of the Surgical Outcomes and Quality Improvement Center at Northwestern University in Chicago.\n\nCMS used a financial incentive to encourage surgery centers to publicly report their data. Those that didn\u2019t received a 2 percent cut in their Medicare reimbursement. Asked how CMS is auditing or verifying the data, a spokeswoman wrote that at this time it is not.\n\nPublicly reporting these eight new measures is just a start. Late next year, CMS will release data on two additional measures, one of which will help millions of Medicare beneficiaries who undergo a colonoscopy know more about their chance of having a serious complication.\n\nColonoscopies have higher risks than most patients or their gastroenterologists appreciate, studies show. A recent report that used actual Medicare claims rather than providers\u2019 voluntary reports found 1.6 percent of healthy beneficiaries at low risk of a complication needed emergency care in a hospital within seven days of their colonoscopy. That surprises a lot of doctors who don\u2019t track what happens after their patients leave their facilities.\n\nThis new measure will reveal centers whose providers may need to improve their skills.\n\nDr. Daniel Stonewall Anderson, a gastroenterologist at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Diego, said showing what are called adverse events for colonoscopies by center is a good idea. \u201cIt\u2019s important to get it out there, because we know the risk increases with age, and maybe (gastrointestinal doctors) will be more careful about doing them in older people.\u201d\n\nHe also noted numerous studies showing that many gastroenterologists nationally don\u2019t know the age and interval cutoffs for colonoscopy and do more than necessary. Older people are more at risk for complications.\n\nThe last measure, to be released later, looks at the percentage of cataract patients who had improved visual function within 90 days of their surgery center procedure. Ophthalmology centers can choose to report this measure.\n\nThe public has had some scant information about surgical centers, but few know where to find it and others question its value.\n\nIn October, CMS released two other measures related to ambulatory surgical centers.\n\nOne asked whether surgeons perform a safe surgery checklist, and almost all said they did.\n\nThe other reflects total volume and individual volume for seven categories of procedures, those involving the eye, the gastrointestinal system, the genitourinary system such as prostate biopsy, musculoskeletal such as wrist joint repair; nervous system such as nerve blocks or spine injections, respiratory procedures such as nasal septum repair and skin procedures such as skin grafts.\n\nThe data show, for example, that the Otay Lakes Surgery Center performed 2,545 procedures in 2012, nearly all involving the nervous, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal systems, except for two skin procedures and two genitourinary procedures. Likewise some centers don\u2019t appear to specialize in any one procedure, such as Surgical Center of San Diego, which performed 194 gastrointestinal, 362 eye, 317 musculoskeletal and 480 genitourinary procedures.\n\nTo many experts, volume speaks volumes.\n\nHow many procedures a center performs is important for both the physician and the center to know, says the Leapfrog Group\u2019s Binder. \u201cI am not personally ever going to go to an ASC that only does a handful of procedures like the one I need,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to look for the one that has the higher volume.\u201d\n\nKrumholz agreed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to have a procedure performed by someone who is not doing very many, unless they have done a million in their lives and are the world\u2019s expert.\u201d\n\nHe thinks that volume is such an important measure of quality that he and colleagues recently developed a free app called Doc Stats. It uses CMS data to show procedural volume for any provider in an area the user selects.\n\nOfficials with the large ambulatory surgical center trade group said its members are generally uncomfortable with volumes reported by CMS, because some surgeons do procedures at multiple facilities, and those procedures add up to higher volume overall.\n\nKrumholz said that while surgeon-specific complications would be nice, and will eventually come, what\u2019s also meaningful to consumers is quality data by center. .\n\n\u201cShould we get crash results from pilots or airlines?\u201d asked Krumholz. \u201cProbably the airlines are a little better. We want to know how the engineers and maintenance teams work, and a lot of other things.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to know how well the center\u2019s staff work as a team, said Leapfrog\u2019s Binder. \u201cThat\u2019s as important as the surgeon\u2019s skill.\u201d\n\nMore reporting by this author on this topic:\n\nWe'll let you know when big things happen.\n\nEmail address:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "San Diego news from inewsource", "description": "The public will soon have quality data about those ambulatory surgical centers that are reimbursed by Medicare.", "title": "Surgery center quality will soon be open to public scrutiny", "url": "http://inewsource.org/2016/04/14/san-diego-surgery-patient-harm-quality-measure/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i2.wp.com/inewsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Lead-image_Clark-e1460591556693.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-14T12:45:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T21:40:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.wp.com/inewsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Lead-image_Clark-e1460591556693.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "The Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Collaboration, an industry trade group, reports a national average for some measures based on voluntary reporting from some facilities, whose overall scores are shown in parentheses below.\nKrumholz said that while surgeon-specific complications would be nice, and will eventually come, what\u2019s also meaningful to consumers is quality data by center.\n\u2022 Medicare has approved about 3,500 types of procedures for payment when they are performed in an ambulatory surgical center.\nIn October, CMS released two other measures related to ambulatory surgical centers.\nThe public has had some scant information about surgical centers, but few know where to find it and others question its value."}
