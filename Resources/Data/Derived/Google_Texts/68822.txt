If you are part of the large contingent of the American population that opposes Obamacare, one Democratic senator says it’s probably because you’re a racist.

“I think it is very important to take a long view at what’s going on here,” retiring West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, the chair of the of the Senate Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee, said at a Wednesday committee hearing on Obamacare. “I’ll be able to dig up some emails that make part of the Affordable Care Act that doesn’t look good — especially from people who made up their mind that they don’t want it to work because they don’t like the president. Maybe he’s of the wrong color, something of that sort. I’ve seen a lot of that and I know a lot of that to be true. It’s not something you’re meant to talk about in public but it’s something I’m talking about in public because that is very true.”
