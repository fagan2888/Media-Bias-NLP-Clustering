The story behind each sign featured in the ad can be found on the campaign\u2019s tumblr page.\n\nOne of the main reasons that McDonald\u2019s new ad campaign is being dismissed as insincere is its low wages.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s new ad campaign tries to put a fresh face on the same low-wage business model that forces workers to rely on public assistance to make ends meet and that costs taxpayers billions every year,\u201d said Kendall Fells, organizing director of Fast Food Forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no getting around the need for McDonald\u2019s to pay a living wage, and until the company acts, the fast-food workers\u2019 movement will only continue to grow.\u201d\n\nMany McDonald\u2019s workers earn minimum wage despite being with the company for years. This summer, 81-year-old Jos\u00e9 Carrillo joined protests to demand a higher wage. Castillo, who was arrested while participating in the protests, has worked for McDonald\u2019s for 10 years as a maintenance man and at the time was making just $8.10. On average, McDonald workers make $9.15 an hour.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s insists that its wages are fair \u2013 or, at least, based on the marketplace.\n\n\u201cThe topic of minimum wage goes well beyond McDonald\u2019s \u2013 it affects our country\u2019s entire workforce. McDonald\u2019s and our independent franchisees support paying our valued employees fair wages aligned with a competitive marketplace,\u201d Becca Hary, director of global media relations at McDonald\u2019s, told the Guardian last week.\n\nWe believe that any minimum wage increase should be implemented over time so that the impact on owners of small and medium-sized businesses \u2013 like the ones who own and operate the majority of our restaurants \u2013 is manageable. Additionally, we believe that any increase needs to be considered in a broad context, one that considers, for example, the impact of the Affordable Care Act and its definition of \u2018full-time\u2019 employment, as well as the treatment, from a tax perspective, of investments made by businesses owners.\u201d\n\nHary went on to point out that about 90% of US McDonald\u2019s restaurants are \u201cindependently owned and operated by franchisees\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe owners of those restaurants set wages according to local, state and federal laws. More than 20 US states have raised their minimum wage for 2015. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s does not determine wages set by our more than 3,000 US franchisees,\u201d she added.\n\nThere is currently a bill in Congress to redefine full-time employment under the Affordable Care Act as 40 hours a week instead of 30. The bill, according to Republicans who support it, would prevent companies from cutting workers\u2019 hours in order to avoid paying for their insurance.\n\n\u201cOne of the worst things we could do is destroy the 40-hour work week, which has been a part of American culture and life for a very long time,\u201d the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said last week.\n\nThe White House has warned that President Obama is likely to veto the bill.\n\nIronically, another McDonald\u2019s ad, \u201cArchenemies\u201d, shows the Democratic donkey and Republican elephant coming together to enjoy some McDonald\u2019s.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, more than 75% of the workers at corporate-owned McDonald\u2019s locations were part-time working less than 18 hours a week; the number of part-time and full-time workers at franchisee-operated McDonald\u2019s wasn\u2019t available. The company says that while it can\u2019t tell its franchisees what wage to pay and benefits to provide, it has made it possible for the corporate healthcare plans to be available through its franchisees. In 2010, almost 80% of franchisees offered such plans to their workers.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "The fast-food restaurant\u2019s new campaign stresses the love between the brand and its customers but draws ire from those who believe it should pay better wages", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Jana Kasperkevic", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "The fast-food restaurant\u2019s new campaign stresses the love between the brand and its customers but draws ire from those who believe it should pay better wages", "title": "McDonald's 'Signs' ad sparks Twitter backlash among higher-pay advocates", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/13/mcdonalds-signs-ad-angers-advorcates-higher-minimum-wage-twitter", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420676225446/66f0e85e-8c47-4e4b-94f1-19b090d57dbd-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=59744338dd0fdd8da4c130481d875ad4", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/13/mcdonalds-signs-ad-angers-advorcates-higher-minimum-wage-twitter?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/13/mcdonalds-signs-ad-angers-advorcates-higher-minimum-wage-twitter", "iphone": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/13/mcdonalds-signs-ad-angers-advorcates-higher-minimum-wage-twitter?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@kasperka", "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420676225446/66f0e85e-8c47-4e4b-94f1-19b090d57dbd-2060x1236.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/13/mcdonalds-signs-ad-angers-advorcates-higher-minimum-wage-twitter?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US personal finance,US income inequality,McDonald's,Food & drink industry,Poverty", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-01-13T13:30:08.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jana-kasperkevic", "section": "Money", "modified_time": "2015-01-13T14:36:20.000Z", "tag": "US personal finance,US income inequality,McDonald's,Food & drink industry,Poverty"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420676225446/66f0e85e-8c47-4e4b-94f1-19b090d57dbd-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=6accd100f303f692f4b9a352f91dd509", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US personal finance,US income inequality,McDonald's,Food & drink industry,Poverty"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa07\"", "article_summary": "Ironically, another McDonald\u2019s ad, \u201cArchenemies\u201d, shows the Democratic donkey and Republican elephant coming together to enjoy some McDonald\u2019s.\nOne of the main reasons that McDonald\u2019s new ad campaign is being dismissed as insincere is its low wages.\n\u201cThe topic of minimum wage goes well beyond McDonald\u2019s \u2013 it affects our country\u2019s entire workforce.\nMore than 20 US states have raised their minimum wage for 2015.\nA new McDonald\u2019s commercial created by ad firm Leo Burnett is proving to be quite divisive, twisting the fast-food purveyor\u2019s slogan of \u201cI\u2019m lovin\u2019 it\u201d."}
