Bloomberg News\n\nGermany must cut taxes to encourage its citizens to spend more and generate an economic recovery in Europe, according to the chief investment officer of Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management arm.\n\nDr Asoka Woehrmann, who directs investment strategies for Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management, which has over $1.2 trillion in assets under management, said that Germans must be forced to loosen their traditionally frugal approach to personal finances and start shopping.\n\n\u201cThe thing you have to do is cut now the taxes,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cCut now taxes, spend your money. That\u2019s the message you have to give now\u2026 to enforce growth and stop people saving.\n\nHe is well aware that his advice goes against the grain of Germans\u2019 reputation for financial prudence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cultural behavior,\u201d he said of Germans\u2019 propensity to save, in spite of record low interest rates and negative real yields. \u201cPeople are not realizing they\u2019re losing their wealth\u2026 I hate people neglecting real negative returns.\u201d\n\nHe added Germans are duty bound to spend on goods and services from other European countries whose economies have stalled in order to help them out: \u201cGermany can spend much more\u2026 Germany has much more room to be flexible in their model than other European countries and if you feel solidarity for other countries, you have to show it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to enforce growth by consumer-led growth.\u201d\n\nSo what taxes should Angela Merkel cut? Income tax, is Dr Woehrmann\u2019s suggestion, as he views slashing sales tax, fuel duty or capital gains tax as too controversial. In his ideal world, he suggests that the government itself might also flash a bit more cash, mainly on infrastructure and education, but concedes that with the current fashion for austerity in the Eurozone, that is unlikely.\n\nAs for savers, his advice is fairly simple: \u201cBuy and hold is over\u2026 If you own a G4 [government bond], sell it.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Germany must cut taxes to encourage its citizens to spend more and generate an economic recovery in Europe, according to the chief investment officer of Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management arm.", "title": "\u2018Germany Must Cut Taxes\u2019 \u2014 Deutsche Wealth Chief", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/09/12/germany-must-cut-taxes-deutsche-wealth-chief/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EN029_0912de_P_20140912052504.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "\u2018Germany Must Cut Taxes\u2019 \u2014 Deutsche Wealth Chief", "description": "Germany must cut taxes to encourage its citizens to spend more and generate an economic recovery in Europe, according to the chief investment officer of Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management arm.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Juliet Samuel", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Germany must cut taxes to encourage its citizens to spend more and generate an economic recovery in Europe, according to the chief investment officer of Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management arm.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-09-12T11:40:12-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/09/12/germany-must-cut-taxes-deutsche-wealth-chief/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-26812", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Germany must cut taxes to encourage its citizens to spend more and generate an economic recovery in Europe, according to the chief investment officer of Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management arm.", "title": "\u2018Germany Must Cut Taxes\u2019 \u2014 Deutsche Wealth Chief", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/09/12/germany-must-cut-taxes-deutsche-wealth-chief/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EN029_0912de_P_20140912052504.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-26812", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-09-12T11:41:42-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c98\"", "article_summary": "Bloomberg NewsGermany must cut taxes to encourage its citizens to spend more and generate an economic recovery in Europe, according to the chief investment officer of Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management arm.\n\u201cCut now taxes, spend your money.\nSpending, not saving, goes against the grain in Germany, but people are not realizing they\u2019re losing wealth says Dr. Woehrmann.\n\u201cThe thing you have to do is cut now the taxes,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cThey have to enforce growth by consumer-led growth.\u201dSo what taxes should Angela Merkel cut?"}
