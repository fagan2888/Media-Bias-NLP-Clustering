The objective: To funnel gently worn, reduced-cost bridal gown sales into funding free programs for cancer patients and their families. This was one of about 120 stops this year on a schedule of traveling shows.\n\n\u201cI think everyone knows someone who has been impacted by cancer, so this is an incredibly important cause,\u201d says Amy Paulishak, the senior vice president of the BABC nonprofit, which is based in Lakewood Ranch and will celebrate its third year in December.\n\n\u201cI personally come from a family with a breast cancer history, and have lost two friends under 40 to breast cancer,\u201d Paulishak adds. \u201cSo with the BABC events, we\u2019re just given a tremendous opportunity to be able to take something so exciting \u2014 a wedding day and the start of a new life for a woman \u2014 and provide her and her family members with information to help prevent breast cancer.\u201d\n\nEvery show across the nation offers breast cancer resources and materials to help educate the public. The Tour of Gowns raises nearly $2 million for cancer support programs annually; 80 cents out of every dollar from each gown purchase goes toward the cause. Since January 2013, the total viewership for BABC topped 230 million.\n\n\u201cMy mother is a breast cancer survivor, so I know what it\u2019s like to see how it can affect someone,\u201d says Karen DeRitter, the event\u2019s manager. \u201cDuring these events, my favorite part is hearing people\u2019s stories. They\u2019re so inspiring \u2014 the strength and the hope.\u201d\n\nAt the Sarasota tour stop, brides-to-be had their hair and makeup done by area professionals, and personal shoppers assisted them with selecting their dream garments. Gecko\u2019s Grill and Pub catered the benefit, providing a long table packed with sandwiches. About 200 guests left with scores of colorful gift bags and souvenirs.\n\nVendors included Angela\u2019s Pure Salon and Spa, an eco-friendly Sarasota locale, where master stylist Robin Tam invited women to visit for primping. She also shared stories about her mother\u2019s bout with breast cancer.\n\n\u201cWe want to educate women about using clean beauty products,\u201d Tam says, echoing the mission of the spa's owner/cosmetologist Angela Powers. \u201cWe use organic relaxers and purified water, all in an attempt to stay away from hazardous chemicals that are so often present in salons. This is important when it comes to cancer prevention.\u201d\n\nA general atmosphere of fun and pampering helped raise awareness for the breast cancer cause while giving an uplift to those who stopped by.\n\n\u201cWeddings can be very stressful but exciting times, and we want to help make preparing for the experience enjoyable,\u201d Paulishak says. \u201cI think brides nowadays are more connected to philanthropy, so if they can give back on their special day, they\u2019re open to it.\u201d\n\nAt the event, DeRitter watched as women oohed, ahhed and purchased numerous dresses for their special days, and she was noticeably touched.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very lucky to be able to witness this,\u201d she says, \u201cand to know how many people will ultimately be helped by this mission.\u201d\n\nFor more information on future Brides Against Breast Cancer events, call 907-9350 or visit bridesabc.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/10/SBRIDE.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce05a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI personally come from a family with a breast cancer history, and have lost two friends under 40 to breast cancer,\u201d Paulishak adds.\nThis is important when it comes to cancer prevention.\u201dA general atmosphere of fun and pampering helped raise awareness for the breast cancer cause while giving an uplift to those who stopped by.\nBlending the glamour of a posh ladies\u2019 day out with the good-heartedness of a charity fundraiser, a recent Brides Against Breast Cancer event at Sarasota\u2019s Westfield Southgate had a profound impact on hundreds of guests.\nShe also shared stories about her mother\u2019s bout with breast cancer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very lucky to be able to witness this,\u201d she says, \u201cand to know how many people will ultimately be helped by this mission.\u201dFor more information on future Brides Against Breast Cancer events, call 907-9350 or visit bridesabc.org."}
