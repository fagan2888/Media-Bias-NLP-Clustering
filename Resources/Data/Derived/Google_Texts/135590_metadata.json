In the end, they seemed to indicate that they found it hard to believe the state\u2019s contention that a half-inch beard poses more of a security threat than the hair on top of an inmate\u2019s head, which is unregulated.\n\n\u201cYou have no comparable rule about hair on one\u2019s head, where it seems more could be hidden than in the beard . . . hide something in a beard, and it might drop out,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said.\n\nReplied the attorney, David A. Curran, \u201cYour point speaks to contraband, and I agree as a matter of common sense and logic there is a length and gravity component to a head that\u2019s different than a beard, for sure.\n\n\u201cBut the risk is still there none the same.\u201d\n\nGregory Houston Holt, an Arkansas prison inmate, is challenging prison rules that ban beards grown for religious reasons. (Arkansas Department of Corrections)\n\nIt went on like that for quite some time. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who coincidentally as a lower-court judge once wrote an opinion that said Muslim police officers have a right to grow beards, seemed particularly intent on picking holes in the state\u2019s argument.\n\nOn the contraband point, where the state worried about razors or SIM cards for cellphones, he proposed another solution.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t the prison just give the inmate a comb . . . and if there\u2019s anything in there, if there\u2019s a SIM card in there or a revolver \u2014 or anything else you think can be hidden in a 1/2-inch beard, a tiny revolver \u2014 it\u2019ll fall out,\u201d Alito said.\n\nA second argument, that the ban was necessary for identification purposes inside the prison or if an inmate escaped, was no more successful with Alito.\n\nThe challenge was brought by Gregory Houston Holt, who is serving a life sentence for slitting the throat of a former girlfriend and stabbing her in the chest. He is also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad, and according to his brief to the court, he feels his Muslim faith requires him to follow this dictate: \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger said, \u2018Cut the moustaches short and leave the beard (as it is).\u2019 \u201d\n\nHolt said he is willing to compromise with prison officials and keep his beard trimmed to one-half inch. But Arkansas corrections officials allow beards only for dermatological conditions \u2014 not religious beliefs \u2014 and even then they must be trimmed to one-quarter inch.\n\nHolt is pressing his claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, which was passed expressly to protect religious practices from the whims of state and local officials.\n\nIt says that a substantial limit on a prisoner\u2019s exercise of religion can be justified only if it is the least restrictive means to further a compelling government interest. The court ruled last year that the contraceptive coverage mandate in the Affordable Care Act failed essentially the same test under a related law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nLower courts had ruled that deference to prison officials required them to uphold Arkansas\u2019s restrictions, even though a magistrate said it was \u201cpreposterous\u201d to believe that contraband could be hidden in a short beard.\n\nThe Obama administration and a coalition of religious groups are supporting Holt, and Justice Stephen G. Breyer wondered how much deference was due when more than 40 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons make such accommodations.\n\n\u201cWould you say it\u2019s an exaggerated fear that people would hide something in their beards when, in a country of a very high prison population, not one example has ever been found of anybody hiding anything in his beard?\u201d Breyer asked.\n\nThe problem for the court, several justices said, was how far to go. What about a Sikh inmate who is forbidden to cut his hair and wears it in a turban? Would a full beard be more of a contraband threat than a short one?\n\nDouglas Laycock, a University of Virginia law professor representing Holt, tried his best not to get caught up in hypotheticals more complicated than the half-inch whiskers his client requested.\n\n\u201cSooner or later, you will have to decide one of those cases. But this case . . . is only about half an inch,\u201d Laycock said, adding that the law makes it the state\u2019s burden to prove why a policy affecting his client\u2019s religious beliefs is necessary.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia questioned just how deep those beliefs were. Holt is supposed to have a full beard, so why does he compromise? Scalia asked.\n\nLaycock said Holt was trying to meet prison officials halfway and shouldn\u2019t be penalized for trying to be \u201creasonable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, religious beliefs aren\u2019t reasonable,\u201d Scalia said. \u201cI mean, religious beliefs are categorical. You know, it\u2019s \u2018God tells you.\u2019 It\u2019s not a matter of being reasonable. God be reasonable? He\u2019s supposed to have a full beard.\u201d\n\nThe case is Holt v.
