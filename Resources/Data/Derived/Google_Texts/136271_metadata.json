When he\u2019s not recalling how he reduced one of the most powerful women in the world to a sobbing mess, Crist peppers the pages of his book with a plethora of sage sayings. Here are some of those:\n\nFootball teaches important lessons for life. Forgive and accept forgiveness. At some point, shouldn\u2019t the good of the people come before partisan politics? I\u2019ve always believed that laughter can be the best medicine.\n\nDeep stuff. Anyway, another great feature of this book is that it does this weird thing where it strings together a series of very short or incomplete sentences, with a line break at the end of each. That\u2019s great for two reasons: First, it makes reading the book go a lot faster \u2014 lots of white space! \u2014 and second, it\u2019s like a fun little inadvertent attempt at spoken-word poetry, which is awesome. One example:\n\nNobody\u2019s perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. Pencils have erasers. People deserve a second chance.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s perfect\u201d \u2014 I love that. Here\u2019s another, on responses to his non-involvement in the Terry Schiavo case:\n\nI detected something else this time: the approval of Democrats and independents. Those who thought I\u2019d been respectful. Those who appreciated my refusal to jump in. Those who thought the case was too much of a mob scene.\n\nAnd there\u2019s his lengthy, vivid description of that fateful hug with Obama:\n\nHe walked out toward me. Both of us smiled. The applause was just about frantic. We shook hands. The new president leaned forward and gave me a hug. Reach. Pull. Release. . . . It changed the rest of my life. Reach, pull, release \u2014 just like that.\n\nSO GOOD. If flannel-sporting English majors aren\u2019t doing read-alouds of this stuff in dank bar basements at two o\u2019clock in the morning, Charlie Crist should sue. (It would be easy, because he\u2019s working for a huge trial-lawyer firm right now.)\n\nBut it\u2019s not all slam poetry and commentary on the merits of youth sports; he also takes a few fun pokes at discussing concepts that he doesn\u2019t seem to completely understand. For instance, on the Affordable Care Act, Crist writes: \u201cIt was modeled after Mitt Romney\u2019s program in Massachusetts. How Republican can you get?\u201d \u201cWhat could possibly be more Republican than a policy from Massachusetts,\u201d said nobody ever except Charlie Crist. He also has a wondrous defense of his use of the term \u201cpro-life.\u201d Though Crist\u2019s voting record is decidedly pro-choice (which he touts in the book), he thinks the term \u201cpro-life\u201d describes him perfectly because, well, I\u2019ll let him explain:\n\n\u201cPersonally, I have always been pro-life,\u201d he writes. \u201cI believe life is precious and should be treasured. I like being alive.\u201d\n\nHistorical context, shmontext! Have you killed yourself? No? Then congratulations! You get to be pro-life, too!\n\nCharlie Crist is not necessarily the most self-aware person of all time. My favorite instance of this comes when he makes a comment on a Mark Leibovich piece that quoted Marco Rubio (who was then running against him in the 2010 Republican Senate primary). Rubio, Leibovich wrote, described the Tea Party as \u201can important part of a bigger movement in America united behind the idea that you don\u2019t have to get rid of everything that\u2019s right about America to fix what is wrong about our country.\u201d\n\nHis take on this? \u201cWhat empty platitudes! I remember thinking when I read that.\u201d I believe it. Nobody knows empty platitudes like Charlie \u201cPeople Deserve a Second Chance\u201d Crist.\n\n\u2014 Betsy Woodruff is a William F.

Here\u2019s another, on responses to his non-involvement in the Terry Schiavo case:\n\n\nI detected something else this time: the approval of Democrats and independents.\n\nThose who thought I\u2019d been respectful.\n\nThose who appreciated my refusal to jump in.\n\nThose who thought the case was too much of a mob scene.\n\n\nAnd there\u2019s his lengthy, vivid description of that fateful hug with Obama:\n\n\nHe walked out toward me.\n\nBoth of us smiled.\n\nThe applause was just about frantic. We shook hands. The new president leaned forward and gave me a hug.\n\nReach.\n\nPull.\n\nRelease.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0\n\nIt changed the rest of my life.\n\nReach, pull, release \u2014 just like that.\n\n\nSO GOOD. If flannel-sporting English majors aren\u2019t doing read-alouds of this stuff in dank bar basements at two o\u2019clock in the morning, Charlie Crist should sue. (It would be easy, because he\u2019s working for a huge trial-lawyer firm right now.)\n\nBut it\u2019s not all slam poetry and commentary on the merits of youth sports; he also takes a few fun pokes at discussing concepts that he doesn\u2019t seem to completely understand. For instance, on the Affordable Care Act, Crist writes: \u201cIt was modeled after Mitt Romney\u2019s program in Massachusetts. How Republican can you get?\u201d \u201cWhat could possibly be more Republican than a policy from Massachusetts,\u201d said nobody ever except Charlie Crist. He also has a wondrous defense of his use of the term \u201cpro-life.\u201d Though Crist\u2019s voting record is decidedly pro-choice (which he touts in the book), he thinks the term \u201cpro-life\u201d describes him perfectly because, well, I\u2019ll let him explain:\n\n\u201cPersonally, I have always been pro-life,\u201d he writes. \u201cI believe life is precious and should be treasured. I like being alive.\u201d\n\nHistorical context, shmontext! Have you killed yourself? No? Then congratulations! You get to be pro-life, too!\n\nCharlie Crist is not necessarily the most self-aware person of all time. My favorite instance of this comes when he makes a comment on a Mark Leibovich piece that quoted Marco Rubio (who was then running against him in the 2010 Republican\u00a0Senate primary). Rubio, Leibovich wrote, described the Tea Party as \u201can important part of a bigger movement in America united behind the idea that you don\u2019t have to get rid of everything that\u2019s right about America to fix what is wrong about our country.\u201d\n\nHis take on this? \u201cWhat empty platitudes! I remember thinking when I read that.\u201d I believe it. Nobody knows empty platitudes like Charlie \u201cPeople Deserve a Second Chance\u201d Crist.\n\n\u2014 Betsy Woodruff is a William F.
