However, the data does reveal another problem: extremely wide variation in the costs of care, even after adjusting for geographical differences in the cost of labor.\n\nExpenditures per primary care encounter ranged from $150 to $396 dollars, which may indicate that some facilities are suffering from inefficiencies that are needlessly driving up costs.\n\nWhile the VA uses this data for its accounting and financial analytics, its governance policies do not require the system to correlate expenditure data with encounter information in order to gain insight into the quality of primary care. This may be detrimental to patients, GAO says, and should be corrected if the VA wants to develop an accurate portrait of its services and outcomes.\n\n\u201cUsing panel size data in conjunction with encounter and expenditure data would allow VA to assess facilities\u2019 capacity to provide primary care services and the efficiency of their care delivery,\u201d the report concludes. \u201cBy not using available encounter and expenditure data in this manner, VA is missing an opportunity to potentially improve the efficiency of primary care service delivery.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The VA is missing an opportunity to improve its data analytics and provide better access to primary care, says a GAO report.", "author": "HealthITAnalytics", "og": {"url": "http://healthitanalytics.com/news/gao-va-patient-panel-setup-limits-data-analytics-care-access", "site_name": "HealthITAnalytics", "image": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/OIG-2.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "GAO: VA Patient Panel Setup Limits Data Analytics, Care Access"}, "twitter": {"description": "The VA is missing an opportunity to improve its data analytics and provide better access to primary care, says a GAO report.", "creator": "@HITAnalytics", "image": {"src": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/OIG-2.jpg"}, "title": "GAO: VA Patient Panel Setup Limits Data Analytics, Care Access", "site": "@HITAnalytics", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd903e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cUsing panel size data in conjunction with encounter and expenditure data would allow VA to assess facilities\u2019 capacity to provide primary care services and the efficiency of their care delivery,\u201d the report concludes.\nThe \u201cunreliable\u201d structure of patient attribution, as well as missing and inaccurate data, also make it difficult to perform meaningful care quality analytics.\n\u201cBy not using available encounter and expenditure data in this manner, VA is missing an opportunity to potentially improve the efficiency of primary care service delivery.\u201d\nUnpredictable variation in the sizes of patient panels attributed to primary care providers in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may be restricting patient access to basic services, found a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).\nExpenditures per primary care encounter ranged from $150 to $396 dollars, which may indicate that some facilities are suffering from inefficiencies that are needlessly driving up costs."}
