With April 15 only two weeks away and new tax laws like Obamacare, many Americans do, the American Institute of CPAs has some answers.\n\nHere are 10 questions and answers from the AICPA to help you with any last-minute uncertainties you may have as the deadline for filing your federal 2013 individual income tax return approaches.\n\nQuestion: Do I have to make that mad rush to the post office to mail my tax return before midnight?\n\nDo I have to make that mad rush to the post office to mail my tax return before midnight? Answer: Not if you e-file. The IRS strongly encourages taxpayers to file online at www.irs.gov/Filing. A Certified Public Accountant can also electronically file your return for you. If you prefer to mail your tax return, the U. S. Postal Service uses special procedures and maintains extra-long hours to make it as easy as possible for taxpayers who wait until the last minute to get their returns in the mail by midnight. You can also use one of the IRS-designated private delivery services. However, the deadline is April 15 regardless of whether you e-file or submit your tax return on paper.\n\nQuestion: What does it cost to file my return online?\n\nWhat does it cost to file my return online?

Answer: Filing a Form 4868 on time and in accordance with all IRS requirements automatically grants a taxpayer an extension to file his or her 2013 income tax return until Oct. 15, 2014.\n\nQuestion: How complicated is Form 4868? Will I be able to fill it out myself?\n\nHow complicated is Form 4868? Will I be able to fill it out myself? Answer: Form 4868 is very short, only asks for basic contact information and requires that you estimate what your taxes are for 2013.

Answer: No. You should file your return (or an extension) by April 15 even if you do not have the money to pay your tax liability. If you fail to timely file a return, the IRS will assess failure to file penalties in addition to the failure to pay penalties. If you are experiencing financial difficulties, you should consider contacting the IRS immediately regarding installment agreements and offers in compromise .\n\nFor help getting started preparing your tax return, check the tips on the AICPA\u2019s 360 Degrees of Taxes website, a public service site to assist taxpayers year-round with tax filing questions and tax planning.
