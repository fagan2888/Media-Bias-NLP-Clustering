His recovery marks the end of a year-long nightmare for his parents, Jake and Natalie Peterson, who have lived in constant fear of their son\u2019s life. \"He could go from being totally fine to turning blue sometimes \u2014 not even kidding \u2014 in 30 seconds,\" Natalie said, speaking to the NPR blog Shots.\n\n\"It was so fast. It was really scary,\u201d she added. \"When he got upset, or even sometimes just with a diaper change, he would turn completely blue.\"\n\nTwo 3D-printed splints have now been implanted to hold his trachea open until it becomes strong enough to function on its own. For the first time in his life, Garrett is now able to breathe on his own without constant supervision. But according to Dr. Scott Hollister, the biomedical engineer who oversaw the design of the implant, the severity of the young boy\u2019s condition made the prognosis uncertain at first.\n\n\"In some sense we were thrown directly into the fire,\" he told reporters. \"We characterized it as sort of a Hail Mary pass.\"\n\nTogether with Dr. Glenn Green of the University of Michigan, Hollister started by developing a computer model of Garrett\u2019s trachea. Using a 3D printer that melts plastic dust particles with a laser, they were able to construct two small, flexible splints tailored to fit around the weakest points of the windpipe. \"It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,\" Green explained.\n\nThe innovation has yet to receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 but after some convincing from the medical team, the agency granted an emergency waiver, and Garrett was finally scheduled for surgery.\n\nDuring the procedure, the team opened the boy\u2019s chest, fitted the splints around his weakened trachea, and watched as his white, oxygen-deprived lungs turned a healthy pink. The whole thing was over in about eight hours.\n\nAlthough Garrett is still in the hospital, doctors say that he will be able to come off his ventilator completely within months. \"Here something that we'd worked on, that had been constructed just a week ago to match this defect,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt had worked just the way we had hoped. I said, 'This is going to change this boy's life and his family's life forever.'\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "3d printing, tracheomalacia, garrett peterson, scott hollister, glenn green", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "3D-printed splints will help 18-month-old Garrett Peterson breathe until his trachea is strong enough to function on its own.", "title": "Baby Breathes Again, Thanks To 3D Printer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/3d-printed-windpipe-splints-help-baby-tracheomalacia-breathe-again-271518", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/18/3d-printer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "3D-printed splints will help 18-month-old Garrett Peterson breathe until his trachea is strong enough to function on its own.", "title": "Baby Breathes Again, Thanks To 3D Printer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/3d-printed-windpipe-splints-help-baby-tracheomalacia-breathe-again-271518", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/18/3d-printer.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/18/3d-printer.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-03-18T16:35:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-18T16:35:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "3D-printed splints will help 18-month-old Garrett Peterson breathe until his trachea is strong enough to function on its own."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce85\"", "article_summary": "3D-printed splints will help 18-month-old Garrett Peterson breathe until his trachea is strong enough to function on its own.\nGarrett Peterson is only 18 months old, but he has already had major surgery in the form of 3D-printed windpipe splints.\nTwo 3D-printed splints have now been implanted to hold his trachea open until it becomes strong enough to function on its own.\nI said, 'This is going to change this boy's life and his family's life forever.'\"\nFor the first time in his life, Garrett is now able to breathe on his own without constant supervision."}
