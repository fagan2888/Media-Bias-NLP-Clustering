Napolitano takes issue with the pope's exhortations on economic issues and Catholic tradition when it comes to allowing marriage annulments and permitting priests to forgive abortion.\n\n\u201cSpeeding up annulments\u2026is a rejection of his papal role,\u201d says Napolitano. \u201cHe has assaulted matrimony. For him to make annulments easier is a backdoor towards permitting divorce.\u201d\n\nProduced by Anthony L. Fisher.
