The two Sonoma County clinics were among only 10 health centers in the state and 57 across the country to be recognized as national quality leaders.\n\nThe Department of Health & Human Services awarded a total of $36.3 million in Affordable Care Act funding to 1,113 health centers across the country. In California, 118 clinics received a total of more than $5 million in grants.\n\nIt is the first time the federal health agency has awarded such funds under the five-year old health care law. The funds are to be used to further improve quality standards and patient health care outcomes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a healthy competitive spirit that will hopefully lead to improvement in the quality of health for more people in the country,\u201d Toledo said.\n\nAside from the Petaluma and Sonoma Valley clinics, a number of other Sonoma County health centers received awards in various individual categories. The recipients include Alliance Medical Center in Healdsburg; Santa Rosa Community Health Centers; and West County Health Centers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Petaluma Health Center has been awarded nearly $100,000 in federal grants", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "The  Petaluma clinic was the only health center in the state to be recognized in all four categories of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services\u2019 2015 Quality Improvement Awards.", "title": "Petaluma Health Center awarded $100,000 in federal grants", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/3255209-181//news/3255209-186/petaluma-health-centers-stands-out", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=MnRe1oBydSJ5jVNB9KkVoM$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuVUJslZo8IZrSMxTHgVd1QWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2014-12-15T16:17:00-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd872e\"", "article_summary": "The Petaluma Health Center has been awarded nearly $100,000 in federal grants for its leadership in meeting local and national health care quality standards.\nThe recipients include Alliance Medical Center in Healdsburg; Santa Rosa Community Health Centers; and West County Health Centers.\nIt is the first time the federal health agency has awarded such funds under the five-year old health care law.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that we\u2019re the only health center in California that received all four quality improvement awards,\u201d said Pedro Toledo, Petaluma Health Center\u2019s acting CEO.\nThe clinic received $15,000 for electronic health records reporting; $13,260 for clinical quality improvement; $35,760 for being a local leader in health care quality; and $35,760 for being a national health care quality leader."}
