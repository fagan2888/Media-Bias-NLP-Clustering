The updated regulations will reflect changes in the way managed care is delivered to beneficiaries, and correct inconsistencies that have developed as states have implemented their own managed care programs, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe 635-page proposed rule, which was sent to the OMB last Thursday, includes provisions that would require states to establish quality strategies for Medicaid programs and better assess the adequacy of plan's provider networks.\n\nThe rule also includes proposals for expanding managed long-term services and supports, among them increasing stakeholder engagement and developing quality measures specific to managed LTSS.\n\n\u201cThe current Medicaid managed care regulations were written at a time when a managed\n\ncare delivery system was not frequently utilized for LTSS,\u201d the rule reads. \u201cWith states using managed care to deliver covered services to populations with more complex needs, care coordination that is appropriate for individuals using LTSS becomes an important component of managed care.\u201d\n\nThe rule would cost an estimated $112 million to implement, HHS said. OMB reviews can take as long as 90 days, so the final rule is expected to be published in May.\n\nClose to 46 million people, or 73% of all Medicaid beneficiaries, have a managed care plan, and that number is expected to increase as the Affordable Care Act expands Medicaid coverage to low-income adults, Modern Healthcare reported.\n\nClick here to read the full Medicaid managed care proposal.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,forms.mcknights.com,mcknights.com,media.mcknights.com", "description": "A rule that aims to drastically overhaul Medicaid's managed care regulations was sent to the Office of Management and Budget for review last week.", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "McKnight's", "description": "A rule that aims to drastically overhaul Medicaid's managed care regulations was sent to the Office of Management and Budget for review last week.", "title": "Medicaid managed care overhaul rule goes to OMB for review", "url": "http://www.mcknights.com/news/medicaid-managed-care-overhaul-rule-goes-to-omb-for-review/article/478112/", "image": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2008/12/15/white house_34966_34967.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A rule that aims to drastically overhaul Medicaid's managed care regulations was sent to the Office of Management and Budget for review last week.", "creator": "@Emmongan", "image": {"src": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2008/12/15/white house_34966_34967.jpg"}, "title": "Medicaid managed care overhaul rule goes to OMB for review", "site": "@mcknightsltcn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183363395035820}, "google-site-verification": "mx4rGVRiNxzj0lwxNljynJz1gArTEK6bZ0rK6AzvXic", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2016-02-21T23:00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T17:32:43"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The rule, first announced in May 2015, will \u201cmodernize\u201d Medicaid managed care regulations for the first time since 2002.\nMedicaid managed care overhaul rule goes to OMB for reviewShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintThe White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to issue the final rule in MayA rule that aims to drastically overhaul Medicaid's managed care regulations was sent to the Office of Management and Budget for review last week.\nClick here to read the full Medicaid managed care proposal.\n\u201cThe current Medicaid managed care regulations were written at a time when a managedcare delivery system was not frequently utilized for LTSS,\u201d the rule reads.\n\u201cWith states using managed care to deliver covered services to populations with more complex needs, care coordination that is appropriate for individuals using LTSS becomes an important component of managed care.\u201dThe rule would cost an estimated $112 million to implement, HHS said."}
