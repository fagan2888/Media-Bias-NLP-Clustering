Audience, do you trust the government?\" After Huckabee's audience responded no, Huckabee replied: \"And why would you? I mean remember these?\" He then played clips of Obama talking about health care, the IRS, and then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice's Sunday show comments about Benghazi. Huckabee contrasted the remarks with Obama's September 16 statement it was unlikely someone with Ebola would reach America but \"we've taken new measures so that we're prepared here at home.\"\n\nHuckabee concluded his Fox commentary by claiming he's \"feeling a little sick myself. But it's not Ebola. I'm just sick of a government that I'm paying for telling me not to worry and just trust them. I wish I could, but if they repeatedly lie to me I just don't believe them anymore.\"", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Media Matters for America", "description": "Fox News host Mike Huckabee is claiming&nbsp;the American public&nbsp;should distrust&nbsp;statements made by&nbsp;President Obama and&nbsp;the federal government about the spread of Ebola&nbsp;because they&nbsp;have&nbsp;purportedly lied about the September 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\nDuring the October 4 broadcast of&nbsp;Huckabee, the", "title": "This Fox Host Thinks People Should Distrust Obama On Ebola Because Of Benghazi", "url": "http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/10/06/this-fox-host-thinks-people-should-distrust-oba/201025", "image": "http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2014/10/06/20141006post-huckabeetopimage.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-06T16:43:07-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/10/06/this-fox-host-thinks-people-should-distrust-oba/201025", "creator": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}, "site": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}, "card": "summary", "title": "This Fox Host Thinks People Should Distrust Obama On Ebola Because Of Benghazi"}, "fb": {"admins": 1092360128}, "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "Fox News Channel", "published_time": "2014-10-06T11:49:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-06T11:30:24-04:00", "author": "http://mediamatters.org/authors/eric-hananoki/2"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa2c\"", "article_summary": "Fox News host Mike Huckabee is claiming the American public should distrust statements made by President Obama and the federal government about the spread of Ebola because they have purportedly lied about the September 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\nI'm just sick of a government that I'm paying for telling me not to worry and just trust them.\nHuckabee concluded his Fox commentary by claiming he's \"feeling a little sick myself.\nHe then played clips of Obama talking about health care, the IRS, and then-U.N.\nI wish I could, but if they repeatedly lie to me I just don't believe them anymore.\""}
