We\u2019re going to MemeWorld! A runner-up New Year\u2019s resolution from Week 1106. (Bob Staake for The Washington Post)\n\n(Click here to skip down to the results of Week 1006, New Year\u2019s resolutions for 2115)\n\n\u201cPope\u2019s momma so fat the bathroom scale just said \u2018High Mass.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cPope\u2019s momma so dumb she asked for a papal bull at Sizzler.\u201d\n\n\u201cPope\u2019s momma so fat they give her a poker chip instead of a Communion wafer.\u201d\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t look too thrilled either if you were straddling a cactus and had backward-Dalmatians coming after you. This week\u2019s second prize. (Pat Myers/The Washington Post)\n\nJoking for a moment in a much more serious context last month, Pope Francis let it be known that \u201cif someone \u201csays a curse word against my mother, he can expect a punch.\u201d Which immediately prompted the duo of Tom Scocca and Joe MacLeod to pen \u201cA Selection of Jokes About the Pope\u2019s Momma\u201d \u2014 including those above \u2014 on Gawker.\n\nThe list was brought to the attention of the Empress by one of Scocca\u2019s biggest fans: another Scocca, Tom\u2019s brother Dave. And Dave also had an idea, one that taps into a latter-day Invite tradition: This week: Write a [Someone\u2019s] Mama joke for some well-known figure, past or present, real or fictional. (\u201cMama\u201d is The Post\u2019s usual spelling, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll use.)\n\nWinner gets the Inkin\u2019 Memorial, the Lincoln statue bobblehead that is the official Style Invitational trophy. Second place receives a festively painted Latin American-style clay statue depicting a troubled-looking man \u2014 understandably troubled-looking, since he\u2019s (a) straddling the top of a giant cactus, and (b) looking down at three polka-dotted dogs climbing the cactus after him. Donated by Cheryl Davis.\n\nOther runners-up win their choice of a yearned-for Loser Mug or the ardently desired \u201cWhole Fools\u201d Grossery Bag. Honorable mentions get a lusted-after Loser magnet designed by Bob Staake: either \u201cThe Wit Hit the Fan\u201d or \u201cHardly Har-Har.\u201d First Offenders receive a smelly tree-shaped air \u201cfreshener\u201d (FirStink for their first ink).
