In a piece titled, No, You Can\u2019t Keep Your Drugs Either published at Forbes, Gottlieb \u2014 who also appeared on Fox News to tout the argument \u2014 writes that policies sold through the ACA\u2019s exchanges don\u2019t include unlimited drug coverage and may force patients to pay out-of-pocket for certain medications:\n\nSimply put, many drugs may not be covered at all, and the costs patients incur by buying them with cash won\u2019t count against out of pocket caps. This has repercussions for drug makers with big portfolios of specialty and primary care drugs (more on that later). But most of all, it has implications for patients. [\u2026] The out of pocket caps on consumer spending only apply to costs incurred on drugs that are included on a plan\u2019s drug formulary. This is the list of medicines that the health plans have agreed to provide some coverage for. If the drug isn\u2019t on this formulary list, then the patient could be responsible for its full cost (with little or no co-insurance to help offset that cost). Moreover, the money they spend won\u2019t count against their deductibles or out of pocket limits ($12,700 for a family, $6,350 for an individual).\n\nUnder the law, insurers must offer drug benefits as part of 10 essential health care benefits, meaning that millions of uninsured Americans will now have drug coverage for the very first time. But the coverage won\u2019t be limitless. Insurers will continue to rely on drug formularies \u2014 as they currently do in the private market and Medicare Part D \u2014 to decide which prescriptions are covered and which are not.\n\nThe ACA requires that issuers provide the greater of one drug from each category or class, or offer as many drugs in each category as are covered by a benchmark plan. The law allows states the choice of four different benchmarks, which Gottlieb helpfully lists in his article: 1) One of the three largest small group plans in the state by enrollment; 2) one of the three largest state employee health plans by enrollment; 3) one of the three largest federal employee health plan options by enrollment; or 4) the largest HMO plan offered in the state\u2019s commercial market by enrollment.\n\nStates \u2014 not the federal government \u2014 select the benchmark and insurers then offer coverage for the drugs listed in those formularies. \u201cWhat the vast majority of states have chosen is a common small business plan, so you know it\u2019s saying what will be available in the exchanges and in the individual market generally is what\u2019s popular among small businesses now and that seems like a reasonable place to start,\u201d the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Larry Levitt explained.\n\nBut yes, there are certain limits: a formulary, for instance, may cover three drugs for treating a certain condition but not two others. Obamacare \u2014 like all insurers currently operating in the market \u2014 has a fix for that. ACA regulations demand that a health plan must have an \u201cexceptions process\u201d in place that allows patients to request and gain access to clinically appropriate drugs that aren\u2019t covered by the health plan (in addition to internal and external appeal processes). So, if a health plan does not cover a particular drug that a patient absolutely needs, their doctor can certify medical necessity to extend coverage. Insurers have relied on drug formularies before the law went into effect and already have exceptions processes in place, meaning that most \u201cwill not have to implement significant changes.\u201d\n\nIn his piece, Gottlieb illustrates the narrowness of some formularies this way: \u201cI found one plan in North Carolina that doesn\u2019t cover Actonel for osteoporosis, Aubagio for multiple sclerosis, or Xeljanz for severe rheumatoid arthritis, among other \u2018non formulary\u2019 drugs.\u201d But as Washington & Lee law professor Tim Jost points out, \u201cThis is the way formularies work, we\u2019ve decided we\u2019re going to cover these drugs, but not those drugs\u2026 I don\u2019t think you can know anything from seeing what they list as the non formulary drugs without knowing what the formulary is and how fungible those drugs are with the formulary drugs.\u201d Jost notes that drugs within the same category and class are more or less fungible, and so for most people, the drug that\u2019s offered will work as well as the one that isn\u2019t \u2014 and is often far cheaper than the name brand option.\n\n\u201cA bigger problem for the insured is going to be co-sharing,\u201d Jost admitted. But \u201cIf Gottlieb thinks that \u2018s a bad idea then let him ask his Senators and Representatives to sponsor legislation to provide low deductible plans as qualified health plans, I think that\u2019s a great idea, but it\u2019s going to cost a lot of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act struck a balance here,\u201d Levitt added. \u201cThere is a wide range of plans available to people with some people providing much more coverage, but at higher premiums, and then a minimum level of coverage that is really the kind of catastrophic coverage that conservatives have long advocates.\u201d\n\nAnd therein lies the irony of the attack: Republicans have traditionally seen high deductibles and limited coverage as a way to control individual health care spending. Now that Obamacare gives patients that choice, they\u2019re suddenly complaining that the insurance is not generous enough.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Under the law, insurers must offer drug benefits as part of 10 essential health care benefits, meaning that millions of uninsured Americans will now have drug coverage for the very first time.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Under the law, insurers must offer drug benefits as part of 10 essential health care benefits, meaning that millions of uninsured Americans will now have drug coverage for the very first time.", "title": "No, Obamacare Won\u2019t Cover Every Drug \u2014 Just Like Every Other Insurance Policy", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/10/3042741/drugs-obamacare-coverage/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/prescription-drug-addictions1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Under the law, insurers must offer drug benefits as part of 10 essential health care benefits, meaning that millions of uninsured Americans will now have drug coverage for the very first time.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/prescription-drug-addictions1-320x213.jpg", "title": "No, Obamacare Won\u2019t Cover Every Drug \u2014 Just Like Every Other Insurance Policy", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/prescription-drug-addictions1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/prescription-drug-addictions1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-10T12:40:49+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecba\"", "article_summary": "Health No, Obamacare Won\u2019t Cover Every Drug \u2014 Just Like Every Other Insurance Policy CREDIT: ShutterstockCritics of the Affordable Care Act have gone from complaining that the new health care law won\u2019t guarantee that Americans can keep their existing insurance policies and medical providers to arguing that they may have to give up their prescription drug benefits as well.\n[\u2026] The out of pocket caps on consumer spending only apply to costs incurred on drugs that are included on a plan\u2019s drug formulary.\nThis has repercussions for drug makers with big portfolios of specialty and primary care drugs (more on that later).\nUnder the law, insurers must offer drug benefits as part of 10 essential health care benefits, meaning that millions of uninsured Americans will now have drug coverage for the very first time.\nSo, if a health plan does not cover a particular drug that a patient absolutely needs, their doctor can certify medical necessity to extend coverage."}
