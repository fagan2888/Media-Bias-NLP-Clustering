The insurance company revealed the loss in filings released by the Obama administration last week.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield has requested the feds to OK about a 20 percent spike in premium costs, the station reports. This means that the 731,000 or so people enrolled in these ACA plans should expect to see anywhere from a 3 percent cut to a 20 percent hike, depending on whether the proposed rates go into effect. An estimated 8 of 10 BCBSTX plan holders qualify for federal subsidies at this moment, however.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Texas did not return a message requesting comment to D Healthcare Daily on Friday. CNBC quotes its parent company:\n\nLauren Perlstein, spokeswoman for the insurer\u2019s parent, Health Care Service Corp., said the rate filings reflect the insurer\u2019s \u201cintention to offer an array of competitively priced products to existing and potential customers,\u201d and that it has \u201cgained a tremendous amount of experience, insight and data,\u201d which was used to establish the rates. \u2026 Any discussion of average rate increases would be \u201cmisleading\u201d because \u201crate changes individuals personally receive are impacted by a host of factors,\u201d Perlstein added.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected. In January of 2014, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded the outlook for all the country\u2019s health insurers to negative from stable.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve had industry risks from regulatory changes on our radar for a while, the ongoing unstable and evolving environment is a key factor for our outlook change,\u201d said Stephen Zaharuk, a Moody\u2019s Senior Vice President said at the time. \u201cThe past few months have seen new regulations and announcements that impose operational changes well after product and pricing decisions were finalized.\u201d\n\nThe Moody\u2019s report then went on to predict the possibility that the premium costs from the young and (generally) healthy may not be enough to make up the costs of insuring the older and (generally) less healthy. At the time, 24 percent of enrollees were in that coveted 18-34 age range. Now, Health and Human Services figures put that at 28 percent. In order to fully offset the cost of treating the ill, that number, Moody\u2019s says, would need to hover closer to 40 percent. Despite that being about 3.3 million people, it\u2019s still not there yet.\n\nAmong other insurers in Texas, Cigna requested about a 16 percent increase for its local plus plan. Humana is waiting to see whether a 10 percent jump for its HMO will be approved. Smaller insurance plans seem to be struggling significantly more: Many of the Scott & White Health plans on the exchange have asked for close to a 100 percent increase on the premiums.\n\nAll health plans offered in Texas have requested some sort of increase.
