Rebates for individual market premiums are paid directly to the consumers, while those for small and large groups are paid to the employer who purchased those group plans.\n\nRebates may take the form of a check in the mail, a lump-sum reimbursement to a bank account (if the premium was paid by credit or debit card), or a direct reduction in future premiums.\n\nThe following chart provides a list of those insurers who owed rebates to Delaware consumers based on their medical loss ratio for coverage year 2014.
