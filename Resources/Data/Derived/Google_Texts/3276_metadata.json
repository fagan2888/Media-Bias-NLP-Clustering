When crews arrived, they found one man on shore, uninjured. His boating companion, however, was missing, and a fire department dive team soon began looking for him.\n\nVogel said the circumstances of the accident are still unclear. Neither man was wearing a life vest, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople need to be safe out on the water,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cAnd they have to wear life vests.\u201d\n\nJohn Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johningold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Man pronounced dead after boating accident at North Sterling Reservoir", "title": "Man pronounced dead after boating accident at North Sterling Reservoir", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/15/man-pronounced-dead-after-boating-accident-at-north-sterling-reservoir/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-15T19:20:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-15T19:20:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde807\"", "article_summary": "One man died Sunday after a boating accident at North Sterling Reservoir in far northeastern Colorado, the region\u2019s fire chief said.\nAn emergency call came in at 5:22 p.m. Sunday about a boating accident at the reservoir, which is 12 miles north of Sterling, Vogel said.\n\u201cPeople need to be safe out on the water,\u201d Vogel said.\nVogel said the man was a middle-aged adult, but he didn\u2019t have the man\u2019s name or age.\nHis boating companion, however, was missing, and a fire department dive team soon began looking for him."}
