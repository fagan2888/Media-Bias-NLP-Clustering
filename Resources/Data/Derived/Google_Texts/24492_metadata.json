She weighed 170 pounds \u2014 four more than the national average. Her body mass index was 29.2 \u2014 less than obese, but not by much.\n\nLike tens of thousands of other workers across North Texas and the country, Zwernemann enrolled in a wellness program called Naturally Slim. Ten weeks later \u2014 after Thanksgiving and Christmas \u2014 Zwernemann dropped 20 pounds. Nearly nine months later, she\u2019s managed to keep it off.\n\nShe\u2019s happy, and so is her employer, Baylor Scott & White Health, because Naturally Slim is helping the hospital chain improve the health of its employees.\n\nBaylor hopes that will lower its insurance bills.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was just transforming,\u201d Zwernemann said. \u201cAfter trying so many things, I was successful at it. I\u2019ve been able to maintain it. It makes sense to me. And it really sort of re-educated me on a lot of myths and things that even I as a physician was propagating about the ways of eating.\u201d\n\nNaturally Slim, a program offered by Dallas-based ACAP Health consultants, was developed by Marcia Upson, a Garland nurse practitioner, based on concepts learned in Shreveport, La., by her mother in the 1970s.\n\n\u201cOne day, Mom said, \u2018I\u2019m going to quit dieting and start watching thin people,\u2019\u201d Upson said. \u201cThey don\u2019t diet. They eat the things they like. They don\u2019t obsess about food.\u201d\n\nThe lessons formed the core of Naturally Slim, which Upson teaches through online videos. Some of what she learned: People should eat together, and not be distracted by videos or books. They should put their forks down between bites. They should drink plenty of water.\n\n\u201cYou can eat whatever you want to eat. You can have it all,\u201d Upson said. \u201cSugar \u2014 we\u2019re going to reduce. ... But I\u2019m going to change how you eat \u2014 the habits. And I\u2019m going to change when you eat \u2014 just eat when you\u2019re hungry.\u201d\n\nZwernemann, for example, no longer eats breakfast. She gets through the morning drinking water and coffee.\n\nThis approach was combined with the science of obesity and its many chronic diseases by Dallas-based ACAP Health, with help from two veterans of the Cooper Aerobics Center.\n\nACAP Health pushed employers to start testing their workers for five indicators of \u201cmetabolic syndrome,\u201d a cluster of conditions \u2014 excess body fat around the waist, increased blood pressure, a high blood sugar level, abnormal cholesterol levels \u2014 that increase the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes.\n\nMost employee wellness programs measure success on the basis of how many employees participate, said Wally Gomaa, CEO of ACAP Health. Naturally Slim relies on bloodwork and observed measures of an employee\u2019s height and weight.\n\nA failing grade on three or more of the metabolic syndrome indicators makes employees a candidate for Naturally Slim.\n\nGomaa said a person with a healthy waist line and normal blood glucose levels spends about $2,739 a year on health care. A person with a waist circumference that\u2019s more than an inch into the unhealthy level (above 40 inches for men, and above 35 inches for women) spends $4,451.\n\nUnhealthy waist readings and high, unhealthy blood sugar levels translate into spending of $9,969 a year.\n\nACAP Health is so confident in the program that it guarantees at least a 25 percent reduction in the number of employees with metabolic syndrome \u2014 or the company gets its money back.\n\nThe program\u2019s basic cost is $385 per employee for a 10-week course, and another $175 for maintenance programs.\n\nHilti, a power tool company with 2,700 employees based in Tulsa, has used Naturally Slim since 2009. The company saw its metabolic syndrome prevalence decline from 30 percent of its workforce to 16 percent.\n\nBAE Systems, Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of a British aerospace and defense company, ran a pilot of Naturally Slim for 1,000 of its employees. Metabolic syndrome rates fell 43 percent, Gomaa said.\n\n\u201cThe blood doesn\u2019t lie,\u201d Gomaa said of metabolic syndrome testing.\n\nSouthwest Airlines, Baylor University, SMU, Atmos Energy, Commercial Metals, Brinker International and Texas A&M are some of the state\u2019s employers that have embraced Naturally Slim. The program was adopted by BlueCross BlueShield of Texas as part of its covered prevention programs.\n\nDonna Spencer, a cargo specialist with Southwest Airlines, has lost 28 pounds on the program.\n\n\u201cLike most women, I\u2019ve tried every diet imaginable since the 1970s, and they never worked,\u201d she said. Naturally Slim, Spencer said, lets her lose weight while eating what she wants.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t monitor my calories. I pay no attention at all to my calorie count,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I want a chili cheeseburger, I\u2019ll go have a chili cheeseburger. Only eating when I\u2019m hungry makes a lot of the difference.\u201d\n\nStarting this fall, the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover obesity wellness and counseling programs at no cost to insured individuals.\n\n\u201cRight or wrong, if we\u2019re going to measurably improve the health of Americans, it\u2019s going to have to be through corporations helping their employees,\u201d said Todd Whitthorne, ACAP\u2019s president and a former senior executive at the Cooper center. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the most to lose, and a lot to gain.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was around Halloween of 2014 when Dr. Erica Zwernemann decided to learn how to eat. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve always been a person who dutifully did my exercises, I just kept getting fatter,\u201d the Keller pediatrician said. \u201cI had a sense of desperation about what I was going to do.\u201d", "og": {"description": "It was around Halloween of 2014 when Dr. Erica Zwernemann decided to learn how to eat. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve always been a person who dutifully did my exercises, I just kept getting fatter,\u201d the Keller pediatrician said. \u201cI had a sense of desperation about what I was going to do.\u201d", "title": "Wellness program that re-educates people on eating is popular in Texas", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20150911-wellness-program-that-re-educates-people-on-eating-is-popular-in-texas.ece", "image": {"width": 854, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20150911-zwernemann-2.ece/BINARY/original/Zwernemann+%282%29", "height": 1280}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-09-11T18:46:36Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-09-11T18:23:56Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Wellness program that re-educates people on eating is popular in Texas\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20150911-wellness-program-that-re-educates-people-on-eating-is-popular-in-texas.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20150911-zwernemann-2.ece/BINARY/original/Zwernemann+%282%29\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2430949\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-11T18:23:56Z\", \"section\": \"Health Care\", \"author\": \"JIM LANDERS\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20150911-zwernemann-2.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/Zwernemann+%282%29", "publishtime": "2015-09-11T18:23:56Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Like tens of thousands of other workers across North Texas and the country, Zwernemann enrolled in a wellness program called Naturally Slim.\nSouthwest Airlines, Baylor University, SMU, Atmos Energy, Commercial Metals, Brinker International and Texas A&M are some of the state\u2019s employers that have embraced Naturally Slim.\nNaturally Slim, Spencer said, lets her lose weight while eating what she wants.\nThey don\u2019t obsess about food.\u201dThe lessons formed the core of Naturally Slim, which Upson teaches through online videos.\nThe company saw its metabolic syndrome prevalence decline from 30 percent of its workforce to 16 percent."}
