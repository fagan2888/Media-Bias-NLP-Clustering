A Meridian pastor says the election of a Mississippi pastor as the president of the National Baptist Convention will be beneficial to communities around the country.

Reverend Alphonzo D. Lewis of Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church in Meridian says the National Baptist Convention, USA, Incorporated has a membership of about eight million. Reverend Jerry Young of Jackson will now lead the convention. Lewis says Young's vision is for the convention to function as a denominational entity and not just as a convention.

"The man is very, very down to earth," Rev. Lewis says of Rev. Young. "Has a humble background. But is very well trained, taught, excellent education, excellent administrator. Very, very good preacher, pastor."

Reverend Young is pastor of New Hope Baptist Church in Jackson.
