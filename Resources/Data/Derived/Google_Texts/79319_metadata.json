Cruz essentially said pro-life voters shouldn\u2019t support Trump because \u201che thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful.\u201d\n\nAs LifeNews reported, Trump stood firm in his defense of Planned Parenthood\u2019s very few services other than abortion during Thursday night\u2019s CNN Republican debate.\n\n\u201cI am pro-life, I am totally against abortion having to do with Planned Parenthood, but millions and millions of women, [with] cervical cancer, breast cancer, are helped by Planned Parenthood,\u201d Trump said in the face of criticism from his rivals.\n\n\u201cYou can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood who are helped greatly. I wouldn\u2019t fund it, I\u2019d defund it because of the abortion factor,\u201d he added.\n\nHere\u2019s what Cruz had to say in response:\n\nSIGN THE PLEDGE: I Pledge to Vote for a Pro-Life Candidate for President\n\nTED CRUZ: \u201cYou know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements on Planned Parenthood. He thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful. I would instruct the department of justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations. On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons. I want to end it because it\u2019s gone too far, it\u2019s killed millions of jobs, and it\u2019s hurting people\u2019s health care. Donald wants to end it, because he says it doesn\u2019t go fairly near enough. And what was amazing in that exchange that\u2019s missing is that for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.\n\nWhat he\u2019s said is that the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care. And a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you\u2019re heartless. Social Democrats have been saying that for years. If you\u2019re a small business owner, Donald Trump\u2019s socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you\u2019re elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on Earth where it\u2019s been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don\u2019t get that hip replacement, you don\u2019t get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care. I\u2019ll tell you that. As president, I will repeal every word of Obamacare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz: Don't Vote for Donald Trump Because \"He Thinks Planned Parenthood is Wonderful\"", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Ted Cruz went after Donald Trump's repeated praising of the Planned Parenthood abortion business last night during the Republican presidential debate.
