Of course, breast cancer is always busy, exerting its sneaky destruction through abnormal cell growth. But now it\u2019s October and Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and the scary fact is everywhere again: One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime.\n\nThis time around, the talk about breast cancer feels more urgent, more ubiquitous and definitely more confusing. Recent headlines have screamed \u201cWhat If Everything Your Doctor Told You About Breast Cancer was Wrong,\u201d in Mother Jones, and \u201cWhy Doctors Are Rethinking Breast-Cancer Treatment,\u201d in a Time magazine cover story.\n\nWhen even the White House is awash in pink, it\u2019s extremely tempting to put blinders on \u2014 especially for Jewish women like me. Ashkenazi Jews face a 1 in 40 chance of having a BRCA mutation, which increases their lifetime risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer up to 84 percent. (Overall, one in 400 women are BRCA-positive.)\n\nThese searing facts were published recently in Elizabeth Wurtzel\u2019s gut-wrenching New York Times Op-Ed, \u201cThe Breast Cancer Gene and Me.\u201d Wurtzel tackled her own bilateral mastectomy and relentless chemo regime with the same visceral directness that the author of \u201cBitch Rules\u201d and \u201cProzac Nation\u201d built her reputation on.\n\nBut it was the writer\u2019s conclusion that, for me, was a wake-up call: \u201cAll Ashkenazi Jewish women should have the BRCA test,\u201d she wrote. In the Times\u2019 print edition, that sentence was pulled out with the words \u201cIt\u2019s simple.\u201d\n\nIn reality, what to do about BRCA screenings is far from black and white.\n\nConfused and concerned \u2014 Should I get the BRCA test? Is prophylactic surgery going to be on the table? \u2014 I spent much of the past week talking to scientists, doctors and geneticists about the BRCA mutation, why it\u2019s controversial and what Jewish women should consider when thinking about genetic testing.\n\nThe recent controversy kicked in last December at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, where Dr. Mary-Claire King \u2014 the geneticist who discovered the BRCA1 gene \u2014 told her professional community that all women 30 and over should be tested for BRCA mutation.\n\n\u201cTo identify a woman as a carrier only after she develops cancer is a failure of cancer prevention,\u201d said King, a professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine.\n\nSaying all women should be tested \u2014 not just those considered at high risk \u2014 was a big deviation from current medical practice. And it comes at a time when BRCA testing is far more feasible for more women for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the Affordable Care Act changed the equation: It mandates coverage for mammograms and other prevention measures (including genetic testing and counseling) for many more women. Second, a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling helped make the test far more affordable \u2014 since then, the price has dropped from about $4,000 to about $250.\n\nStill, most of the doctors I spoke with don\u2019t think women should go out and buy a DIY test, just because they can.\n\nIn December 2013, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \u2014 an independent panel of experts appointed by the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 issued this recommendation: For women with family medical history of certain cancers, \u201ctalk with a health care professional to learn if their history might put them at risk for carrying a BRCA mutation. Women who screen positive should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, BRCA testing.\u201d\n\nFor other women, it warned against testing: \u201cFor the vast majority of American women (90 percent) who do not have a family history associated with an increased risk for the inherited mutations, the Task Force continues to recommend against genetic counseling and testing.\u201d\n\nConsidering King\u2019s recent advice, however, I asked her: What should Jewish women bear in mind?\n\n\u201cInheriting a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 drastically increases a woman\u2019s chances of developing breast or ovarian cancer, and ignoring these mutations does not make them go away,\u201d the doctor told me. \u201cBRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are inherited from fathers as often as from mothers, and if inherited from fathers may not be accompanied by any family history of cancer.\u201d\n\nThe good news, she added, is that \u201cbreast and ovarian cancer risk can be reduced from very high to very low for young women with mutations.\u201d While \u201cthe interventions [like preventative surgery] are not pretty \u2026 they work.\u201d (For women who have the mutation, a preventative double mastectomy decreases the risk of breast cancer by 95 percent.)\n\nREAD: Rochelle Shoretz, whose cancer battle inspired her activism, dies at 42\n\nKing sang the praises of genetic counseling, especially for young women with a family history of BRCA mutations.\n\nElana Silber, the executive director of Sharsheret, the national Jewish breast cancer organization, described genetic counseling this way: It \u201cprovides a personalized risk assessment and discussion of both medical and psychosocial implications of genetic testing.\u201d A trained professional can guide you through the process, she added, and walk you through risk and prevention techniques.\n\nThe value of genetic counseling is one thing that all the experts seem to agree on, including Dr. Tamar Peretz, director of Hadassah Medical Organization\u2019s Sharett Institute of Oncology in Jerusalem. She describes herself as having a \u201cunique vantage point of probably treating more Ashkenazi Jewish patients than any other physician in the world.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to universal testing for BRCA mutations, Peretz \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with testing all women; she also opposes testing all Ashkenazi women. Why?\n\n\u201cTesting must be part of good genetic counseling in which the question of the consequences to the woman and her family are taken into consideration,\u201d she said. \u201cUnlike a disease that belongs to a woman alone, the discovery that a woman is a BRCA gene carrier means there is a 50 percent chance that her first-degree relatives are carriers, too.\u201d\n\nPeretz is concerned that \u201cinformed decisions about the impact of testing\u201d are too often overlooked. When a woman discovers that she is BRCA-positive, for example, \u201cshe has to make the difficult decision of whether to tell her family [and her potential partner],\u201d often an \u201cadditional burden\u201d on top of a new cancer diagnosis.\n\nBut Dr. Marisa Weiss, the president and founder of Breastcancer.org, thinks \u201call Jewish women should seriously consider genetic testing.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenetic information used to be scary,\u201d Weiss, a breast cancer survivor who is Jewish, told me. \u201cNow it can be powerful in helping you take steps to have a full life. We are learning that all conditions, as well as diseases, may have some genetic bases to them.\u201d\n\nIn her opinion, knowing if you are BRCA positive \u201csooner rather than later gives you powerful steps for prevention and could help you save your life.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in the United States, the odds for surviving breast cancer have greatly improved. The five-year survival rate for breast cancer has jumped from 75.2 percent in 1975 to 91 percent in 2007 in part because of new tools to detect and treat cancer.\n\nAnd surgical options have improved, too. Today\u2019s mastectomies are generally \u201cnipple-sparing and we do the reconstruction at the same time,\u201d said Dr. Alison Estabrook, chief of the Comprehensive Breast Center at Mount Sinai-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City. Plus, young BRCA-positive women who want children, she added, should \u201cgo ahead and have children. We recommend screening starting at age 25 with MRIs \u2014 then they go on with their lives, get married, then around age 40, we recommend having their ovaries out if they\u2019ve had children.\u201d\n\nREAD: Israeli breast cancer survivor fills a niche with nipples\n\nEstabrook said that King\u2019s recommendation for universal testing is important because of the attention she is bringing to family histories \u2014 something especially significant as many \u201cAshkenazi women do not have complete family histories.\u201d\n\nHer concern is that if only people who are considered high-risk get tested, women who don\u2019t know their family histories \u2013 including on their fathers\u2019 sides \u2013 won\u2019t know if they are high-risk and may fall through the cracks of current screening practices.\n\nHealthy habits are crucial, too.\n\n\u201cOnly up to 10 percent of breast cancer cases are due to a genetic mutation; 90 percent are due to how you lead your life,\u201d Weiss said. That means \u201cexercising three to four times a week, eating well, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol use, not smoking, getting a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m also paying attention to the conversations around mammograms. Right now, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends that women 40 and older get regular mammograms. But in new draft recommendations, the task force suggests upping the age to 50.\n\nDr. Michael LeFevre, a task force member and immediate past chair, told me that \u201cthe decision to screen for women in their 40s should be an individual one and made in consultation between women and their doctors.\u201d\n\nWhile concerns abound about the overuse of mammography, not everyone is pleased by the new recommendations. One concern is that they will lead to decreased access to screenings, including insurance coverage for women in their 40s.\n\nAmong them is U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who, in April wrote an Op-Ed in the Washington Post urging others to join her in opposing this change to the guidelines.\n\n\u201cAs a breast cancer survivor and an Ashkenazi Jewish woman who has a significantly higher genetic risk of breast cancer,\u201d she told me via email, \u201cthere is no more personal issue for me.\u201d\n\nThe congresswoman was 41 when she discovered a lump in her breast. Her fear is the new recommendations, if finalized, \u201cwould jeopardize mammogram coverage for those who need it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m someone who loves asking questions, so I find it reassuring that the smartest thing women can do is to seek answers: Talk to our families (crucially, on both sides) about their medical histories, ask ourselves if there are lifestyle changes we need to make and talk to our doctors about breast cancer risks.\n\nAs for me, I\u2019ll be stepping up the self-care. It\u2019s been more than five years since I\u2019ve had a cigarette, but that\u2019s not enough. I\u2019m changing the way I think about exercise, for one. As the parent of a young child, exercise can feel like a luxury \u2014 a tertiary concern after work, family and everything else. But it\u2019s not; it\u2019s one way to help ensure we stay healthy, along with being disciplined enough to get a full night\u2019s sleep.\n\nAnd yes, I\u2019ve talked to my doctor about my personal medical history, and she and I agreed that I would start having mammograms in my late 30s.\n\nSince I started this article, I dug up the referral she gave me \u2014 it had expired. So I got a new one, and now I have an appointment. And I made a doctor\u2019s appointment, too, during which I\u2019ll inquire about seeing a genetic counselor.\n\nI\u2019d rather be a previvor than a survivor. And a survivor in any form then not live to see my daughter grow up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One in 40 Ashkenazi women carries a breast cancer-causing gene \u2014 yet some experts urge caution when it comes to genetic testing.
