The patient, identified only as Zhou, lost his left hand during a work accident in Xiangtan, in China\u2019s Hunan province. He was rushed to a local hospital and then transferred to Xiangya hospital in the provincial capital, where surgeons chose to graft the severed hand to his ankle to ensure that sufficient blood supply would save the limb.\n\nTang Juyu, head of the hand microsurgery department at the hospital, told People \u2019s Daily Online: Instead of amputating Zhou\u2019s hand, the surgeons kept it alive by grafting it to his ankle, so it can borrow a blood supply from the arteries of the leg. The patient\u2019s hand was severely injured, and the nerves and tendons needed time to heal before reattachment surgery. A month later, surgeons were able to remove the hand and replant it back on his arm.\n\nChina man recovers severed hand after it was preserved by being grafted to his leg http://t.co/C5woN9EnSH pic.twitter.com/Xlfkm4cPso \u2014 People's Daily,China (@PDChina) July 17, 2015\n\nAccording to the American Society for Surgery of the Hand, the reattachment, also known as the \u201creplantation\u201d process, involves a number of steps: First, the damaged tissue is carefully removed; second, the bone ends are shortened and rejoined with pins, wires, or plates and screws to hold the part in place while the rest of the tissues restore; and third, muscles, tendons, arteries, nerves, and veins are then repaired. In several cases, grafts or artificial spacers of bone, skin, tendons, and blood vessels may be needed. The grafts can be from either the patient\u2019s body or from a tissue bank.\n\nZhou now has slight movement in his fingers. However, he still requires further rehabilitation to regain full function of his hand. After the incident, Zhou recalled: \"My mind went blank at that moment and I just thought that I had lost one hand.\"\n\nThe team of surgeons performed a similar procedure in 2013 when a man named Ziao Wei severed his right hand after operating a machine in a family workshop in China. Doctors were able to preserve his hand for a month by grafting it to his ankle while they repaired his right arm.\n\nAmputation now seems like a last rather than a first option, thanks to microsurgery saving limbs.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chinese man, severed hand, blood supply, save-a-limb, reattachment surgery, replantation surgery, damaged tissue, amputation, blood supply, surgery of the hand", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A man in China had his left hand sewn back to his arm after being grafted to the ankle for a month.", "title": "Man Recovers Hand After Having It Grafted To His Leg [GRAPHIC PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/save-limb-chinese-man-has-severed-hand-grafted-ankle-blood-supply-prior-reattachment-343580", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/17/severed-hand-grafted-ankle.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A man in China had his left hand sewn back to his arm after being grafted to the ankle for a month.", "title": "Man Recovers Hand After Having It Grafted To His Leg [GRAPHIC PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/save-limb-chinese-man-has-severed-hand-grafted-ankle-blood-supply-prior-reattachment-343580", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/17/severed-hand-grafted-ankle.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/17/severed-hand-grafted-ankle.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-07-17T12:20:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-17T12:39:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A man in China had his left hand sewn back to his arm after being grafted to the ankle for a month."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd54f\"", "article_summary": "@PDChina/TwitterA man in China was able to recover his severed hand after doctors grafted it to his ankle for a month.\nThe patient, identified only as Zhou, lost his left hand during a work accident in Xiangtan, in China\u2019s Hunan province.\nA man in China had his left hand sewn back to his arm after being grafted to the ankle for a month.\nDoctors were able to preserve his hand for a month by grafting it to his ankle while they repaired his right arm.\nThe patient\u2019s hand was severely injured, and the nerves and tendons needed time to heal before reattachment surgery."}
