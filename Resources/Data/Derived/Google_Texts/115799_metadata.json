A recent CBS News poll puts the president\u2019s approval rating at just 42 percent \u2013 among the lowest marks of his presidency, and a far cry from the 57 percent he enjoyed only a year ago.\n\nThe president, who departs later Friday to Hawaii for a Christmas vacation with the first family, emphasized a positive outlook throughout his press conference. He began by touting an economy that\u2019s \u201cstronger than it was when we started the year,\u201d highlighting patterns in job growth and deficit reduction that give him confidence about the future.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that 2014 can be a breakthrough year for America,\u201d the president said, calling for a \u201cyear of action\u201d to continue building on 2013\u2019s economic progress.\n\nHe praised the recent budget deal passed by the House and Senate as a \u201cgood start,\u201d though he conceded that it\u2019s likely too early to hail the rebirth of bipartisanship.\n\nWhen he was pressed on his falling approval ratings, the president insisted he wasn\u2019t bothered by poll numbers. \u201cMy polls have gone up and down a lot during the course of my career,\u201d he said. \u201cI took this job to deliver for the American people.\u201d\n\nHe conceded that 2013 has been a year of \u201cfrustrations,\u201d admitting he wished Congress had \u201cmoved more aggressively\u201d on his agenda. Still, he argued that real progress has occurred on gun control, immigration, and other policy arenas.\n\nThe president said he continues to believe it was a \u201cmistake\u201d for the Senate not to pass a bill expanding background checks for gun buyers, but highlighted gun control efforts at the state level that he said could make a real difference in curbing gun violence.\n\nOn immigration reform, the president touted signs of \u201cprogress,\u201d highlighting the Senate\u2019s bipartisan vote in June in favor of a comprehensive immigration package. And though the House declined to take up the Senate bill (or any immigration bill) in 2013, Mr. Obama said he was heartened by a \u201ccommitment\u201d from House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to try and move forward on immigration in 2014.\n\nNSA surveillance reform\n\n\n\nThe president was pressed aggressively on the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance practices that have engendered controversy since their disclosure in June by former government contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nMr. Obama said there was no evidence the programs in question were \u201cabused,\u201d but he added it is \u201cimportant\u201d to rebuild public confidence in the U.S. intelligence apparatus.\n\nHe acknowledged that \u201cwhatever benefits\u201d the U.S. might accrue through its aggressive intelligence-gathering might be \u201coutweighed\u201d by public concern about the programs\u2019 encroachment on privacy, and he said the ongoing review of government spying practices will continue.\n\nA panel he convened to examine potential reforms to U.S. surveillance practices did an \u201cexcellent job,\u201d the president said.\n\nMr. Obama was also asked about the possibility that Snowden, who has been charged with espionage in the U.S. and currently resides in Russia, might be granted some form of clemency to incentivize his return.\n\nThe president replied that \u201cas important and as necessary\u201d as the debate started by Snowden\u2019s leaks has been, his decision to disclose classified programs had done \u201cunnecessary damage to U.S. intelligence capabilities and U.S. diplomacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I will leave it up to the courts and to the attorney general to weigh in publicly on the specifics of Mr. Snowden\u2019s case,\u201d the president added.\n\nDefense of Obamacare implementation\n\n\n\nThe president also fended off contentions that his administration has hopelessly bungled the rollout of his signature health care law, saying that the early problems with the Obamacare website have largely subsided and that the chaos sown by the structural reform of the insurance industry will soon be smoothed over. He also implied that his critics are exaggerating the scope of Obamacare\u2019s problems to suit their own political ends.\n\n\u201cThe health care website problems were a source of great frustration,\u201d he said, but there are a \u201ccouple million, maybe more, who are going to have health care on January 1. That is a big deal, and it\u2019s why I ran for this office.\u201d\n\nAnd when he was asked about other problems with the law\u2019s implementation, including the myriad delays the administration has enacted and the insurance cancellations caused by the law\u2019s regulations, the president insisted the problems \u201cdon\u2019t go to the core\u201d of the reform program.\n\n\u201cWhen you try to do something this big affecting this many people, it\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite the website problems, despite the messaging problems, it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nNew fights in 2014\n\n\n\nThe president briefly dove into the politics of the upcoming battle to raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, which must occur before February if the nation hopes to avoid a potential default on its debt.\n\nDespite evidence that congressional Republicans are gearing up for a fight, the president reiterated his long-held belief that he will not \u201cnegotiate for Congress to pay bills that it has already accrued.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine\u2026that folks are thinking actually about plunging us back into the kinds of brinksmanship and governance by crisis that has done us so much harm over the past couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to assume folks aren\u2019t crazy enough to start that thing all over again.\u201d\n\nHe also briefly discussed the tug of war over new sanctions on Iran as negotiations over that country\u2019s nuclear program continue. A raft of senators are pushing for a fresh round of economic sanctions to hold Iran\u2019s feet to the fire, but the president counseled them to wait and see what negotiations produce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be hard for us to turn the dials back, strengthen sanctions even further\u201d if talks fail, the president said. \u201cI\u2019ll work with members of Congress to put even more pressure on Iran, but there\u2019s no reason to do it right now.\u201d\n\nThe president, who will spend the next two weeks with his family for a Christmas vacation in Hawaii, said he hopes to return to Washington with a rejuvenated sense of inspiration in the new year.\n\n\u201cThe end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that I will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "On defense after sagging approval ratings, the president threw a series of counter-punches at his critics", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-year-end-news-conference-obama-goes-on-offensive/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/20/a4f42f3d-cd9e-44f8-bc9f-b34de27221a0/thumbnail/1200x630/7d0a026ac7f319f41cbcea903d62ac7a/458177881.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "On defense after sagging approval ratings, the president threw a series of counter-punches at his critics", "title": "In year-end news conference, Obama goes on offensive"}, "twitter": {"description": "On defense after sagging approval ratings, the president threw a series of counter-punches at his critics", "title": "In year-end news conference, Obama goes on offensive", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/in-year-end-news-conference-obama-goes-on-offensive/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/in-year-end-news-conference-obama-goes-on-offensive/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-year-end-news-conference-obama-goes-on-offensive/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/20/a4f42f3d-cd9e-44f8-bc9f-b34de27221a0/thumbnail/1200x630/7d0a026ac7f319f41cbcea903d62ac7a/458177881.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-year-end-news-conference-obama-goes-on-offensive/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/in-year-end-news-conference-obama-goes-on-offensive/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4271\"", "article_summary": "A panel he convened to examine potential reforms to U.S. surveillance practices did an \u201cexcellent job,\u201d the president said.\n\u201cThe health care website problems were a source of great frustration,\u201d he said, but there are a \u201ccouple million, maybe more, who are going to have health care on January 1.\nNSA surveillance reformThe president was pressed aggressively on the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance practices that have engendered controversy since their disclosure in June by former government contractor Edward Snowden.\nThe president, who departs later Friday to Hawaii for a Christmas vacation with the first family, emphasized a positive outlook throughout his press conference.\nStill, he argued that real progress has occurred on gun control, immigration, and other policy arenas."}
