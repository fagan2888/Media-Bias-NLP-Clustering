Now Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration looks to continue the city\u2019s health initiative by demanding that all chain restaurant menus indicate which meals are high in sodium.\n\n\"This doesn't change the food,\" Dr. Mary Travis Bassett, the city\u2019s Health Commissioner, told The Associated Press. \"It enables people to identify single items that have a level of salt that is extremely high.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the NYC Department of Health will propose the measure to the Board of Health. If approved, all chain restaurants would be required to designate which menu options contain more than the recommended daily salt intake of 2,300 milligrams of sodium. Like Bloomberg\u2019s move to require calorie counts on restaurant menus, de Blasio\u2019s proposal is considered the first of its kind. Also like Bloomberg\u2019s measure, de Blasio\u2019s proposal has been met with waves of criticism.\n\n\"The composition of menus may soon have more warning labels than food products,\" Melissa Fleischut, president of the New York State Restaurant Association, told AP.\n\nAlthough groups already panning the measure consider it overbearing, it\u2019s interesting to note how lenient it actually is. The proposal would only require restaurants to designate menu options that exceed 2,300 milligrams of sodium compared to the American Heart Association\u2019s recommendation of 1,500 milligrams per day. The AHA estimates that most Americans consume upward of 3,400 milligrams of sodium per day. High sodium intake often leads to high blood pressure due to the retention of water, which can lead to various health complications, including heart failure, stroke, obesity, and kidney disease.\n\nLuckily, there are proving methods for counteracting the effects of sodium by way of diet and exercise. One of the most common ways of dealing with high salt intake is by also increasing our water intake. Oddly enough, a good way to dilute the fluid sodium retains is by drinking more water. We can also try adding more potassium to our diet, which along with sodium helps manages the body\u2019s balance of water. When all else fails, go outside and work up a sweat. Exercise not only pushes the excess fluid out of our bodies, but it also gets rid of excess sodium \u2014 a quart of sweat contains around 1,000 milligrams of sodium.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "high, sodium, warning, labels, nyc", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Restaurants in NYC may have to start identifying which menu options contains more than the recommended daily intake of 2,300 milligrams of sodium.", "title": "NYC Calls For High-Sodium Dishes To Come With Warning Labels", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/counteracting-high-salt-intake-nyc-proposes-high-sodium-warning-labels-restaurant-337456", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/10/high-sodium-warnings.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Restaurants in NYC may have to start identifying which menu options contains more than the recommended daily intake of 2,300 milligrams of sodium.", "title": "NYC Calls For High-Sodium Dishes To Come With Warning Labels", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/counteracting-high-salt-intake-nyc-proposes-high-sodium-warning-labels-restaurant-337456", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/10/high-sodium-warnings.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/10/high-sodium-warnings.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-10T12:25:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T12:25:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Restaurants in NYC may have to start identifying which menu options contains more than the recommended daily intake of 2,300 milligrams of sodium."}, "article_summary": "One of the most common ways of dealing with high salt intake is by also increasing our water intake.\nHigh sodium intake often leads to high blood pressure due to the retention of water, which can lead to various health complications, including heart failure, stroke, obesity, and kidney disease.\nIf approved, all chain restaurants would be required to designate which menu options contain more than the recommended daily salt intake of 2,300 milligrams of sodium.\nNow Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration looks to continue the city\u2019s health initiative by demanding that all chain restaurant menus indicate which meals are high in sodium.\nLike Bloomberg\u2019s move to require calorie counts on restaurant menus, de Blasio\u2019s proposal is considered the first of its kind."}
