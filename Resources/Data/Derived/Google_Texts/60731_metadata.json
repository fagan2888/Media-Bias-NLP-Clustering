Its ambitions of operating within a large-scale market stem from the company\u2019s expansion into commercial managed-care membership in states including California, Georgia, and Missouri. The consolidation is now expected to add new members in Arizona and Tennessee.\n\nIn areas where Anthem is already present, it is forecast this merger will raise its profile. Already, 54% of Cigna\u2019s enrollees are in states where it is a dominant player. The take-over will expand the business\u2019 footprint by adding new dental enrollees in Texas and Florida, where the corporation has no exposure.\n\nThe combined company will have 81% of its insurance plans within the commercial managed-care sector. If we look at the data collected by Bloomberg Terminal, we can see the total membership of each company in every market segment. In the local group-employer market, Anthem\u2019s competitive advantage becomes obvious.\n\nWithin this, Anthem has 15,219 members. Cigna\u2019s roll totals 8,828. Put another way, the new company will have 45% of the total available membership in this market sector. In the national accounts-employer market, the newly combined corporation will control 31% of total memberships. The difference for Anthem\u2019s position will come Cigna\u2019s presence in both the local group and national accounts-employer markets.\n\n\n\nAnthem\u2019s decision to buy out Cigna will allow it to expand its reach into the commercial managed-care business. This segment is not expected to register exceptional growth. That reduces its significance to the company.\n\nIn fact, it is the government-sponsored health plan market that is expected to show high growth in the future. Bloomberg\u2019s data for 2014 shows Anthem\u2019s share of the Medicare Advantage enrollment market amounted to 8.40%. Cigna counted on 2.70% of the total. The bigger company will only pick up an extra 3% of market share by purchasing Cigna, giving Anthem 11.10% of the Medicare enrollment market, below United Health Group Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:UNH) 17.90% share.\n\n\n\nWithin the Medicaid enrollment market, the merger appears encouraging. With Cigna\u2019s low profile within the sector, Anthem will only acquire under 1% of additional market share. That raises the merged firm\u2019s total to 7.80%. In contrast, United Health holds 7.50% of the market, shows data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\nHealth insurance companies are eager to take advantage of the growing opportunities arising from the Affordable Care Act (AKA Obamacare), where the government is accelerating efforts to offer health insurance to previously uninsured people. Consequently, enrollment in both Medicaid and Medicare is expected to increase.\n\nData from the Henry Kaiser Family Foundation underlines increases of 13.20% in enrollment and 14.30% in spending within Medicaid by 2015. In buying Cigna, Anthem will not enjoy any significant improvements in the sector.\n\n\n\nThe Anthem-Cigna merger will not produce future high growth for the new entity. Anthem paid an almost 40% premium and did so with a large degree of debt. It will issue $22 billion in debt and $21 billion in stock for the purchase. That puts the business\u2019 debt-to-capital ratio at 49%, perhaps the highest when compared to the debt-to-capital ratios of other diversified health insurance firms.\n\nAnthem is planning to reduce its debt-to-capital ratio to 40% in two years, after closing the buyout. The company\u2019s target could result in the suspension of share repurchase programs.\n\n\n\nAnthem has payable debt worth $625 million in FY15, $947 million in FY17, $1.28 billion for FY18. Its projected free cash flows are $2.82 billion for FY15, $3.37 billion in FY16, $6.55 billion during FY17, and $7.55 billion in FY18.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"DESCRIPTION": "The Anthem Inc(NYSE:ANTM)-CIGNA Corporation(NYSE:CI) merger does not ensure high growth for the combined firm in the future as the consolidation will bring large scalability but that scalability is not marked by high growth for the future.", "COPYRIGHT": "2016 Bidness Etc", "AUTHOR": "Hannah Ishmael", "og": {"url": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/49697-anthemcigna-merger-the-real-story/", "image": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/anthemcigna-merger-the-real-story.jpg", "type": "Business_news", "description": "The Anthem Inc(NYSE:ANTM)-CIGNA Corporation(NYSE:CI) merger does not ensure high growth for the combined firm in the future as the consolidation will bring large scalability but that scalability is not marked by high growth for the future.", "title": "Anthem-Cigna Merger: The Real Story"}, "IMAGE": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/anthemcigna-merger-the-real-story.jpg", "syndication-source": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/49697-anthemcigna-merger-the-real-story/", "robots": "index, follow", "twitter": {"description": "The Anthem Inc(NYSE:ANTM)-CIGNA Corporation(NYSE:CI) merger does not ensure high growth for the combined firm in the future as the consolidation will bring large scalability but that scalability is not marked by high growth for the future.", "title": "Anthem-Cigna Merger: The Real Story", "url": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/49697-anthemcigna-merger-the-real-story/", "image": {"width": "1280px", "identifier": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/anthemcigna-merger-the-real-story.jpg", "height": "720px"}, "site": "@Bidnessetc", "player": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/video/embed/bank-america-merrill-lynch-others-slow-start/", "height": 270}, "card": "photo"}, "language": "english", "fb": {"admins": "bidnessetc", "app_id": 441098346005934}, "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "KEYWORDS": "Anthem Inc, ANTM stock, CIGNA Corporation, CI stock, medicaid enrollments, medicare enrollments, merger, gains, future growth, Obama care changes, deal value, debt to capital ratio, cash flows, financial strength", "article": {"section": "Health", "published_time": "2015-08-07"}, "news_keywords": "Anthem Inc, ANTM stock, CIGNA Corporation, CI stock, medicaid enrollments, medicare enrollments, merger, gains, future growth, Obama care changes, deal value, debt to capital ratio, cash flows, financial strength", "THUMBNAIL": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/310-anthemcigna-merger-the-real-story.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "SUBJECT": "Driving The Financial Data Revolution Bidnessetc.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce52f\"", "article_summary": "Within the Medicaid enrollment market, the merger appears encouraging.\nIn buying Cigna, Anthem will not enjoy any significant improvements in the sector.\nBloomberg\u2019s data for 2014 shows Anthem\u2019s share of the Medicare Advantage enrollment market amounted to 8.40%.\nIn areas where Anthem is already present, it is forecast this merger will raise its profile.\nThe Anthem-Cigna merger will not produce future high growth for the new entity."}
