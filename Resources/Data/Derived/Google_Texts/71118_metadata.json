Since then, its numbers have dropped precipitously.\n\n\u201cThe neat thing about that is we found them at four different sites so we know there are multiple colonies out there,\u201d said CU biologist Carol Kearns, who is one of the census project\u2019s leaders. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty excited.\u201d\n\nKearns said leading bee researchers hypothesize that Western bumblebees imported to Europe years ago picked up a non-native gut parasite. When the queens made their way back to the U.S., they probably brought the parasite with them.\n\nAs to why they might be making a comeback now, the bees could be developing a resistance to those parasites, Kearns said, \u201cbut that\u2019s just speculation.\u201d\n\nBen Bruffey, an evolutionary and ecology biology student at CU who was involved with the study, said the research will give a broader understanding of bumblebee numbers along the Front Range.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important research because pollinators are an indicator species,\u201d Bruffey said. \u201cIf their populations are declining, it could mean the environment is becoming harder to live in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0da\"", "article_summary": "But this summer, a crew of student researchers captured more than a dozen Western bumblebees, suggesting the insect is coming back.\nThe group was in the third year of a five-year census of bumblebee species along the Front Range.\nThe discovery of the insects in multiple colonies has researchers cautiously optimistic the Western bumblebee is making a comeback along the Front Range.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty excited.\u201dKearns said leading bee researchers hypothesize that Western bumblebees imported to Europe years ago picked up a non-native gut parasite.\nMany researchers feared that the Western bumblebee, or Bombus occidentalis, was headed toward extinction as are other bee species in the U.S.Their outlook changed in 2012, when a team of two University of Colorado at Boulder researchers and five undergraduate assistants found five in Boulder County."}
