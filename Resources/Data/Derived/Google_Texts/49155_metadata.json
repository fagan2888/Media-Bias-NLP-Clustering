Scouts have their eyes on his backup quarterback.\n\nThree days after Brock Osweiler\u2019s impressive showing in Seattle \u2014 arguably his best showing as a pro \u2014 Nuggets coach Michael Malone, general manager Tim Connelly and other team assistants and staff members attended the Broncos\u2019 training camp practice at Dove Valley.\n\nAnd Osweiler, for obviously reasons, caught Malone\u2019s eye.\n\n\u201cI mean he\u2019s 6-foot-8,\u201d Malone said of the former Arizona State quarterback who almost ended up at Gonzaga to play basketball. \u201cI know that he played very well in the first game against Seattle and I hope he can really have a great season, but I heard he was a pretty good high school basketball player. If he wants to come over and help us out, he\u2019s more than welcome to, and I promised coach Kubiak we\u2019ll make sure he doesn\u2019t get hurt.\u201d\n\nMalone spent some time with Broncos general manager John Elway during practice and, afterward, had a lengthy conversation with Kubiak about coaching \u2014 and getting fired. Kubiak was let go by the Houston Texans in 2013, and Malone by the Sacramento Kings last December.\n\n\u201cWe talked about myself being fired in Sac, when he got fired in Houston, and how it really does make you stronger and makes you a better coach at the next opportunity that you get,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe\u2019re just really thankful for the time that they allowed us here today.\n\n\u201cFor me, one thing I asked coach Kubiak, it\u2019s so big, everything about the Broncos. They have 90 players on their roster right now and they have 20-something coaches. I talked to him about how he delegates to his staff and how he trusts his coaches to do their jobs. Obviously, he kind of steps in whenever he sees fit, so we talked about that.\u201d\n\nMalone stayed for the full practice, watching intently from the sideline as Osweiler and Peyton Manning led the team through 11-on-11 drills, and Joe DeCamillis coordinated three special teams periods. He watched as Von Miller tore through offensive linemen during one-on-one drills. And he watched as backup receiver Bennie Fowler hauled in a couple more deep catches, as follows to his 41-yard grab Friday.\n\nBut Malone couldn\u2019t escape Dove Valley without fielding questions about the Ty Lawson trade last month.\n\n\u201cWe wish Ty well. I mean that sincerely. That\u2019s not just coach talk,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe all wish him well. But it was a move that we felt was a good move for us. I hope he\u2019s able to get his life in order, and when he does, we all know he\u2019s a special player.\u201d\n\nMalone said he had input on the deal, acknowledging that he continues to work closely with Connelly, (assistant general manager) Arturas Karnisovas and (president) Josh Kroenke.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team. There\u2019s no separation between church and state,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe\u2019re together, we\u2019re one, we communicate, and I think that\u2019s so important. But at the end of the day, Tim\u2019s job as GM is to make those decisions, obviously with the blessing of Josh Kroenke. They asked my opinion, I gave it, I tell him what I feel and believe in, and then whatever decision they make I roll with it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Josh Kroenke,Michael Malone,Nuggets,Tim Connelly,Training Camp,Ty Lawson", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Nuggets coach Michael Malone spoke about Ty Lawson at Denver Broncos practice on Monday at Dove Valley.", "title": "Nuggets coach Michael Malone talks Ty Lawson trade", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/08/17/michael-malone-ty-lawson-trade/13238/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/08/477325302-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Nuggets coach Michael Malone spoke about Ty Lawson at Denver Broncos practice on Monday at Dove Valley.", "title": "Nuggets coach Michael Malone talks Ty Lawson trade", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/08/17/michael-malone-ty-lawson-trade/13238/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/08/477325302-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Nuggets coach Michael Malone spoke about Ty Lawson at Denver Broncos practice on Monday at Dove Valley."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd44b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFor me, one thing I asked coach Kubiak, it\u2019s so big, everything about the Broncos.\n\u201cI mean he\u2019s 6-foot-8,\u201d Malone said of the former Arizona State quarterback who almost ended up at Gonzaga to play basketball.\nBut Malone couldn\u2019t escape Dove Valley without fielding questions about the Ty Lawson trade last month.\nKubiak was let go by the Houston Texans in 2013, and Malone by the Sacramento Kings last December.\nThat\u2019s not just coach talk,\u201d Malone said."}
