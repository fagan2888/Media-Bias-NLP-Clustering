I knew I wasn\u2019t going to get a job,\u201d Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador, R-Idaho, said. In fact, he joked, \u201cI was not marketable at all, so I had to run for Congress.\u201d\n\nActually, the Idaho Republican recalled, he paid his way through college and law school, taking multiple jobs to afford the cost of higher education. Although he was accepted into the prestigious Georgetown University law school, he instead chose to enroll in the University of Washington\u2019s School of Law because it was one-third the price.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to make those decisions for yourself,\u201d Labrador said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be expecting the government to be subsiding everything that you\u2019re going to be doing in your life.\u201d\n\nAlthough he took a lighthearted approach to the debate over the burden of student loan debt, Labrador and his colleagues had a serious message for millennials: President Obama\u2019s policies are making it more difficult for young Americans to prosper.\n\n\u201cYoung people who voted overwhelmingly for Obama have a higher unemployment rate today than they did before Obama was president of the United States,\u201d Labrador said. \u201cThey have fewer opportunities for growth, their education loans are higher, and they\u2019re having fewer opportunities to go out there in the marketplace.\u201d\n\n>>> Watch the Entire Conversation (with School Loans at 32:40, 40:37)\n\nRep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., agreed, and encouraged millennials to work part-time jobs to front the cost of education and get real-world experience.\n\n\u201cThe added benefit of actually working while you\u2019re going to school,\u201d Salmon said, \u201cis that when you graduate, you actually have some marketable skills in addition to your sheepskin.\u201d\n\nWhen The Daily Signal asked about Obama\u2019s reference to \u201cmillionaires\u201d helping to retire loan debt in his remarks yesterday at the White House, Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, said the president\u2019s rhetoric is an attempt to drum up support before the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cWe have this massive VA scandal, and he is out talking about the executive actions, trying to distract the public from a failed economy, failed situation at the VA.\u201d\n\nHuelskamp added: \u201cI think he\u2019s trying to make himself relevant in a town he should be fixing.\u201d\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., argued that part of the problem with prevailing trends in American education is that \u201cwe boost up people\u2019s self-esteem and tell them they can be whatever they want\u2014they can major in anything they want.\u201d\n\nBut in his district, Massie said, employers are \u201ccrying\u201d for more qualified employees.\n\n\u201cWe send [young people] to college without asking them to look at their employment prospects with their degrees,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. \u201cThis is an area where there needs to be some personal accountability and responsibility.\u201d\n\nHis advice to college-bound millennials? \u201cDo not major in political science.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama has misplaced priorities on the job market that makes student loan debt worse, congressmen say at Conversations with Conservatives event.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Obama has misplaced priorities on the job market that makes student loan debt worse, congressmen say at Conversations with Conservatives event.", "title": "Conservatives: Obama\u2019s Policy on Student Loans Hurts Millennials", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014_0610_CWC-Thumbnail.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-10T17:28:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1hMJGPu"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Obama has misplaced priorities on the job market that makes student loan debt worse, congressmen say at Conversations with Conservatives event.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014_0610_CWC-Thumbnail.jpg"}, "title": "Conservatives: Obama\u2019s Policy on Student Loans Hurts Millennials", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "American Dream,higher ed,jobs", "published_time": "2014-06-10T17:08:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-10T17:28:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2ae\"", "article_summary": "The job market and student loan debt had lawmakers waxing philosophical at today\u2019s Conversations with Conservatives event on Capitol Hill.\nAlthough he was accepted into the prestigious Georgetown University law school, he instead chose to enroll in the University of Washington\u2019s School of Law because it was one-third the price.\n\u201cThis is an area where there needs to be some personal accountability and responsibility.\u201dHis advice to college-bound millennials?\n\u201cWhen I graduated from undergrad, I had a degree in Spanish literature and a minor in philosophy.\nI knew I wasn\u2019t going to get a job,\u201d Rep.
