Political humorist and Heartland friend Bill Mellberg appeared last week on the Stevie Jay and Diane Ducey show on ESPN Radio 93.5 in Champaign-Urbana, IL to imagine a world in which President Obama not only wasn’t re-elected president, but didn’t win his first Senate race in 2004.

In Bill’s parody, Obama operates a used car lot, “Crazy Barry’s Obama Car, Used Car, Car Emporium”, where he only sells American, union made cars fromthe “workers paradise” of Detroit. We don’t want to give too much away, so just listen in the player above.
