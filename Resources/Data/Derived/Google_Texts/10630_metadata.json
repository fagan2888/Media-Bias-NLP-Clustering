Apartment complexes and businesses must register for the city\u2019s \u201c2-5-2\u201d repeat offender list if they meet the following criteria:\n\nTwo or more separate notices of violation for conditions that are dangerous or impair habitability, and were not corrected within the time required.\n\nFive or more separate notices of violation for conditions that are dangerous or impair habitability which are issued on separate days regardless of whether the violation was corrected or not.\n\nTwo or more citations for conditions that are dangerous or impair habitability within 12 consecutive months.\n\nThe program was established in October 2013 in response to a incidents of collapsing balconies and walkways at local apartment complexes that displaced dozens of low-income tenants.\n\nThe ROP is intended to create safer living conditions for tenants by having landlords with multiple code violations register with the City Code Department, pay a $100 fee and post notices at the property. City ordinance also requires annual inspections for any outstanding violations. An example of the ROP Notice to Register is here.\n\nBut UT Law student researchers under the guidance of the Clinic\u2019s Director Heather K. Way find:\n\nthe ROP is complaint-driven, creating the potential many serious and life-threatening conditions are missed\n\naverage response time for initial inspections based on citizen complaints at ROP properties takes longer (12.6 days) than for other code violations (1.89-3.57 days)\n\nfew smaller rental properties qualify under the ordinance, leaving out duplexes and quad-plex units\n\nmany ROP property owners fail to register after receiving notice (19 of 29)\n\n\u2018most\u2019 ROP owners are missing Notice of Violation (NOV) deadlines\n\nCode is not penalizing those owners creating an environment where landlords can ignore initial NOVs\n\nThe average time to carry out a follow-up inspection after a repair deadline at an ROP property is 83 days. The average time to address a code violation \u2013 159 days, the study found.\n\nAustin Code\u2019s stated time to close out a code violation from complaint to voluntary compliance is 90 days. Compare that the study\u2019s authors suggest to San Antonio where the voluntary compliance rate in 2011 was 29 days and in Dallas, 33 days.\n\nThe Clinic\u2019s report also finds by the time Code refers a case to the City\u2019s Building Services Commission months have gone by \u201cleaving tenants exposed to dangerous living conditions for many months\u201d and several instances where landlords have failed to act on Commission orders, \u201cposing on-going safety risks to the tenants who remain in the units.\u201d\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe study\u2019s authors put forth 16 recommendations. Among them:\n\nallowing Code Officers to issue Violation Notices during drive-bys; not just after complaints\n\nadopting a rental registration program so most properties are subject to routine health and safety inspections\n\nputting in place a High Impact Landlord Program to show which owners of smaller-sized properties such as duplexes are putting tenants\u2019 health and safety at risk\n\nconducting inspections of ROP properties immediately after they register\n\ncarrying out follow up inspections and ensure owners are held to deadlines (extending to civil fines, criminal citations or Chap 54 lawsuits against owners who violate BSC orders)\n\nimplementing a community prosecutor program to enforce actions against problem properties\n\nThe City\u2019s response\n\nKXAN reached out to Code staff for their reaction to the UT study which was sent to Code Department executives in mid-July, a week before the official release Monday the 27th, according to Randy Teich President of the North Austin Civic Association which commissioned the report.\n\nA City spokesperson emailed this response:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently unable to comment on specific aspects or conclusions until we\u2019ve had to time to fully review their analysis but do appreciate the Civic Association\u2019s diligence and commitment to improving the City. We\u2019ll include their findings as yet another voice in the on-going discussion concerning dangerous rental properties. It will take a collaborative effort from both the public and the City to identify and address gaps in current programs and turn them into opportunities that benefit the community at large. We look forward to taking these challenges head on to make Austin the most livable city in the country.\u2019 \u2013 David Green, City of Austin\n\nFY 2014-15 budget records show Austin Code created\udbc0\udc03 a\udbc0\udc03 Multi Family\udbc0\udc03 Inspection\udbc0\udc03 Unit,\udbc0\udc03 in light of recent incidents where balconies or walkways threatened to collapse at rental complexes.
