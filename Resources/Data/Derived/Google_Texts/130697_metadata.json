At first, I enjoyed riding the N train to its last stop. It left Manhattan, and dove underwater at 57th Street, then crossed into Queens and resurfaced above ground, bringing the dying light of dusk, birch trees, and sky through the windows. After it dropped us off at the last stop, I walked 10 blocks to my apartment \u2014 one way, an hour-and-a-half from work to home. But despite feeling relieved when I left Manhattan, I was unhappy. I was spending three hours a day on the train, transferring trains, or walking down that icy street in Queens back and forth to the train. Going to the gym meant either getting up at 6 a.m. or not getting home until 10 p.m. Most nights, I stayed home to avoid taking the train for another hour to meet friends back in Manhattan.\n\nIf you have a similarly lengthy commute that gets you down and fatigued, you\u2019re not alone. A new study shows that a longer commute does indeed lower your life satisfaction. Published in World Leisure Journal, the research, which was conducted by the University of Waterloo, found that any type of long commute \u2014 whether you travel by subway or car \u2014 reduced people\u2019s level of happiness and impaired their overall mental health.\n\n\u201cWe found that the longer it takes someone to get to work, the lower their satisfaction with life in general,\u201d said Margo Hilbrecht, a professor in applied health sciences at the University of Waterloo and the associate director of research for the Canadian Index of Wellbeing, in a press release.\n\nThe researchers found that commutes can often offer some positive things, like providing people time to unwind before or after work. Train riders don\u2019t have to worry about being stuck in traffic or driving a car, and can often spend that time reading or listening to music. But the problem is having a time crunch, the researchers argue. \u201cSome people may enjoy a commute, but overall, longer travel time is linked to feelings of time crunch, which can increase stress levels,\u201d Hilbrecht said.\n\nPast research has found that long commutes were linked to both poor mental and physical health, and have exacerbated or caused issues like hypertension, obesity, fatigue, and a lowered immune system (causing work absences). If you\u2019re constantly on the go, and rarely have a moment to yourself, it\u2019s easy to imagine that getting sick and feeling tired might be more likely.\n\nBut the major factor that caused lower life satisfaction was the lack of physical activity among people who had long commutes, the researchers found. \u201cWe learned that commuters who had time for physical leisure had higher life satisfaction,\u201d Hilbrecht said. \u201cPhysical activity can mitigate commuting-related stress if workers can include it in their daily routines, but the obvious constraint is time scarcity. Longer commutes mean less time for other activities, which leads to lower life satisfaction.\u201d\n\nResearch has shown that driving is the worst offender, because you\u2019ll spend far less time walking than if you took the train or biked to work. One study found that women who commuted via train, biking, or other forms of transportation had a body mass index score 0.7 lower than that of women who drove to work every day. Both driving and working in an office are sedentary, which can increase your chances of obesity.\n\nUltimately, the authors concluded that employers should be aware of their employees\u2019 commuting times, and allow for more flexible work hours to provide for exercise time. \u201cThe message to employers is that encouraging flexible work hours or providing time for physical leisure can pay dividends in their employees\u2019 satisfaction with life,\u201d Hilbrecht said.\n\nSource: Hilbrecht M, Smale B, Mock S.
