Some 280,000 people live in Amish communities scattered through the United States, with the largest populations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, according to research by Elizabethtown College in Lancaster County.\n\nWhile practices vary by community, most Amish fund their health care through a system that merges church aid, benefit auctions and negotiated discounts with local hospitals, promising quick cash payment in exchange for lower rates.\n\n\"The way they come together to pay for health care is amazing,\" said Jan Bergen, chief operating officer at Lancaster General Health. \"It's a tithing. Their sense of responsibility extends beyond themselves and to the community.\"\n\nThe Amish exemption to Obamacare dates back nearly 60 years to when Congress extended the Social Security tax to the self-employed and to farmers. Many Amish refused to pay. The Internal Revenue Service moved to enforce the law, sometimes with disastrous public relations consequences.\n\n\"There was an Amish guy who refused to pay Social Security. IRS agents confiscated his horses while he was out in the field plowing,\" said Donald Kraybill, author of \"The Amish\" and professor at Elizabethtown College.\n\nIn 1965, Congress passed a law giving certain Amish and Mennonite religious orders the right to opt out of Social Security, Medicaid and a host of other government benefits. The Obamacare exemption is an extension of the Social Security exemption.\n\n\"The basic religious reason driving their resistance is that, as a religious faith, the church community should take care of its own members,\" said Kraybill. \"If there's a disaster like a tornado, fire or hospital bill, the community should come together for that.\"\n\nAn Amish man from Kinzers, Lancaster County, said his community relies on two funds. Nearly every family contributes monthly to a hospital aid fund, while large bills are also paid with free-will offerings.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Nation-World, Health, Pennsylvania, News, Breaking", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-mcall", "description": "The debate over U.S. health-care reform that has gripped the nation and led to a government shutdown is of small concern in rural Pennsylvania's Amish country for a very simple reason.
