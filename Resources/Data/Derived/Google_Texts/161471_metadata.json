Many companies may need that extra personnel, as more than half of the CFOs predict higher sales in 2014, driven by increased demand from existing customers and greater expansion into international markets.\n\n\n\nThere's one catch: Amid the positive views, one very big risk has captured CFOs' attention, and it's tied directly to the workforce, and health care benefits in particular: unanticipated labor costs. Eight out of 10 executives said they were somewhat or very concerned. That outpaced market risks, operational risks, succession planning and several other concerns.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "CFOs are hoping they can avoid layoffs and even boost hiring in 2014.
