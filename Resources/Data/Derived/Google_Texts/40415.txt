RALEIGH, NC (AP) â€” Experts say there are at least 13 ships sunk off the North Carolina coast that could leak oil.

The News & Observer of Raleigh reported those 13 ships are among hundreds of wrecks off the North Carolina coast.

But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the ships sunk during World War II are a pollution threat because of the oil still on the vessels.

A company hired by the Coast Guard has worked to stop the leak on one of the old tankers sunk by a German submarine in 1942.

But Lee Sykes with Atlantic Coast Marine Group says the work was probably just a temporary fix. Sykes says the hull is rusting and officials must decide whether to patch the holes or pump the oil out.
