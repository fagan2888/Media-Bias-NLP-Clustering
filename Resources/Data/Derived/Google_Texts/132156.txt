The America’s Cup is the world’s greatest nautical challenge, and San Francisco last year played host to the most spectacular America’s Cup ever. Against the backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island, defending champion Oracle Team USA rallied from a 8-1 deficit against Emirates Team New Zealand to win the first-to-nine-wins series.

Now it appears that the race is looking for a new host city.

The defending champion gets to choose the location for the next race, and Team Oracle, which is owned by billionaire Larry Ellison, said it’s favoring Bermuda, Chicago or San Diego.

In a letter to San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee Tuesday, Russell Coutts, who runs the Oracle sailing team for Ellison, said he had taken the city off the shortlist of candidates. He referred to a meeting with the mayor last week, but gave no explanation about why he made the decision.

Oracle officials and city leaders have been tussling over the terms of the next America’s Cup, scheduled for 2017, after San Francisco said the 2013 event cost the city government $11.5 million. Since the event ended in September, Lee said he wanted the city to spend none of its own money if it were to host the Cup again, and that he wanted Cup officials to pay rent for using piers that the city gave them for free last year.

Through a spokeswoman, Lee said he was “proud of San Francisco’s success in hosting this international sporting event” and that “I wish Larry Ellison, Oracle Team USA, and the America’s Cup Event Authority the best in selecting a host city for the 35th America’s Cup.”

Does this really mean San Francisco, with its dramatic landscape and reliable winds, is out of the running? Besides sailing, the America’s Cup has a rich tradition of gamesmanship. Coutts has insisted that his tough stance on San Francisco is not a negotiation tactic. If he is bluffing, San Francisco has called.
