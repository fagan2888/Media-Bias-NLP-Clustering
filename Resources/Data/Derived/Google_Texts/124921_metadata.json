They will increase the cost of energy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will destroy industries.\u201d\n\nInside an agricultural equipment shop, Fiorina spoke to a crowd of around 250 people on the future of rural America.\n\n.@CarlyFiorina meeting with people in Iowa; she\u2019s in rural America this evening #iacaucus pic.twitter.com/iNm5l458IK \u2014 Leah Jessen (@_LeahKay_) August 13, 2015\n\nShe says as the EPA controls more of the water in the United States, agriculture is being destroyed. By the end of August the EPA will control 95% of the water in Iowa, she said.\n\nFiorina believes the EPA is standing in the way of affordable and reliable electricity.\n\n\u201cThe EPA thinks that a fish is more important than tens of thousands of jobs.\u201d\n\nThrough innovation, technology, and using resources already present, she feels the United States can become the \u201cglobal energy powerhouse of the 21st century.\u201d\n\nTo combat any \u201cfestering\u201d problems, she said the economy will grow if regulations and power are lifted from the government.\n\nTo help get the economy of the country on track, Fiorina reiterated two ways to get debt and deficit under control: grow the economy and cut spending.\n\n\u201cTwo sides of the same coin if they\u2019re done properly.\u201d\n\nFiorina feels economy growth is being prevented by government spending. She is in favor of a zero-based budget, a \u201crevenue-reducing tax reform,\u201d and would like tax codes simplified.\n\n\u201cWe have to cut government size so it becomes competent again,\u201d @CarlyFiorina #iacaucus #Carly2016 pic.twitter.com/HJQrXkFvGH \u2014 Leah Jessen (@_LeahKay_) August 13, 2015\n\n\u201cWe need a government that\u2019s smaller. We need a government that\u2019s more responsive. We need a government that\u2019s not crushing the potential of this nation. But we also need a government that is competent, not inept.\u201d\n\nOther issues discussed at the town hall include religious liberty and protecting life.\n\nPro-life Fiorina was asked by a local mother of five children about her stance on vaccinating kids.\n\n\u201cWhen in doubt, it is always the parent\u2019s choice,\u201d Fiorina said.\n\nAs for Planned Parenthood, Fiorina would like to see the organization defunded.\n\n\u201cIt [the releasing of videos by the Center for Medical Progress] is an opportunity to have a different conversation in this nation about the sanctity of life.\u201d\n\n.@CarlyFiorina says Planned Parenthood needs to be defunded #iacaucus #Carly2016 pic.twitter.com/aNJeNJCGd8 \u2014 Leah Jessen (@_LeahKay_) August 13, 2015\n\nNot only protecting life at conception, Fiorina said she will stand up for those that \u201cserve and protect\u201d citizens; whether that be those in a battlefield abroad or through law enforcement officials at home.\n\nOn criminal justice, Fiorina said she favors reform \u201cbecause the rules the police are asked to enforce have become a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have the highest incarceration rates in the world. About two-thirds of the people who are in jail today are there for nonviolent offenses. Most of them are drug related offenses.\u201d\n\nFiorina said she lost a daughter \u201cto the demons of addiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand how addiction impacts so many families, but we can\u2019t have a system where we are incarcerating so many people and not helping anybody. That costs money too.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolicies work better to lift people up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Environmental Protection Agency needs to \u201croll back\u201d regulations, said former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina Thursday evening at a town hall.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency needs to \u201croll back\u201d regulations, said former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina Thursday evening at a town hall.", "title": "Carly Fiorina: EPA Regulations \u2018Will Destroy Livelihoods\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150814_FiorinaIA_Jessen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JhbCIi"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency needs to \u201croll back\u201d regulations, said former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina Thursday evening at a town hall.", "title": "Carly Fiorina: EPA Regulations \u2018Will Destroy Livelihoods\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150814_FiorinaIA_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-08-15T19:39:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Carly Fiorina, EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, Iowa, religious liberty, Planned Parenthood"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b38\"", "article_summary": "ALDEN, Iowa\u2014The Environmental Protection Agency needs to \u201croll back\u201d regulations, said former Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Officer Carly Fiorina Thursday evening at a town hall meeting a few miles outside of the \u201cbest town by a dam site.\u201d\u201cThe regulations that the EPA is rolling out now will destroy livelihoods.\n\u201cThey will destroy industries.\u201dInside an agricultural equipment shop, Fiorina spoke to a crowd of around 250 people on the future of rural America.\nFiorina believes the EPA is standing in the way of affordable and reliable electricity.\nBy the end of August the EPA will control 95% of the water in Iowa, she said.\n@CarlyFiorina meeting with people in Iowa; she\u2019s in rural America this evening #iacaucus pic.twitter.com/iNm5l458IK \u2014 Leah Jessen (@_LeahKay_) August 13, 2015She says as the EPA controls more of the water in the United States, agriculture is being destroyed."}
