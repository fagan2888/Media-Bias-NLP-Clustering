(tried) the young man before we knew all the details... They set the tone, they climbed a tall tree and now they don't know how to get down, so they have to try him and make a symbol of him,\" said demonstrator Eli Hubara.\n\nThe incident in Hebron, a city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that has been a hotbed of six months of Palestinian street violence, tapped into international controversy over whether Israeli security forces' response has been heavy-handed.\n\nDefence lawyers say Azaria took action because he feared the Palestinian had a hidden bomb. Prosecutors, citing testimony from Azaria's comrades and his apparently calm disposition, contend that it was an illegal shooting motivated by revenge.\n\nAzaria was initially held on a murder warrant but the lighter manslaughter charge, reflecting a view that the killing was not premeditated, could spell a jail term of up to 20 years.\n\nAn opinion poll last month found 57 percent of Israelis felt Azaria should never been arrested. Almost 60,000 people have signed an online petition demanding he be decorated for heroism.\n\nThe outcry over the incident has exposed rare rifts over the role and ethics of Israel's conscript military, long a symbol of unity among the majority Jews where deep concern for security is largely shared across the social and political spectrum.\n\nOver the past six months, Palestinians have killed 28 Israelis and two U.S. citizens in knife, car-ramming and gun assaults. In recent weeks, these have slowed from near-daily occurrences to more sporadic incidents.\n\nIsraeli forces have killed at least 191 Palestinians, 130 of whom Israel says were assailants. Many others were shot dead during clashes and protests since October.\n\n(Writing by Ori Lewis; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Thousands of Israelis rallied in a central Tel Aviv square on Tue", "title": "Thousands rally to call for release of Israeli soldier who shot Palestinian assailant", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Thousands-rally-call-release-Israeli-soldier-who-shot-Palestinian-assailant", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/israel-palestinians-soldier_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Thousands-rally-call-release-Israeli-soldier-who-shot-Palestinian-assailant", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/israel-palestinians-soldier_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Thousands of Israelis rallied in a central Tel Aviv square on Tue", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Thousands of Israelis rallied in a central Tel Aviv square on Tuesday calling for the release of a soldier charged with manslaughter for shooting dead a wounded Palestinian assailant.\nThe incident in Hebron, a city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that has been a hotbed of six months of Palestinian street violence, tapped into international controversy over whether Israeli security forces' response has been heavy-handed.\nAn opinion poll last month found 57 percent of Israelis felt Azaria should never been arrested.\nDefence lawyers say Azaria took action because he feared the Palestinian had a hidden bomb.\nOver the past six months, Palestinians have killed 28 Israelis and two U.S. citizens in knife, car-ramming and gun assaults."}
