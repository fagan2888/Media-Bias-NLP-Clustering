They say they were totally unfamiliar with Workforce Boulder County before they started the project.\n\n\"It was kind of like, 'This is what Workforce does, we want a platform for youth,'\" said Finnegan.\n\n\"It was actually pretty vague, which is why we signed on,\" added Jury.\n\nThe idea for the site goes back almost two years, according to Jane Banz, work force manager for Workforce Boulder County.\n\n\"It started with (executive director) Tom (Miller) talking about what young people do today,\" said Ganz. \"From that, we tried to brainstorm, 'How could we get in touch with these kids?'\"\n\nWorkforce posted an advertisement for an internship and through it, got connected with the University of Colorado-Boulder's Alliance for Technology, Learning and Society \u2014 or ATLAS \u2014 program. Grad student Rachel Strobel, a participant in the program, was tapped as project coordinator.\n\nThrough Skyline STEM teacher Richard Gunther they found the students to build the website.\n\n\"This was a group that I knew and I always wanted them to pilot things like this,\" he said.\n\n\"They came into the project the second semester their junior year,\" said Strobel. \"So I've worked with them for a year and a half.\"\n\nInitially the students thought about creating an app but then decided against it.\n\n\"Eventually we came to the idea of a website because we were focused on underprivileged youth, and we thought they might not have the money to have a smart phone,\" said Jury.\n\n\"Plus we wanted to put a lot of content on there,\" added Finnegan.\n\n\"Jump Into Jobs\" website http://jumpintojobs.wfbc.org/\n\nThe four started with developing basic themes for the website, such as color schemes, and then began adding content.\n\nMost, but not all, of the content was taken from Workforce Boulder County's site, Lamp said, but they tried to reword it to speak to a younger audience.\n\nFor example, there's this tip on what to do before a job interview:\n\n\"Get moral support. The day or night before, hang out with a positive pal, who will keep your mind off of the interview and your nerves, and give you the upbeat and helpful support you need. No Negative Nancys need to be adding to your stress or nervousness.\n\n\"The day of the interview, put away your notes and take a quiet moment just to breathe and relax yourself. Picture you walking into the interview and nailing it perfectly. Be confident in you and your abilities. You are going to rock this! Don't stress!\"\n\nThey also inserted \"quizlets\" after much of the instructional material so the reader can test their own comprehension. Jury pushed for tying the site to social media outlets such as Pinterest and YouTube.\n\n\"I have so many friends that come up to me and say, 'I have a job interview. What shall I wear?'\" Jury said. Now, she said, she can simply direct people to the Workforce Boulder County Pinterest page, where they'll find a board called \"What Should I Wear?!\", containing photos of appropriate interview attire.\n\nNow that the four seniors are set to graduate it will be up to a new batch of students to take over working on the website this fall. Gunther said it's been interesting to watch the outgoing seniors interviewing students aspiring to take over next year.\n\n\"The next wave of kids will have different skill sets,\" said Strobel, who will also be moving on.\n\nAdded Ganz, \"The second part of this project is we want to have our youth case manager work with the new group at Skyline to produce interactive content.\"\n\nThe four graduating students, who say they've been working together since they were freshman, feel like they've left a solid foundation for the next group of students to build upon.\n\n\"This isn't our first website but it's our best website,\" Finnegan said.\n\nGanz said that ultimately, she would like to see Jump Into Jobs website become a tool useful to youths all over the state.\n\n\"In the future we would be looking at coordinating with other Workforce regions, so they could have their own project or contribute to our project,\" she said.\n\nContact Times-Call staff writer Tony Kindelspire at 303-684-5291 or tkindelspire@times-call.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/business/local-business/ci_25781863/workforce-boulder-county-taps-skyline-kids-design-website", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0516/20140516__18TCCJUM~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Tony Kindelspire \n \n  Times-Call staff writer", "description": "Workforce Boulder County has commissioned a website geared toward young people that it hopes will become a template for other Workforce centers around the state to use.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:25781863:view"}, "startDate": "2014-05-18T11:22:01-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/business/local-business/ci_25781863/workforce-boulder-county-taps-skyline-kids-design-website", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0516/20140516__18TCCJUM~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Workforce Boulder County has commissioned a website geared toward young people that it hopes will become a template for other Workforce centers around the state to use.", "title": "Workforce Boulder County taps Skyline kids to design website 'from youth, for youth'"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Workforce Boulder County has commissioned a website geared toward young people that it hopes will become a template for other Workforce centers around the state to use.", "title": "Workforce Boulder County taps Skyline kids to design website 'from youth, for youth'", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/business/local-business/ci_25781863/workforce-boulder-county-taps-skyline-kids-design-website", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0516/20140516__18TCCJUM~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-05-18T11:22:01-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Workforce Boulder County taps Skyline kids to design website 'from youth, for youth'", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0516/20140516__18TCCJUM~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local Business", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2014-05-19T13:17:22-0600", "endDate": "2024-05-18T11:22:01-0600", "byline": "By Tony KindelspireTimes-Call", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-05-18T11:28:40-0600", "news_keywords": "longmont colorado business news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21e0\"", "article_summary": "The idea for the site goes back almost two years, according to Jane Banz, work force manager for Workforce Boulder County.\nNow, she said, she can simply direct people to the Workforce Boulder County Pinterest page, where they'll find a board called \"What Should I Wear?!\nThey say they were totally unfamiliar with Workforce Boulder County before they started the project.\n( Lewis Geyer / Longmont Times-Call )Workforce Boulder County has commissioned a website geared toward young people that it hopes will become a template for other Workforce centers around the state to use.\nMost, but not all, of the content was taken from Workforce Boulder County's site, Lamp said, but they tried to reword it to speak to a younger audience."}
