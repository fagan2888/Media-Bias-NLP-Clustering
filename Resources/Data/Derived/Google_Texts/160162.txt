Funk Flex needs to drop a bomb on this. Sheek Louch is gearing up to drop the sequel to 2008's underrated project, Silverback Gorilla on Dec. 4 via his new home Tommy Boy Entertainment. Silverback Gorilla 2 has a bunch of features with the most notable being Billy Danze, Joell Ortiz, Swizz Beatz, Pusha T, Jadakiss, A$AP Ferg, Styles P, Ghostface, and Fabolous. The album is currently available for pre-order on iTunes here.

The project's first single, "What's On Your Mind," features two generations of NYC rap in Yung Fergenstein and Kiss. The track's producer Jimmy Dukes uses a very choice Timbaland sample from Ginuwine's "Keep It Real" and all three rappers come through with impressive verses. Don't sleep on Donnie G.
