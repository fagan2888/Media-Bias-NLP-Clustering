From Essence

Halle Berry wears many hats—movie star, mother, Oscar winner—but now we can add producer to the list. While many would have given up on a project that took years to see the light of day, Berry fought for more than five years to ensure her latest film, Frankie & Alice, made it theaters.

The film, which the actress produced and is based on a true story, finds Berry playing a woman who battles dissociative identity disorder and who must work through her inner demons to live a normal life. ESSENCE.com caught up with Berry to discuss the film and why she just had to tell this story.

ESSENCE.com: This project has been a labor of love for you and has been years in the making. What does it feel like to finally see it make it to the screen?

HALLE BERRY: It’s like birthing a baby that you’ve carried for five years and it feels really good. It’s something I care deeply about and I worked really hard on it. It’s the first film I ever produced, so for all those reasons it’s truly a passion. And now that it’s not going to sit on a shelf, it’s going to see the light of day? I’m over the moon.

What made you want to fight so hard to get this story out there?

For this woman to have survived this, and not just survived it, but she is now teaching at one of the most reputable universities in the country—she’s revered. She has found a way to live with this disorder, and not only live, but thrive. I thought it was a great testament to her character, to overcoming mental illness, and at the end of the day, it was inspiring and I wanted to be apart of bringing a story like this to the screen.
