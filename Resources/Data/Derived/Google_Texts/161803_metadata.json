Cummings was nearly unstoppable on draws, as Maryland controlled seven of them after halftime, with Cummings tracking down four herself.\n\n\u201cThe draw is such a mind game,\u201d said Cummings, the tournament\u2019s most outstanding player. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of push and pull and figuring each other out. In the second half we made it Maryland ball. The only way we were going to be able to come back was if we had the ball. All year long we said, \u2018It\u2019s four seconds of focus.\u2019 We did that and that\u2019s what got us back in the game.\u201d\n\nCummings finished with five points. She set up Brooke Griffin for a goal to cut the Tar Heels\u2019 lead to 6-5 at the 7:24 mark of the second half and scored the tying goal on pretty pass from Whittle a few minutes later.\n\nWith Cummings dominating in the faceoff circle, Whittle put the Terrapins ahead for good with consecutive goals.\n\n\u201cMegan Whittle is a great player,\u201d Maryland coach Cathy Reese said. \u201cShe\u2019s a great scorer and a great dodger. But for her to come in on an offense where I was returning three first team All-Americans was a tough spot to be in. But, she did everything we asked, she learned a lot on how to be a part of a team offense. She\u2019s going to be a fun player to watch over the course of her career.\u201d\n\nAfter Maria McCool scored her second goal of the game for North Carolina (18-4) to cut Maryland\u2019s lead back to one, Cummings finished off her hat trick.\n\nMaryland avenged a double-overtime loss to North Carolina in the 2013 title game.\n\nNorth Carolina pulled within a goal with a little more than three minutes remaining when Maggie Bill scored her third goal of the game, but the next draw never took place as possession was awarded to Maryland after North Carolina tried to make a late substitution. Despite efforts by Tar Heels coach Jenny Levy to call timeout, the officials instead awarded Maryland possession.\n\n\u201cWe made too many mental errors in the second half,\u201d Bill said. \u201cAgainst a team like Maryland you can\u2019t do that and expect to recover from it.\u201d\n\nIncluded in the mix was junior goalie Megan Ward, who started the second half in place of all-tournament goalie Caylee Waters, a move often employed by Tar Heels coach Jenny Levy.\n\nWard made a couple of possession mistakes herself, once losing the ball out of bounds behind the net and another losing possession as she was lunging to get back to the goalie\u2019s circle.\n\nBoth mistakes turned into Maryland goals. And Levy lifted Ward after 13 minutes and put Waters back in the game, but the damage was already done.\n\n\u201cIt was actually the clearing,\u201d Levy said. \u201cCaylee tends to clear a little bit better and is a little bit bigger. I felt Meg was fine in the cage and then she started worrying about the clearing game and that started to get into her saving game, so we went back to Caylee.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina dominated the first half.\n\nThe Tar Heels scored the first two goals rather quickly, with Bill notching the opening goal just 15 seconds into the match, scoring a free-position goal on the game\u2019s first shot.\n\nTwo possessions later, Sam McGee sneaked out from behind the net and took a pass from Bill and deposited it into the net.\n\nMaryland recovered to score three consecutive goals to take the lead.\n\nWhittle and Cummings drew the Terrapins even and Erin Collins took a pass from Cummings and snapped it past goalie Caylee Waters to make it 3-2.\n\nWaters thwarted two free-position shots from the Terrapins, stopping both Zoe Stukenberg and Collins from in close. But perhaps the biggest missed opportunity from Maryland came on a failed attempt during a breakaway with Waters caught in the midfield after advancing the ball and losing it out of bounds. However, a pass from Griffin to Cummings was just out of reach, allowing the Tar Heels to dodge a major chance.\n\nBill tied it and Aly Messinger put the Heels ahead with a free-position marker.\n\nMarie McCool took a pass from Bill, ducked a check and scored over the top of Maryland goalie Alex Fitzpatrick to make it 5-3 before Sydney Holman scored on a frantic final play of the half with 3.4 seconds to go to give North Carolina a three-goal lead at intermission.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taylor Cummings and Megan Whittle combined for four of the Terrapins' six second-half goals and helped Maryland win back-to-back women's lacrosse national championships by defeating North Carolina, 9-8.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Taylor Cummings and Megan Whittle combined for four of the Terrapins\u2019 six second-half goals and helped Maryland win back-to-back women\u2019s lacrosse national championships by defeating North Carolina, 9-8.", "title": "Maryland rallies in second half, takes second consecutive NCAA championship", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/25/maryland-rallies-second-half-takes-second-consecut/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/10646c8656867317770f6a706700c182.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/10646c8656867317770f6a706700c182.jpg", "description": "Taylor Cummings and Megan Whittle combined for four of the Terrapins' six second-half goals and helped Maryland win back-to-back women's lacrosse national championships by defeating North Carolina, 9-", "card": "summary", "title": "Maryland rallies in second half, takes second consecutive NCAA champio"}, "Author": "Anthony Sanfilippo", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Taylor Cummings, Megan Whittle, Brooke Griffin, Maggie Bill"}, "article_summary": "However, a pass from Griffin to Cummings was just out of reach, allowing the Tar Heels to dodge a major chance.\nDespite efforts by Tar Heels coach Jenny Levy to call timeout, the officials instead awarded Maryland possession.\nCummings was nearly unstoppable on draws, as Maryland controlled seven of them after halftime, with Cummings tracking down four herself.\nIn the second half we made it Maryland ball.\nThe Tar Heels scored the first two goals rather quickly, with Bill notching the opening goal just 15 seconds into the match, scoring a free-position goal on the game\u2019s first shot."}
