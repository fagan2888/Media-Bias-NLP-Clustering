Clinton backs Obama on Iran\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made clear she supports President Barack Obama\u2019s call to allow the current negotiations over ending Iran\u2019s nuclear development and that new sanctions being debated by Congress should be shelved while those talks take place, according to a late-January letter she wrote obtained by POLITICO.\n\nClinton made her views clear in a Jan. 26 missive sent to her former Senate colleague, Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan. It\u2019s the first time that Clinton\u2019s perspective on the current discussions have been laid out in detail.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLevin wrote to Clinton 10 days earlier, asking for her guidance as former Secretary of State on what effect new sanctions would have on the efforts to reach a comprehensive deal with Tehran.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Iran: We're serious about nukes talks)\n\n\u201cI share the opinion of you and many of your colleagues that these sanctions and the carefully constructed global consensus behind them are responsible for driving Tehran to the negotiating table. It was because sactions worked that we are starting implementation of the Joint Plan of Action, an important step \u2013 though still only a first step \u2013 toward a comprehensive solution,\u201d Clinton wrote in the letter.\n\n\u201cNow that serious negotiations are finally under way, we should do everything we can to test whether they can advance a permanent solution. As President Obama said, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed, while keeping all options on the table,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe U.S. intelligence community has assessed that imposing new unilateral sanctions now \u2018would undermine the prospects for a successful comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran.\u2019 I share that view. It could rob us of the diplomatic high ground we worked so hard to reach, break the united international front we constructed, and in the long run, weaken pressure on Iran by opening the door for other countries to chart a different course.\u201d\n\nClinton continued, \u201cIf the world judges \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 that negotiations have collapsed because of actions in the United States Congress, even some of our closest partners abroad \u2013 to say nothing of countries like Russia and China \u2013 may well falter in their commitment.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama vows Iran sanction veto)\n\n\u201cLike President Obama, I have no illusions about the ease or likelihood of turning the Joint Plan of Action into a permanent solution.\u201d\n\nShe outlined other lingering concerns about Iranian officials\u2019 behavior toward their own citizens, as well as to other nations.\n\n\u201cSo long as Iran remains a sponsor of terrorism and a threat to global security, we will have to remain vigilant in defense of our allies and partners, including Israel,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYet I have no doubt that this is the time to give our diplomacy the space to work. If it does not, there will be time to put in place additional sanctions in the future, with greater international support necessary to ensure enforcement, and to explore every other option on the table.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: State of the Union 2014 fact check)\n\nAides to Levin and Clinton did not respond to emails for comment.\n\nObama made clear in his State of the Union address last week \u2013 delivered after the Clinton\u2019s letter was sent \u2013 that he will veto any legislation calling for fresh sanctions against Iran if such a bill is passed by Congress. In the past, his aides have described such a move as an effort toward war-footing by some elected officials, at a time when his administration and current Secretary of State John Kerry are hoping that negotiations with Iran\u2019s new regime will produce something substantial. Levin noted his own opposition to fresh sanctions in his letter to Clinton.\n\n\u201cI come to the current debate as a longtime advocate for crippling sanctions against Iran,\u201d Clinton wrote to Levin, noting her own historic hawkishness on the topic. \u201cIn my eight years in the Senate, I supported every Iran sanctions bill that came up for a vote and I spoke out frequently about the need to confront the threat posed by Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, its support for terrorism, and its hostility toward Israel. As Secretary of State, I spent four years sharpening a choice for Iran\u2019s leaders: address the international community\u2019s legitimate concerns about their nuclear program or face ever-escalating pressure and isolation. With support from Congress and our allies, our diplomacy yielded the toughest international sanctions ever imposed.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Coons: 'Not the time' for Iran bill)\n\nClinton expressed similar views on the current debate, which saw a breakthrough late last year, at a speech that was closed to the media at the Saban Forum last December.\n\n\u201cWe can always put on sanctions,\u201d she said, according to a transcript. \u201cI mean that is no heavy lift for the United States Congress, believe me. So why do it now before we can really test? \u2026 And then we\u2019re isolated again, and we\u2019re back to where we basically were in 2008, without an international coalition and consensus that has, I believe, brought Iran at least to the point of our being able to explore whether there is a decent deal there.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s former State Department adviser Jake Sullivan, currently working for Vice President Joe Biden, was quietly dispatched while he was still working for the secretary to Oman in 2011 for early talks toward a nuclear agreement.\n\nIn a statement from Levin emailed by an aide, the senator said: \u201cThis is a thoughtful, persuasive argument from an experienced, respected senior official. It makes clear Secretary Clinton\u2019s belief that tough sanctions helped bring Iran to the negotiating table, and that Congress and the administration are poised to act if Iran violates its commitments or fails to negotiate in good faith toward a final agreement. Her letter is another strong signal to Congress that we should not take any legislative action at this time that would damage international unity or play into the hands of hard-liners in Iran who oppose negotiations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "She supports allowing the negotiations to play out.", "title": "Clinton backs Obama on Iran", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/hillary-clinton-iran-102997.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/31/131031_hillary_clinton_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Nuclear Proliferation,Hillary Clinton,Iran,Carl Levin,Sanctions", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "She supports allowing the negotiations to play out.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d4f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI come to the current debate as a longtime advocate for crippling sanctions against Iran,\u201d Clinton wrote to Levin, noting her own historic hawkishness on the topic.\nIt was because sactions worked that we are starting implementation of the Joint Plan of Action, an important step \u2013 though still only a first step \u2013 toward a comprehensive solution,\u201d Clinton wrote in the letter.\nClinton made her views clear in a Jan. 26 missive sent to her former Senate colleague, Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan.\nAs President Obama said, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed, while keeping all options on the table,\u201d she wrote.\nClinton made her views clear in a Jan. 26 missive sent to her former Senate colleague."}
