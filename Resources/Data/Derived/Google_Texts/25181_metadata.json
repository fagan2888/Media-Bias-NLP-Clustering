However, the pharmaceutical industry has other intentions for mothers-to-be.\n\nThe powerful and profit-driven motives of the giant industry has raked in billions of dollars pushing dangerous drugs on pregnant women, taking full advantage of the common occurrence of depression during pregnancy.\n\nAmy Philo J.D. tells her experience on her website, www.uniteforlife.org. After her baby was born, her doctor gave her Zoloft for postpartum depression. She breast-fed her baby and he became very lethargic and sedated. If she didn\u2019t eventually feed him formula instead, he would have died. Not that formula is necessarily very good for a baby but it\u2019s certainly miles ahead of a psychiatric drug.\n\nIn a study done by Kimberly Yonkers, professor of psychiatry and obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, it was determined that antidepressants cause birth defects, not depression. In women who were depressed but not on these drugs, there were no or very little birth defects.\n\nShe says, \u201cHowever, the good news is, for discerning moms, the information is available, if you can sort through all of the conflicting , confusing contradictions from doctors who are just flat-out in denial when it comes to drugging pregnant mothers.\u201d\n\nWhen taking these SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), brand-named Prozac, Paxil, etc, in their third trimester, babies were more likely to have seizures after they were born and if the mother took three or more prescriptions during the third trimester, that figure jumps to five times the chances.\n\nEven the FDA has updated their labels on psychiatric drugs to include the warnings that they may cause abnormal muscle movements and withdrawal symptoms in infants.\n\nThe Citizens Commission on Human Rights has listed several studies that were done in various countries on the effects of these drugs on pregnant women.\n\nOne done Jan 12, 2012, In The British Medical Journal, it said drugs taken late in pregnancy, caused persistent pulmonary hypertension.\n\nOn July 1, 2011, in the journal, Obstetrics and Gynecology a Finnish study was done on babies exposed to Prozac and Paxil. It was shown, they were born smaller and had a definite risk of heart defects.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, a study on May 1, 2010 showed babies were born prematurely and had an eight times higher chance of birth defects.\n\nIn Canada on April 26th, 2010, studies showed an association between maternal bupropion (an antidepressant) and heart defects in the newborn.\n\nIn Sweden, written in \u201cPsychological Medicine,\u201d pregnancy complications were evident. Paxil caused heart and urinary tube defects.\n\nIn the U.S, in \u201cCurrent Drug Delivery\u201d, it says there is a greater risk of spontaneous abortion, especially with Paxil and Effexor.\n\nIn Canada on Sept 1, 2009, in \u201cCurrent Drug Safety\u201d, it says if these drugs are taken when the fetus\u2019 organs are forming, there is a greater risk of heart malfunction.\n\nIn Drugs.com, it tells of a study which shows when mothers take antidepressants, there is a higher chance the infant ends up in intensive care, suffering from \u201c\u2026seizures, jitteriness, infections, respiratory problems and jaundice\u2026\u201d\n\nSSRIs do cross over from the placenta and appear in the umbilical cord.\n\nThe Mother\u2019s Act was not passed in 2009, even after a very heavy campaign. What it involves is mandatory mental screening for every pregnant woman with the inevitable result of drugging most of them.\n\nHowever, it is now, unfortunately, part of the Affordable Healthcare Act (Obamacare) in its original mandatory form \u2013 a very good reason to repeal it.\n\nDr. Mercola, holistic medical doctor, has many good solutions for prenatal and postnatal depression. He says the very most important thing, which most people lack, is omega 3 fatty acids but many people eat too much omega 5 fatty acids which are not good for the body.\n\nNot only is this great for everyone but it is excellent for the child\u2019s nervous system development and also prevents premature delivery. Taken especially in the third trimester, it creates better brain growth and also helps greatly to prevent diabetes in the child later in life.\n\nThe best source of this valuable supplement is krill oil, he recommends, since there\u2019s so much mercury in fish. Also, fish oil supplements can go rancid but krill oil does not.\n\nThe next thing is grass-fed beef, a great source of omega 3.\n\nVitamin D is very important and sunshine is the best way to get it. If that\u2019s not real, then supplements are very good.\n\nExercise and eating organic food, especially lots of greens are fantastic for handling depression and for creating a healthy body for mom and baby.\n\nThose are some of the major and natural ways to have a happy, successful pregnancy.\n\nAntidepressants should have no part in the miracle of birth because they are not designed for life. The natural, God-given means to create a healthy baby are quite the opposite; they do not cause sickness and birth defects.\n\nWritten by Lucille Femine\n\nSource 1\n\nSource 2\n\nSource 3\n\nSource 4\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "If you are pregnant, plan to be or have anyone close to you who is, it is vital you understand the dangers of antidepressants and the harm they cause \u2013 in anyone \u2013 but tragically in the unbor\u2026", "title": "Antidepressants Cause Birth Defects", "url": "http://guardianlv.com/2013/09/antidepressants-cause-birth-defects/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/t1larg.antidepressants.pregnancy.gi_.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-23T01:08:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-23T01:08:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/t1larg.antidepressants.pregnancy.gi_.jpg?w=640", "site": "@ifrackle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd99c7\"", "article_summary": "In a study done by Kimberly Yonkers, professor of psychiatry and obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, it was determined that antidepressants cause birth defects, not depression.\nThe natural, God-given means to create a healthy baby are quite the opposite; they do not cause sickness and birth defects.\nIn women who were depressed but not on these drugs, there were no or very little birth defects.\nAntidepressants should have no part in the miracle of birth because they are not designed for life.\nIf you are pregnant, plan to be or have anyone close to you who is, it is vital you understand the dangers of antidepressants and the harm they cause \u2013 in anyone \u2013 but tragically in the unborn or newly-born child through birth defects."}
