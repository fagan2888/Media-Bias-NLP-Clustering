Senior aide to President Obama, David Axelrod, took to twitter on Saturday to defend Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry who was indicted by a grand jury Friday for abusing his budget powers.

“Unless he was demonstrably trying to scrap the ethics unit for other than his stated reason, Perry indictment seems pretty sketchy,” Mr. Axelrod tweeted.

Mr. Perry has been accused of misconduct after he publicly promised to veto $7.5 million for a District Attorney’s office unless the district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg resigned. Ms. Lehmberg had recently been convicted of drunk driving, according to the Associated Press.

Other Democrats have spoken out on Twitter to defend the rumored 2016 presidential contender.

Politico’s chief economic correspondent Ben White tweeted, “It seems quite perverse to indict a governor for exercising his clearly delineated constitutional authority.”
