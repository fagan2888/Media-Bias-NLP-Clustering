Remember President Barack Obama — the guy whose policies would surely wreak havoc on the American economy, killing jobs and prolonging the economic slump he inherited from George W. Bush? Amid stronger-than-expected economic growth and an increasingly robust labor market, that right-wing boogeyman has gone missing. Contrary to conservative claims, Obamacare and environmental regulations haven’t destroyed the economy, and with Obama’s approval ratings on the rise as economic fortunes improve, Republicans confront the possibility that come 2016, voters will decide that they’re better off than they eight years before.

But how much does Obama have to do with the economic upswing? That’s the question Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman tackles in his New York Times column today. As Krugman notes, presidents typically have little influence on the economy’s performance; business cycles fluctuate, regardless of which party holds the White House. To the extent that policy does shape the economy, it’s often monetary policy, set by the politically independent Federal Reserve, that determines the country’s economic climate. Krugman observes that the so-called Reagan boom of the 1980s was primarily the result of Fed chairman Paul Volcker’s decision to lower interest rates after years of tightened monetary policy aimed at combatting inflation.

While presidents may have less power over the economy than popularly imagined, Krugman contends that the same rule doesn’t necessarily apply when it comes to the Obama-era economy. Though it may have been too small given the scale of the Great Recession, economists overwhelmingly agree that the president’s 2009 stimulus package proved pivotal in softening the recession’s impact.
