And the cost for each additional year lived by a patient as a result of new drugs soared from $54,000 in 1995 to $207,000 in 2013.\n\nRelated: Billion Dollar Drugs: America\u2019s 10 Top Selling Medications\n\nA commentary by more than 100 cancer specialists published Thursday by the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings voiced outrage over soaring cancer drug prices and renewed a call for tough new federal regulations to rein in prices. Specific proposals include changing federal law to permit Medicare officials to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower prices and permitting the import of cheaper drugs from Canada.\n\n\u201cThere is no relief in sight because drug companies keep challenging the market with even higher prices,\u201d the oncologists wrote. \u201cThis raises the question of whether current pricing of cancer drugs is based on reasonable expectation of return on investment or whether it is based on what prices the market can bear.\u201d\n\nMajor pharmaceutical companies have argued for years that the higher drug prices reflect the substantial cost of researching and producing new wonder drugs and that more emphasis should be placed on the benefits they provide to patients. \u201cThe fact is that the type of progress we\u2019ve seen in cancer care does not come easy,\u201d Robert Zirkelbach, senior vice president of communications for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, told The Washington Post. \u201cDeveloping new treatments and cures is a very long, a very complex and a very costly process.\u201d\n\nRelated: Costly Hepatitis \u2018C\u2019 Drug Makers Face New Fire\n\nIndustry critics are not buying that argument. The cancer doctors\u2019 lament is only the latest in a growing demand by physicians, insurers, state Medicaid officials and members of Congress to do something about run-away prescription drug prices, which increased by more than 12 percent last year \u2013 the biggest annual increase in the past decade.\n\nIn the past several years, new specialized medications have substantially boosted the cost of treatments for cancer, hepatitis C, cystic fibrosis and other diseases.\n\nSovaldi and Harvoni, the new miracle drugs made by Gilead Sciences to treat the potentially deadly hepatitis C liver virus, have become the poster children of runaway drug costs: The retail cost of the drugs is between $84,000 and $94,500 for a 12-week regimen. The drugs are far ahead of other treatments and procedures in saving lives, but the math works out to be a startling $1,000 per pill for Sovaldi and $1,125 per pill for Harvoni.\n\nYet the hepatitis C treatment costs are only the tip of the iceberg. The United Auto Workers Retiree Medical Benefits Trust has loudly complained about how Gilead and other pharmaceutical companies set prices, citing the more than $300,000 per year price of Vertex Pharmaceuticals\u2019 cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco and the $150,000 annual price for Celgene\u2019s cancer drug Revlimid.\n\nOn Tuesday, Medicare\u2019s board of trustees warned that these costly, breakthrough medications will help drive a sharp increase in the program\u2019s prescription-drug spending over the next decade, raising annual growth to 9.7 percent between 2015 and 2024, from 6.5 percent in the prior eight years.\n\nRelated: The Life-Saving Drug That Almost No State Can Afford\n\nThese soaring costs are forcing the VA, Medicaid and other programs to in some cases limit or ration the availability of these drugs to the neediest patients, because of the unsustainable growth in their prescription drug budgets. Moreover, cancer patients \u201chave to make difficult choices between spending their incomes on potentially lifesaving therapies or forgoing treatment to provide for family necessities,\u201d the oncologists wrote in the journal commentary today. Consequently, about 10 percent to 20 percent of cancer patients don\u2019t take their treatment as prescribed, according to the article.\n\nAmong the recommendations made by the doctors in the Mayo journal:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Recent breakthroughs in cancer treatment come with a hefty price tag.", "title": "As Drug Prices Soar, Doctors Voice Outrage", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/23/Drug-Prices-Soar-Doctors-Voice-Outrage", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222010_Pills_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/23/Drug-Prices-Soar-Doctors-Voice-Outrage", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222010_Pills_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Recent breakthroughs in cancer treatment come with a hefty price tag.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf8b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere is no relief in sight because drug companies keep challenging the market with even higher prices,\u201d the oncologists wrote.\nRelated: Billion Dollar Drugs: America\u2019s 10 Top Selling MedicationsA commentary by more than 100 cancer specialists published Thursday by the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings voiced outrage over soaring cancer drug prices and renewed a call for tough new federal regulations to rein in prices.\nConsequently, about 10 percent to 20 percent of cancer patients don\u2019t take their treatment as prescribed, according to the article.\nRecent breakthroughs in cancer treatment come with a hefty price tag.\nSpecific proposals include changing federal law to permit Medicare officials to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower prices and permitting the import of cheaper drugs from Canada."}
