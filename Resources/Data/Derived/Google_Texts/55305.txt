Bolstered by a newly awarded federal grant, La Red Health Center will be opening an additional medical clinic in Milford.

The Sussex County-based health center was awarded a $483,333 grant Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

La Red already offers multilingual health consultation and services through clinics in Georgetown, Seaford and Sussex Technical School District. The new clinic, with its central location in Milford, will be able to help Delawareans in lower Kent County more readily receive primary and pediatric medical care, CEO Brian Olson said.

The new clinic also will work to integrate mental health care into the patient's overall care, to diagnose faster and more efficiently. Olson estimates more than 1,440 people may benefit from the services.

It's expected to be open in 120 days.

"So we have a lot to accomplish in a short period of time," Olson said.

La Red will care for people with private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, Obamacare plans and no insurance.

The new clinic's grant funding was provided through the Affordable Care Act. Nationally, approximately $101 million was awarded to 164 new health center sites in 33 states to potentially increase access to health care services for nearly 650,000 patients.

"Health centers are keystones of the communities they serve in Delaware," HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement. "Today's awards will enable more individuals and families in Delaware to have access to the affordable, quality health care that health centers provide. That includes the preventive and primary care services that will keep them healthy."
