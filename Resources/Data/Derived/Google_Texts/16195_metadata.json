That ended Dec. 1, after the Affordable Care Act made him an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse.\n\nHealth-law subsidies for workers to buy their own coverage combined with years of rising costs in the company plan made dropping the plan an obvious \u2013 though not easy \u2013 choice.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of regrets going into it,\u201d Dunn, who owns three Italian Oven restaurants in suburban Atlanta, said of his decision. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have as many now \u2014 only because I\u2019ve seen the affordability factor for my managers improve.\u201d\n\nDunn and five managers are now covered under individual plans bought on healthcare.gov. How many other owners make the same decision will help set the future of small-business health insurance. Although the evidence so far is mixed, brokers expect more firms to follow in the next few years.\n\nCompanies like Dunn\u2019s \u2014 those with fewer than 50 workers \u2014 provide medical coverage to roughly 20 million people. Unlike larger employers, they have no obligation under the health law to offer a plan. Now they often have good reason not to.\n\nIf employees qualify for government subsidies, like the managers who switched from Italian Oven\u2019s corporate insurance to individual Obamacare coverage, everybody can win.\n\nOwners don\u2019t have to pay premiums, meaning they can give workers raises, invest in equipment or add to profits instead. And employee take-home pay can rise if subsidies \u2014 available even to families with middle-class incomes \u2014 are worth more than what a company was contributing.\n\nWhether to cancel a company plan and let workers buy insurance on healthcare.gov or another online exchange \u201cis something that I would say comes up in every conversation with a small-group\u201d employer, said Adam Berkowitz, a consultant with Caravus, a benefits firm based in St. Louis.\n\n\u201cI just had another [small] business call in today and say, \u2018You know, we can\u2019t do it. We\u2019re packing it in,\u2019\u201d said Roger Howell, head of Howell Benefit Services in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.\n\nAnthem, the largest seller of small-business health insurance, lost almost 300,000 members in such plans \u2014 many more than expected \u2014 in the first nine months of the year. That was 15 percent of the enrollment. Many of those consumers are presumably switching to individual plans sold through exchanges, including those offered by Anthem, officials said.\n\nIt\u2019s far from clear, however, that most companies will take the same steps as Italian Oven.\n\nMany small employers see health coverage as an essential piece of compensation. They note that premiums in company-sponsored plans are tax-deductible \u2014 for workers as well as employers \u2014 while the tax advantages of individual plans are limited.\n\n\u201cI feel like we have to have a medical plan in order to hire people and keep them employed,\u201d said Dan Allen, head of a 15-worker engineering firm in Decatur, Ill. Allen Engineering renewed its Coventry Health Care plan for 2015 even though the premiums rose 21 percent, he said.\n\nNo other major insurer has reported cancellation of small-business plans at the same rate as Anthem.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see that,\u201d said Rick Allegretti, vice president of marketing at Health Care Service Corp., operator of Blue Cross plans in five states including Illinois and Texas. \u201cWe actually saw our [small-group] business grow slightly \u2014 mind you it\u2019s probably a tenth of a percent.\u201d\n\nBusinesses shifting workers into the individual exchanges tend to be the very smallest, employing a handful of people, said Skip Woody, a partner at Hill, Chesson & Woody, a North Carolina benefits firm. \u201cAnything above 15, we haven\u2019t had any dropping coverage,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead, many small companies are taking advantage of rules letting them maintain insurance bought before the health law took effect. President Barack Obama, who promised consumers they could keep coverage they liked, allowed carriers to extend noncompliant plans after facing fierce criticism over their imminent extinction.\n\nMost, but not all, states approved the adjustment. Because older policies may lack features required by the health law and because their rates are often set according to employee health history, not community-wide costs, they can be less expensive than compliant plans, say brokers and consultants.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t sold one of the new plans yet\u201d to a small employer, said John Jaggi, an Illinois broker and consultant. Faced with price increases of as much as a third or more for new plans, all 40 or so of his small-business clients including Allen Engineering renewed older coverage for 2015, he said.\n\nHeavy renewal of old plans plus workers shifting to individual coverage help explain why the health law\u2019s online portal for new small-business plans has attracted only modest interest, analysts say.\n\nFor some companies there is logic to ending coverage altogether.\n\nFor Italian Oven\u2019s Dunn, \u201cit made sense to recommend that he drop coverage,\u201d said Elena Merino, CEO of the Meridian Group, a benefits firm in Alpharetta, Ga. \u201cIt hurts me. But that was the responsible thing to tell him.\u201d\n\nItalian Oven employs the equivalent of about 30 people \u2014 less than the 50-worker threshold that would get it fined for not sponsoring insurance. The company does not offer coverage to servers and kitchen staff, but full-time managers have always had a plan.\n\nAll are eligible for tax credits to buy insurance on healthcare.gov, said Dunn. Next year, the subsidies are available for individuals with income of up to $46,680 and families of four with income of up to $95,400.\n\nWith subsidies factored in along with unrelated pay increases, the managers \u201care going to be saving money out of the deal\u201d while getting coverage comparable to what they had before, Dunn said. \u201cMy managers actually got excited about it because they\u2019re saving money on their health insurance.\u201d\n\nBrokers expect more small businesses to make the same move, especially after the ability to extend older, noncompliant plans expires between now and the end of 2017, depending on state policy. Allen, the engineering firm executive, is concerned premiums could rise even higher next year than they did for the 2015 renewal.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s up in the 25- to 30-percent increase [range] \u2014 I\u2019ve heard as high as 40 \u2014 we\u2019ll just have to drop it,\u201d he said. \u201cTurn everybody loose.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "For two decades Atlanta restaurant owner Jim Dunn offered a group health plan to his managers and helped pay for it.
