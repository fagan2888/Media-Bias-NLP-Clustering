And the insurance should have been offered by the county last year because the nurses already work 30 hours a week, school officials said Monday.\n\nThe Board of Education voted 5-0 with two absent to submit an amended 2015-16 school budget request that deleted $394,070 from the proposed budget the board approved June 1. That still leaves the budget seeking $2,153,963 in county funding, which \u2014 adjusted for required funding to be shared with city school systems \u2014 would add about 13 cents to the countywide property tax rate.\n\nHowever, the new proposal includes about $85,000 to cover the estimated cost of providing health insurance for the nurses, although no retirement or life insurance is provided to such part-time employees.\n\nThe new proposal would decrease the estimated property tax increase needed to fund the school budget from about 15 cents per $100 of assessed value, Business Manager Leslie Bonner said after a called BOE meeting Monday.\n\nThe change was approved on a motion by Randall Jones, seconded by Jerry Greene. Member Todd Broughton, Vice Chairman Jack Bales, Michael Hughes, Greene and Jones vote for it; Chairman Dan Wells and member Betty Combs were absent.\n\n\u201cA lot of them (nurses) stay later off the clock to get things done,\u201d Hughes said, while Interim Director of Schools-elect Evelyn Rafalowski said that probably goes for other employees, too.\n\nRafalowski said she was comfortable with the recommendation and that school officials since June 1 have determined that if nurses ever do go full-time, it might be better for them to remain Sullivan County Regional Department of Health employees rather than becoming school system employees.\n\nInitially, the nurses were to become school system employees, which would save money because the county\u2019s self-insured health insurance plan is more expensive than the one the school system uses from Tennessee.\n\nHowever, she said other factors down the road might make keeping them health department employees worth considering.\n\nSince current nurses are contracted workers, the county system does not have to share money spent on them with the Kingsport and Bristol school systems.\n\nRafalowski said county school nurses in 2014-15 were paid slightly more to offset the lack of health insurance, and Business Manager Leslie Bonner said the county was responsible for offering health insurance under the ACA, also known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt was up to the county to offer it to them,\u201d Bonner said.\n\nThe budget change was in response to a recent Budget Committee request for a \u201cdo-over\u201d or review of the school budget by the BOE.\n\nAs for that committee\u2019s questions about school nurses, Rafalowski said three or four of the 22 school nurses are licensed practical nurses, or LPNs and the rest are registered nurses, or RNs. LPNs work in school with an RN nearby, she said, such as the elementary portion of Sullivan Gardens K-8, North Middle inside North High, Blountville Elementary next to Blountville Middle and Weaver Elementary near East High.\n\nShe said Kingsport City Schools uses all RNs, while Bristol, Tenn., schools use all LPNs at individual schools with an RN available to float among schools for things an LPN cannot do. She said Bristol is more compact and has fewer schools than the county.\n\nThings an RN can do but a LPN alone cannot include sign off on individual health care plans, do IEP or individualized education plan meetings, train in use of EpiPens or glucose monitors and critical care, Rafalowski said.\n\n\u201cI think most of us would like to leave the (proposed budget with) nurses full-time,\u201d Broughton said.\n\nThe proposed general purpose budget of $84,580,680 \u2014 more than $2.3 million more than the amended 2014-15 budget \u2014 also leaves in about $2.2 million to give all employees a 4 percent raise, with about half the money for the teacher portion of that coming from Tennessee; $451,855 to take maintenance and custodial workers back to full-time status and $12,000 for a part-time fire science instructor at East High.\n\nIt also would take $2,193,902 from county school system reserves.\n\n\u201cThe reason we keep putting things out there is because they are important,\u201d said outgoing Director Jubal Yennie, who is leaving for the Albany County, Wyo., school system. Monday was his last board meeting, and he called the board\u2019s vote a \u201cgood-faith\u201d response to the committee.\n\nIn other action during the called meeting, the board approved the same differentiated pay plan it first used in 2014-15. It includes signing bonuses for hard-to-fill positions such as speech, as well as extra money for teacher leader program participants, technology coaches at the school building levels and teachers who act as assistant principals in elementary schools otherwise without that position.\n\nThe board also approved budget transfers to \u201czero out\u201d federal Race to the Top fund accounts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>BLOUNTVILLE \u2014 Sullivan County\u2019s school nurses will have health insurance available for 2015-16.</p>\n<p>And that is even though the latest proposed school budget would no longer", "og": {"url": "http://www.timesnews.net/News/2015/06/23/Sullivan-school-nurses-to-get-health-insurance-regardless-of-county-budget-decision-thanks-to-Obamacare.html", "site_name": "Kingsport Times-News", "image": "http://www.timesnews.net/image/2015/06/23/x720_q60/a16a085a2c8acdd9046a05ac8af81a08-jpg.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Sullivan school nurses to get health insurance regardless of county budget decision, thanks to Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.timesnews.net", "creator": "TimesNewsOnline", "image": {"src": "http://www.timesnews.net/image/2015/06/23/x720_q60/a16a085a2c8acdd9046a05ac8af81a08-jpg.jpg"}, "title": "Sullivan school nurses to get health insurance regardless of county budget decision, thanks to Obamacare", "site": "@TimesNewsOnline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 306444286209772}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 201506230098}}, "keywords": "Kingsport Times-News,News", "google-site-verification": "uiTHhc2bxN1N0pBi249F-jCDqA59bFKW1qHORL26uvo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc273\"", "article_summary": "As for that committee\u2019s questions about school nurses, Rafalowski said three or four of the 22 school nurses are licensed practical nurses, or LPNs and the rest are registered nurses, or RNs.\nThe budget change was in response to a recent Budget Committee request for a \u201cdo-over\u201d or review of the school budget by the BOE.\nRafalowski said county school nurses in 2014-15 were paid slightly more to offset the lack of health insurance, and Business Manager Leslie Bonner said the county was responsible for offering health insurance under the ACA, also known as Obamacare.\nThe mandatory benefit is because of the federal Affordable Care Act, not because of the school board or County Commission.\nIt also would take $2,193,902 from county school system reserves."}
