Pappas, Springfield\n\nThe author is a Qualified Purchasing Agent.\n\nSomeone's 'junk mail' is another person's job\n\nJunk mail? What's junk mail? Ads that reach homes by way of the U.S. Postal Service orthose tucked in the daily newspaper?\n\nMail means jobs.\n\nWe replace toll collectors with technology. Corporations send jobs overseas to save money. Now we want to stop receiving ads by mail? Those are more jobs that will be lost. How? Let's start with the initial employer. The merchant.\n\nNext, the people that compose the ad. Third: the printer. Fourth: the people who deliver it to the consumer.\n\nWake up, America. We are our own 'worst enemy'. The post office, and I was part of it, had its first Reduction in Force' (RIF) in 1992. And it started with 'those ads\u201d being delivered in the Sunday newspapers and more people taking care of bills online. Then forget those people that keep interrupting our meals because they needed a job but can\u2019t do their work because of \u201cDon\u2019t Call\u201d rules.\n\nAny suggestions where our unskilled Americans are supposed to get jobs to support themselves? I'll take the ads and the phone calls we need to keep Americans working.\n\nEleanor M. Strollo, Belleville\n\nGovernment subsidies should go only to U.S. citizens\n\nI support the Affordable Care Act. It seems obvious to me that in our great country, citizens should have police and fire protection, public education, and health care. Your article highlighting the story of a South Asian green-card holder who qualified for a subsidy, though, surprised and disappointed me.\n\nA subsidy means that other working Americans shoulder some of the financial burden. I applaud doing that for American citizens needing help, but I don't think that we should stretch further our finite resources by subsidizing noncitizens.\n\nI hope that eligibility gets a second look in any upcoming review of the Act.\n\nJames Tubman, Flemington", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "education, health, letters-to-the-editor, obamacare, star-ledger-letters, opinion", "title": "Shocking Kean University table purchase, junk mail means jobs, limit government subsidies: Letters", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Shocking Kean University table purchase, junk mail means jobs, limit government subsidies: Letters\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/12/shocked_by_kean_university_table_purchase_junk_mail_jobs_government_subsidies_letters.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/new_jersey_opinion/photo/16470374-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14641843\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-12-04T13:15:50Z\", \"author\": \"Letters to the Editor | The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"education\",\"health\",\"letters-to-the-editor\",\"obamacare\",\"star-ledger-letters\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/new_jersey_opinion/photo/16470374-standard.jpg", "description": "I was shocked and dismayed by Kean University President Dawood Farahi&#8217;s response of &#8220;Why not?&#8221; as justification for the purchase of a more than $219,000 conference table without public bid.
