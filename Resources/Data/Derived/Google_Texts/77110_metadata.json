After the filing of a complaint by Orthodox petitioners, the New York State Supreme Court upheld the denial of a permit for the mikvah.\n\nBut Thursday\u2019s appeals court ruling overruled that decision, affirming that the mikvah qualifies as a \u201chouse of worship\u201d for the purposes of Mamakating\u2019s zoning codes and therefore must be allowed.\n\nHasidic supporters of the development in Bloomingburg allege that the town\u2019s denial of the mikvah is part of a systematic campaign to thwart the Hasidic growth in the area and discriminate against Hasidic Jews already living in Bloomingburg.\n\nREAD: How to build a Hasidic shtetl \u2014 See Bloomingburg, N.Y.\n\nThe tiny village in Sullivan County, about 80 miles north of New York City, has been the site of a pitched battle between Orthodox Jewish developer Shalom Lamm and locals \u2014 including Mamakating town supervisor Bill Herrmann \u2014 who oppose the changes Lamm is bringing to the area. For months, construction at Lamm\u2019s housing development adjacent to the mikvah, which is being built to suit Hasidic needs, had been frozen while Lamm and opponents in Mamakating fought over certificates of occupancy for the dozens of units already completed.\n\nBut the first certificates of occupancy recently were granted, and sales of the units are now in progress, according to a spokesman for Lamm, Michael Fragin.\n\n\u201cEvery effort of the town of Mamakating to stymie the growth of the Jewish community in Bloomingburg has been struck down by the courts,\u201d Fragin said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Bill Herrmann and his allies to cease their costly campaign of discrimination and fruitless legal challenges.\u201d\n\nIn its ruling in favor of the mikvah, the appeals court cited Jewish law as a basis for its decision.\n\n\u201cUnder Jewish Law, a mikvah must be built in a new community even before the construction of a synagogue,\u201d noted the decision, signed by clerk Robert Mayberger of the Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court. \u201cJacob Schacter, a rabbi and professor of Jewish history, explained that an individual\u2019s immersion in the waters of a mikvah is \u2018a basic religious ritual [of Orthodox Jews] for the purpose of restoring spiritual and family purity. According to Binyamin Hammer, another rabbi, the ritual is \u2018vital to those who observe Jewish laws.\u2019 Petitioner\u2019s submissions further showed that immersion in a mikvah is generally accompanied by the recitation of blessings or prayers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.128x79":
