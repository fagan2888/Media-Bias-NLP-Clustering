We questioned authority. We identified with the outsider. We rooted for the underdog. And through it all, we never lost our faith in happy endings. Our thoughts and prayers are with Harold\u2019s wife, Erica, his children and grandchildren, and all those who loved him, who quote his work with abandon, and who hope that he received total consciousness.\u201d\n\nThe last line, of course, is a nod to Bill Murray\u2018s famous remarks in \u201cCaddyshack.\u201d\n\nSee photos: Remembering Harold Ramis \u2013 13 of His Most Iconic Contributions to Comedy\n\nRamis, who passed due to complications from auto-immune inflammatory vasculitis, a rare disease that causes swelling of the blood vessels, was praised throughout the comedy world, with collaborators and admirers displaying deep reverence for his work.\n\nAlso read: Harold Ramis and Bill Murray: Inside The \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 Duo\u2019s Decade-Long Feud\n\n\u201cHarold Ramis made almost every movie which made me want to become a comedy director,\u201d director Judd Apatow said. \u201cI interviewed him when I was 16 years old for my high school radio station and he could not have been more gracious and hilarious. I looked up to him as a director but even more so as a man. We hired him to play Seth\u2019s father in \u2018Knocked Up\u2019 because we all saw him as the dream dad \u2013 funny, warm and wise. Harold was one of the nicest people I have ever met and he inspired countless people to go into comedy.
