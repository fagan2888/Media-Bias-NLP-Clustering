Violence is flaring in Ukraine and on Israel\u2019s borders. A humanitarian crisis is developing on our own southern border, but immigration legislation, like most all legislation, is moribund. Probes of the veterans\u2019 health-care system, the IRS and Benghazi are sucking up attention and the administration\u2019s time.\n\nAs President Obama fails to get any credit for the millions who have found jobs or gained health-care coverage on his watch, a nonpartisan Quinnipiac poll this week found that 33 percent of Americans consider him to be the worst president since World War II, besting (or worsting, as it were) George W. Bush and leaving Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon in the dust.\n\nNo wonder this bear wants to break loose. And maybe he will \u2014 if Republicans take control of the Senate.\n\nCrazy talk, you say? Maybe so. The prevailing view is that a Republican Senate would only compound Obama\u2019s woes by bottling up confirmations, doubling the number of investigations and chipping away at Obamacare and other legislative achievements.\n\nYet there\u2019s a chance that having an all-Republican Congress would help Obama \u2014 and even some White House officials have wondered privately whether a unified Republican Congress would be better than the current environment. Republicans, without Harry Reid to blame, would own Congress \u2014 a body that inspires a high level of confidence in just 7 percent of Americans, according to a Gallup survey last month finding Congress at a new low and at the bottom of all institutions tested.\n\nThere would be no more excuses for Republicans\u2019 failure to put forward their own health-care plan, immigration proposals, specific cuts to popular government programs, and pet causes involving abortion, birth control and gay rights. This would set up real clashes with Obama \u2014 who could employ the veto pen he hasn\u2019t used a single time since Republicans gained control of the House in 2010 \u2014 and sharp contrasts that would put him on the winning side of public opinion.\n\nIt is not hard to imagine a Republican takeover of the Senate causing conservatives in both chambers to overreach. House Republicans would get more pressure from their base to take a swing at impeachment, because the odds of convicting Obama in the Senate would be better (if still prohibitive). Alternatively, Republican leaders, recognizing that the public will hold them responsible now that they have complete control of Congress, might try to compromise with Obama.\n\nIn the first scenario, marauding conservatives drive Republicans to oblivion in 2016 and beyond, putting Hillary Clinton in the White House. In the second scenario, Obama actually accomplishes something in his last two years.\n\nOf course, there is a third scenario, in which a Republican Senate majority only makes Obama miserable. Norm Ornstein , Congress watcher nonpareil, predicts Republicans would halt executive-branch confirmations, leaving the administration weak and understaffed. Remaining staffers would be hamstrung as they try to comply with a new wave of congressional subpoenas. And Republicans may content themselves simply to keep the legislative process shut. \u201cLuring them into a further layer of craziness has advantages,\u201d Ornstein said, but \u201cthe danger for Obama is what resonates with the public is he\u2019s the president: Why the hell can\u2019t he get it done?\u201d\n\nA unified Republican Congress could also force Obama to accept rollbacks of Obamacare and other Democratic achievements by attaching the rollbacks to must-pass legislation. Michael Tomasky argued in the Daily Beast that a Republican majority would \u201ctake as many bites as it can out of what Obama has accomplished in the last six years.\u201d\n\nSuch concerns are all valid, but they may not give enough weight to conservatives\u2019 tendency to overplay their hand, as Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) did by provoking last year\u2019s government shutdown or as Rep. Darrell Issa (Calif.) has done with a stream of wild accusations that discredited his investigations.\n\nI hold out hope that a Congress under unified Republican control might react the way it did during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, producing a balanced budget and welfare reform. But if Republicans don\u2019t take seriously their responsibility to govern, they\u2019ll find the Senate even less governable than it is today. Democrats would still have more than enough votes to block legislation with filibusters \u2014 as the Republican minority did in the last two years of Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut hopefully Democrats would let some of the more egregious proposals reach Obama\u2019s desk. Of the 2,564 presidential vetoes since 1789, this president has issued only two, both over obscure issues. More exercise of the veto pen could strengthen Obama\u2019s weak hand.\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An all-Republican Congress could force the party to govern and compromise", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "An all-Republican Congress could force the party to govern and compromise", "title": "For Obama, loss of the Senate could be freeing", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-for-obama-loss-of-the-senate-could-be-freeing/2014/07/04/d69dacda-0384-11e4-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/07/04/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Merlin_371266-2617.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Milbank"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-for-obama-loss-of-the-senate-could-be-freeing/2014/07/04/d69dacda-0384-11e4-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Dana Milbank, gridlock, obama gop, obama senate, gop senate, republican senate, 2014 election, obama second term, republican congress, gop congress", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank"}, "eomportal-uuid": "d69dacda-0384-11e4-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Dana Milbank, gridlock, obama gop, obama senate, gop senate, republican senate, 2014 election, obama second term, republican congress, gop congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb42\"", "article_summary": "Of course, there is a third scenario, in which a Republican Senate majority only makes Obama miserable.\nThe prevailing view is that a Republican Senate would only compound Obama\u2019s woes by bottling up confirmations, doubling the number of investigations and chipping away at Obamacare and other legislative achievements.\nHouse Republicans would get more pressure from their base to take a swing at impeachment, because the odds of convicting Obama in the Senate would be better (if still prohibitive).\nI hold out hope that a Congress under unified Republican control might react the way it did during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, producing a balanced budget and welfare reform.\nIt is not hard to imagine a Republican takeover of the Senate causing conservatives in both chambers to overreach."}
