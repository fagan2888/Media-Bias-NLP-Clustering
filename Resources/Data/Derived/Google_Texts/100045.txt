Doctors make a visible impact every day via the patients they treat, but their economic impact, while less obvious, also provides broader benefits to their communities.

Physicians contributed $1.6 trillion in direct and indirect economic output nationwide in 2012, according to a March 2014 report by the American Medical Association. In Tennessee, that figure was $20.1 billion, or 7.2 percent, of the state’s gross domestic product.

In addition to spending, physicians are also job creators, with each supporting, on average, more than 10 jobs — including his or her own.

At the time of the study, Tennessee had slightly more than 14,000 physicians, and demand is projected to grow nationally by 18 percent through 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which could cause a ripple effect of job creation as the healthcare industry continues to grow.

This growth in demand as the population ages, coupled with significant changes in reimbursements to health care providers under the Affordable Care Act, is changing how many physicians practice.

Federal health care reform provides incentives for the creation of accountable care organizations, which consist of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers, who coordinate care to their Medicare patients. Twenty-four percent of physicians reported participating in ACOs in the AMA report versus just 3 percent in 2011. An additional 10 percent of doctors say they plan to join this year.

These and other changes driven by the Affordable Care Act create more paperwork and expectations, doctors say. These demands are leading more doctors to opt to be employees of a larger organization, rather than running their own practice, according to the AMA.

The Business Journal’s list of Knoxville-area physician groups offers examples of several different management structures.

University Physicians Associates, the group that counts the largest number of physicians on the list, is classified as an independent physician association. Its physicians remain in private practices, but the association takes care of many administrative duties and business operations. UPA has 674 staff — 485 of which are physicians — at 150 East Tennessee locations.

Summit Medical Group, an independent group ranked second on the list, in 2010 created an ACO subsidiary, Summit Health Solutions. Summit employs more than 1,300 staff members, 214 of whom are physicians, in a 12-county area.

Covenant Medical Group at No. 3 is the largest hospital-affiliated group, employing 758 people, more than 100 of which are physicians.

Knoxville-based TeamHealth provides yet another employment option for physicians.

Originally founded to provide emergency department administrative and staffing services, TeamHealth is currently one of the nation’s largest providers of hospital-based clinical outsourcing and provides emergency medicine, hospital medicine, anesthesia, urgent care, and pediatric staffing and management services.

In the Knoxville area it employs more than 1,600 people and has 9,800 affiliated healthcare professionals nationwide. The company has completed 13 acquisitions in the past two years.
