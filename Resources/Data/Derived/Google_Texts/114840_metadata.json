He\u2019s normalized relations with Cuba, implemented a historic Iranian nuclear deal, signed a global climate pact with nearly 200 nations, overseen the continued success of Obamacare, all while the economy has recorded 73 straight months of job growth.\n\nNo wonder that polls point toward a Democrat succeeding him in the White House.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t there more media credit directed his way? Is the press making the mistake of reading off the Republican campaign script this year, which insists America is teetering on collapse? (Obama joked at the White House Correspondents Dinner: \u201cThe end of the Republic has never looked better.\u201d)\n\nWhatever the reasons, let\u2019s note there hasn\u2019t been a media rush to document Obama\u2019s strong standing in recent weeks. CNN last month timidly suggested, \u201cthere's some evidence that the public is viewing Obama \u2026 more fondly.\u201d The first clue? Obama\u2019s approval rating hit a three-year high of 53 percent, according to Gallup. (He boasts a staggering 66 percent approval rating today among voters 18-29.)\n\nObama\u2019s strong showing has remained steady since March: Gallup on Monday pegged his approval rating at 52 percent.\n\nNote that the president\u2019s approval rating dropped down to 40 percent just 18 months ago during the midterm election cycle in 2014, which means he\u2019s ridden a 13-point surge over the last year-and-a-half. Doesn\u2019t that qualify as news?\n\nThe president averaged a nearly 50 percent approval rating from January 20 through April 19, his 29th quarter in office, according to Gallup. That 29th quarter represents \u201cone of the higher quarterly averages in his presidency to date.\u201d That\u2019s especially remarkable considering second terms are not traditionally kind to presidential approval ratings.\n\nRecall that our previous two-term president left office with a 22 percent approval rating, while his vice president signed off with a thumbs-up from 13 percent of voters.\n\nWhat\u2019s also impressive is that in today\u2019s hyper-partisan environment, Obama has been able to boost his standing while getting almost no support from Republican voters.\n\n\u201cObama is the first president since polls existed to have never gone above 25 percent approval from the other side,\u201d noted Paul Waldman at the American Prospect. Obama\u2019s approval among Republicans currently stands at just 14 percent, according to Gallup. Given today\u2019s rugged political terrain, \u201cIf a president can stay at 50 percent, he should be counted a remarkable success,\u201d Waldman argued.\n\nBut don\u2019t look for lots of media tributes. The truth is, during his two terms the press has repeatedly worked to depict Obama\u2019s standing as being on the decline, and often downplaying his success. (Also, good news is no news.) As Media Matters noted in 2010, \u201cBeltway scribes today have made it plain that when it comes to Obama and polling, good news is no news.\u201d\n\nAnd when Obama\u2019s standing did fall, the press eagerly piled on, as I laid out after Democratic losses in 2014:\n\nRight after the election, a November Economist editorial announced, \"Mr. Obama cannot escape the humiliating verdict on his presidency.\" Glimmers of hope after the midterms were no reason to think Obama had \"somehow crawled out of the dark place that voters put him,\" the Washington Post assured readers. (Post columnist Dana Milbank has recently tagged Obama as a hapless \"bystander\" who's \"turning into George W. Bush.\") And a McClatchy Newspapers headline declared, \"President Obama Is Now Truly A Lame Duck.\"\n\nSo it\u2019s not surprising the same press corps is in no rush today to detail Obama\u2019s recent surge in popularity, and in fact seems to tiptoe around it.\n\nIn January, The New York Times looked ahead to Obama\u2019s final year in office and stressed, \u201cpolls show doubts about his handling of critical issues.\u201d Contrasting his second term with Bill Clinton\u2019s and Ronald Reagan\u2019s, the Times insisted Obama began the year \u201cwithout the advantages of popularity that Reagan and Mr. Clinton had.\u201d\n\nIn other words, both Reagan and Clinton were very popular during their final year in office, but Obama was not. Yet recently, Obama\u2019s Gallup approval rating slightly exceeds Reagan\u2019s from the same point in the Republican\u2019s eighth year in office.\n\nObama\u2019s Gallup rating April 25-May 1, 2016: 51 percent.\n\nReagan\u2019s Gallup rating May 2-May 8, 1988: 50 percent.\n\nSo where are the media acknowledgements? (In the press, Reagan is often used as shorthand for a universally popular president.) In recent months, the Times has made only a few passing references to Obama\u2019s approval ratings, according to Nexis.\n\nIn early March, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that Obama\u2019s approval rating had risen to 51 percent, up from 45 percent in December. Big news, right? Nope. The Post reported that 51 percent fact in the ninth paragraph and devoted just one sentence to his surge.\n\nHere\u2019s another example: Last June when a CNN poll found that Obama\u2019s approval rating dipped to 45 percent, CNN played the data as big news (\u201cPresident Barack Obama's job approval numbers are sinking\u201d), complete with the taunting headline \u201cBush Now More Popular Than Obama.\u201d\n\nBut more recently, when CNN polling pegged Obama\u2019s approval at 51 percent, CNN downplayed the news. CNN\u2019s polling write-up about the survey included just one sentence noting the president\u2019s surge.\n\nAnd in a recent 8,000-word opus, Politico outlined what it claims to have been Obama\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to communicate his agenda, and what \u201cwent wrong\u201d inside the White House. It wasn\u2019t until 7,000 words into the feature that Politico acknowledged Obama\u2019s approval rating recently hit a three-year high. Politico also never mentioned that Obama\u2019s approval today matches that of Reagan\u2019s, who was known as The Great Communicator.\n\nTo date, Obama\u2019s second term has been a broad success, and lots of voters agree.
