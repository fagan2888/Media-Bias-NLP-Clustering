Product manager Jerry Bougher said the idea is to attack smells \u201cwhere the action is.\u201d\n\nThe $90 seat is one of many high-tech gadgets that Wisconsin-based Kohler and its competitors have introduced in recent years to make time spent in the bathroom more pleasant. When it comes to toilets, consumers can get seats with features such as slow-closing lids, heat and nightlights that typically add $20 to $100 to the cost.\n\nKohler sees deodorizing technology as something that most consumers can connect with, Bougher said. \u201cIn terms of odor, everyone\u2019s experienced it.\u201d\n\nThe seat turns on automatically when someone sits down. The fan emits a slight hum as it filters the offending odor. The air flows over a scent pack similar to air fresheners used in cars, and the masking smell builds gradually. Bougher\u2019s wife, Angela, said her husband installed a Purefresh seat in their home without telling her, and she noticed the scent \u201cjust before you would normally reach for a can of spray.\u201d\n\nJosh Pantel, 27, has a Purefresh seat in the Middleton home he bought about three months ago with his girlfriend, who works for Kohler. He too likes it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kohler introduces odor-eating toilet seat", "author": "M.l.
