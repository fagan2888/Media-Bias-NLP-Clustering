Within weeks, I had accumulated a stack of envelopes related to the operation. Not a \u201cget well\u201d card in the bunch. Only demands for money. Now that I\u2019d been stitched up, it was time to pay up.\n\n\u201cIt is your responsibility to see that this bill is paid in full within 60 days,\u201d the anesthesia company wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are now accepting payment by credit card,\u201d the pathology lab trumpeted, as if it were introducing an innovation to rival the Internet.\n\n\u201cIf you are unable to pay in full, please contact a financial counselor,\u201d the hospital advised.\n\nMy health care \u201cproviders\u201d were hounding me for \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d expenses, a benign phrase that evokes a few quarters tangled in lint.\n\nIf only.\n\nGoing under the knife was, thank God, my first major patient experience. The health care part was easy \u2014 skilled doctors and nurses, preheated blankets, a fuzzy pillow of sedation, no overnight stay, and a scar that fell well short of Frankenstein proportions. But the blitz of invoices that followed made me question whether my UnitedHealthcare insurance was worth it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone who\u2019s been treated at a hospital or had an imaging scan in the last few years knows that out-of-pocket costs have spun out of control. Patients are being held liable for ever-higher deductibles, more out-of-network charges, and something called coinsurance \u2014 which should be called \u201cno insurance.\u201d Even gold-standard policies have coverage gaps that don\u2019t fill in until patients reach the level of care needed for a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d illness. In my case, the final out-of-pocket tally was about $2,000, or 8,000 quarters.\n\nWith so much attention focused on boosting health insurance enrollment numbers nationwide, the out-of-pocket issue has been underplayed. But rising expenses for individuals could undermine the primary reason behind universal coverage \u2014 healthier people. Many are being squeezed into choosing between two bad outcomes: taking on debt or forgoing treatment.\n\nA Commonwealth Fund survey last fall found Americans \u201care paying more out-of-pocket for health care now than they did in the past decade.\u201d About one in five adults spent at least 5 percent of their income on out-of-pocket costs \u2014 excluding premiums \u2014 the Commonwealth Fund said, and 13 percent forked over 10 percent or more. Those with lower incomes had higher out-of-pocket charges, mainly because their coverage was lousy.\n\nThis year, the average US employee will pay $2,487 in out-of-pocket fees, based on a projection by the benefits consultancy Aon. Over the last five years, Aon said, a worker\u2019s share of health care costs \u2014 including premiums and out-of-pockets \u2014 will have gone up by more than 52 percent.\n\nDepending on your insurance plan, there\u2019s plenty of headroom for heftier obligations going forward. Under the Affordable Care Act, 2015 out-of-pocket costs for an individual max out at $6,600. The family plan ceiling is $13,200.\n\nDirecting more expenses to patients is one way health insurers have been able to ease off from the eye-popping double-digit annual premium increases that were long the norm. The industry has fashioned this trend into something of a public relations coup. Most businesses highlight a price change only when it\u2019s a decrease; health insurance executives get to crow about jacking up the cost of their products at a slower rate than before. What a deal!\n\nInsurers also argue that out-of-pockets make subscribers sensitive to the real cost of care. Instead of hightailing it to the emergency room for a splinter, a patient might visit a walk-in clinic or see a nurse practitioner to save money.\n\nTaking a more \u2018active role\u2019 in their health care often involves patients making medical decisions based on their finances, not their well-being.\n\n\u201cConsumers are being asked to take a more active role in their health care,\u201d says Maria Gordon Shydlo, a spokeswoman for UnitedHealthcare. It\u2019s a line I heard frequently during nine years as an editor overseeing coverage of the health insurance and medical industries. The problem is that an \u201cactive role\u201d too often involves patients making medical decisions based on their finances, not their well-being.\n\nHealthy people aren\u2019t forced into those kinds of choices. As long as they don\u2019t need serious or regular medical care, and their premiums come straight from a paycheck, coverage can seem almost invisible. Insurance is something that\u2019s there, just in case. But it\u2019s an illusion of affordability, perhaps an unintended consequence of the Affordable Care Act. The law, for good reason, exempts certain preventive services from copays, deductibles, and coinsurance. It\u2019s a way to encourage people to seek routine care now that might head off serious problems later. The side effect is that for those whose only encounter with the health care system is a yearly wellness exam, out-of-pocket expenses can appear to be going down instead of up.\n\nThis deep into a story about health insurance, your eyes are likely glazing over. Do not seek medical treatment \u2014 the feeling will pass once you resume normal activities. My vision, too, blurred as I tried to decipher all the bills I received. Impenetrable math detailed \u201cplan discounts\u201d negotiated between the insurer and providers. Dense language like \u201csurgical path level IV gross & micro\u201d may as well have been in code. It took months to sort everything out, despite a steady stream of UnitedHealthcare EOBs. That\u2019s an \u201cexplanation of benefits\u201d to us lay folk. They\u2019re identifiable by the \u201cthis is not a bill\u201d label.\n\n\u201cEOBs are chock-full of information,\u201d Shydlo told me. \u201cPeople kind of toss those aside.\u201d\n\nI tried to harvest something useful from mine, but the \u201ctotal amount you owe\u201d often didn\u2019t sync with statements from the hospital, doctors, and labs. I decided to write checks only after the \u201c30 days past due\u201d notices arrived. By then, I theorized, any contractual price cuts and unapplied credits for deductibles had been sorted out. Who knows for sure?\n\nMaybe I should have hired Adria Goldman Gross. Her New York company, MedWise Insurance Advocacy, helps people navigate insurance claims and medical bills. MedWise has saved clients about $3.5 million in the last three years, according to Gross.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies are ripping people off,\u201d she says.\n\nTo minimize out-of-pocket expenses, Gross advises, \u201cAlways ask in advance, \u2018What am I going to be charged for this procedure and who is going to be taking care of me?\u2019 \u201d Another tip: Insist on an in-network provider whenever possible.\n\nInsurers and providers have long sparred over who\u2019s to blame for escalating prices. The medical industry is in the throes of major changes that are supposed to make a difference \u2014 they include Obamacare, a shift from fee-for-service to pay-for-performance care, electronic medical records, and a tidal wave of consolidation. In the latest mammoth move, CVS Health this month said it would pay $1.9 billion to take over Target\u2019s clinic and pharmacy operations. Such mergers give companies more leverage with insurers and allegedly yield \u201cefficiencies\u201d that reduce costs. It\u2019s too early to offer a prognosis on whether any of this will save consumers money and improve health on a grand scale. Meantime, we\u2019re getting our pockets picked clean, one X-ray at a time.\n\nHealth insurance isn\u2019t much of a benefit if you can\u2019t afford to use it.\n\nMark Pothier can be reached at mark.pothier@globe.com.
