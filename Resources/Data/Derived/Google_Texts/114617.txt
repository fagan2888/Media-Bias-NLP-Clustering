Democratic strategist Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, shared the meme in support of the drive to sign people up for Obamacare before the looming March 31 deadline. In a new bumper sticker playing on the Gadsden flag, her group, Democracy Partners, replaces the defiant snake with a similarly coiled stethoscope with the words, “Don’t Tread On My Obamacare.”

When Colonel Christopher Gadsden presented the flag to the plucky Continental Navy in the first months of the Revolutionary War, I doubt he intended it to be later used as a symbol to bolster a massive and intrusive government program.
