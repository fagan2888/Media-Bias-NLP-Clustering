It has the best seat in the house for the high-scoring attack that frees the defense to get after opponents as they try to play catch-up.\n\n\u201cWe have an offense that does a great, great job,\u201d safety Will Allen said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stop those guys.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers scored 24 straight points Sunday in their rally to a 34-27 victory over the Broncos, who lead the NFL in points allowed and total yards allowed.\n\nThe win enabled the Steelers (9-5) to control their fate when it comes to making the playoffs; they will qualify for the postseason by winning their last two games \u2014 at Baltimore (4-10) Sunday and at Cleveland (3-11) on Jan. 3.\n\nThe Steelers could also clinch a berth Sunday if they win and the New York Jets (9-5) lose at home to the AFC East champion New England Patriots (12-2).\n\nWhile the six-time Super Bowl-winning franchise has built much of its history on the foundation of strong defense, it is Pittsburgh\u2019s offense that is leading the charge now. The Steelers have scored at least 30 points in a team-record six straight games, going 5-1 in that span to help overcome a 4-4 first half of the schedule.\n\n\u201cOur offense is unstoppable,\u201d defensive end Cam Heyward said. \u201cTo have an offense that can go up and down with anybody, it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s out there. It\u2019s pretty special.\u201d\n\nThe offense helps take pressure off a defense that has had its ups and downs. Pittsburgh is fifth in the NFL in rushing defense with 89.4 yards allowed a game, but 31st against the pass, giving up an average of 279.1 yards.\n\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t see themselves rest on their laurels or patting themselves on the back,\u201d Heyward said of the offense. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to continue to score. You appreciate that as a defense because they give some leeway at times.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers seemingly should be able to keep putting up big numbers against the injury-ravaged Ravens and woeful Browns.\n\nAntonio Brown has 64 catches for 868 yards in the past six games, leading the league in both categories in that span, while quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has averaged 365.8 yards and thrown 13 touchdown passes.\n\nThe Steelers are also healthy. Everyone practiced fully Friday, and no one was listed as doubtful or questionable on the injury report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Antonio Brown, Steelers offense putting on an NFL show", "title": "Antonio Brown, Steelers offense putting on an NFL show", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/25/antonio-brown-steelers-offense-putting-on-an-nfl-show/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__SP21FBNBRONX_3AO_5229xp1.jpg", "height": 437}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__SP21FBNBRONX_3AO_5229xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-25T21:44:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:55:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 The Steelers\u2019 offense, over the past six weeks, has put on a show unlike that of any other team in franchise history.\nNobody is enjoying watching the offense pile up the points more than the Pittsburgh defense.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to stop those guys.\u201dThe Steelers scored 24 straight points Sunday in their rally to a 34-27 victory over the Broncos, who lead the NFL in points allowed and total yards allowed.\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t see themselves rest on their laurels or patting themselves on the back,\u201d Heyward said of the offense.\nIt\u2019s pretty special.\u201dThe offense helps take pressure off a defense that has had its ups and downs."}
