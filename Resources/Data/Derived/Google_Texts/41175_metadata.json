[...] The data also will be used by analysts who study cost. High-volume physicians might be very good at their trade, for example, but some of those procedures could be medically unnecessary.\n\nThe searchable database above includes figures for Massachusetts health-care providers, and shows total 2012 Medicare reimbursements (a future database we'll create will break those totals down by procedure).\n\nTo get started, search either by provider / organization name, or by total amount.\n\nThe search tool will accept partial entries for the name field \u2014 so, you can search for last name only if you are unsure of a first name. Use ALL CAPS when typing the name.\n\nIf you're searching by amount, use the drop-down menu to select \"Less than or equal to\", \"Greater than\", \"Less than\", or \"Equal to\". Then, enter the amount in the field that reads, \"Enter a number\".\n\nIf your search returns multiple rows, click column headers to sort the data or use the \"Adjust range slider\" to set new maximum or minimum reimbursement totals.\n\nFinally: Searching the database causes the page to reload, so please scroll back down to see the results. Searches may take a few moments, depending on your connection speed.\n\nSEARCH THE DATABASE Text search is case sensitive. Leave fields blank to see the entire database (may cause longer load times).
