But last night, the Democratic candidates sounded almost as gloomy about the country they hope to lead, even as they lavished praise on the Democrat who\u2019s currently leading it.\n\nBernie Sanders, the crotchety socialist who was probably born in a bad mood 74 years ago, was even more relentlessly negative than usual, making the U.S. economy sound like an oy-vey sequel to The Grapes of Wrath. He bemoaned how \u201calmost everyone is getting poorer,\u201d how ordinary Americans are \u201cworried to death about the future of their kids,\u201d how \u201cthere is massive despair all over this country.\u201d He spoke of seniors who are \u201ccutting their pills in half\u2026don\u2019t have decent nutrition\u2026can\u2019t heat their homes in the wintertime.\u201d He complained that a rigged economic system and a corrupt political system have created \u201ca moment of serious crises\u201d\u2014an unemployment crisis, health insurance crisis, infrastructure crisis, child poverty crisis, and a dispiriting sense that our crippling problems can\u2019t be solved.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHillary Clinton, the mainstream Democrat who served in the Obama Cabinet, did not push back against this dystopic vision of a nation in pain. She repeatedly pointed out that she agrees with Sanders that too many Americans are getting left behind, that \u201cyes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.\u201d Her main critique of the Sanders critique was that it lacked identity-politics specificity, that it didn\u2019t recognize the unique challenges of \u201creally systemic racism\u201d against blacks, of \u201chardworking immigrant families living in fear,\u201d of women\u2019s rights that are \u201cunder tremendous attack,\u201d of \u201cdiscrimination against the LGBT community,\u201d even of the struggles in coal country and other downtrodden white communities \u201cwhere we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.\u201d\n\nPerhaps this doom-and-gloom-a-thon was predictable after Sanders and Donald Trump rode their messages of malaise to victory in New Hampshire, which had a 3 percent unemployment rate to go along with America\u2019s lowest murder rate and poverty rate. Today, only one quarter of Americans believe the country is on the right track. Still, it was striking that after a record 71 months of employment growth that have created 14 million new jobs, at a time when gasoline is cheap and health care inflation is at the lowest level in half a century and the federal deficit has dropped by more than two thirds, the party in power was essentially embracing the Republican view of America as a dumpster fire.\n\nIt was just as striking to hear Sanders and Clinton interrupt their depressing colloquies about the state of the country with gushing compliments for its leader. Obama has sky-high approval ratings among Democrats, and Clinton repeatedly wrapped herself in the Obama mantle, calling Hillarycare a precursor to Obamacare, praising his executive actions on immigration, boasting about her role in his nuclear deal with Iran as well as his decision to authorize the raid on Osama bin Laden. She also repeatedly accused Sanders of insufficient loyalty to the president\u2014for criticizing his leadership, for downplaying his Wall Street reforms, for calling for a primary challenge in 2012, even for providing a blurb for a book portraying Obama as a disappointment to progressives. \u201cThe kind of criticism that we\u2019ve heard from Senator Sanders about our president, I expect from Republicans,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not expect it from someone running for the Democratic nomination.\u201d\n\nSanders reacted more vehemently to that accusation of disloyalty than he has reacted to anything Clinton has said in any of their debates. \u201cMadam Secretary, that is a low blow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. I have been a strong ally of his on virtually every issue.\u201d Sanders launched his own fiery defense of Obama\u2019s record, arguing the president has done an \u201cextraordinary job\u201d after inheriting an economy losing 800,000 jobs a month, a $1.4 trillion deficit, and a collapsing financial system. \u201cAs a result of his efforts and Joe Biden\u2019s efforts against unprecedented, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress,\u201d Sanders said. He also pointed out that Clinton has not always been such an Obama fan: \u201cOne of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate.\u201d\n\nIt is not necessarily inconsistent to argue that the country has made a lot of progress since the depths of the Great Recession and also that the progress has been insufficient. And the Democrats did not go nearly as far as Republicans have gone in describing the entire world as a chaotic nightmare that threatens our safety, a key element of the GOP case for a departure from the Obama era. But Republicans must be enjoying the spectacle of Democrats echoing their view of the economy\u2014that it\u2019s much worse than the 4.9 percent jobless rate suggests, that the middle class is getting crushed, that Americans have, as Clinton said, \u201cgood cause\u201d to be angry\u2014while simultaneously emphasizing their admiration of Obama. If 2016 is going to be an election about change, about Making America Great Again, it\u2019s hard to see how that landscape favors Obama-loving Democrats.\n\nAnd let\u2019s face it: This is mostly a problem for Clinton. Sanders is perfectly comfortable as Chicken Little, campaigning with left-wing Obama critics like Cornel West, thundering about a nation getting devoured by \u201csuicide, alcoholism, drugs.\u201d If America is in crisis, if \u201cwe need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country,\u201d then the Sanders argument that we also need a political revolution makes sense. It\u2019s tougher to mobilize around the Clinton argument, which is that America is in crisis but we basically need to stay the course. There was a telling moment last night when Clinton argued that the slew of individual donors supporting her as well as Sanders \u201cdemonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.\u201d In 2016, the candidate who served under Obama and supports just about all of Obama\u2019s policies does not look like the candidate of change.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible that Clinton would be able to shift her message in a general election, to focus more on the progress America has made in adding jobs, reducing oil imports and carbon emissions, covering the uninsured, raising graduation rates, and bringing home soldiers since January 2009. Obama\u2019s approval rating has climbed to 50 percent, and the Republican candidates remain unpopular, so it\u2019s possible that the specter of Trump or Ted Cruz or another Republican in the White House would make the electorate feel better about the current direction of the country. For now, though, the candidates of both parties are spending their time on national television telling Americans the country is in shambles. The problem for Democrats is that Americans may believe them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "If she thinks America is such a mess, why wouldn't we want something different?", "title": "Clinton Backs Into a New Corner", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/02/democratic-debate-clinton-sanders-213623", "image": "http://static.politico.com/dd/9e/fc996620415ea1b88f60672939ce/clintonsandersmilwaukee.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "If she thinks America is such a mess, why wouldn't we want something different?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26d7\"", "article_summary": "He also pointed out that Clinton has not always been such an Obama fan: \u201cOne of us ran against Barack Obama.\n\u201cAs a result of his efforts and Joe Biden\u2019s efforts against unprecedented, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress,\u201d Sanders said.\nIt\u2019s tougher to mobilize around the Clinton argument, which is that America is in crisis but we basically need to stay the course.\nIt was just as striking to hear Sanders and Clinton interrupt their depressing colloquies about the state of the country with gushing compliments for its leader.\nStory Continued BelowHillary Clinton, the mainstream Democrat who served in the Obama Cabinet, did not push back against this dystopic vision of a nation in pain."}
