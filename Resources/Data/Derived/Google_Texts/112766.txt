When you’re halfway through with your life, what do you need to be thinking about? One of the things was kind of transitioning at some point in your life to being more significant than being more successful.”

Some people in their 60s are typically thinking about retirement and that it can’t happen quick enough, but William Breland is looking to reinvent himself with a career change.

The longtime physical therapist in Wichita Falls said his private practice business model has been about being successful. Now, the 63-year-old said, his focus is about doing something significant to help people.

It was the book “Halftime: Moving from Success to Significance” by Bob Buford that Breland said he read when he was about 35 years old that planted a seed and has led to this life-changing decision.

“When you’re halfway through with your life, what do you need to be thinking about?” he said of the book’s intended meaning. “One of the things was kind of transitioning at some point in your life to being more significant than being more successful.”

Although he’s not completely stepping away from the physical therapy and training career he has had for 41 years — 39 of which in Wichita Falls — he said he wants to use his experiences to become a patient advocate during a time even finding a doctor can be difficult; and he wants to help clinics survive by consolidating to lower costs at a time when reimbursements continue to fall.

He made the decision a while ago to close Breland Health and Fitness on Plaza Parkway in Century City Shopping Center, and also align his locations in Burkburnett and Lawton, Oklahoma, under the direction of friend and colleague John Reneau at Reneau Rehab in Wichita Falls.

“Because of changes with Obamacare and Medicare, it is very, very hard for small operations, small clinical groups — particularly single clinics like his (Reneau’s) — to stay open, quite frankly,” Breland said. “So there’s a need, and in the country, there’s big move of consolidation so that you can lower your expenses.”

The reimbursement rate for private practice physical therapists taking care of Medicare patients is about 15 percent less than what it was a few years ago, he said, and the profit margin for those clinics is about 15-20 percent. He said that means physical therapy clinics are in essence working for no profit at all.

“We can still stay good and do the good job that hopefully we’ve done all these years,” he said, “But we’ve got to do it ... with a bigger organization so that we can lower our expenses a little bit.”

He also shared the story of a family member in South Texas with myriad health problems who was having difficulty finding a physician. He said he helped the family member get in touch with a physician, but the doctor declined to take them on because the doctor didn’t have time to take care of the multiple medical problems.

It took a few more days, he said, before he could find a doctor who could manage his family member’s care.

“There’re people out there who have that same kind of challenge,” he said. “So, I want to become that patient advocate with no skin in the game. I’m not going to be treating folks, but I’m going to be able to advise them.”

Breland said another area where he hopes to make a significant positive impact is with a Christian-based group called Coreluv. He said he is planning a trip to Haiti through his son’s church in Frisco to work with orphans in disabilities.

“Once again, I’m going to (use) my expertise in an area of the world that’s unbelievably poor,” he said. “It’s not just kids, it’s adults. But this ministry that I’m going to be working with primarily works with orphaned kids, and they’re building some hospitals there.”

Breland said he will also continue to travel to country to educate physical therapists on how to evaluate golfers, as well as provide physical training for golfers through GoLo GolfPerformance.
