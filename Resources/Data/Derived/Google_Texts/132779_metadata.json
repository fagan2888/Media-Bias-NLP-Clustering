Rick Perry on Friday for allegedly abusing the powers of his office by carrying out a threat to veto funding for state prosecutors investigating public corruption \u2014 making the possible 2016 presidential hopeful his state\u2019s first indicted governor in nearly a century.\n\nA special prosecutor spent months calling witnesses and presenting evidence that Perry broke the law when he promised publicly to nix $7.5 million over two years for the public integrity unit run by the office of Travis County Democratic District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg. Lehmberg was convicted of drunken driving, but refused Perry\u2019s calls to resign.\n\nPerry\u2019s general counsel, Marry Anne Wiley, defended the governor\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cThe veto in question was made in accordance with the veto authority afforded to every governor under the Texas Constitution,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will continue to aggressively defend the governor\u2019s lawful and constitutional action, and believe we will ultimately prevail.\u201d\n\nThe unit Lehmberg oversees is the same that led the investigation against former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican who in 2010 was convicted of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering for taking part in a scheme to influence elections in his home state.\n\nSeveral top aides to the Republican governor appeared before grand jurors in Austin, including his deputy chief of staff, legislative director and general counsel. Perry himself did not testify, though.\n\nPerry was indicted on charges of abuse of official capacity, a first-degree felony with potential punishments of five to 99 years in prison, and coercion of a public servant, a third-degree felony that carries a punishment of two to 10 years.\n\nNo one disputes that Perry is allowed to veto measures approved by the Legislature, including part or all of the state budget. But the left-leaning Texans for Public Justice government watchdog group filed an ethics complaint accusing the governor of coercion because he threatened to use his veto before actually doing so in an attempt to pressure Lehmberg to quit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the grand jury determined that the governor\u2019s bullying crossed the line into illegal behavior,\u201d said Craig McDonald, executive director of Texans for Public Justice. \u201cThe complaint had merit, serious laws were potentially broken.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Texas governor is charged with abusing his power and coercing a public servant", "author": "Paul J.
