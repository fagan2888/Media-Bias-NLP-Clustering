A house on South Queen Street in Lakewood suffered extensive damage Saturday after a party involved in a domestic disturbance there torched a vehicle parked in the garage, Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office officials said.

Jefferson County Sheriff’s officers arrived at 4 p.m. at a house in the 1500 block of South Queen following reports of a domestic disturbance. When officers arrived, they saw that a vehicle in the garage was on fire and two people were engaged in a physical altercation, said Jacki Kelley, a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office.

Officers removed the suspects and took an adult male into custody, she said. The fire spread from the car to the garage to the house, she said.

Nobody was injured, she said.
