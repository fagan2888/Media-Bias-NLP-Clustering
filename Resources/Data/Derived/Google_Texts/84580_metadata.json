As part of its commitment to connecting with the broader community, the College of Health and Social Services is hosting its second Dean\u0092s Health Symposium in Las Cruces.\n\nThis year\u0092s one-day seminar, \u0093A Beautiful Death: What will you choose?\u0094 is from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. May 1 at the Las Cruces Convention Center. The event is free and open to the public. Registration is required at http://health.nmsu.edu/2015-deans-health-symposium/.\n\n\n\n\u0093We hope this event will encourage residents of the area and members of our health care community to come together to talk about what is often a difficult topic for both the health care providers and the family members of a dying person,\u0094 said Donna Wagner, interim dean of the College of Health and Social Services.\n\n\n\nThe conference topics are selected for significance and timeliness. Wagner chose the end-of-life conversation because of her interest in advanced care planning and the importance of engaging the health care workforce to provide meaningful services to the dying patient and his or her family and friends.\n\n\n\nThe college\u0092s first educational community outreach effort, \u0093Understanding the Affordable Care Act,\u0094 was held in 2013. The inaugural event helped prepare residents for the law that went into effect in 2014, which was designed to increase the number of people covered by health insurance and implement numerous health insurance-related reforms.\n\n\n\nThe 2015 event has options available for consumers and family caregivers as well as clinicians. Workshop topics include legal issues, the conversation across the lifespan, communicating effectively with health professionals, advanced care planning, New Mexico regulations affecting end-of-life care, hospice and palliative care, pharmacological issues at the end of life, assembling and managing the care team and writing an obituary.\n\n\n\nThe morning session\u0092s keynote speaker will be Margaret Battin, a bioethicist at the University of Utah. She is not only an expert on end of life, but also has a captivating personal story. She and other experts will give presentations throughout the day.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about Battin\u0092s story visit http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=308908.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NMSU News Center", "description": "NMSU will host the Dean\u0092s Health Symposium, \u0093A Beautiful Death: What will you choose?\u0094 May 1 at the Las Cruces Convention Center.", "title": "NMSU Dean\u0092s Health Symposium will explore end-of-life planning, care", "url": "http://newscenter.nmsu.edu/Articles/view/11077/nmsu-dean-s-health-symposium-will-explore-end-of-life-planning-care", "image": "http://newscenter.nmsu.edu/Photos/get/7593/full/symposium.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://newscenter.nmsu.edu/Photos/get/7593/article/symposium.jpg"}, "title": "NMSU Dean\u0092s Health Symposium will explore end-of-life planning, care", "description": "NMSU will host the Dean\u0092s Health Symposium, \u0093A Beautiful Death: What will you choose?\u0094 May 1 at the Las Cruces Convention Center.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nmsunews"}, "description": "NMSU will host the Dean\u0092s Health Symposium, \u0093A Beautiful Death: What will you choose?\u0094 May 1 at the Las Cruces Convention Center.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 507625569}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0196\"", "article_summary": "NMSU Dean\u0092s Health Symposium will explore end-of-life planning, careDate: 04/21/2015Writer: Tiffany Acosta, 575-646-3929, tfrank@nmsu.eduFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ PinterestNew Mexico State University provides educational opportunities to more than just the students on the university\u0092s campuses.\nWorkshop topics include legal issues, the conversation across the lifespan, communicating effectively with health professionals, advanced care planning, New Mexico regulations affecting end-of-life care, hospice and palliative care, pharmacological issues at the end of life, assembling and managing the care team and writing an obituary.\nAs part of its commitment to connecting with the broader community, the College of Health and Social Services is hosting its second Dean\u0092s Health Symposium in Las Cruces.\nWagner chose the end-of-life conversation because of her interest in advanced care planning and the importance of engaging the health care workforce to provide meaningful services to the dying patient and his or her family and friends.\nThe college\u0092s first educational community outreach effort, \u0093Understanding the Affordable Care Act,\u0094 was held in 2013."}
