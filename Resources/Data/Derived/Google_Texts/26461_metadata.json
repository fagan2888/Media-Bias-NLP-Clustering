It\u2019s likely Obama will talk about the failures - especially the state\u2019s mistakes - that led to the crisis.\n\nMeantime, it wasn\u2019t that long ago that Governor Snyder would point to Washington D.C. as a bastion of dysfunction. Snyder continually called out the federal government for being broken and would highlight Michigan as a beacon for problem solving. Now, as the tables have turned and it\u2019s Democrats calling attention to the problems with a Republican-run state government, we\u2019ll see how far President Obama goes in calling out Michigan Republicans.\n\nAnd, let\u2019s not forget, Rick Snyder needs President Obama and the Obama administration to help fix the Flint crisis. Governors need presidential support, just think of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie\u2019s famous Obama hug when POTUS arrived with federal relief after Hurricane Sandy. It was widely panned by a bunch of how-dare-you Republicans but Christie\u2019s response was \u2018I gotta do what I gotta do for my state.\u2019\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like Rick Snyder hasn\u2019t played footsie with President Obama before. There\u2019s been the the new Detroit international bridge, light rail commuter transit for downtown Detroit and the Obamacare Medicaid expansion that Snyder pushed hard for (even against many of his fellow Republicans\u2019 wishes).\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how these two lame ducks spend the rest of their terms in office. Obama, of course, is done in about nine months with a legacy largely cemented and approval ratings that are relatively decent for an outgoing president. Public opinion research meanwhile, says Snyder is largely viewed as a failure. But, he has more than two and half years left in office and is looking to rescue his place in history from the legacy of Flint.\n\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s plenty Snyder still wants to get done before he\u2019s term-limited out of office. And, a lot of that depends on a cordial relationship with who is in the White House right now.\n\nSo, just how does that play out when Obama touches down in Flint on Wednesday?\n\nAs we mentioned, it\u2019s unlikely Snyder will sit in the audience for any kind of blistering speech the President delivers but, perhaps, could something like an airport greeting be in order, a quick handshake, let\u2019s say, on the tarmac?", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Government", "description": "President Obama is planning to fly into Flint later this week to check in on the response to the city\u2019s drinking water crisis and Governor Rick Snyder", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "It's Just Politics", "og": {"url": "http://michiganradio.org/post/can-gov-snyder-afford-snub-president-obama-during-trip-flint", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/michigan/files/styles/medium/public/201605/logo_background_white.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "President Obama is planning to fly into Flint later this week to check in on the response to the city\u2019s drinking water crisis and Governor Rick Snyder", "title": "Can Gov.
