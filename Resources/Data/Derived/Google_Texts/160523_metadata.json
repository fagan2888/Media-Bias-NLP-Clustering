This number is expected to grow as football's biggest event approaches.\n\nRelated: This Little Pigskin Player Failed to Go to Market\n\n\"We typically see the demand for travelers doesn't really spike until we see what teams are in the Super Bowl,\" Sharples added.\n\nPeter Tichey, a pharmacist in Ridgefield Park, N.J., owns a second home just minutes away from MetLife Stadium. Tichey said he is asking $1,000 a night for his four-bedroom home during Super Bowl week. That's $600 more than his usual per-night charges, even during the holiday season.\n\nThis is the first Super Bowl to be hosted by two states. It's also the first time in the region, and there's no certainty another will happen here again anytime soon. More than 400,000 visitors are expected.\n\n\"From a business perspective, it's an amazing opportunity,\" Sharples said. \"You can charge a lot more money.\"\n\nHomeAway's rental prices for the Super Bowl period are historically three to four times as high as those during nonevent periods, the service said.\n\n\"There's no question that people are taking advantage of the fact that people will pay more for the Super Bowl,\" said Sharples. \"Hotel prices have really gone through the roof for that small window of time ... so you will see the same with home rentals.\"\n\nIn Clifton, N.J., just a few miles from the stadium, hotels including Howard Johnson and Holiday Inn are charging rates of $900-plus a night for Super Bowl weekend.\n\nSuch tabs make renting a house an appealing option for many\u2014especially groups.\n\n\"A typical three- to four-bedroom home can usually accommodate up to six people. A home allows families and groups to be together in one place rather than going back to their hotel rooms at night,\" Sharples said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in CNBC.\n\nRead more at CNBC:\n\nHow to win friends, influence regulators\n\nBrands plan megabashes for Super Bowl 2014\n\nTaxman looks into holiday rentals", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "New York and New Jersey homeowners are already cashing in on the 2014 Super Bowl, whic", "title": "Best Way to Make Big Bucks on the Super Bowl", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/22/Best-Way-Make-Big-Bucks-Super-Bowl", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01312013_49ers_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/22/Best-Way-Make-Big-Bucks-Super-Bowl", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01312013_49ers_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "New York and New Jersey homeowners are already cashing in on the 2014 Super Bowl, whic", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f23\"", "article_summary": "Read more at CNBC:How to win friends, influence regulatorsBrands plan megabashes for Super Bowl 2014Taxman looks into holiday rentals\n\"There's no question that people are taking advantage of the fact that people will pay more for the Super Bowl,\" said Sharples.\nRelated: This Little Pigskin Player Failed to Go to Market\"We typically see the demand for travelers doesn't really spike until we see what teams are in the Super Bowl,\" Sharples added.\nThis is the first Super Bowl to be hosted by two states.\nHomeAway's rental prices for the Super Bowl period are historically three to four times as high as those during nonevent periods, the service said."}
