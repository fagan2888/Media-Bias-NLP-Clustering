Paul Ryan, R-Wis., listens to testimony on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, June 4, 2013, during the committee's hearing on organizations that say they were unfairly targeted by the Internal Revenue Service while seeking tax-exempt status. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nThe nut jobs on the right are getting nuttier by the day.\n\nA new national survey for the Wall Street Journal and NBC News indicates that only one in four Americans (24 percent) support the tea party. The events of the last week demonstrate why the wingnuts in the Republican Party are so unpopular.\n\nOvernight, tea party poster boy Paul Ryan became a RINO (Republican in Name Only). Ryan negotiated the new budget deal with his Senate budget counterpart, Patty Murray, D-Wash., who has not been accused by liberals of being a DINO (Democrat in Name Only)\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the tea party.]\n\nI don't understand why the wing nuts have gored Ryan so hard for being a RINO. Ryan embodies everything the GOP is all about: indifference to the plight of the poor, insensitivity towards the rights of women and toadyism to the super rich. He is getting pilloried for supporting a budget that denies unemployment insurance for the long-term unemployed, reduces nutrition assistance payments to almost 2 million Americans, preserves tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires and restores billions of dollars to the bloated Pentagon budget. How dare he? The tea party should give this guy a medal.\n\nRight-wing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Newt Gingrich, the spiritual grandfather of the wackjobs, are taking flack for praising the recently deceased former South African President Nelson Mandela. These two guys are giants of right-wing extremism, so the wacko birds are eating their own young. But I can understand why right-wing extremists are so upset. Mandela fought for universal human rights and suffrage for blacks, goals which the wacko birds completely disdain.\n\nWill Ryan, Cruz and Gingrich be disinvited to the holiday \u2013 excuse me Christmas party \u2013 at the Heritage Foundation? Inquiring minds want to know.\n\nThen the wingnuts went nuts when they saw President Obama shake hands with Cuban dictator Raul Castro. The right considers the greeting grounds for removing the president from office. But the wing nuts would demand his removal from office if he issued an executive order for the U.S. to celebrate Mother's Day twice a year instead of once.\n\n[See a collection of editorial cartoons on Ted Cruz.]\n\nBut the right clearly underestimated the power of social media. Immediately after the handshake went viral, the web was full of pictures of Republican leaders shaking hands and chatting with dictators. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was one of the first Republicans to pounce on the president. And sure enough, the next thing you know, reminders of the senator in a tote a tete with Libyan dictator Mohamar Gaddafi popped up on the web. Then the social media produced pictures of the first President Bush chatting with communist dictator Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Donald Rumsfeld glad handing Saddam Hussein.\n\nCompared with Gaddafi and Saddam, Raul Castro is a joke as far as dictators are concerned. Cuba has been toothless since the Soviet Union went under a quarter of a century ago. And Obama's handshake with Castro doesn't even begin to compare with Ronald Reagan's sale of missiles to the Islamic radicals running Iran. I'd take a handshake with a dictator over an arms sale to one any day.\n\nRead Susan Milligan: The iPotty, 2013\u2019s Worst Christmas Present Idea\n\nRead Jimmy Williams: Why South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley Is Having Re-Election Issues", "article_metadata": {"zone": "brad-bannon/blogentries", "keyword": "Gingrich, Newt", "title": "The Wacko Right Comes After Paul Ryan and Ted Cruz", "og": {"url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/brad-bannon/2013/12/12/the-wacko-right-comes-after-paul-ryan-and-ted-cruz", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "type": "article", "description": "Even Paul Ryan and Ted Cruz can't avoid the wrath of the wacko right.", "title": "The Right Wing Is Eating Its Own ...
