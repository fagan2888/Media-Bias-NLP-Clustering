He started 44 games at Fresno State and had 15 interceptions.\n\nReceiver Mario Alford of West Virginia - Cincinnati\u2019s seventh-round pick - also has signed a contract.\n\nThe Bengals\u2019 most intriguing signing so far is former Ohio State quarterback Terrelle Pryor, who attended a rookie camp last weekend on a tryout basis and got a deal after impressing the coaches. He\u2019ll have a chance to compete for a job backing up Andy Dalton.\n\nThe Bengals also have AJ McCarron and Josh Johnson as backup quarterbacks. McCarron was a fifth-round pick last year, but missed the season with a sore shoulder.\n\n___\n\nOnline: AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Bengals signed safety Derron Smith of Fresno State on Tuesday, leaving two draft picks under contract.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Bengals signed safety Derron Smith of Fresno State on Tuesday, leaving two draft picks under contract.", "title": "Bengals sign 6th-round pick Derron Smith", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/12/bengals-sign-6th-round-pick-derron-smith/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/12/329ead1a9e1eed14750f6a706700ffb5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/12/329ead1a9e1eed14750f6a706700ffb5.jpg", "description": "The Bengals signed safety Derron Smith of Fresno State on Tuesday, leaving two draft picks under contract.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Bengals sign 6th-round pick Derron Smith"}, "Author": "JOE KAY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbad9\"", "article_summary": "CINCINNATI (AP) - The Bengals signed safety Derron Smith of Fresno State on Tuesday, leaving two draft picks under contract.\nHe started 44 games at Fresno State and had 15 interceptions.\nSmith was Cincinnati\u2019s sixth-round pick.\nReceiver Mario Alford of West Virginia - Cincinnati\u2019s seventh-round pick - also has signed a contract.\nMcCarron was a fifth-round pick last year, but missed the season with a sore shoulder."}
