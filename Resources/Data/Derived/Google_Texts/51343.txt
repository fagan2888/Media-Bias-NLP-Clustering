Authorities in Gilpin County said Monday a butane tank explosion that destroyed a home, killed a dog and left a man with burns to his hands was the result of failed hash oil extraction.

Leland Baker, 60, who was renting the home about five miles north of Black Hawk in an unincorporated part of the county, has not been charged in Sunday’s explosion, though he is under investigation.

Another dog was badly burned in the explosion but was “standing and walking around” on Monday, according to Cherokee Blake, a county sheriff’s office spokeswoman.

Hash oil is extracted from marijuana using a dangerous chemical process that has been the center of regulatory debates throughout the state.

Baker was transferred to University of Colorado Hospital on Monday, Blake said.

Officials are investigating what caused the explosion.

A neighbor and a passerby stopped and were able to help Baker out of a window and away from the burning home, according to 7News.
