In coming years, there could be only a handful of very large health systems left in Georgia, University CEO Jim Davis said.\n\nAfter his first health system board meeting, Keel said he met with Davis about a week ago.\n\n\u201cWe hit it off very well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe started it off that at the very least we are going to be good neighbors to at the very most we are going to have all of the partnership opportunities you can imagine.\u201d\n\nThe health system is working with the University System of Georgia Board of Regents on what the next steps should be but \u201cwe\u2019ll start opening up those communication lines between University Hospital and Georgia Regents University,\u201d Keel said. There had been some preliminary, \u201chigh-level discussions\u201d between the two and some assessments of other opportunities that might be out there but the regents wanted to wait until Keel was on board before pursuing anything in more detail with anyone, said Chief Business Officer Tony Wagner.\n\n\u201cWe are not actively at this point engaged in a discussion of a merger or any other major affiliation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re hopeful, based on the work that we\u2019ve done to date, that we\u2019re ready to enter into those kinds of much more detailed discussions in the very near future.\u201d\n\nThe health system has turned around its financial fortunes from some previous years and \u201cthat gives us room to be very deliberate about moving forward,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nWhile University is doing very well this year, looming financial pressures and the need to spread fixed costs over a much larger organization point the way toward greater hospital consolidation in Georgia, Davis said, a trend he predicted in October 2013 just as enrollment in the Affordable Care Act started. Some of that is already happening in the Atlanta area now, where WellStar Health System is in talks to acquire five hospitals and hospitals in Athens and Savannah have announced they are seeking partners, Davis said.\n\nHe once predicted that in order to be a standalone health system in the future it would take at least $3 billion a year in revenues and has since revised that to $5 billion and it may be as high as $20 billion. Ultimately, the U.S. might end up with 150 or less large health systems, which would likely leave Georgia with three to five big providers, Davis said.\n\nScale \u201cis becoming very important,\u201d he said. For now, University is watching what happens, Davis said.\n\nBut ultimately, \u201cwe\u2019re probably going to have to get bigger,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are looking for.\u201d\n\nThere is a lot of enthusiasm on both sides to make something happen between the two health systems, who sit \u201cliterally a stone\u2019s throw away\u201d from each other, Keel said.\n\n\u201cWe are all committed to making this a better community,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Metro, Tom Corwin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "After his first health system board meeting, CEO and GRU President Brooks Keel said he met with University CEO Jim Davis about a week ago.", "title": "Georgia Regents Health System, University Hospital talk of need for partnerships", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/health/2015-08-27/georgia-regents-health-system-university-hospital-talk-need-partnerships", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/14678904.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87a2\"", "article_summary": "In coming years, there could be only a handful of very large health systems left in Georgia, University CEO Jim Davis said.\nAfter his first health system board meeting, Keel said he met with Davis about a week ago.\nNew health system CEO and GRU President Brooks Keel said some of those talks have been with each other.\nUltimately, the U.S. might end up with 150 or less large health systems, which would likely leave Georgia with three to five big providers, Davis said.\n\u201cWe started it off that at the very least we are going to be good neighbors to at the very most we are going to have all of the partnership opportunities you can imagine.\u201dThe health system is working with the University System of Georgia Board of Regents on what the next steps should be but \u201cwe\u2019ll start opening up those communication lines between University Hospital and Georgia Regents University,\u201d Keel said."}
