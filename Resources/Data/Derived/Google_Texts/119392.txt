It’s a feel-good story all around. New Hampshire waitress Sarah Hoidahl recently picked up the $27 tab of two furloughed National Guard soldiers who sat in her section at the Concord Ruby Tuesday’s.

The single mom’s story went viral after the New Hampshire National Guard posted a picture of Sarah and her note on Facebook. The note reads: “Thanks to the government shutdown the people like you that protect this country are not getting paid, however I still am. Lunch is on me thank you for serving, ladies! Have a good day!”

“The Ellen DeGeneres Show” wanted to show its appreciation for Sarah, so host Ellen DeGeneres gave the single mom $10,000 and a new TV (Sarah’s is broken), much to Sarah’s shock. Ellen also paid her $27 in cash to cover the cost of the bill, since that night, Sarah only took home $8 in tips.

After, Sarah says through tears, “Thank you so much.”
