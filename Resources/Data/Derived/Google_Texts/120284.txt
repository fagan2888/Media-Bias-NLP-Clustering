While responding to a call in the early hours of Sunday morning, a Lacey police officer struck and killed a pedestrian in the area of Lacey Road and Deerhead Lake Road, authorities said.

Ocean County Prosecutorâ€™s Office spokesman Al Della Fave said Neil Vandeputt, 25, of Toms River was pronounced dead at the scene at 3:47 a.m.

According to Della Fave, Lacey Police Officer Andrew Slota was responding to a call and traveling East on Lacey Road when his patrol car struck Vandeputt before veering off the road and into a utility pole following an evasive maneuver by the officer.

Witnesses to the incident indicated that Vandeputt was crossing against the traffic signal to the north of Lacey Road at the Deerhead Lake intersection when he was struck by Slotta, Della Fave said.

According to Della Fave, though Slota attempted to avoid Vandeputt, the pedestrian was struck by the front passenger side of the patrol vehicle, and after impact the vehicle struck a utility pole on the westbound side of the road, eventually coming to rest in the bank parking lot adjacent to the roadway.

Vandeputt was pronounced dead at the scene by Dr. Konomos from Newark Beth Israel at 3:47 a.m.

Slota was taken to Community Medical Center where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries.

Because a member of the Lacey Police Office is involved in the incident, the Lacey Police Department will not be involved in the ongoing investigation, Della Fave said.

Instead, a joint investigation will be conducted by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office Major Crimes/Fatal Accident Investigation Unit, Toms River Police Department and the Ocean County Sheriff's Department CSI.
