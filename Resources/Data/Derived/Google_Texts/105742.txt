Outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was involved in an exercise accident that caused him to be rushed to the hospital.

According to a statement released by his office, the 75-year-old Nevada Democrat was using a piece of exercise equipment in his home Thursday when it broke and caused him to fall and “break a number of ribs and bones in his face.”

“Senator Reid was first brought to St. Rose Dominican Hospital in Henderson by his security detail,” the senator’s office said. “He was then transferred to UMC for further testing, where he was admitted overnight as a precaution.”

According to Time Magazine the senator expects to be back at work Tuesday to prepare for the new session.

Twitter users took some shots at “Dirty Harry,” including Dr. Marty Fox, who asked about the Koch brothers.
