Luckily for Union City, it\u2019s defense was there to pick them up once more, as Dayber Licea hauled in an impressive interception.\n\nSoon after, quarterback Renaldy Tavarez tossed an 11-yard touchdown pass to Daiquan Kelly to get Union City on the board.\n\nFollowing another Shabazz touchdown, Boyd redeem himself with a 13-yard touchdown run to put the Soaring Eagles back on top for good at 14-12.\n\nThe second half was all Union City, as the defense completely shut down Shabazz\u2019s offensive attack, while the Soaring Eagles\u2019 offense exploded for 25 points to put the game well out of reach\n\nAfter getting its season off on the right foot, Union City will set its sights on a meeting with rival North Bergen at home Sept. 20.\n\nShabazz (0-1) 6 6 0 0 \u2014 12\n\nUnion City (1-0) 7 7 11 14 \u2014 39\n\nS: Johnson 23 yard fumble recovery (2-point conversion failed)\n\nU: Kelly 11 yard catch from Tavares (Acosta kick)\n\nS: Fogle 1 yard run (2-point conversion failed)\n\nU: Boyd 13 yard run (Acosta kick)\n\nU: Rojas 22 yard run (2-point conversion)\n\nU: Acosta 23 yard field goal\n\nU: Rojas 7 yard run (Acosta kick)\n\nU: Rojas 1 yard run (Acosta kick)", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "union-city", "title": "Union City football team passes first test with 39-12 victory over Shabazz", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Union City football team passes first test with 39-12 victory over Shabazz\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/09/union_city_football_team_passe.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2013/09/13363302-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11194402\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-07T07:04:42Z\", \"author\": \"Michael Wright/The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"union-city\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2013/09/13363302-small.jpg", "description": "UNION CITY - After coming up short in the sectional finals three years in a row, Union City has it&#8217;s sets sight on one thing this season: a state championship.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, September 07, 2013,  3:04 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2013/09/13363302-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mwrightJJournal\", \"author_nickname\": \"Michael Wright/The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"10728279\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "UNION CITY - After coming up short in the sectional finals three years in a row, Union City has it&#8217;s sets sight on one thing this season: a state championship.", "title": "Union City football team passes first test with 39-12 victory over Shabazz", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/09/union_city_football_team_passe.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, September 07, 2013,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "Michael Wright/The Jersey Journal", "Description": "UNION CITY - After coming up short in the sectional finals three years in a row, Union City has it&#8217;s sets sight on one thing this season: a state championship."}, "article_summary": "UNION CITY \u2014 After coming up short in the sectional finals three years in a row, Union City has it\u2019s sets sight on one thing this season: a state championship.\nUnion City made even more mistakes on the very next drive, as a Tamaine Boyd fumble gave Shabazz the ball back once again.\nThe Soaring Eagles\u2019 quest for a title could not have gotten off to a better start last night, as Union City knocked off Shabazz, 39-12, at Roosevelt Stadium.\nLuckily for Union City, it\u2019s defense was there to pick them up once more, as Dayber Licea hauled in an impressive interception.\nSoon after, quarterback Renaldy Tavarez tossed an 11-yard touchdown pass to Daiquan Kelly to get Union City on the board."}
