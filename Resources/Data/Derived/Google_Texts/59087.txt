An 18-year-old man has died following a crash late Saturday morning in Chase County.

The crash happened around 11 a.m. on K-150 near Elmdale. Troopers say a Ford passenger car had just passed a vehicle and was about to pass a semi as a second semi was approaching in the oncoming lanes.

The Ford swerved and over-corrected, traveling to a ditch and was hit by the oncoming semi. The driver was ejected.

After the collision, the semi left the roadway and overturned. The 53-year-old driver was taken to a local hospital for treatment.

Debris from the crash also hit a third vehicle.

The driver of the Ford died at the scene. He is identified as Keleb Montgomery of Marion.

K-150 was closed for several hours.
