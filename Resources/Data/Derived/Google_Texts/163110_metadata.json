(AP) - The hottest item at Bud Grant\u2019s garage sale on Thursday was the Hall of Fame coach\u2019s autograph.\n\nShoppers lined up to have the former Minnesota Vikings coach sign the team souvenirs and outdoor gear they bought. Even a gun.\n\nThe 87-year-old signed a poster for 7-year-old Preston Oberloh, of Rapid City, South Dakota, whose family happened to be in town. His father, Aaron Oberloh, said he thought it would be cool to get next to the coach and get a picture, even though at 33 he wasn\u2019t even born when Grant led the Vikings to four Super Bowl appearances.\n\nIf people didn\u2019t buy anything, Grant\u2019s signature came at a price.\n\n\u201cNow if you buy my stuff, these autographs are free. But if you just come here to get an autograph, and don\u2019t buy anything, then I charge you 25 dollars,\u201d Grant said as $20 and $5 bills piled up on the table in front of him.\n\nGrant, an avid outdoorsman, signed a floating fishing chair that Kristen Strain, of Hudson, Wisconsin, bought for her 10-year-old son, Austin, as well as a Vikings drink glass for her 12-year-old daughter, Taylor. Strain said they\u2019re originally from Rochester and find it a little strange living as Vikings fans in Packers territory.\n\n\u201cMy kids have issues with the green and the gold,\u201d Strain said.\n\nIt was Grant\u2019s 10th garage sale. He billed it as his last. It began Wednesday evening and runs through Friday.\n\nGrant said his goals were simple: Get rid of stuff and make some money.\n\nOne table Thursday held Vikings memorabilia, including 40th anniversary posters from 2000 and Game 900 T-shirts from when the Vikings played the Lions in 2004. That merchandise belonged to a dealer. Grant said he let him come to draw a crowd.\n\nGrant\u2019s own stuff included fishing reels, power tools, wildlife prints and the usual garage sale items. A Vikings Artic Blast snowmobile jacket and pants were priced at $225 together. The original price tags, totaling $330, gave away that he never wore the items.\n\nBut Grant had fired the 12-gauge shotgun that Leslie Davis of Apple Valley bought for $395, still in its original box. Grant signed it on the stock.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll use this now that he\u2019s autographed it,\u201d Davis said with a laugh.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The hottest item at Bud Grant's garage sale on Thursday was the Hall of Fame coach's autograph.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The hottest item at Bud Grant\u2019s garage sale on Thursday was the Hall of Fame coach\u2019s autograph.", "title": "Bud Grant autograph hot item at his garage sale", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/22/shoppers-eager-for-a-piece-of-viking-history/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/22/214b2501035cec14540f6a706700fc62.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/22/214b2501035cec14540f6a706700fc62.jpg", "description": "The hottest item at Bud Grant's garage sale on Thursday was the Hall of Fame coach's autograph.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bud Grant autograph hot item at his garage sale"}, "Author": "STEVE KARNOWSKI", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Bud Grant, Minnesota Vikings"}, "article_summary": "BLOOMINGTON, Minn.
