Some talented Bay High School students are on their way to take a bite of the Big Apple.

Forty-five members of the Bay High School Choir took off Saturday morning for their flight to New York City.

They will be the opening performance in the 2015 New York Invitational Music Festival in the historic Carnegie Hall.

The Bay High Choir will perform a 20-minute show, featuring four advanced-level songs.

The choir's director talked about the once-in-a-lifetime experience for the students.

"Oh, the students know now," said Julia House, Choir Director. "At first, they didn't know how big this was, but now they know. They are really, really excited, and they worked really hard for this."

Bay High will perform on Tuesday Night and will return to Panama City on Wednesday.
