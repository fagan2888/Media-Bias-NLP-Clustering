Many women have one or more risk factors for heart disease, which is the top killer of women in the United States today, according to the American Heart Association. If you're at risk, you can take the preventive-care steps to meet your health goals. And early detection of conditions like heart disease and breast cancer can make a difference for successful treatment.\n\nWell-Woman Exam Tips\n\nBecause of the Affordable Care Act, most health plans provide for free preventive care visits so you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about the cost. You can see your primary care provider or your ob/gyn, who can advise you about your reproductive health and family planning, too. Your well-woman exam is also an opportunity to catch up on recommended vaccines to protect you from infectious diseases.\n\nPrepare for a Preventive Care Visit\n\nPrepare for your visit by knowing your family history and putting together a list of any medications you're taking. Bring a checklist of any health questions you may have.\n\nYour doctor may recommend tests for heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure and high cholesterol, as well as cancer screenings like mammogram or colonoscopy, depending on your age and risks. You can also get your blood sugar levels and BMI tested as part of preventive care.\n\nCheck with your primary care doctor or your ob/gyn to find out which well-woman exam tests are right for you, based on your age and your health history.\n\nMore Women's Health Info\n\nWhich Well-Woman Screening Tests Do You Need?\n\n10 Cancer Screening Tests Women Need to Know About\n\nBest and Worst Birth Control Options\n\n10 Things Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Hysterectomy", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "none", "description": "From heart disease prevention to family planning, here are great reasons to schedule your well-woman check-up today.", "og": {"site_name": "EverydayHealth.com", "description": "From heart disease prevention to family planning, here are great reasons to schedule your well-woman check-up today.", "title": "Top Reasons to Schedule a Well-Woman Visit", "url": "http://www.everydayhealth.com/top-reasons-schedule-well-woman-visit/", "image": "http://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Schedule-Your-Well-Woman-Visit-infographic-722.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From heart disease prevention to family planning, here are great reasons to schedule your well-woman check-up today.", "title": "Top Reasons to Schedule a Well-Woman Visit", "url": "http://www.everydayhealth.com/top-reasons-schedule-well-woman-visit/", "image": "http://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Schedule-Your-Well-Woman-Visit-infographic-722.jpg", "site": "@everydayhealth", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"app_id": 135346036490186}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "National Women's Health Week Action PlanNational Women\u2019s Health Week is the right time to schedule your yearly visit to your healthcare provider for a well-woman exam.\nYour well-woman exam is also an opportunity to catch up on recommended vaccines to protect you from infectious diseases.\nPrepare for a Preventive Care VisitPrepare for your visit by knowing your family history and putting together a list of any medications you're taking.\n10 Cancer Screening Tests Women Need to Know AboutBest and Worst Birth Control Options10 Things Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Hysterectomy\nMore Women's Health InfoWhich Well-Woman Screening Tests Do You Need?"}
