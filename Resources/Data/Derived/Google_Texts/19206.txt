New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced plans Tuesday to spend at least $50 million to renovate Camden High School and update its technology, the latest in a series of efforts to turn around the poor city’s failing schools.

Families and educators have long complained about the district’s crumbling buildings, including the high school, which was built in 1918. The funding will come from the New Jersey Schools Development Authority, which uses bond money to build and repair schools in urban areas.

Mr. Christie has been to Camden repeatedly over the last year, positioning himself as a Republican who cares about struggling cities even while he gets few votes in them. Last year he took over the troubled Camden schools and appointed a new superintendent, who has said the dilapidated conditions held students back and demoralized them.

Superintendent Paymon Rouhanifard said Tuesday he aimed to create four small learning communities within the high school, with one focused on career and technical education.

State data for Camden High School say that in 2012-13, only 47% of students graduated in four years and few were deemed ready for college. The school has about 800 students this year.

The Schools Development Authority is also planning a $130.5 million construction of a new high school in Trenton.
