You are here to talk about an innovative thing that is happening in helping people deal with and recover from mental ill-health. It involves comedy and mentoring and performance and courage and camaraderie. Can we start, please Steve, with an overview of WISE Stand Up for Mental Health Program? What is going on there?\n\nSB: Stand Up for Mental Health is a program that began in Canada by a guy named David Granirer, who is a depressive himself and who works also as a counsellor. And he decided that a great way to help people with mental health issues and to empower them about their issues would be to teach them comedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is a stand-up comedian as well. So he took people under his wing. He taught them comedy and they put on a small show about their experiences and using their experiences as a source of comedy. And it went from there. He has conducted these courses throughout Canada and throughout the United States and he came to the attention of WISE.\n\nWISE is a company that has been empowering marginalised people through employment for 20 years now. WISE actually became involved and contacted David Granirer \u2013 who, incidentally, thought the first e-mail was spam and nearly deleted it.\n\nHe nearly completely cut the whole thing off at the pass. But WISE became involved and contacted David and what's happened is over the course of 12 weeks David took these nine individuals who were garnered by the WISE network and who all have varying mental illnesses and he taught them the art of stand-up comedy through having weekly lessons.\n\nDavid was in Canada via Skype, and I was in the room as well as a local mentor and assistant and basically we taught these people how to make light of what is a very serious subject.\n\nMS: Can you give a few anecdotes about the performance, because, as you said, there is a range of mental illnesses going on there? And can you tell us what they did? Some people might think, for example, that mental illness and comedy are not a natural fit. I think they are actually, but what happened? What sort of things were going on?\n\nSB: Well it turned out that mental illness and comedy is a perfect fit. These nine people came into the room and there were varying illnesses from schizophrenia to post traumatic stress to depression to you name it, the full gamut was covered off there in the room.\n\nIt was amazing. And what they came with was a group of experiences. They had all had various experiences, either in the mental-health system, or personally . And they brought these experiences to the table and from there, comedy was born.\n\nI agree entirely that mental health and comedy are a perfect fit, because there is no better way of destigmatising anything than with comedy. It could be mental health. It could be football. It could be anything. Comedy is the perfect destigmatising tool.\n\nMS: There has been a lot done to reduce the stigma that used to surround mental ill-health. Part of that of course is that people are coming to understand just how common it is. And let's put some statistics out there. Half the population will experience, or almost half, will experience a mental-health disorder at some time in their life. At least a third of the population will have experienced it before 25. Each year as many as one in five adults in Australia will have a mental disorder. There are today in Australia as many people with depression as there are with a common cold. Do you think there is a greater understanding out there?\n\nSB: No. I still don't think there is. I still think that it is up to programs like Stand Up for Mental Health and other initiatives including from beyondblue and others, to really help destigmatise mental health. There still is a great problem and a great deal of work to do.\n\nIf you tell somebody at a party you are depressed or you suffer from depression, people will walk away from you. If you tell somebody at a party you have got a wooden leg, people will just want to tap it and see what noise it makes.\n\nBut if you tell somebody you're mentally ill, or you tell somebody that you do have a mental dysfunction of some description, people will walk away, people still don't quite understand. People still need to be made aware of the facts. As you say, the facts and figures are there; it touches everybody at some stage, yet there is still this reluctance to acknowledge it properly.\n\nMS: Why?\n\nSB: I have no idea why. I think it is the fear of the unknown. I think it is because it is not something like a broken arm you can put a plaster on. I think it is because it is something that requires mystical medication, requires talking to somebody. The concept of actually getting better by talking to somebody is still quite foreign to a lot of people.\n\nMS: What has been the effect on you and the other performers?\n\nSB: Let's deal with the other performers first, because I think they are the most important aspect of this whole program. I think the effect on them has been remarkable.\n\nI have seen nine people go from quite withdrawn - and in a lot of cases, shells of people. And I have seen them grow and I have seen them develop and I have seen the confidence come in to these people.\n\nThere is one woman, Jo Maria, who has suddenly started going to the gym as a result of this. She has felt the confidence to now suddenly feel physically better to go to the gym.\n\nI have seen these people change in their whole demeanour, from the way they come into the classroom to the way they present physically. They lift themselves. They are higher beings. It is remarkable what has come over them. And it is through the power of comedy. And as far as I am concerned, I have been totally uplifted by the experience of helping these people.\n\nThe whole WISE experience for me is something that has been quite interesting. It has been my job to help nurture these nine individuals along the way and make them feel better and get them to a stage where they can perform. But I feel WISE has nurtured me to a certain extent as well. I feel very much valued, very much appreciated and you really can't underestimate the importance of that.\n\nMS: Can you talk a little bit more about feeling valued and appreciated?\n\nSB: It is little things. It's little things like WISE making sure that as an ambassador - I am the ambassador for WISE Stand Up for Mental\n\nHealth \u2013 I got support. I had to go to Preston to help one of the guys out. And I said to Matt Lambelle, who is in charge of all this for WISE, I said Matt I have no idea where Preston is.\n\nPreston might as well be the moon as far as I'm concerned. Anyway he turns up one day at a breakfast meeting with a sat-nav for me, just completely out of the blue. And they have gone above and beyond as far as all the performers are concerned as well. Nobody is out of pocket. Every bit of petrol is paid for. Myki cards are paid for. They have made sure that every single person has been looked after, valued and nurtured along the way.\n\nMS: I don't think, listening to what you're saying, that we can underestimate the importance of those words \"valued and appreciated\", can we?\n\nSB: You can't. And this is part of the thing - these people who we've been working with, these nine comedians, are now valued and appreciated. These people have had tough times. They have been through the ringer of the public health system. They have been through long periods of unemployment, through homelessness.\n\nAll of a sudden, there is a whole army of people, a whole organisation, who are behind them at 100 per cent to make them the best person they can possibly be and give them new skills that they never dreamt they could possibly have had before. And they do feel valued and they do feel appreciated, and WISE has done a tremendous job in doing that.\n\nMS: Well you have paid it back a bit too, haven't you? You were telling me when we were having lunch about the reaction of one person that you followed up with, and you followed up with all of them. But suddenly you have gone from being this person in another galaxy to somebody who is mentoring.\n\nSB: That's it. It's interesting that Craig Tolley is the individual who I've been working with probably most closely. And I have found him an amazing guy. He was a guy who worked as one of the cleaners at Clean Force, which was one of WISE's companies. He is a guy who had worked there for four years. For the first two years he didn't speak to a soul. He walked with this head down. He had nothing to do with anybody.\n\nSuddenly he started doing this comedy program. Suddenly he's talking to people. He's alert. He's engaging people. He's part of the whole thing. Suddenly he's valued. He was always a valued work member, but suddenly he is part of the work society and suddenly he is someone who has grown into a whole fresh human being.\n\nI rang him to check on how he was going and to see how he was feeling a week after the big show and to my surprise he was just mesmerised by the fact that I would ring him, that I would follow up and ring him, that somebody who had done what I had done would suddenly follow him up. But from my standpoint, that Friday night where we all performed, I was on the same level as them as far as I'm concerned.\n\nOn that night we were all comedians and we were all doing a job. We are all damaged and we are all on the same level. And I think that is why the guys related to me as well as they did. It's not like I was somebody who was just been brought in. I had a mental illness as well and we spoke about that as a group and they were able to relate to me on those grounds as well as being a performer.\n\nMS: Perfect segue, Steve - your personal story is fundamental here. It is instructive. Can you talk about how you came to be doing this? Your bipolar was undiagnosed for a long time. What is your story - what would you like to say about your story?\n\nSB: My story is probably one that is probably not unfamiliar to the many people have been through a similar thing. I was bipolar but undiagnosed for many years. I was not diagnosed until 2007.\n\nUp until that time, I had had high profile jobs in the media, at Triple M and various places, and had been working under the legacy of crushing lows and mega-highs the whole time, which made me inherently a difficult person to work with. And a terrible person to work with at times.\n\nI can see that now. I can see that I was not pleasant. I can see that I was demanding. I can see there were many different aspects of my behaviour and personality that were very unpleasant. But now I see that I was also very unwell.\n\nI did not realise that at the time. I also know that because of that - because of the illness and because of the way I behaved \u2013 there've been many, many relationships that have been destroyed and that won't be repaired because of the way I behaved, no matter how many interviews I do, no matter how many times I talk about it or try to increase people's awareness of mental illness.\n\nThere is still that thing of well basically he's an arsehole and it's not an illness it's just a personality thing so let's just move on. So I have suffered through that. But my story was that I was diagnosed in 2007, and hospitalised on several occasions. I have gone through several courses of ECT to try to overcome the depression, which has been very successful in my case. I made an attempt on my life in 2011, which was a difficult time to go through for me and my family.\n\nAnd it's here that I point out how lucky I am compared to the nine people that I have been working with. I am lucky in that I have had the very best of everything. I have had the very best of private mental-health care. I have a wonderful wife who supported me through this and without her support I wouldn't be here now.\n\nI could not have got to where I am now in terms of wellness or even being alive if it wasn't for the support of my wife. And I am very lucky in that regard. Whereas the people we have been working with don't have those supports.\n\nThey have been through the rigours of the public system. They have been through all sorts of hell and back personally and professionally and a lot of them haven't worked for 20 years, have been incapable of working. They have gone from homelessness to flop houses and it's been very difficult. My story is complex, but it is a story that has a good outcome compared to many and I am very lucky.\n\nMS: As you have just so clearly put it Steve, families can be so important in providing support and understanding but so many people lack that support. Where else then can people find the sort of ongoing support beyond their encounters with mental-health professionals?\n\nSB: Well I think finding the right mental-health professional in the first place is the right thing. An interesting thing occurred in my life in that when I first met my wife - my wife is Jewish - she introduced me to the world of Judaism and it intrigued me, both from an educational standpoint and from a theological standpoint and from every standpoint imaginable. It was an intriguing religion to me.\n\nSo I embarked on an Orthodox conversion, which was at the height of my illness, so I'm up from work and I'm down from work and I've taken this on as well. This became the guiding force in my life. This became two years of solid study and hard work to complete this Orthodox conversion.\n\nThat was 11 years ago. And I have been a practising Jew ever since and I must confess that that, in spite of my illnesses and everything else, has always been a touchstone for me to fall back upon, regardless. Faith is an interesting thing. Faith can sometimes be as healing as a talk to a psychiatrist. Sometimes you can draw from faith what you can't draw from talking to people.\n\nMS: Can you talk more about what faith means?\n\nSB: Faith to me is a fundamental belief. It is a fundamental feeling. I have faith in my wife and I have faith in my religion. Faith is a feeling of not being alone. It's that feeling of having a touchstone that you can always fall back on if you need an answer. It will always be there for you.\n\nMS: Speaking of always - the future. What is the future for the Stand Up for Mental Health Program? It seems to be gaining support and momentum. There is other stuff coming along, there are more gigs coming. Do you see it as something that can spread?\n\nSB: There is great support already for the guys who have partaken in the program so far. There is a gig coming up at the Shell oil refinery. There are several other gigs in the pipeline. So people are responding.\n\nThe private sector and the public sector are responding to the message that is WISE Stand Up for Mental Health, and that is we can come and talk to you about mental health in the workplace and help you out with that. So that is what has been occurring and those inquiries are still coming in. As far as the program itself goes, I know WISE is looking at exploring it for 2014.\n\nThere will definitely be another class, another group of alumni for 2014. Whether or not that takes place in Melbourne or Sydney or around the country they are not sure yet. But there will definitely be another class for 2014, because although it hasn't exactly been a huge money-making venture for WISE, it has been a great altruistic venture and I think they can see the value in it long term.\n\nMS: As an ambassador and somebody who has been fundamentally involved as a mentor and performer, if somebody is reading this, wanting to be involved, wanting to know more, what should they do?\n\nSB: They can go to the website, which is wiseemployment.com.au\n\nMS: And I will put a link to that with all of this.\n\nSB: So there'll be the link there and they'll be able to see what's going on with WISE Stand Up for Mental Health. They'll be able to see clips of the performers from the night. And they'll be able to get just a general feel for what WISE does sand for what the program is doing in terms of enabling people with mental-health issues.\n\nMS: Of whom, as we have discussed, there are many, so there is a great potential here for a lot of people.\n\nSB: Yes, a lot of people. There is huge potential for a lot of people. It's all about taking that first step. And that was one of the most gratifying things - seeing the people who turned up on that very first day for the very first lesson. They were like timid church mice.\n\nThey turned up and they didn't know what to expect. They were this disparate, damaged group of people, and all they knew was that they wanted to try something. They wanted to try something and they had a message and they had a feeling and they had an illness.\n\nThey wanted to try to expand on that and do something with it in a way that was positive, both for them and for the wider community. And I think they achieved that.\n\nMS: Going back to something you talked about earlier, and it's very raw - you sought to end your own life. And something amazing happened. Something amazing happened, in terms of somebody in California contacting somebody else who contacted somebody else. Can you please tell that story?\n\nSB: I had decided to take my own life. And I had gone to all the trouble of writing a note. I don't have any recollection of it myself now, but apparently it was quite eloquent and had absolutely no doubt about its intent, according to my psychiatrist. I then took a lot of pills and drank a lot of scotch. But before I passed out, I managed to post something on Facebook, which was picked up by a friend of mine in California, who then contacted a friend of mine in Sydney, who then contacted my wife, who then contacted her mother, because she couldn't get to the house.\n\nAnd her mother came to the house and found me on the floor having gashed my head having fallen over and so I was very lucky, very fortunate. And I remember waking up in the Alfred hospital and my first thought was what am I doing here. And the second thought was thank God that did not work.\n\nMS: You have just had your second child. It's a very good continuation of the story, isn't it?\n\nSB: It's a great continuation of the story. The fact that I almost threw away not only a life but a beautiful life with a wonderful woman and a then-three-year-old daughter - and now we have a new child who is 14 weeks old and I am in the best place I have been in a long time.\n\nAnd a lot of that is due to, number one, finding the right doctor and, number two, getting on the right cocktail of medications and, number three, programs like Stand Up for Mental Health, from which I derive as much benefit as the participants do.\n\nMS: The message here involves a little bit the notions of redemption, resurrection and recovery, doesn't it? There is something like that.\n\nSB: It's a Greek tragedy. It is, it's a Greek tragedy. I am in the recovery stage now. And part of that recovery stage was writing an article that I wrote for Radio Today, a radio industry website that was picked up by a journalist from The Age.\n\nBut the redemption part is the hard part. Redemption comes easily for some things. Redemption comes easily for business indiscretions. It comes easily for indiscretions of a sexual nature, or something like that. It doesn't quite come so easily when it comes to mental health. Redemption and understanding are intertwined when it comes to mental health, and it's not that easy to overcome.\n\nRedemption is not so easy. I have attempted redemption and attempted contacting people to try to make amends, not trying to get a job but just trying to make amends and be a good human and it doesn't work out so well.\n\nMS: When you say understanding, do you mean understanding by you or understanding by others, or both?\n\nSB: For others to understand your redemption or to understand you, you really have to understand yourself first. You have to have a clear reconciliation of where you are at and you have to be in a place where you are prepared to take the knock-backs when you attempt reconciliation.\n\nWhen you attempt redemption you have to be prepared to be knocked back. You have to be prepared for failure. And unless you have got yourself in a situation where you can take that failure, where you can actually take that on board and accept it and realise that perhaps some other people can't move on, then you really shouldn't seek redemption.\n\nMS: And in some cases, from what you were saying to me earlier when we had lunch, you understand and accept that for some people they were just too pissed off.\n\nSB: Yeah exactly. I couldn't have put it any better. For some people, the damage that was done was too great and it can't be recovered from. And there were people who will see you citing mental illness as a cop out, as an excuse. But it is not an excuse; it is just something that occurred.\n\nAnd that is part of the problem that mental health education faces at the moment, in that it is so widespread and it is so all-encompassing across all of society that people do see it sometimes as an excuse. They don't see it as a genuine illness.\n\nPeople say 'oh well he's just saying he's depressed'. There're certain illness terms that are thrown about quite candidly now. It's like saying the flu when you have got a common cold. So there are many things we have to be careful about. We have to be careful about how we treat mental illness in society and we have to make sure that everybody is treated equally and valued and treated appropriately.\n\nMS: What is your advice to people who might feel that they might be starting to be unwell?\n\nSB: You have just got to get help. The first thing is to get help. I was in a situation where I probably knew I was becoming unwell, but my sickness was actually an aid to my professional life. The highs of being bipolar enabled me to achieve on a daily basis things that probably couldn't be done normally. Then I would crash.\n\nBut my advice to anybody is if you feel that you're starting to be in the remotest way unwell or not quite right or something is not right in your life or you have a crushing sadness or something is wrong or you're feeling stressed in a great way, you must seek assistance. You must seek assistance.\n\nAnd you might not find the right doctor the first time. It might take two or three times. But keep getting referrals and eventually you will find somebody who you relate to, and having that relationship with a psychiatrist or a psychologist is just as important as anything else in terms of medication or other treatments.\n\nMS: There is this thing in our society, isn't there, about 'well, just suck it up and soldier on', particularly for men, that makes it really problematic, doesn't it?\n\nSB: Yes, it is difficult for the average Australian bloke to admit that they are seeing a psychiatrist. It can be a difficult thing to admit in the wrong circle of friends. It is not something that is easy to admit. And it is not something that is easy to do.\n\nBut, you know what, for your overall mental health and for your overall well-being, and just as equally for the well-being of those around you, you can't be a good father and you can't be a good husband or uncle or work mate if you are labouring under a mental illness. You need to seek that out and get it seen to.\n\nMS: What is your advice then Steve for those who might be worried that somebody they care about or spend time with is becoming unwell?\n\nSB: That is a tough one. It's the elephant in the room. How do you approach something like that with somebody? It's the ones closest to you that notice it that are often the most reluctant to say anything because they don't want to upset you, they don't want to disturb the situation. How to talk to somebody who they think might have a mental illness?\n\nI don't know. Because I don't think anybody ever really spoke to me. I'm sure that my wife at some stage thought that I had some sort of illness. But in many cases is about not wanting to rock the boat or upset the applecart and just to keep things going the way they are and hope things will clear up.\n\nBut my advice would be sit down and have a quiet chat and maybe map out plans. Maybe get together and make a list of behaviours that have been concerning you. Talk to people about that. Make a list and so you've done this on this day and I think this is a concern. Little things like that will make a difference. But just to talk.\n\nMS: So that sort of open-ended 'are you okay' can be a good start?\n\nSP: 'Are you okay' is great. It's a great initiative. And it's a great question, are you okay. The trouble is, being Australians, we just say yes or no. We don't really go into are you okay or not.\n\nBut that initiative, the 'are you okay' initiative, is an important first step. All it takes, and all it needs, is one person to say well actually I'm not. And then suddenly you have got cut through and you have got success.\n\nAnd for every 10 times you ask the question, if you can get two or three people who can actually say that they are not okay, then that is the first step. That initial chat can be an important first step.\n\nMS: It shows someone that they are valued and appreciated, doesn't it?\n\nSB: Exactly. Exactly. You know what, just the fact that somebody even asks that question means you are valued and appreciated.\n\nMS: So your message here, it sounds, would be if you are uncertain take the risk and ask the question carefully and gently but show that you value and appreciate someone you're concerned about and the risk might be that you get a negative reaction, but that is better than not having the conversation.\n\nSB: The conversation is the most important thing. To initiate the conversation, to start the chat, to get the ball rolling, to get somebody to actually open up about what may be wrong with them - it may be something that happened at work and it may be some form of bullying or it may be anything, but whatever it is, to initiate the conversation is the most important thing you can do.\n\nMS: The final question to everyone in The Zone, Steve, is what is the hardest thing you have ever had to do? And given what we have talked about, that may be a gormless question, but what would you say?\n\nSB: The hardest thing, and the easiest thing, are both the same to me. And that is asking somebody for help. The hardest thing I ever did was finally admitting to myself that perhaps my behaviours and my attitudes weren't healthy, weren't healthy for me and weren't helping healthy for others and that I needed help.\n\nAnd so the hardest thing I've ever had to do was go and get help. But once I sat down and spoke to somebody, the hardest thing I had to do turned into the easiest thing I ever did, because it gave me tremendous relief. There was a great relief.\n\nThe first time I sat and spoke to the psychiatrist I see now about my problems and what I was going through and what I was feeling, the relief that I felt, the absolute lifting of the weight, was phenomenal, just being able to sit and unburden myself. It was years of crises and ups and downs.\n\nIt was such an important first step. So I guess, yes, seeking help is the hardest and yet the easiest thing I have ever done.\n\nMS: Steve, thank you for your time today. I wish you and your family a rich and engaged future.\n\nSB: Thank you Michael.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Comment", "application-name": "The Age", "og": {"site_name": "The Age", "description": "Michael Short: Steve Bedwell, welcome to The Zone.", "title": "Full transcript: Steve Bedwell", "url": "http://www.theage.com.au/comment/full-transcript-steve-bedwell-20131124-2y3lb.html", "image": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/2/y/4/f/z/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.2y3lb.png/1385303010627.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@theage", "image": {"src": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/2/y/4/f/z/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.2y3lb.png/1385303010627.jpg"}, "description": "Michael Short: Steve Bedwell, welcome to The Zone.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Full transcript: Steve Bedwell"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Age", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 230318243699378}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theage.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.theage.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Michael Short: Steve Bedwell, welcome to The Zone."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9445\"", "article_summary": "I still think that it is up to programs like Stand Up for Mental Health and other initiatives including from beyondblue and others, to really help destigmatise mental health.\nRedemption and understanding are intertwined when it comes to mental health, and it's not that easy to overcome.\nIt could be mental health.\nCan we start, please Steve, with an overview of WISE Stand Up for Mental Health Program?\nIt doesn't quite come so easily when it comes to mental health."}
