Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, introduced legislation earlier this month aimed at lifting telehealth restrictions in Medicare, inspired in part by Mississippi\u2019s success. The bill would allow Medicare patients to use video conferencing, remote patient monitoring and technology to transfer patient data.\n\nThe proposed legislation is seen as a way to make telehealth services more widely available beyond special projects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supportive of anything that can help us improve access and efficiency of care,\u201d said Dr. Lee Greer, geriatrician who serves as North Mississippi Health Services\u2019 chief quality and safety officer.\n\nTelehealth encompasses a broad range of technology that can connect patients with their health care team or link health care providers with each other. In addition to video conferencing capability, medical instruments have gotten high tech makeovers. Nurses and doctors can listen to hearts, look in ears and throats and examine rashes or wounds from across the state or across the country.\n\nRemote monitoring allows the health care team to closely track patients between visits and coach them on better care for chronic conditions. In announcing the bill, Wicker touted the success of a University of Mississippi Medical Center program for people with uncontrolled diabetes.\n\n\u201cMississippi has actually been a leader in telehealth services,\u201d said Michael Adcock, administrator for UMMC Center for Telehealth.\n\nBoth state and federal legislators have been champions for helping expand telehealth services, Adcock said. Mississippi law requires private insurers to cover telehealth services. Mississippi Medicaid pays for remote patient monitoring.\n\n\u201cWe need Medicare to come along,\u201d Adcock said.\n\nTelehealth in action\n\nEven without broad Medicare reimbursement, providers across the state have found ways to put telehealth services to work.\n\nNMMC-Tupelo has partnered with Baptist Memorial Hospital-Union County to share the expertise of neonatologists using telehealth connections. Now the Tupelo-based system is taking the next step making four specialties \u2013 geriatrics, diabetes care, pulmonology and cardiovascular surgery \u2013 available for telemedicine consultations.\n\nUMMC has 200 sites across the state with access to 35 specialties. The Center for Telehealth\u2019s goal has been to create a collaborative environment so that providers across the state can put high-quality telehealth services into action, Adcock said.\n\n\u201cTelehealth is a very hot topic among people looking for ways to improve health of populations,\u201d Adcock said.\n\nTelehealth is helpful for vulnerable populations like the elderly who may have difficulty traveling beyond their towns or homes to receive care, Greer said. But it also has the capacity to improve access for younger adults, who are crunched for time as they work and care for families.\n\n\u201cTelehealth hits across the spectrum of care,\u201d Greer said.\n\nTelehealth services have the potential to save taxpayers, Wicker said. According to an analysis by the health-care consulting firm Avalere, the bill\u2019s major provisions could save $1.8 billion over 10 years, he said.\n\n\u201cI am encouraged that our telehealth legislation already has bipartisan support, as well as the backing of the medical community and a number of health-care organizations,\u201d Wicker said in a written statement.\n\nmichaela.morris@journalinc.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Michaela Gibson Morris Daily Journal Federal legislation could broaden access to telehealth services in Mississippi and across the country.
