One that will give you an unbiased, no-spin comparison of candidate positions on key issues? That's what our Campus Election Engagement Project guide will give you! We are a national nonpartisan initiative working with college and university administrators, faculty, and student leaders to increase student participation in America's elections. For the 2014 elections we have created and distributed voter guides to campuses in more than 20 states so they can provide their communities with accurate information for informed voting. Because these guides have been so well received and are useful for all voting citizens who want to be better informed, we are also posting them here.\n\nWe developed our guides by analyzing information from trusted resources such as www.votesmart.org, www.ontheissues.org, www.ballotpedia.com, www.politifact.com, www.factcheck.org, www.vote411.org and from candidate websites, public debates and interviews, and statements in major media outlets. We also showed them to groups like campus Young Republicans and Young Democrats at the schools we work with to verify their fairness and lack of bias.\n\nSo here are the issue-by-issue stands for Doug Ducey, Fred DuVal and Barry Hess, with additional links at the bottom for each candidate if you'd like to dig deeper.\n\n----------\n\nEducation: Do you support Arizona's Superior Court ruling to restore $317 million to K-12 education this fiscal year and $1.6 billion over 5 years? ( Background : Since 2010 the state has implemented drastic K-12 funding cuts, ignoring voter-approved Constitutional requirement for automatic annual inflation increases. In 2013 the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the state had shorted public schools and issued a ruling requiring the state to increase public and charter K-12 schools by $317 million this fiscal year and $1.6 billion over five years to restore mandated school funding.
