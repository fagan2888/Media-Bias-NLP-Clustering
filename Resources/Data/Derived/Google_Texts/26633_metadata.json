This would allow voters, not a committee aligned with Communist leadership in China, to pick candidates.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that these demands are unrealistic and will not be met, at least in the short term,\u201d said Chan, 74, who oversaw the civil service as Hong Kong\u2019s second-highest official under British rule and stayed on to lead the transition to Chinese control.\n\nIn the Q&A below, she recommends how the two sides can find common ground, lashes out at Britain\u2019s weak response to the protests, and describes how the democracy fight in \u201clittle Hong Kong\u201d is a concern for the world.\n\nThe Daily Signal: What do you make of the violence that engulfed protest camps last week? Is Beijing activating gangs of criminals known as triads?\n\nChan: It cannot be stressed too strongly that the protests have been remarkably peaceful given the numbers involved, the duration and inclement weather conditions ranging from blistering heat to thunderstorms and torrential downpours. There has been no looting, no vandalism, no damage to property or vehicles. The protesters have cleaned up after themselves, sorted rubbish for recycling and even offered police officers protection from the rain with their umbrellas.\n\n>>>The Empire Strikes Back: China-Controlled Gangs Incite Violence in Hong Kong Demonstrations\n\nThe attacks on the protest camps have clearly been orchestrated, including by criminal \u201ctriad\u201d gangs, but it is hard to see what Beijing would gain by colluding with such action less than 24 hours after Chief Executive C.Y. Leung was forced to agree to direct discussions with the protest leaders. I am certain that Beijing does not want to see a violent end to the current standoff in full view of the world\u2019s media.\n\n\u201cTriad\u201d criminal gangs have led attacks on protest camps, says Anson Chan.\n\nQ: What does Beijing fear about Hong Kong\u2019s ambition for democracy?\n\nA: Beijing is afraid that unless they keep a tight hold on the nomination process there is a risk that Hong Kong people will elect someone as chief executive who will oppose the central government and possibly even press for independence.\n\nModerates in the pro-democracy camp, including myself, have persistently argued that Hong Kong people can be trusted to exercise their vote sensibly and will not elect someone who cannot work with Beijing, but this is a risk they are currently not prepared to take.\n\nIn the wider context, the central government [of China] fears that allowing democratic government in Hong Kong may fuel further unrest in its turbulent autonomous regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, hence the constant reminder that the pace of democratization in Hong Kong must take account of China\u2019s national security and development interests.\n\nQ: How would you analyze the strategy of the protesters?\n\nA: The protesters have been firmly united in their goal to achieve genuinely democratic elections for the next chief executive in 2017 and all legislators no later than 2020.\n\nThe spontaneous nature and speed of escalation of the protests took everyone by surprise, including the organizers of the original \u201cOccupy Central\u2019 campaign, which has now been subsumed within the much wider Occupation Movement.\n\n>>>\u2018We Have a Place in This World\u2019: Hong Kong-Born Merchant Stays Connected to Freedom Fight\n\nI think it is vital that the political parties unite to try to bring together the various groups and agree on a strategy for winding down the protests peacefully.\n\nQ: Could Hong Kong\u2019s business tycoons, considering their connections to Beijing, help broker concessions that might end the impasse?\n\nA: I understand that many leading members of the community, including members of the pro-Beijing business elite, have urged Beijing to show restraint in handling the protests.\n\nUnfortunately, they do not see it as being in their wider interests to broker the sort of concessions the protesters are demanding\u2013such as abolition of the functional constituency system of election, which enables them to wield a disproportionate influence on the workings of the legislature and election of the chief executive.\n\nQ: If neither of the protesters\u2019 demands are met\u2013removal of C.Y. Leung as chief executive and democratic election of his successor without vetting by Beijing\u2013what does winning look like for the protesters?\n\nA: It is clear that these demands are unrealistic and will not be met, at least in the short term.\n\n\u201cIt is clear\u201d that protestors\u2019 basic demands will not be immediately met, says Anson Chan.\n\nIt is therefore imperative that the Hong Kong government offer some concession\u2013and a significant one\u2013that can convince the diehards in the movement that their protest action has not been totally in vain.\n\nSpecifically, the government must make clear exactly how much scope there is, within the parameters of the Aug. 31 NPCSC [National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee] decision [to require vetting of chief executive candidates by a Beijing-influenced nominating committee], to reform the composition of the future nominating committee to make it more genuinely representative of the Hong Kong community and thus more likely to nominate candidates from a range of political backgrounds.\n\nMy group, Hong Kong 2020, has advocated measures to improve the composition of the nominating committee and ensure that the nominating process for candidates follows democratic procedures as required by Article 45 of the Basic Law.\n\nQ: How has Hong Kong\u2019s future turned out differently from what you imagined in 1997 in helping with the handover from Britain to China?\n\nA: In the years leading up to and immediately following the return of sovereignty, I travelled the world in my capacity as head of the Hong Kong Civil Service, lobbying for the support of the international community for the Joint Declaration [the transfer of control to China from Britain].\n\nI was confident that the terms of this internationally binding treaty would be honored by both signatories and sincerely believed that the Joint Declaration and our mini-constitution\u2013the Basic Law\u2013offered the people of Hong Kong a bright and stable future under \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d\n\nI am shocked that, only 17 years after the handover, we are witnessing a concerted attack on the concept of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d by Beijing and its united front affiliates in Hong Kong.\n\nAnson Chan is \u201cshocked\u201d that Beijing is interfering with Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d concept.\n\nThe Central People\u2019s Government\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong now blatantly interferes in matters which should be the sole concern of the Hong Kong government.\n\n>>>The View From China on Hong Kong\u2019s Massive Demonstrations\n\nThis is why the Hong Kong public has no faith in a future nominating committee, which we foresee will be equally vulnerable to Central [People\u2019s] Government manipulation.\n\nFreedom of the press is now being systematically eroded by self-censorship and the sacking of outspoken writers, columnists and broadcasters.\n\nAlmost all of Hong Kong\u2019s major Chinese language newspapers, radio and TV stations are now owned by pro-Beijing tycoons who do not want to offend Beijing.\n\nThe reputation of our police force and world-leading anti-corruption agency\u2013the Independent Commission Against Corruption\u2013are being tarnished by suspicions that their missions have been politicized.\n\nI am also deeply disappointed at the failure of the British government to speak up in defense of the terms of the treaty they signed, even when its terms are so clearly being undermined.\n\nIt seems the lure of trade agreements with China is trumping its legal and moral responsibilities to Hong Kong.\n\nQ: Why should the international community care about what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong?\n\nA: Under the policy of \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d Hong Kong is unique among cities in China in terms of our adherence to the rule of law, the rights and freedoms enjoyed by citizens, a largely corruption-free civil service and a level playing field for business.\n\nAs a result, many countries have huge stakes in our city\u2019s future both in its own right and as a gateway to business and investment in mainland China.\n\nThe terms of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law enable Hong Kong to have a swath of bilateral relationships in its own right. For example:\n\nAccording to the World Investment Report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Hong Kong is the world\u2019s third-largest recipient of foreign direct investment.\n\nSeventy-three of the world\u2019s top 100 banks operate in Hong Kong and we are home to the world\u2019s sixth-largest securities market, second-largest IPO market and fifth-largest foreign exchange market.\n\nOver 100 airlines fly in and out of our airport under the auspices of 67 air services agreements; Hong Kong is the world\u2019s fourth-largest shipping registry.\n\nHong Kong is home to 66 foreign consulates-general and 73 honorary consuls and over 9,000 overseas companies. It has signed visa waiver agreements with 42 countries, double taxation agreements with 35 countries and regions, legal assistance agreements with 35 countries and investment promotion and protectionagreements with 17 countries.\n\nIn short, the international community has a big stake in little Hong Kong\u2013all of which hangs fundamentally on faithful implementation of the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law and the policy of \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d including strict adherence to the rule of law and independence of the judiciary.\n\nIt is important that world leaders lend whatever support they can to the safeguarding of Hong Kong\u2019s current status. This is not interference; it is prudent concern for the protection of their interests.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anson Chan, one of Hong Kong's veteran leaders, is a key figure in seeking a compromise with the pro-Beijing camp on how to elect a new chief executive.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Anson Chan, one of Hong Kong's veteran leaders, is a key figure in seeking a compromise with the pro-Beijing camp on how to elect a new chief executive.", "title": "Hong Kong's Former No. 2 Official on Fight For Democracy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/eyepress079070.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1oRFprT"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Anson Chan, one of Hong Kong's veteran leaders, is a key figure in seeking a compromise with the pro-Beijing camp on how to elect a new chief executive.", "title": "Hong Kong's Former No. 2 Official on Fight For Democracy", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/eyepress079070.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Evergreen Topics", "tag": "Asia,International", "published_time": "2014-10-08T16:17:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hong Kong, protests, Occupy Central, China, Beijing, Anson Chan, chief executive, Triad, Leung Chun-ying, Britain"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bd3\"", "article_summary": "The Central People\u2019s Government\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong now blatantly interferes in matters which should be the sole concern of the Hong Kong government.\nIt is important that world leaders lend whatever support they can to the safeguarding of Hong Kong\u2019s current status.\nQ: What does Beijing fear about Hong Kong\u2019s ambition for democracy?\nHong Kong\u2019s government and student groups leading the protests, which began Sept. 28, agreed to begin talks Friday on the future of democracy in the city.\nQ: How has Hong Kong\u2019s future turned out differently from what you imagined in 1997 in helping with the handover from Britain to China?"}
