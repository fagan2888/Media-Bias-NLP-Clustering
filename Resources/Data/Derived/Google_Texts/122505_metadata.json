Were her eyeglasses close by, but not so close that she\u2019d roll over and crush them in her sleep? Was her phone charged so that its alarm would wake her for school?\n\nSitting on what is now her living room couch, in an apartment near downtown Eugene, Bechtle \u2014 who has bright red hair and dark brown eyes \u2014 recalled her recent experiences.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of mental energy, being homeless,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mental logistics of eating, drinking water, changing my clothes, going to the bathroom \u2014 everything but that base level of need becomes superficial.\n\n\u201cDecisions become simple because they\u2019re all about survival.\u201d\n\nThe problem of K-12 students being homeless has proved intractable and unrelenting, persisting through economic booms and busts. Each year in the past decade, about 700 Eugene School District students have been homeless. The most recent data identified 722 homeless students in the district in the 2014-15 school year, according to the Oregon Department of Education.\n\nIt\u2019s cold comfort that the number of homeless students in the Eugene district isn\u2019t growing, as it is in much of the state. Across Oregon, there were 20,524 homeless students, or about 4 percent of the overall statewide student body enrolled in public schools in 2014-15 \u2014 approximately a 9 percent increase from the previous year, when there were 18,902 homeless students enrolled in public schools throughout the state.\n\nStatewide numbers have fluctuated over the past five years, but the most recent numbers for the 2014-15 school year were record-breaking, the state said. The rise is due in part to a lack of affordable housing and to economic instability for lower-income families, the state said.\n\nAlso, the state has changed its way of counting homeless students, which now requires designated officials to record student identification numbers into a secure system, instead of schools providing counts by grade level. The change may have boosted the count, the education department said.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s numbers brings the homeless student count up to levels not seen since the 2010-11 school year,\u201d Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction Salam Noor said.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the increase was in the number of students identified as \u2018unsheltered,\u2019 meaning they live in vehicles, tents, and other forms of substandard housing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite an improving economy, many Oregon families are still struggling just to meet their most basic needs,\u201d Noor said.\n\nDona Bolt, a homeless-education specialist for the state, said the reviving economy has not helped all pockets of society.\n\n\u201cFor many of our families, the economic recovery has not yet become a reality,\u201d Bolt said. \u201cFamilies are still looking for work, struggling to get by, and trying to provide a sense of stability to their children. It is critical that we all work together to address the complex underlying issues and get more children \u2014 and adults \u2014 into permanent and stable housing.\u201d\n\nThe Great Recession, which lasted from 2008 to 2012, hammered Oregon\u2019s jobs base. Housing costs levelled or dropped, but that was no help to the many people who lost their weekly paychecks.\n\nHundreds homeless locally\n\nNearly 500 homeless students were enrolled in the Springfield School District during the 2014-15 school year, and slightly more than 407 in the Bethel School District in west Eugene.\n\nIn terms of percentage of student body, the Bethel district had the greatest number of homeless students, more than 7 percent of all students. In Eugene and Springfield, it was closer to 4 percent.\n\nDonna Butera, homeless liaison for the Bethel district, said there\u2019s no simple explanation for the higher percentage of homeless students in Bethel compared to Springfield and Eugene.\n\n\u201cIt takes longer for people at lower income brackets to recover from a recession,\u201d Butera said, \u201cSo some people are still trying to recover from falling deep into debt or getting an eviction, or getting their house foreclosed on.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Butera said, in the past several years the district has been more thorough when asking about housing situations and can more easily identify homeless students during registration in the fall.\n\nThe state education department defines homelessness in a number of ways. Students are considered to be homeless if they live at a shelter or a motel, or share space in an unsheltered situation, such as a vehicle, tent or other substandard housing.\n\nStudent homelessness rising\n\nStudent homelessness has been on the rise in Oregon and across the nation for years, Bolt said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been coordinator of this program for nearly 30 years and have yet to see a downward trend in the number of homeless children and unaccompanied youths in the state,\u201d Bolt said. \u201cSchool district liaisons, bus drivers, counselors and other school staff work hard to help these kids and their families, but the numbers keep growing.\u201d\n\nBolt said the rate of student homelessness is much higher in other states, including California and Washington. State education data indicates there were 35,511 homeless students in Washington and 269,663 in California during the 2014-15 school year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not specific to Oregon,\u201d she said. \u201cHomelessness is on the rise everywhere that there\u2019s social and economic struggle, a lack of housing, a lack of way to take care of people in chronic poverty.\u201d\n\nBolt said even climate change is playing a part.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a big factor,\u201d Bolt said. \u201cThe drought in California is pushing people up north to Oregon, and people losing jobs because of a lack of water in California are progressing north in search of a better life.\u201d\n\nDeborah Dailey, homeless liaison for the Eugene district, said the heart of the homeless problem in Eugene is a lack of housing that low-income families can afford.\n\nA substantial increase in such housing \u201cwould be the answer to the homelessness that I see,\u201d she said.\n\nDailey, who\u2019s held her position in the district for eight years, said Eugene is well known for helping the homeless.\n\n\u201cPeople come from all over the United State (to Eugene) because they\u2019ve heard about the services and support in the (school) district,\u201d Dailey said. \u201cThere\u2019s an acceptance of homelessness in Eugene, and they feel it. They show up here and somebody genuinely cares about them and they feel supported.\u201d\n\nThe McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, enacted by Congress in 1987, established the right of homeless youth to have equal access to the same free, appropriate public education provided to other children, Dailey said. The law requires that every district designate a homeless liaison and collect data about homeless children enrolled in K-12 public schools.\n\nReauthorized under the No Child Left Behind Act, the program works to ensure that homeless children are provided with immediate access to education services, despite the lack of a permanent residence, a supervising parent or legal guardian, or records from a previous school.\n\n4.0 grade point average\n\nAdriann Bechtle is one of those students.\n\nBut despite not having a permanent address, a shower or a real bed, Adriann Bechtle maintained a perfect 4.0 grade point average at North Eugene High School during the two months she was homeless. The teenager still has perfect grades and is also considered by school officials to be talented and gifted.\n\nBechtle began taking high school-level math classes at the age of 9, official school transcripts show. \u201cShe was multiplying fractions using different common denominators when she was 8 years old,\u201d Jage Bechtle said of her daughter.\n\n\u201cI did it in the car so I wouldn\u2019t get car sick,\u201d Adriann Bechtle confirmed with a smile.\n\nJennifer Coates, a language arts teacher at North Eugene High School said Adriann Bechtle is one of the brightest students she\u2019s ever had.\n\n\u201cShe was pretty remarkable from the first day she got here,\u201d Coates said. \u201cShe\u2019s in my international baccalaureate langauge and literature class, and we had been studying a set of vocabulary for three or four weeks. The test was the day after she started and I told her she didn\u2019t have to take it, but she did anyway and got 100 percent \u2014 she\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d\n\nCoates said on top of being extremely intelligent, the teenager also has incredible speaking skills, self motivation, and is kind and helpful to everyone in the class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very often that I see a student like this, especially as an 11th grader,\u201d Coates said. \u201cOccasionally I see some of those qualities in other students but she has it all together. She knows herself, she\u2019s incredibly smart and she has such a positive attitude in the classroom. She\u2019s just so wonderful.\u201d\n\nAdriann said she maintains high expectations for herself.\n\n\u201cI really like to learn,\u201d Adriann Bechtle said. \u201cI\u2019m a really curious person and anything I can do to learn something I do. I want to become the best I can be. I try not to compete with other people, only with myself.\u201d\n\nAdriann said she hopes to become a biomedical engineer, an architect, a veterinarian or maybe something else.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of things I\u2019m interested in, and a lot of passions, so I\u2019m not entirely sure what I\u2019ll do,\u201d she said.\n\nA new beginning\n\nWhile Adriann says she\u2019s maintained straight A\u2019s throughout school, she\u2019s relatively new to Oregon.\n\nShe and her mother moved to Eugene from Minneapolis last fall. They were in search of a new beginning in a place where they could grow their own food throughout the year, not trudge through hip-deep snow in the winter, and, most importantly, feel safe.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a different environment, physically, politically, socially and culturally,\u201d Adriann Bechtle said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like how everything was so spread out (in Minneapolis); it wasn\u2019t environmentally friendly.\u201d\n\nThe mother-daughter duo say they faced their share of adversity in the Midwest, ranging from domestic abuse to living on the streets to hospitalizations due to autoimmune diseases.\n\nBoth suffer from a number of health complications, including being severely allergic to a number of foods and ingredients in foods. Both are vegans and say they maintain specific diets to ensure their health \u2014 which complicated almost everything about being homeless.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t eat a lot of the food in the (local) food pantry,\u201d Adriann Bechtle said. \u201cAnd the only thing I can eat at school is the salad.\u201d\n\nBank account drained\n\nSo in August, the two and their small 4-year-old dog, Toastie, a poodle-bichon mix, set out for Eugene to find short-term housing, set up Adriann Bechtle\u2019s schooling and get some leads on work opportunities and community resources.\n\nThe two were on the road for about six weeks, and took some time to explore the area, camping near Cape Perpetua for a week. During that trip, Toastie ate dark chocolate and had to be rushed to the veterinarian.\n\n\u201cWe drove as fast as possible to Florence and she had an emergency vet visit that drained our bank account,\u201d Jage Bechtle said.\n\nThey returned to Eugene where some new friends let them camp in their backyard for a few days. Despite their costly visit to the veterinarian, mother and daughter affirmed that Eugene would be their new home, and found a roommate at a residence in the Churchill area. They headed back to Minnesota to pack their belongings, and Adriann arrived back in Oregon for keeps, via train, on Oct. 14.\n\nUpon their arrival, the two were somewhat surprised by their roommate\u2019s new pet \u2014 an 18-month-old pitbull. Within 24 hours, the dog had attacked Toastie, and the small family knew it had no choice but to move out.\n\n\u201cAnd just like that, we were living in our car,\u201d Jage Bechtle said.\n\n\u2018The car saved our lives\u2019\n\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, Jage and Adriann Bechtle sat sipping tea on opposite pieces of furniture in their living room. Both agreed that if they hadn\u2019t had their Toyota Scion, they would not have survived their period of homelessness.\n\n\u201cI think what saved us was being able to lay down at night,\u201d Jage Bechtle said. \u201cSo many people out on the streets and in shelters don\u2019t necessarily have that luxury.\u201d\n\nThe mother and daughter also said their relationship and respect for one another played an important role.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an introvert,\u201d Adriann Bechtle said. \u201cSo 24/7 human contact is not something I can deal with very well.\u201d\n\nAdriann Bechtle said she used to walk for several miles each night just to have time alone to think and breathe. But other times, she and her mother would take walks together to talk through their stresses and to temporarily escape the confines of their small SUV.\n\nOne major struggle they experienced was the lack of places to park their car at night.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be respectful of those around us,\u201d Jage Bechtle said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to feel like we were intruding or invading their personal space, but I also couldn\u2019t afford to get a parking ticket.\u201d\n\nShe said they found that the south Eugene area seemed to have the most street parking where she felt like she could stay out of the way.\n\n\u2018It exhausts your soul\u2019\n\nThe two are now in an apartment and have a relatively stable life, buying food through the federal food stamps program and paying $333 a month in rent, with the balance of the rent paid by the federal government\u2019s Section 8 program.\n\n\u201cWe searched online using the computers at (the St. Vincent dePaul) First Place Family Center and did a lot of research into rental companies and managers beginning in August,\u201d Jage Bechtle said. \u201cFirst Place even helped us out with our deposit. We called and looked at places as often as we could and asked about future availability.\u201d\n\nAlmost all of their belongings, including a piano, were found in the \u201cfree\u201d section on Craigslist.\n\n\u201cWe moved mostly everything in our car,\u201d Jage Bechtle said. \u201cI\u2019m just really resourceful.\u201d\n\nJage Bechtle said because of her Crohn\u2019s Disease diagnosis and other autoimmune ailments, she also receives a small monthly stipend from Medicaid, and does odd jobs to earn cash.\n\nJage Bechtle said the worst part about being homeless was the constant moving.\n\n\u201cIt exhausts your soul,\u201d the mother said. \u201cYou never feel welcome, you live like you can never stop moving. There\u2019s also a constant fear each night, \u2018Am I going to be able to feed my daughter tomorrow?\u2019 I just had to keep telling myself, \u2018It\u2019s one foot in front of the other, just keep going.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollow Alisha on Twitter @alisharoemeling.
