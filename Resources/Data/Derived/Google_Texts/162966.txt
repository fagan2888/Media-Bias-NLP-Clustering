A number of factors underpin the anti-redistributionist shift in public opinion that I wrote about last week.

First, and perhaps most important, is the emergence of significant resistance to downward redistribution among the elderly, a major voting bloc.

The views of older voters deserve scrutiny. They “worry that redistribution will come at their expense, in particular via cuts to Medicare,” Vivekinan Ashok, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Yale; Ilyana Kuziemko, a professor of economics at Princeton; and Ebonya Washington, a professor of economics at Yale, write in a March 2015 Brookings Institution essay, “Support for Redistribution in an Age of Rising Inequality”— an essay my Times colleague Neil Irwin also discussed in a recent column that asked why Americans don’t want to soak the rich.

In the end, Ashok, Kuziemko and Washington conclude that

the elderly have grown increasingly opposed to government provision of health insurance and that controlling for this tendency explains roughly half of their declining relative support of redistribution.

What the Brookings essay neglects to explore are the material circumstances of over-65 voters that might affect their views on redistribution. Over a third of retirees depend on Social Security for 90 percent or more of their annual income, according to the Social Security Administration. In the zero-sum competition for federal dollars, the cost of major spending programs like the Affordable Care Act has to be made up by spending cuts elsewhere.

The Obama administration has reported that the Affordable Care Act will be financed in part by $716 billion in Medicare cuts over 10 years. Somewhat improbably, the administration also contends that cuts of this magnitude will not reduce services to Medicare beneficiaries.

The decline in support among the elderly in the United States for redistributive social spending stands in contrast to Britain, Germany, Sweden and Australia where Ashok, Kuziemko and Washington found that older people were more supportive of redistribution than those of working age. In most European countries, health care is guaranteed regardless of age, while in the United States, before the enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, only the elderly were guaranteed health coverage through Medicare.

This lends support to the authors’ conclusion that

seniors, a group unique in having guaranteed health insurance during our sample period, may increasingly feel that expansions of redistributive programs could come at their expense.

Further increasing anxiety among the aged in the United States is the shift from defined benefit pensions, which guarantee payments, to defined contribution pensions, which do not.

“Our best assessment is that retirees are falling short and will fall increasingly short over time,” Alicia H. Munnell, Matthew S. Rutledge and Anthony Webb, researchers at Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research, wrote in November 2014.

Munnell, the director of the center, and her co-authors found that from 1983 to 2010 the ratio of total savings to annual income, “a good indicator of the extent to which people can replace their earnings in retirement, has remained virtually unchanged.”

While that may sound comforting, it doesn’t reflect crucial changes in the lives of the elderly. Life expectancy at 65 has steadily increased. Greater longevity compounds the fears that result from the higher risks of defined contribution plans because retirees have to stretch out income and savings for a longer time span.

Chart 1, based on data from the Social Security Administration, tracks life expectancy for men and women at age 65 from 1900 to the present.

“The new demographic transition is a longevity transition: how will individuals and societies respond to mortality decline when almost all of the decline will occur late in life?” Karen N. Eggleston, director of the Stanford Asia Health Policy Program, and Victor R. Fuchs, professor emeritus of economics at Stanford write in a 2012 study. The combination of longer lives and unreliable pension benefits increases retirees’ dependence “on transfers from the working population for living expenses, including large consumption of medical care,” Eggleston and Fuchs note.

Adding to the financial pressures on the elderly, Munnell et al. found that in the 27 years from 1983 to 2010, health care costs under Medicare Part B rose from 6.8 percent of the average 1983 Social Security benefit to 17.0 percent of the 2010 benefit. The decline in interest rates since 2008 has reduced the rate of return on retirement savings, another factor leading to anxiety among seniors.

The Kaiser Family Foundation has data (see chart 2) that shows how even with Medicare, out-of-pocket health costs are larger for over-65 households – both in dollar terms and as a percentage of income – than for younger households:

In other words, the data suggest that the elderly are right to be worried.

A second factor in the declining support for downward redistribution is a shift in the balance of political power at the state and federal levels, away from labor unions and progressive nonprofit interest groups to the corporate sector and politically influential affluent classes.

In his new book, “The Business of America Is Lobbying,” Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, provides insight into a crucial element of this power shift.

Beginning in the early 1970s, just as support for redistribution began to decline, “corporate America began to devote attention and meaningful resources to politics,” Drutman writes. “The 40-year trend has overwhelmingly moved in one direction: growth. Corporate lobbying expenditures now dwarf the comparable investments of unions” and public interest or citizen groups.

From 1998 to 2012, the ratio of corporate/trade association lobbying spending to union/public interest group spending went from 22 to one to 34 to one, Drutman found.

“Looking at lobbying in the aggregate, what jumps out is the stark imbalance in resources. Corporations blow everyone else out of the water,” Drutman wrote in a post on April 16 for the Washington Post’s political science blog, Monkey Cage.
