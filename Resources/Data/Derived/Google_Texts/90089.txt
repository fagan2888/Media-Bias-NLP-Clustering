Columbia Central High School will host the Columbia State Community College choir at the sixth annual Maury County Choral Festival at 6 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 27. The event will also feature elementary, middle and high school choral programs throughout Maury County.

“This year’s festival will have a patriotic theme,” said Emily Gaskill, Columbia State choir director and associate professor of music. “It lends itself well to the mass choir performance during the program’s finale.”

Each participating choir in the festival will perform several choral pieces chosen by their individual choral directors. Members of the Columbia State chorus will join Columbia Central’s choir for a selection of choral pieces.

Participating in this year’s choral festival are Randolph Howell Elementary School, under the direction of Sandi Sanders Wilson; Mt. Pleasant Elementary School, directed by Jill Butler; Highland Park Elementary School, directed by Holly Sanders; Mt. Pleasant Middle School, under the direction of Jill Butler; Culleoka Unit School, directed by Kim Sutton; Columbia Central, under the direction of Susan Manning; and Spring Hill Middle School, directed by Greg Walton.

Spearheaded by Gaskill, Sanders Wilson and Manning, the event has grown in numbers over the past few years and is an opportunity for area choirs to get together and share their talents with each other and with the community at large.

Columbia Central is located at 921 Lion Parkway in Columbia. The event is sponsored by the Lyceum Committee, in conjunction with the music department at Columbia State. The event is free and open to the public.
