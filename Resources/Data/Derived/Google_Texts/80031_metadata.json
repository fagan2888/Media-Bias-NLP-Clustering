Tom Cole (R-Okla.) leveled about how realistic a chance there is for Republicans to erase the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awfully hard to repeal Obamacare when a guy named Obama is president of the United States,\u201d Cole said.\n\nCole was among the 230 members of Congress who voted on Friday to pass a continuing resolution that funds the government through Dec. 15, while defunding Obamacare in the process. But in an interview with the Norman (Okla.) Transcript, Cole explained that he saw Friday's vote as just the first of many steps in reaching an agreement.\n\n\u201cWe expect this will get kicked back to the House, but maybe we can come up with something that delays this for another year,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI\u2019m not naive. I don\u2019t think this will be easy or quick.\"\n\nAmong the steps that Cole does not support is shutting down the government. Back in July, he publicly voiced his reservations, telling MSNBC that it was a \"suicidal political tactic.\" In his interview with the Transcript, Cole stood true to that belief, calling the House CR \"the opening volley in a long tennis match.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History\n\n1 of 17 1912 Former President Theodore Roosevelt champions national health insurance as he unsuccessfully tries to ride his progressive Bull Moose Party back to the White House.
