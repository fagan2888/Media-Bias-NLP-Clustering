The National Right to Life Committee endorsed Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, his re-election campaign announced Monday.

In a letter signed by the organization's directors, the committee commended Fleischmann and thanked him for a 100 percent anti-abortion voting record that includes co-sponsoring the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act last year, his opposition to taxpayer funding of abortion and his votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

"All voters who are concerned with the right to life and with the protection of the most vulnerable members of the human family should vote to return you to Congress so that you can continue to work to advance vital pro-life public policies," the letter of endorsement states.

In a news release, Fleischmann said he was honored for the endorsement.

"There is nothing more important than giving a voice to the voiceless and standing up for the sanctity of human life," he said. "I have stood for the value of life from day one and will continue to do so."

Fleischmann faces challenger Weston Wamp in the Aug. 7 Republican primary for Tennessee's 3rd Congressional District.
