Cheney said that includes what she calls the \u201cwar on coal\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a state we have to end the war on coal. Our economy relies on it and our economy depends upon us being able to roll that back. And that means you\u2019ve gotta be able to stand up on a national stage to get others to understand that the issue of Wyoming coal is not just a Wyoming issue. It\u2019s an issue that effects anybody that likes electricity.\u201d\n\nCheney also wants to repeal and replace the affordable care act.\n\n\u201cWe gotta be concerned about health care in this country, we\u2019ve gotta be concerned about making sure that people have access to insurance. I\u2019d like to see things like competition across state lines. I think that when you give power to the consumer and you force the insurance companies to compete, you\u2019re are clearly gonna get a better value for your dollar. And you are going to put individuals in charge and not insurance companies and certainly not the government.\u201d\n\nCheney said that although Congress is dysfunctional, she said that she is a proven conservative leader with a national voice, and that could make a difference. Current U.S. Representative Cynthia Lummis says she will not seek re-election.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Republican Liz Cheney has made it official, she is running to become Wyoming\u2019s next U.S. Representative.
