Letter: Bill would aid residents with MNsure liens

Sign up for health insurance and lose your property? Thanks to the Affordable Care Act in Minnesota, it’s happening.

Recent news reports found that after signing up for health insurance through MNsure, a number of Minnesota residents had liens placed on their property. A bill I’ve co-authored would correct that.

Through no fault of their own, people are losing portions of their estate to the government. Most aren’t even aware it’s happening. That’s not affordable health care.

Impacted residents had sought health insurance in order to comply with the Affordable Care Act law. MNsure gave them only one option — Medical Assistance — and the residents signed up. Later, they discovered that their insurance would be paid for through liens on their estate after they had died.

The proposal I’m co-authoring would require the reimbursement to the estate of any Medical Assistance recipient aged 55 to 64 who received services, other than institutionalization, retroactive to January 1, 2014. I’m also supporting legislation that requires estate lien notice and consent to be given to residents before they sign up for Medical Assistance services.

“We apparently expect consumers to read the fine print when the lawmakers who crafted and passed this legislation did not. Make no mistake, this is the fault of lawmakers, not consumers, and we need to address it.
