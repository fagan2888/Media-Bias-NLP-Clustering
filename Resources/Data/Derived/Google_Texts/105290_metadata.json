They tend to be about broad issues of national or global concern; upcoming motions include \u201cObamacare is now beyond rescue,\u201d \u201cLabor unions are the enemy of the middle class,\u201d and \u201cRussia is a marginal power.\u201d\n\nWhat we eat is quite arguably a global concern as well, of course, but it\u2019s also highly personal, and about as intimate as you can get.\n\nThe motion itself is not a new notion: Phoebe on the hit TV series Friends advocated it, and that was by no means the first time I\u2019d heard that approach, but I was invited to attend the debate and, never having been to an IQ2 debate, as they\u2019re called, I thought it would be fun to see what they\u2019re all about.\n\nIt was a great discussion by intelligent people positing opposing philosophies, albeit all from the fringes of mainstream society.\n\nThose speaking in favor of eating only faceless things actually went beyond that and advocated for a completely vegan diet.\n\nThey were Neal Barnard, president and founder of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine \u2014 an organization that pushes for a vegan diet any chance it gets, I would argue at the expense of science (I once heard a PCRM lawyer say that dairy causes osteoporosis) \u2014 and Gene Baur, president and co-founder of Farm Sanctuary, which considers the consumption of animals to be flat-out barbaric.\n\nOn the pro-face-eating side were Joel Salatin, the naturalist farmer who was a protagonist in Michael Pollan\u2019s anti-Big Food book The Omnivores Dilemma, and Chris Masterjohn, an honest-to-goodness nutrition scientist, albeit one with a personal grudge against veganism, because he developed some serious health problems when he tried being a vegan (his partner\u2019s a vegan, however, so although a vegan diet might rub his own constitution the wrong way he doesn\u2019t have a problem with others being vegan).\n\nAll of them dismissed mainstream animal husbandry at the outset \u2014 that\u2019s what they and many others call \u201cfactory farming,\u201d which they all seemed to agree was unsound ecologically and bad for human health as well as for the welfare of the animals involved in it.\n\nSo that position by itself put them on the margins of public opinion. I tweeted that the debate was the left vs. the far left, and was chastised by a paleo diet advocate who said Chris Masterjohn wasn\u2019t left wing. Indeed, after looking at some of what he\u2019s written, he\u2019s actually a diligent scientist with no axe to grind that would overwhelm his own desire for scientific rigor.\n\nJoel Salatin laughed at the debate after-party when I suggested to him that he was left wing; he said he was a libertarian.\n\nSo O.K. It\u2019s still fair to say that their views are at the margins of public opinion.\n\nThe IQ2 organizers seemed genuinely shocked and hurt when I mentioned that to them, even though the debate\u2019s program notes state that only 2.5 percent of Americans polled in 2011 claimed to eat no animal products \u2014 a number that sounds high to me. Last time I checked with the American Vegetarian Association, and that was earlier this year, the self-declared vegetarian population was only between 4 percent and 6 percent, and many of those people are unclear on the concept and eat chicken and fish.\n\nAnd of course even non-vegan vegetarians eat butter and eggs.\n\nBut I digress. A lot.\n\nFor the studio audience \u2014 one member of whom accused Salatin of being \u201cspeciesist\u201d \u2014 the debaters seemed like a good fit.\n\nIn fact, the results of the debate, which the audience voted on, bore that out.\n\nBefore the debate started, a full 24 percent of the audience favored not eating things with a face, 51 percent were opposed to not eating things with a face (i.e. they thought it was okay to eat meat) and 25 percent were undecided.\n\nThey were overwhelmingly persuaded by Dr. Barnard and Mr. Baur. A whopping 45 percent were for the motion by the end of the debate, 43 percent were opposed and 12 percent were undecided.\n\nI was flabbergasted, and for a brief moment thought that perhaps I had become a right-wing kook when it came to the consumption of dead animals.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; the pro-motion team made compelling points that animals are bad for you \u2014 contributing to heart disease and cancer \u2014 and that killing animals is mean.\n\nBut I thought the other side did a great job at pointing out that purely vegan diets, health-wise, aren\u2019t for everyone, that the nutrients in animal fat and animal protein are hard to get elsewhere, that saying \u201cdon\u2019t eat anything with a face\u201d is excessively absolutist and that eating animals is part of the natural order of things.\n\nBoth also made good cases, respectively, for the environmental impact of eating meat and the potential sustainability of it if you do it the way Mr. Salatin does.\n\nOf course, you can decide for yourself: watch the debate here.\n\nI wondered how so many people could be persuaded that it\u2019s never okay to eat an animal. Surely they\u2019d heard these arguments before, paid attention when Morrissey, Alicia Silverstone and other big celebrities have explained why they\u2019re vegan, and read the reports of the possible ill effects of eating meat.\n\nAnd then, later that night, as I was drifting off to sleep, I realized that maybe they hadn\u2019t. Of course they hadn\u2019t.\n\nVegans tell me with some frequency that if only I knew what they know about how our food is raised, I\u2019d be a vegan, too. They seem unaware that in the course of my job I visit farms \u2014 even mainstream \u201cBig Food\u201d \u201cFactory Farms\u201d \u2014 poke around, ask questions and hear arguments from all sides about how our food is created. They don\u2019t seem to think that, as someone who has devoted his career to writing about food, I\u2019ve explored these issues all my life, starting when I was four years old and, during a fishing trip, saw a rainbow trout that someone caught get its head deliberately smashed on a rock (deliberately by the smasher, not by the fish, obviously).\n\nI\u2019ve pondered, I\u2019ve wondered, I\u2019ve intellectualized and I\u2019ve concluded that I\u2019m fine not only with eating things with a face, but eating their faces.\n\n\u201cYou must have spent a lot of time in Europe,\u201d a journalist in back of me said when I mentioned that before the debate started.\n\n\u201cAsia,\u201d I said, although I did go to cooking school in France, where the chickens brought into the kitchens still had heads and pinfeathers. I\u2019ve spent more time in Asia, though.\n\n\u201cOh, well they\u2019ll eat anything there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause of the poverty.\u201d\n\nI was being kind of a jerk.\n\nToday I had lunch with a guy who before Thanksgiving took his kids, aged 3 and 5, to the turkey farm to meet their dinner. They looked at it and touched it, and then they went home and they ate it.\n\nI think that\u2019s the way it should be. We should absolutely understand where our food comes from. And if you have a problem with the fact that we raise animals for food, kill them and eat them, then you shouldn\u2019t eat them.\n\nAt the after-party I asked Dr. Barnard about some of his research. I asked politely because I was genuinely curious and am open to learning new things. That might have been why he later said I was a \"future vegan\" \u2014 that eventually I would see the light. Perhaps he assumed my judgment was clouded by the fact that I work for a business-to-business publication that he said is \"skeptical\" of people like him.\n\nI don't think Nation's Restaurant News has any opinion of the PCRM, but I sure do; I\u2019ve expressed it before and I stated it above. Would I be healthier as a vegan? I probably would be. Would I be happier? I doubt it. Giving up all those delicious faces, like the one pictured at the beginning of this blog entry, which I ate at Maialino restuarant in New York City earlier this year, would diminish my capacity for joy, just as eating animals would, I have little doubt, diminish Mr. Baur's joy and that of other members of Farm Sanctuary.\n\nI\u2019m glad the world\u2019s big enough to hold all of us.\n\nDecember 11: This blog entry has been updated to correct typographical errors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don\u2019t eat anything with a face.
