Soon after his diagnosis, Carl became uninsured, and he realized he\u2019d have to face the staggering costs of his treatment on his own. Like Carl, many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans are disproportionately uninsured or underinsured. That leaves millions of LGBT people \u2014 including a significant number of LGBT people of color like Carl \u2014 without access to the affordable care they need to stay healthy.\n\nCarl saw this firsthand when he discovered that a one-month supply of medication cost $1,500. As a result, Carl started doing what too many in his position are forced to do: rationing medication crucial to his treatment.\n\nFortunately, Carl got help from Legacy Community Health Services in Houston, where he signed up for coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Now, he can afford his treatments, and he\u2019s feeling better than ever. Still, there are too many people facing the same challenge, who don\u2019t know a solution is within reach.\n\nThis week is LGBT Week of Action, a chance for government, private, and nonprofit partners to help spread the word about open enrollment to the LGBT community. Increasing access to health care coverage is critical for a community that still faces stigma and challenges in access to both care and health services.\n\nStatistics show that LGBT people are more likely to live in poverty and have more chronic health conditions. And health care means more than just physical care. Because of discrimination and stigma, LGBT people are more vulnerable to mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and substance abuse than non-LGBT people.\n\nMoreover, life-threatening but treatable diseases, like HIV, disproportionately affect the LGBT community. In 2010, only half of gay and bisexual men diagnosed with HIV stayed in treatment for a full year, most likely because they didn\u2019t have a reliable source of care. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, three in 10 gay and bisexual men report that they don\u2019t have a regular physician. Tragically, LGBT Americans are also more likely to postpone medical care because of cost barriers. In fact, nearly half of transgender Americans report having to pause or stop their care when they were sick because they could not afford it.\n\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, preventive health services, annual checkups, and screenings, including HIV testing, are now available to millions of Americans. Insurance companies can\u2019t deny preventive services because of a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. In addition, the ACA has provided one of the largest expansions of mental health and substance use disorder coverage in a generation.\n\nThanks to the Obama administration and the work of many dedicated organizations working with the LGBT community, nearly 18 million Americans, including people like Carl Anderson, can finally receive necessary health care. But too many LGBT people are still living without access to the medical coverage that could change their lives for the better. It\u2019s time to take action.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have health insurance, or if you have a friend or loved one who needs health insurance, visit HealthCare.gov or CuidadoDeSalud.gov to shop for quality, affordable health coverage. Enrolling is easier than ever, whether over the phone, online, or in person. You can call (800) 318-2596 for confidential assistance at any hour of the day, in English or Spanish.

In fact, more than seven in 10 returning Marketplace customers will be able to buy a plan for $75 or less a month in premiums after tax credits. But to ensure that you\u2019re covered starting in January, you must sign up by December 15.\n\nHealth coverage matters, for ourselves, our loved ones and our communities.
