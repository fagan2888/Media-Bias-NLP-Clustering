That when the system is so big, so unwieldy, so out of control, it\u2019s impossible to manage all of those elements, and something\u2019s going to fall through the cracks.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s not just costing American taxpayers, it\u2019s costing American lives.\n\nSo if Republicans are smart, they\u2019ll make Democrats in 2014 and 2016 answer not only to individual scandals, but to the larger question of \u201cWhere is your big government bureaucracy actually servicing the American people?\u201d And I think Democrats are going to have a very tough time defending against that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is government bureaucracy too large and unwieldy to be effective?
