Texas legislators push their own beliefs on women

Re: "Texas hard on poor women," April 28

Texas is hard on poor women, and hard on those speaking scientific truth as to the impact of denying access to Planned Parenthood.

Long term birth control access is fundamental to a household's moving out of poverty. Study after study after study supports this contention. Yet, the legislators continue to push their version of what is correct, thereby appropriate, on every Texan.

The failure to expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act was nothing short of absurd. Leaders chose instead to impose their own beliefs, attitudes and values on poor women. Poor Texas women ill prepared to challenge any aspect of this denial.

Persecuting a public servant, a trained scientist at that, for performing an admirable job is not surprising ... in Texas.
