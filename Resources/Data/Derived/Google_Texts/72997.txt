National Chain Pharmacies: Expanding Community Care

Aimee Simone, Associate Editor

More and more patients are seeking primary care as the population continues to age and more patients are granted access to health care services through the Affordable Care Act. At the forefront of these changes is community pharmacy, adapting to meet the complex needs of patients in an overburdened health care system.National pharmacy chains, such as Walgreens, Rite Aid, and CVS Health, are working to shift the focus of pharmacy, with the overall goal of improving the health and wellness of their patients. In that expanded care role, pharmacists are impacting patient care through counseling, medication therapy management (MTM), and various disease state management initiatives.“Walgreens community pharmacists help people get, stay, and live well by practicing at the peak of their profession,” said Anthony Vega, health care recruiter at Walgreens. “Our pharmacists focus on building relationships with patients by working in an environment that allows the pharmacists to be more accessible to provide counseling and additional health services in the communities we serve.”Pharmacists at CVS Health play a similar role in helping patients manage their health.“At CVS Health, our purpose is helping people on their path to better health, and our pharmacists play a critical role in doing so, each and every day,” said Papatya Tankut, RPh, vice president of pharmacy affairs at CVS Health. “Our pharmacists not only dispense medications, they are also trusted resources for patients. They are focused on getting patients their medications when they need them, making sure patients take their medications properly, informing them about possible side effects, and helping them understand their condition. Additionally, our pharmacists play an integral role in providing easily accessible health care services, such as immunizations and vaccinations, when it’s convenient for patients. They are the frontline of health care.”Likewise, Rite Aid believes that pharmacists are an integral part of the health care team.“We see our pharmacists as an important member of the health care community who, with doctors and nurses, help to guide a patient toward improved health care outcomes,” said Scott Jacobson, Rite Aid vice president of pharmacy operations. “At Rite Aid, we have a laser-like focus on improving patient outcomes through medication adherence and compliance.”In addition to MTM and other adherence programs, chain pharmacies are expanding the specialized services they offer their patients, leveraging the pharmacists’ position as the most accessible health care provider.“The future of pharmacy will be more service driven, and Rite Aid is actively developing unique programs and services to ensure that we are able to continue meeting the health and wellness needs of our customers,” Jacobson said.
