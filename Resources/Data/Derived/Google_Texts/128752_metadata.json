As discussed in our Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) overview, manufacturers participating in international business must be mindful of this federal law. Though many are aware of the FCPA, some do not understand its breadth and depth. Below is a bare-bones breakdown of the FCPA\u2019s scope. While the below outline will help readers understand future posts about FCPA defenses, penalties, and compliance, the FCPA contains many nuances, so you should consult legal counsel to analyze specific facts and circumstances.\n\nWho is Subject to the FCPA?\n\nGenerally speaking, the FCPA applies to \u201cdomestic concerns\u201d and \u201cissuers.\u201d \u201cIssuers\u201d generally refers to \u201cpublic companies.\u201d If a domestic or foreign company is either (1) traded on a national stock exchange or (2) traded on the over-the-counter market and required to file periodic reports with the SEC, that company is an \u201cissuer\u201d within the meaning of the FCPA.\n\n\u201cDomestic concerns\u201d can be individuals or business entities. For individuals, a domestic concern is any U.S. resident, national, or citizen. For companies, a domestic concern is one (1) organized under the laws of the United States or one of its states, territories, possessions, or commonwealths or (2) maintaining its principal place of business in the United States.\n\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\n\nThe FCPA contains two main thrusts\u2014anti-bribery provisions and accounting provisions. The former prohibits willful and corrupt bribes to \u201cforeign officials\u201d made for \u201cobtaining or retaining business.\u201d Not surprisingly, courts interpret that language broadly.\n\nTo violate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery provisions, a domestic concern or issuer must directly or indirectly pay or offer to pay anything of value to a foreign official to obtain or retain business. Also, any person or entity that violates the FCPA on United States\u2019 soil may be prosecuted under the FCPA.\n\nAnything of value essentially means what it sounds like. It goes well beyond a suitcase full of cash. Examples include, but are not limited to, cash, gifts, payment of expenses, services, entertainment, payment for medical treatment, loans, or jobs for third-parties.\n\nForeign officials include government representatives, governmental departments, political parties, officials of political parties, and candidates for political office. Moreover, a bribe made to a third person may violate the FCPA if the person making the payment knows, or disregards red flags, that the payment, or part of the payment, is given to a foreign official.\n\nBooks and Records and Internal Control Provisions\n\nTo supplement the anti-bribery provisions, the FCPA also imposes financial reporting requirements on issuers. In particular, the FCPA requires issuers to maintain accurate books and records that reflect in reasonable detail\u201a accurately and completely\u201a transactions and asset dispositions. The FCPA also requires that the \u201cissuer\u201d establish effective systems of internal controls that provide \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of the following:\n\nTransactions are authorized by management;\n\nTransactions are recorded properly;\n\nAssets are accessed with authorization by management; and,\n\nRecorded assets are compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals.\n\nNo specific internal controls are required, which provides some flexibility. However, an effective FCPA compliance program is a critical component of \u201ceffective\u201d systems of internal controls.\n\nThis post covers the basics of the FCPA\u2019s scope.
