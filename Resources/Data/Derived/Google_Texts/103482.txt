Two New York representatives were among the 14 Republicans who broke with the party to vote against a budget bill that was passed by the House of Representatives on Thursday night.

The bill increases defense spending and cuts social welfare spending and seeks to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

The bill passed 226-197, along mostly partisan lines, with the 14 Republicans joining every Democrat in opposing the bill.

The two New York Republicans who voted against the bill were Chris Gibson and John Katko, who each represent districts upstate.

Gibson represents the 19th congressional district, which encompasses the northern Hudson Valley. He has said he will not seek reelection in 2016 and has been traveling the state to help to boost Republican chances to win statewide office. He is thought to be considering statewide office himself, but when asked has only said he has not ruled it out.

"We need a budget that replaces sequester with pro-growth, fiscally responsible policies that create jobs and guide us back to a balanced budget," Gibson said in a statement. "Unfortunately, this budget codified the sequester. Still, I’m hopeful that as the year unfolds we’ll reach another bipartisan agreement like the Ryan-Murray budget we enacted in December 2013 that replaced sequester for two years. Such a budget would better reflect the priorities of NY-19, our state, and the nation."

Katko is in his first term representing a swing district in central New York, which includes Syracuse. He defeated incumbent Democrat Dan Maffei in 2014 and the district is likely to be a Democratic target in 2016.

Katko's office did not responded to a request for comment on his vote.
