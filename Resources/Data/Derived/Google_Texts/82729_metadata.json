A full staff is scheduled for 12-hour shifts, beginning at 9 p.m.\n\nAll interstate routes, primary bridges, high-volume secondary bridges and known trouble spots are being pretreated with brine in Abbeville, Anderson, Greenwood, Laurens and Newberry counties in District 2.\n\nOfficials said District 2 will be staffed with a full night shift beginning at midnight. The weather in these counties is expected to turn to rain by 10 a.m. on Monday with temperatures around 40 degrees, so the SCDOT said they do not think any additional shifts will be necessary in District 2.\n\nCherokee County is in District 4, and crews are pretreating roads there until dark. They are touching up areas along interstates and primaries, and critical areas like bridges and hospital access roads.\n\nCopyright 2016 FOX Carolina (Meredith Corporation).
