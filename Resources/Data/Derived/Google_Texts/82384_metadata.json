Under a Trump administration, the US would look less like the world\u2019s policeman, and more like the world\u2019s rent-a-cop.\n\nTrump has been making many Americans nervous for months now, with speeches that stir up racial and religious animosities and policy pronouncements in areas like immigration and international trade that don\u2019t mesh with either actual or political reality.\n\nRelated: New Levels of Chutzpah from Trump in DC\n\nIn recent weeks, the worry about Trump as a potential president has infected US allies. Diplomats contacted by the Washington Post recently confessed deep concerns about how their country\u2019s relationships with the US would survive a Trump presidency.\n\nYesterday, as though determined to bring that simmering concern to a rolling boil, Trump suggested that the United States needs to back off its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the mutual defense association that has largely kept the peace in Europe since the end of the Second World War.\n\nWhile he didn\u2019t go as far as suggesting that the US actually withdraw from the alliance, he sent mixed signals in interviews with the Washington Post editorial board and then later, in an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer about what he thinks the US commitment to the alliance ought to be.\n\n\u201cNATO was set up at a different time,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cNATO was set up when we were a richer country. We\u2019re not a rich country. We\u2019re borrowing, we\u2019re borrowing all of this money\u2026 NATO is costing us a fortune and yes, we\u2019re protecting Europe but we\u2019re spending a lot of money.\u201d\n\nRelated: Arizona and Utah Provide First Big Test of the \u2018Stop Trump\u2019 Movement\n\n\u201cNumber one, I think the distribution of costs has to be changed. I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved. And I think we bear the, you know, not only financially, we bear the biggest brunt of it.\u201d\n\nWhile the US does shoulder the largest share of the burden for funding NATO, the cost is not as overwhelming as Trump seemed to suggest. The roughly 22 percent of NATO $2.1 billion in operating costs that the U.S. provides came to less than half a billion dollars in 2016.\n\nNATO\u2019s operating expenses don\u2019t tell the whole story \u2013 or even most of it. The largest expense incurred by member countries is related to the deployment of troops. But even there, the amount the US spends on helping to defend Europe, while large, is only a tiny sliver of the overall defense budget.\n\nThe Defense Department last month announced that it would ask Congress to quadruple the amount of money it spends on its European Reassurance Initiative, which aims to keep a \u201cpersistent air, land, and sea presence\u201d in the region. The increase is primarily in response to the growing aggressiveness of Russian in the east. Even that fourfold increase would bring spending on the project up to only $3.4 billion in 2017 \u2013 less than one percent of the total US Defense budget.\n\nRelated: Tuesday Primaries Could Push Trump to Do the Unthinkable: Ask for Help\n\nIn both interviews yesterday, Trump repeatedly returned to the idea that the US ought to be financially compensated for providing protection to its allies around the world.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re treated fair,\u201d he said in his interview with the Post. \u201cYou know, South Korea is very rich. Great industrial country. And yet we\u2019re not reimbursed fairly for what we do. We\u2019re constantly, you know, sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games, doing other. We\u2019re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.\u201d\n\nTrump continued, \u201cIf you look at Germany, if you look at Saudi Arabia, if you look at Japan, if you look at South Korea \u2014 I mean we spend billions of dollars on Saudi Arabia, and they have nothing but money. And I say, why? Now I would go in and I would structure a much different deal with them, and it would be a much better deal.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tendency to see everything in transactional terms appears to extend to the issue of international security. Under a President Trump, it seems, the US would not pursue global stability and international peace as goods in themselves, but rather as things that are optional \u2013 worth having, but only if the price is right.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump yesterday in different interviews lai", "title": "Trump: Turn US Military into the World\u2019s Rent-a-Cop", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/22/Trump-Turn-US-Military-World-s-Rent-Cop", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-women_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/22/Trump-Turn-US-Military-World-s-Rent-Cop", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-women_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump yesterday in different interviews lai", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Under a Trump administration, the US would look less like the world\u2019s policeman, and more like the world\u2019s rent-a-cop.\nI think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved.\nRelated: New Levels of Chutzpah from Trump in DCIn recent weeks, the worry about Trump as a potential president has infected US allies.\nDiplomats contacted by the Washington Post recently confessed deep concerns about how their country\u2019s relationships with the US would survive a Trump presidency.\nRelated: Tuesday Primaries Could Push Trump to Do the Unthinkable: Ask for HelpIn both interviews yesterday, Trump repeatedly returned to the idea that the US ought to be financially compensated for providing protection to its allies around the world."}
