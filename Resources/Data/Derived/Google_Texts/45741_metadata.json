His second bid for the White House ends as a failure, if not in nearly as dramatic of fashion.\n\nThe former Texas governor announced the immediate suspension of his campaign during a speech at the Eagle Forum in St. Louis, Missouri this afternoon.\n\nPerry invoked his faith before announcing he was suspending his campaign, calling it a privilege to speak with the American people. Perry promised he had no regrets about his decision. As Salon\u2019s Simon Maloy noted earlier this week, Perry did\u2019t have much of a choice:\n\nIn the past few weeks, Perry\u2019s campaign has imploded. He was booted from Fox News\u2019 main-stage debate at the last minute by a surging John Kasich, and then got upstaged at the kids-table debate by Carly Fiorina. He\u2019s been unable to convince anyone to give him money, and so he had to stop paying his staff, who have understandably decamped for campaigns that are in stronger financial shape. His New Hampshire operations have gone completely dark, and he\u2019s down to one paid staffer in Iowa. The only thing keeping this corpse of a campaign twitching is Perry\u2019s relatively well-funded super PAC, which for now is providing the things a campaign needs to actually function: advertising, warm bodies, etc.\n\nCalling 2016, \u201cthe most important election in our lifetime,\u201d Perry praised the now dwindled field of 16 Republicans as the \u201cbest in a generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI step aside knowing our party is in good hands,\u201d Perry argued, praising his former Republican rivals.\n\nPerry then got emotional and in a sing-songy manner, implored the conservative activists in the room to mold America after \u201cthe limited government freedom state pioneered in places like Texas\u201d without succumbing to the darker right-wing xenophobic voices in the Republican Party, calling it the \u201cseason of cynical politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Perry becomes the first of 17 Republican candidates to \"suspend\" his 2016 bid", "title": "Rick Perry becomes first candidate to drop out of presidential race", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Perry becomes the first of 17 Republican candidates to \"suspend\" his 2016 bid", "title": "Rick Perry becomes first candidate to drop out of presidential race", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/11/rick_perry_becomes_first_candidate_to_drop_out_of_presidential_race/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/perrys-indictment.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Perry becomes the first of 17 Republican candidates to \"suspend\" his 2016 bid", "title": "Rick Perry becomes first candidate to drop out of presidential race", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/perrys-indictment.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@@SophiaTesfaye", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sophia Tesfaye", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 campaign, 2016 Elections, 2016 Republican primary, Rick Perry, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb830\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 campaign, 2016 Elections, 2016 Republican primary, Rick Perry, Video, Elections News, News, Politics NewsRick Perry made it final.\nAs Salon\u2019s Simon Maloy noted earlier this week, Perry did\u2019t have much of a choice:In the past few weeks, Perry\u2019s campaign has imploded.\nPerry invoked his faith before announcing he was suspending his campaign, calling it a privilege to speak with the American people.\nHis second bid for the White House ends as a failure, if not in nearly as dramatic of fashion.\nThe former Texas governor announced the immediate suspension of his campaign during a speech at the Eagle Forum in St. Louis, Missouri this afternoon."}
