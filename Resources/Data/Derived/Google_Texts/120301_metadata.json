State television coverage is wallpapered with his signature slogans, and his every pronouncement and meeting with foreign dignitaries leads the nightly news broadcast.\n\nNot one, but two books collect Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s speeches and favorite classical Chinese allusions - highly unusual in that they have been published so early in his tenure instead of after his retirement.\n\nBarely two years into office, Xi has attracted an extraordinary degree of attention to his public persona that veers perilously close to a full-blown personality cult. Such a phenomenon has not been seen since the days of Mao Zedong, with successors wary of the turmoil his leadership unleashed and generally favoring a dry, rule-by-consensus approach.\n\nWhile the attention on Xi reflects his popularity with the public, it\u2019s also a sign of how thoroughly he\u2019s consolidated power by sidelining or reducing the influence of rivals in the ruling Communist Party. Like Chairman Mao, Xi even has a popular personal sobriquet: \u201cXi Dada,\u201d roughly translated as \u201cDaddy Xi.\u201d\n\nThe son of a party elder, Xi has always had a sense of destiny about himself, say observers and those who knew him as a younger man, believing that he and others in the \u201csecond red generation\u201d are the rightful inheritors of the communist state.\n\nThe portly, round-faced Xi isn\u2019t about to replace the portrait of Mao hanging from Tiananmen Gate in the heart of Beijing. But he\u2019s becoming more and more of a ubiquitous presence in Chinese life, and a nearly unstoppable force behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if Xi is saying, \u2018It\u2019s my party and I\u2019ll have it the way I want to,\u2019\u201d said June Teufel Dreyer, a China politics expert at the University of Miami.\n\nXi is front-and-center again as the national legislature holds its annual session in Beijing, seated in the heart of the vast Great Hall of the People and meeting with delegates from across the sprawling nation. The National People\u2019s Congress session, which opened Thursday, includes a report summarizing the accomplishments of the past year and laying out the agenda for the next 12 months.\n\nFormally, Xi\u2019s power is derived from his three main titles as Communist Party secretary-general, president of the People's Republic of China and chairman of the Central Military Commission that controls the 2.3 million-member armed forces, the world\u2019s largest standing military.\n\nYet, he has significantly augmented his authority by heading up a long list of leadership panels on key issues from the economy to Internet policy, leaving Premier Li Keqiang, supposedly his partner in governance, a much diminished figure. Xi even established a new national security council with himself as chairman, a feat attempted but ultimately abandoned by his predecessors.\n\n\u201cWe certainly see an attempt to cultivate a personality cult, and this is only natural because he wants to concentrate power in his hands, to have the momentum and the political force in order to promote his program,\u201d said Joseph Cheng, chair of the political science department at the City University of Hong Kong.\n\nAn imposing personal presence may be a prerequisite for shoving through Xi\u2019s ambitious agenda. With planning and patience, Xi has prosecuted a sweeping anti-corruption crackdown that has ensnared top generals and party officials. He\u2019s injected China into world events where former leaders feared to tread, struck a bold climate agreement with the U.S. and launched a sweeping vision for a \u201cNew Silk Road\u201d linking China to markets in western Asia.\n\nThat authority seems to have given him and his close supporters the confidence to spread his personal maxims, pronouncements and policies as far as they can go.\n\n\u201cI think it is all kind of somewhat more reflective of the leadership style under Mao Zedong or (successor) Deng Xiaoping, as compared to anything we\u2019ve seen more recently,\u201d former U.S. ambassador to Beijing Jon Huntsman said at a recent Council on Foreign Relations forum in Washington.\n\nEfforts to boost Xi\u2019s image were underscored at last month\u2019s nationally televised Lunar New Year gala, with his political themes, particularly his concept of the \u201cChinese Dream,\u201d saturating the cavalcade of skits, songs and filmed segments. In one highlight, performers crooned a syrupy musical tribute titled \u201cI Give You My Heart\u201d in front of film clips of Xi handing out blankets, chatting with farmers and otherwise humbly serving the Chinese people.\n\nXi\u2019s pet slogan also made it into the final applause line of Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s annual address to the national legislature on Thursday, in which he told delegates that achieving the year\u2019s goals would help realize \u201cthe Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\u201d\n\nState broadcaster CCTV\u2019s nightly coverage of Xi\u2019s events include meetings with visiting dignitaries no matter how obscure. His visits to other cities and rural areas, meanwhile, are packaged in a manner reminiscent of European propaganda of the 1930s.\n\nXi\u2019s hosting of President Barack Obama and other world leaders at last year\u2019s meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Beijing was a particular showcase of his glitzy, personality-driven diplomacy. On the evening before the summit, CCTV ran hours of coverage of Xi greeting visiting heads of state at an elaborate banquet, joined by glamorous wife Peng Liyuan, a former diva with a military song and dance troupe, who often accompanies him on high-profile visits abroad.\n\nA major military parade planned for the 70th anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender at the end of World War II on Aug. 15 offers a further opportunity to place Xi front and center.\n\nPredecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao also presided at military parades, but only in the twilight of their terms in office, points out Willy Lam, a Chinese politics expert at Hong Kong\u2019s Chinese University. By associating himself so early with such powerful images, Xi is showing that he sees himself as China\u2019s third major leader after Mao and Deng, Lam said.\n\n\u201cThe cult of personality around Xi is being built at full throttle, and Xi himself is responsible for this,\u201d Lam said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to ridiculous levels.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Xi has sought to burnish his credential as a man of the people, appearing unannounced at a Beijing dumpling stall, kicking around a football and carrying his own umbrella. Such poses shouldn\u2019t be confused with candor or accessibility, however: Xi almost never speaks to journalists and his personal life remains largely off-limits to the media.\n\nAnd unlike Mao, Xi shows no sign of directly appealing to the public to join him in any political campaigns - as with the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution era in which Mao appealed to the masses to help him purge China\u2019s establishment of reactionaries. On the contrary, Xi\u2019s administration has made it clear that the party - and only the party - must be in control, and has squashed any efforts of citizens to mobilize, even on behalf of priorities that the party has professed, such as fighting corruption among officials or improving education.\n\nAn early indication of Xi\u2019s rising stature was the publication last November of \u201cXi Jinping: The Governance of China,\u201d a 500-page volume of his collected speeches, talks, interviews, pronouncements and correspondence, with photos of him with his family, meeting world leaders, and carrying out the duties of head of state and chief of the armed forces.\n\nChinese leaders regularly publish such tomes, but only well after they\u2019ve left office.\n\nA more recent volume tracks Xi\u2019s use of classical Chinese allusions in his public statements. Published by the party\u2019s flagship newspaper, the People\u2019s Daily, \u201cXi Jinping Uses the Classics\u201d cites 135 examples on topics from law to self-cultivation, drawn mainly from works associated with the ancient sage Confucius, as well as Song-dynasty administrator and literary figure Su Dongpo.\n\nXi\u2019s image is also branching out into the arts. In February, 12,000 applicants to the Beijing University of Technology\u2019s art program were required to sketch a portrait of the leader in pencil and charcoal as part of their entrance exam. Students told reporters they could draw Xi practically from memory after seeing his face all over the media.\n\nNo matter to what comfort level Xi consolidates his power, experts see little chance he\u2019ll use his clout to implement democratic reforms that might challenge the party\u2019s predominance.\n\n\u201cXi is actively trying to rein in precisely those elements of Chinese socio-political life - intellectual pluralism, popular participation, institutional checks and balances - that most of us would see as necessary for generating a more open, participatory political system,\u201d Boston University China expert Joseph Fewsmith said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "His smiling visage beams from decorative plates and plastic trinkets sold in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
