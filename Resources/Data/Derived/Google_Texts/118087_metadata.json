Sarah Palin (R) said Thursday night it is \"cool\" David Letterman announced he would retire sometime next year.\n\nPalin, who had a dustup with the late-night host while running for vice president in 2008, said maybe he would be starting a trend that extended into the political arena.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Well it's cool, you know, out with the old, in with the new,\" she said on Fox News. \"Maybe he'll start a trend when we talk about politics too \u2014 politicians who have maybe been in Washington, D.C., a bit too long, allow some new blood in there.\"\n\nLetterman announced during a taping of \"Late Show With David Letterman\" Thursday that he would step down in 2015 after more than 20 years on the show. He is the longest running late-night host.\n\nIn 2009, Letterman apologized multiple times for a joke about Palin's teen daughter, which sparked outrage while she was running on the GOP ticket with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).\n\nAt the time, Letterman said he mixed up Palin's two daughters when he joked that one of them was \"knocked up\" by Alex Rodriguez while attending a Yankee game. The joke was meant to be directed at Palin's older daughter; however, her 14-year-old daughter at the time was the one who attended the game.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Palin had a dustup with the late-night host while running for vice president in 2008.", "description": "Palin had a dustup with the late-night host while running for vice president in 2008.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Palin had a dustup with the late-night host while running for vice president in 2008.", "title": "Palin on Letterman retirement: 'Cool'", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/202649-palin-on-letterman-retirement-cool", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/palin.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-04-04T12:03:11-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/202649-palin-on-letterman-retirement-cool", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Palin had a dustup with the late-night host while running for vice president in 2008.", "card": "summary", "title": "Palin on Letterman retirement: 'Cool'"}, "dcterms.modified": "2014-04-04T12:03-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/202649-palin-on-letterman-retirement-cool", "dcterms.date": "2014-04-04T07:57-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Sarah Palin, David Letterman,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-04T07:57:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-04T12:03:11-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Palin on Letterman retirement: 'Cool'"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd910e\"", "article_summary": "Sarah Palin (R) said Thursday night it is \"cool\" David Letterman announced he would retire sometime next year.\nLetterman announced during a taping of \"Late Show With David Letterman\" Thursday that he would step down in 2015 after more than 20 years on the show.\nHe is the longest running late-night host.\nADVERTISEMENT\"Well it's cool, you know, out with the old, in with the new,\" she said on Fox News.\nIn 2009, Letterman apologized multiple times for a joke about Palin's teen daughter, which sparked outrage while she was running on the GOP ticket with Sen.
