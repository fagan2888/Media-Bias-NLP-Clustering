The state has been talking with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services about the request and expects to restart discussions \u201cin earnest\u201d in the next two weeks now that the waiver has been officially submitted, said Nick Lyon, director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic\u201d the waiver will be approved, Lyon told the News on Tuesday.\n\nIf the federal agency rejects Michigan\u2019s request, the expanded Medicaid health program would end by April 30.\n\n\u201cWith nearly 600,000 Michiganders receiving Healthy Michigan Plan benefits, this is a program that makes a real difference in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Gov. Rick Snyder said in a statement.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that oversees the federal Affordable Care Act \u2014 has until the end of the year to make its decision.\n\nThe program provides Medicaid health coverage to adults with incomes between 100 percent and 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or roughly $12,000 for one person.\n\nMichigan wants to require its Medicaid customers to make a choice after 48 months on whether to purchase a policy on the health insurance exchange at HealthCare.gov, or start contributing up to 7 percent of their income to remain on the state\u2019s Healthy Michigan Plan. Lawmakers adopted these requirements as part of the compromise Medicaid expansion legislation that squeaked through the Senate two years ago.\n\nFederal officials have been concerned because the Affordable Care Act allows only those people without health insurance to purchase coverage through the health insurance exchange, said Michigan Medicaid Director Steve Fitton. Under Michigan\u2019s law approved in August 2013, people could try to purchase coverage at HealthCare.gov while still insured by the Healthy Michigan Plan.\n\nAnother issue is the increase on the cost-sharing rate to 7 percent. The federal Medicaid center has capped cost-sharing at 5 percent in other states.\n\nThe Obama administration approved a waiver in December 2013 allowing Michigan to charge recipients from 3-5 percent of their income for coverage, depending on their earnings. A resident with an income of $12,000 annually would contribute 3 percent, or $240 annually.\n\n\u201cWe certainly pushed the boundaries with our first waiver,\u201d Lyon said.\n\n\u201cI think these (waiver) requests are unique,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are something we just will need to work through. We will need to see what kind of middle ground there is.\u201d\n\nRepublican state lawmakers insisted on the cost-sharing requirements because the federal government will gradually stop paying for all of the cost of the health coverage after 2017.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has said it has a policy of not commenting on \u201cwaiver requests that are pending or under review.\u201d\n\nMarianne Udow-Phillips, director of the Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation at the University of Michigan, has said it\u2019s in the Obama administration's interest to approve Michigan\u2019s waiver request.\n\n\u201cIf (Obama officials) don\u2019t grant a little more flexibility that helps make the program work and the Michigan program falls apart, they just lost one of their shiny examples of success,\u201d Lansing consultant John Truscott, who sometimes works on health care issues, told The News in April.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1FgN0IS", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The state submitted a waiver request to a federal agency to continue health coverage for 600,000 low-income residents", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "The state submitted a waiver request to a federal agency to continue health coverage for 600,000 low-income residents", "title": "State submits waiver request for expanded Medicaid", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2015/09/01/michigan-medicaid-waiver/71518778/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The state submitted a waiver request to a federal agency to continue health coverage for 600,000 low-income residents", "title": "State of Michigan submits waiver bid to prevent end of expanded Medicaid health plan", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "medicaid, waiver, michigan, snyder, obama, approval"}, "article_summary": "If the federal agency rejects Michigan\u2019s request, the expanded Medicaid health program would end by April 30.\nThe state of Michigan submitted a waiver request to the federal government Tuesday in the hopes that it can continue health care coverage for nearly 600,000 low-income residents under its expanded Medicaid program.\nThe federal Medicaid center has capped cost-sharing at 5 percent in other states.\nIn April, state officials said they worried the Obama administration might not grant a waiver on the health care cost-sharing requirements in its Medicaid expansion law \u2014 called the Healthy Michigan Plan.\nThe program provides Medicaid health coverage to adults with incomes between 100 percent and 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or roughly $12,000 for one person."}
