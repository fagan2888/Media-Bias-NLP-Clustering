But it was still stunning to hear a Republican commit GOP apostacy. It\u2019s worth listening to Hufstetler\u2019s entire presentation, but here\u2019s a few tidbits:\n\n\u201cI fought the Affordable Care Act and believe the program as a whole is detrimental to our country. The individual mandate, which I hoped would be invalidated by the Supreme Court, was not. But President Obama has given so many waivers that, for all practical purposes, it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nHufstetler cited the list of Republican governors in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Utah who have made accomodations with the Affordable Care Act. He also pointed out that Clayton County was considering a $50 million SPLOST to keep its local regional hospital afloat \u2013 to replace Medicaid dollars being spurned by Georgia. To continue:\n\n\u201cI believe this transfer of wealth is going to hurt Georgia as numerous studies by Kaiser, the University of Georgia, and Georgia State have pointed out. Our stance is hurting our state, but we\u2019re not lowering the federal deficit. I just don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s consistent, after sending the Medicaid Financing Act last year to the Department of Community Health and the executive branch \u2013 that we now want to take control of Medicaid expansion, as we go into recess for the rest of the year, without a single hearing on Medicaid expansion in the last two years\u2026. \u201cI am concerned that my party is going to lose thousands of health care workers and independent voters over this. The majority of Georgians do oppose Obamacare, but six out of 10 believe we ought to expand Medicaid. There is a difference between the two.\u201d\n\nHufstetler voted against HB 990, which passed the Senate on a vote of 35-19. He was the only Republican to do so.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/03/20/the-republican-state-senator-who-endorsed-medicaid-expansion/", "image": "http://www.ajc.com/ogimage.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Buried in the storm of bills shoved through the Legislature on Tuesday was a late-night surprise \u2013 for those paying attention.During debate on HB 990, members of the Senate suddenly found themselves listening to a Republican \u2013 Chuck Hufstetler of Rome -- advocating for the expansion of Medicaid.Sammy Jones of Georgia Public Broadcasting kindly dug through the GPB archives and produced the above clip.No, Hufstetler doesn\u2019t have any opposition this...", "title": "The Republican state senator who endorsed Medicaid expansion | Political Insider blog"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "AJC blog about Atlanta politics, Georgia politics, Georgia and metro Atlanta election campaigns.
