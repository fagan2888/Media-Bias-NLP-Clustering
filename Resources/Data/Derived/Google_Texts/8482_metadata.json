When your teenage kid starts to get moody, irritable, or lashes back at you \u2013 do you write it off as just a phase, or do you begin to worry if there is something seriously wrong with them?\n\nMany parents who deal with difficult adolescents often find themselves wondering what happened to the lighthearted, open, happy child they used to know. Psychologists are split on the issue: some believe it\u2019s more often than not just a phase every child goes through, while others believe these behavior changes should be taken more seriously as a sign of an underlying mental illness. A study published in the journal Developmental Psychology, however, may shine some light on the issue: Dutch researchers found that teen boys between the ages of 13 and 16 actually had decreased levels of empathy, or the ability to understand and feel other people\u2019s emotions, and that it may have something to do with a teenager's moodiness.\n\nEmpathy And Perspective\n\nResearchers examined 500 teenage boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 18 over the course of 6 years. They found that among girls, cognitive empathy \u2013 the ability to understand and consider another person\u2019s perspective \u2013 rose around age 13, and remained relatively stable throughout these years. Overall, girls had a higher level of empathic concern than boys, whose empathy levels dropped for several years before returning again in later teenage years. \u201cWhereas girls\u2019 empathic concern remained stable\u2026 boys showed a decrease from early to middle adolescence with a rebound to the initial level thereafter,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBoys who were physically more mature also reported lower empathic concern than did their less physically developed peers.\u201d\n\nOther studies have examined the issue of empathy in young people. One study hinted that the current generation is far less empathetic as a whole \u2013 no matter what age. The study reviewed 14,000 college students, claiming that young people today are 40 percent less empathetic than college students 30 years ago. One of the lead authors of the study even said that \u201c[i]t\u2019s harder for today\u2019s college student to empathize with others because so much of their social lives is done through a computer and not through real life interaction.\u201d\n\nMental Health Of Adolescents\n\nWhether lack of empathy is truly an epidemic in today\u2019s generation, or if it\u2019s just a short phase every adolescent goes through before reaching full adulthood, it can make parents worry about their child\u2019s mental well-being. Moodiness can often be mistaken for severe depression or mental illness, and vice versa. And there are some psychological experts who believe that the idea of a \u201cphase\u201d teenagers go through is just a myth \u2013 that there actually is an underlying mental illness accompanying these symptoms or seemingly changed personality.\n\n\u201cThe tendency of parents is to think \u2018This is normal,\u2019 \u2018They\u2019ll outgrow this,\u2019 \u2018Not to worry,\u2019\u201d Alec Miller, a doctor of psychology and chief of child and adolescent psychology at Montefiore Medical Center in NYC, told NBC News. \u201cAs a parent you can really lose your compass about what\u2019s normal and typical when you have a range of behaviors coming at you.\u201d\n\nWhat most experts agree upon, however, is that a clear sign of mental illness is typically when moodiness or irritability begins interfering with an adolescent\u2019s life, such as causing them to skip class, withdraw from friends, or start eating or sleeping differently. \u201cParents will often let this go at least two weeks or more because they\u2019re convinced it\u2019s just a phase, even though if their child has a rash, they wouldn\u2019t ignore it,\u201d Dr. Harold Koplewicz, founder and director of New York University Child Study Center, told NBC News.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "moodiness, teenagers, empathy, adolescence", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A study found that empathy levels decrease in teen boys between the ages of 13 and 16.", "title": "What\u2019s Really Causing Your Child\u2019s Moodiness: Teen Boys\u2019 Decreased Empathy Levels", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/whats-really-causing-your-childs-moodiness-teen-boys-empathy-levels-decrease-between-ages-13-and-16", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/07/teenager.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A study found that empathy levels decrease in teen boys between the ages of 13 and 16.", "title": "What\u2019s Really Causing Your Child\u2019s Moodiness: Teen Boys\u2019 Decreased Empathy Levels", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/whats-really-causing-your-childs-moodiness-teen-boys-empathy-levels-decrease-between-ages-13-and-16", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/07/teenager.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/07/teenager.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-12-07T18:37:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-07T19:03:38-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A study found that empathy levels decrease in teen boys between the ages of 13 and 16."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf46f\"", "article_summary": "Empathy And PerspectiveResearchers examined 500 teenage boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 18 over the course of 6 years.\nMoodiness can often be mistaken for severe depression or mental illness, and vice versa.\nOverall, girls had a higher level of empathic concern than boys, whose empathy levels dropped for several years before returning again in later teenage years.\nThey found that among girls, cognitive empathy \u2013 the ability to understand and consider another person\u2019s perspective \u2013 rose around age 13, and remained relatively stable throughout these years.\n\u201cWhereas girls\u2019 empathic concern remained stable\u2026 boys showed a decrease from early to middle adolescence with a rebound to the initial level thereafter,\u201d the authors wrote."}
