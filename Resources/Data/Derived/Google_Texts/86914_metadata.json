They first shook hands, then after a quick pause, grabbed each other for a hug.\n\nVictoria, Concepcion, and their wives were part of a nine way chain involving 18 people last September, one of the largest single-center kidney paired donation chains in the United States.\n\nWhen Victoria found out he wasn\u2019t a match for his wife Virginia, he donated a kidney to the chain, unlocking the possibility for his wife to be matched with someone else. The alternative was more dialysis, which left her too weak to care for their son.\n\n\u201cIt was scary at first,\u201d Victoria said, \u201cBut either way you look at it you\u2019re doing something good for someone.\u201d\n\nAs Victoria got to know the man whose life he saved, his wife scanned the room, anxiously awaiting the arrival of her donor.\n\n\u201cI would love to meet this person,\u201d Virginia Victoria said, \u201cand tell her God bless her for being so brave and so giving. . . She means the world to me and I am never going to forget this.\u201d\n\nRelated Links\n\n\u2022 Kidney donations connect strangers in 'Chain of Life'\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@river','essex-county','health-news','video'", "title": "Kidney donors and recipients have emotional first meeting", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Kidney donors and recipients have emotional first meeting\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/kidney_donors_and_recipients_have_emotional_first_meeting.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/brightcove01/width620/img/23/260701695001/201404/3546/260701695001_3431747263001_vs-533f1275e4b081d3c36f8697-782203297001.jpg?pubId=260701695001\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12588411\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-05T11:00:43Z\", \"author\": \"Adya Beasley | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@river\",\"essex-county\",\"health-news\",\"video\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://imgick.nj.com/home/brightcove01//img/23/260701695001/201404/3546/260701695001_3431747263001_vs-533f1275e4b081d3c36f8697-782203297001.jpg?pubId=260701695001", "creator": "@adyabeasley", "description": "Kidney donors and recipients are brought together for a first meeting as part of the 10th anniversary of the St. Barnabas Living Donor Paired Exchange Program.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, April 05, 2014,  9:42 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/23/260701695001/201404/3546/260701695001_3431747263001_vs-533f1275e4b081d3c36f8697-782203297001.jpg?pubId=260701695001\", \"author_name\": \"abeasley\", \"author_nickname\": \"Adya Beasley | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"8223103\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Kidney donors and recipients are brought together for a first meeting as part of the 10th anniversary of the St. Barnabas Living Donor Paired Exchange Program.", "title": "Kidney donors and recipients have emotional first meeting", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/kidney_donors_and_recipients_have_emotional_first_meeting.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, April 05, 2014,  7:00 AM", "article_author": "Adya Beasley | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "Kidney donors and recipients are brought together for a first meeting as part of the 10th anniversary of the St. Barnabas Living Donor Paired Exchange Program."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb0eb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI would love to meet this person,\u201d Virginia Victoria said, \u201cand tell her God bless her for being so brave and so giving.\nThis week, the program brought together recent transplant recipients and donors for a first meeting.\n\u201cIf patient A needs a kidney and their intended donor is not compatible and patient B needs a kidney and their intended donor is not compatible, perhaps patient A\u2019s donor is compatible to patient B, and patient B\u2019s donor is compatible to patient A,\u201d Geffner said.\nThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the St. Barnabas Living Donor Paired Exchange Program, where approximately 150 living-donor exchanges take place each year.\nVictoria, Concepcion, and their wives were part of a nine way chain involving 18 people last September, one of the largest single-center kidney paired donation chains in the United States."}
