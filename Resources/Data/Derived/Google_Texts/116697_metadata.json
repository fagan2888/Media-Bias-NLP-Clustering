Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\n\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n\nPhoto\n\n1. The Supreme Court unanimously decided not to rule in a major case on contraception, averting a possible 4-to-4 deadlock. The suit, challenging rules of the Affordable Care Act, was sent back to lower courts for a compromise. Religious groups will buy insurance plans for their workers that do not cover contraception, and employees will be able to obtain that coverage from the same insurer.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n2. Doctors said this Massachusetts man was recovering well after undergoing the first penis transplant in the U.S. Thomas Manning, whose penis was amputated several years ago to remove a rare cancer, said he hoped his case would help reassure other men with genital injuries, especially veterans. \u201cDon\u2019t hide behind a rock,\u201d he said.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n3. Donald Trump outlined his strategy against Hillary Clinton. \u201cJust getting nasty\u201d won\u2019t work, he said, and could cost him women\u2019s votes. Instead, he told our political reporters, he will portray her as enabling Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelities, hold her responsible for the Benghazi attacks and challenge her as fundamentally corrupt. He\u2019s also urging Bernie Sanders to consider running as a third-party candidate.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n4. Oregon\u2019s primaries and Kentucky\u2019s Democratic one are on Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton has been campaigning in Kentucky for the last couple of days, stressing her plans to revitalize the economy and her support for the coal industry. Mr. Sanders took his campaign to Puerto Rico, criticizing Wall Street banks for the territory\u2019s crippling debt. A group of big unions pledged to boycott the Democrats\u2019 ambitious get-out-the-vote operation unless they cut ties with Thomas Steyer, a hedge-fund manager who has spent millions to fight climate change.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n5. Dogs are at the forefront of a new approach to improve human health. Researchers are testing rapamycin, a drug that appears to delay the onset of aging in mice, to see if it has any canine side effects, before undertaking human tests. (The dogs\u2019 owners are thrilled at the possibility of lengthening their pets\u2019 lives.) The overall goal is to target the biology that underlies human aging, which is the greatest risk factor for the biggest killers in the developed world: heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes and cancer.\n\nMarket Snapshot View Full Overview\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n6. Venezuela\u2019s economic crisis, set off by collapsing oil prices, has metastasized into a health crisis. Hospitals and clinics have little medicine, and even less in the way of sterile equipment. Some lack even sufficient water to wash blood from surgical tables. Deaths among new mothers in government hospitals have multiplied, and deaths of their newborns have skyrocketed more than a hundredfold.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n7. \u201cThe students brought elderly people into the school and beat them. They beat their teachers and principals. There was nothing in the way of law.\u201d That\u2019s a 64-year-old Chinese composer who now lives in France, remembering the Cultural Revolution, a decade of political upheaval unleashed by Mao Zedong. The Communist Party\u2019s main newspaper broke a general silence about the 50th anniversary of the era\u2019s beginning, writing, \u201cWe sum up and absorb the lessons of history in order to use it as a mirror to better advance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n8. This week\u2019s roundup of TV finales includes \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d (9 p.m. Eastern, The CW), \u201cblack-ish\u201d (Wednesday, 9:30 p.m., ABC), \u201cEmpire\u201d (Wednesday, 9 p.m., Fox) and \u201cShark Tank\u201d (Friday, 9 p.m., ABC). And our entertainment team recommends taking advantage of iTunes\u2019 99-cent deals to rent \u201cSicario\u201d with Emily Blunt or Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cChi-Raq.\u201d Above, the stars of \u201cEmpire.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n9. A host of media organizations in the Bay Area \u2014 including television and radio stations, The San Francisco Chronicle, The San Francisco Examiner, Mother Jones and online publications \u2014 have set June 29 as their target date to publish comprehensive reports on homelessness. It\u2019s a pervasive problem in a city where the tech boom has sent rents ever upward. \u201cWe want the full force of the Fourth Estate to bear down on this problem,\u201d an editor said.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n10. Finally, President Obama honored 13 police officers with the Medal of Valor, the nation\u2019s highest award for public safety officers. This Los Angeles officer, Donald Thompson, was off-duty when he dashed across a highway to pull an unconscious man from a burning car, suffering serious burns in the process. Mr. Obama promised to listen and learn from the officers, and to provide the resources they need to do their jobs. \u201cOur country needs that right now,\u201d he said.\n\n_____\n\nThe Evening Briefing by Email Get a nightly rundown of the day's top stories delivered to your inbox every Monday through Friday.\n\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\n\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\n\nWant to look back?
