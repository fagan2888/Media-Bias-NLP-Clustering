The bank cancelled the remaining $125 million of outstanding credit, an Ex-Im spokesman told The Daily Signal.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s board of directors approved financing for four loan guarantees\u2014totaling $112.8 million\u2014to an Abengoa subsidiary on June 29. The bank\u2019s charter expired the next day, on June 30, marking the first time Ex-Im has experienced a lapse in its authority in its 81-year history.\n\nAccording to the bank\u2019s spokesperson, Ex-Im\u2019s exposure to the solar company totals $66.2 million.\n\nWith Abengoa\u2019s questionable financial future, some question whether the green energy company will be able to repay the taxpayer-backed financing it received from Ex-Im.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re going under, they\u2019re not going to repay their loans,\u201d Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center, told The Daily Signal.\n\nA spokesman for Ex-Im told The Daily Signal the bank is continuing to work with the company to ensure its outstanding debt is repaid.\n\n\u201cEx-Im Bank has and will continue to closely monitor this situation, and continues to work with all parties and creditors to recoup the outstanding debt,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email. \u201cAs with all transactions of this nature, the bank\u2019s exposure is covered by reserves, which are funded by fees assessed on borrowers, not the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nBefore Abengoa\u2019s financial woes were made public, the company was scrutinized in media reports for violating U.S. immigration law, workplace safety codes, and environmental regulations, according to the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nAdditionally, House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, pressed Ex-Im Chairman Fred Hochberg, R-N.Y., on ties between the bank\u2019s advisory board and the Spanish green energy company last year.\n\nIn September 2013, the bank approved two loans totaling $33.6 million to Abengoa for solar projects in Spain and South Africa. When the bank authorized the loans, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, was one of 17 members serving on Ex-Im\u2019s advisory board.\n\nRichardson, who also served as secretary of the Department of Energy under President Bill Clinton, was also a member of Abengoa\u2019s international advisory board at the same time.\n\nSuch ties between government agencies and private companies benefiting from taxpayer-backed financing are not uncommon, de Rugy said, and often times firms like Abengoa will \u201cdouble dip\u201d into several government programs.\n\n\u201cI think what we see with Abengoa, it\u2019s a perfect example of decisions and due diligence that is not driven by how sound a project is, but that is driven by politics,\u201d de Rugy said.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2014, for example, Abengoa received $3 billion in financial assistance from both Ex-Im and the Department of Energy.\n\nThrough its 1705 loan program, the Department of Energy awarded the solar company more than $2 billion in loan guarantees for the construction of two solar plants in the U.S.: one in Phoenix, Ariz., and a second in California\u2019s Mojave Desert.\n\nIt was through the Department of Energy\u2019s 1705 loan guarantee program that the now-defunct Solyndra also received financing.\n\n\u201cIt just tells you everything that\u2019s wrong with these programs,\u201d de Rugy said. \u201cThe decisions are made based on politics and who you know. The more your know, the more double dipping you\u2019re able to do.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Abengoa said $1 billion of the loans and loan guarantees it has received from the federal government have been repaid. The company did not return The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.\n\nEx-Im provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products.\n\nBank officials often boast of Ex-Im\u2019s 0.235 percent default rate and say it returns money to the Treasury each year.\n\nBut over the last year, Abengoa isn\u2019t the only company to receive taxpayer-backed financing from Ex-Im and face financial woes.\n\nNewSat, an Australian satellite company, benefited from $100 million in Ex-Im loans from 2012 to 2014. The company filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the United States last year.\n\nThe company\u2019s bankruptcy\u2014and the decision-making that led to it receiving Ex-Im financing\u2014was scrutinized by Republicans during a June Financial Services Committee hearing, who said the deal was evidence that the bank is \u201cbeyond broken.\u201d\n\nLawmakers said NewSat handed Ex-Im a \u201c$100-million loss\u201d at the \u201cexpense of the taxpayers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Abengoa, a solar company headquartered in Spain, received more than $191 million in loans and loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Abengoa, a solar company headquartered in Spain, received more than $191 million in loans and loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank.", "title": "After Receiving Taxpayer-Backed Loans, Solar Company Files for Bankruptcy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160418_AbengoaExIm_Quinn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/20RLEQl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Abengoa, a solar company headquartered in Spain, received more than $191 million in loans and loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank.", "title": "After Receiving Taxpayer-Backed Loans, Solar Company Files for Bankruptcy", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160418_AbengoaExIm_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2016-04-18T18:12:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Ex-Im, Abengoa, Department of Energy, 1705 loan program, Veronique de Rugy, NewSat, House Financial Services Committee, Bill Richardson, Department of Energy"}, "article_summary": "But over the last year, Abengoa isn\u2019t the only company to receive taxpayer-backed financing from Ex-Im and face financial woes.\nEx-Im provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products.\nNewSat, an Australian satellite company, benefited from $100 million in Ex-Im loans from 2012 to 2014.\nOf the $316 million in financing Ex-Im authorized, the bank disbursed $191 million to Abengoa and its subsidiaries, its records show.\nWith Abengoa\u2019s questionable financial future, some question whether the green energy company will be able to repay the taxpayer-backed financing it received from Ex-Im."}
