The $5 million AeroStay is nearing completion.\n\nConvenience is the name of the game at the AeroStay. Connected to the airport, the soon-to-open hotel will make things easy for travelers.\n\n\"Winter, you don't even have to go outside. You get up in the morning, you're down a hallway and you're on your plane. I think people are going to love it and I'm excited to get started,\" Kary said.\n\nLevi Kary will be the General Manager once it opens. The hotel boasts 76 rooms that range from big with king size beds to eco-efficient getaways.\n\n\"Extremely luxurious and upscale finishes. While it's a smaller room, it's a very comfortable and a very nice room that we think people are going to really like,\" Kary said.\n\nThe construction company plans on handing the hotel over to the management company by the end of the month. The hotel will open around June 1.\n\n\"I think the place is cool. A lot of these finishes we've never put in hotels before like the sliding bathroom door, the Euro cabinets and stuff like that, and wood floors in some of these guest rooms is also new for us,\" Dave Potratz with Beck & Hofer Construction said.\n\nThe AeroStay will be run by the same management group that takes care of the Ramkota and ClubHouse Suites. The proximity between hotels allows the group to pool resources.\n\n\"We'll just shuttle that back and forth every day and it's a five-minute drive away. We'll cross train people. It will really help our operations I think,\" Kary said.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
