Chloe is in the eighth grade. She is also a good church-going girl. So you can imagine her mom\u2019s surprise when she got in trouble at school.\n\nChloe showed up at school wearing a T-shirt that reads: \u201cVirginity Rocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a positive message,\u201d said Bambi Crozier, Chloe\u2019s mom.\n\nApparently some folks at Ramay Junior High don\u2019t understand the concept of virginity.\n\nBut school officials disagreed. They said the shirt could cause a classroom disruption and contained sexual content. Apparently some folks at Ramay Junior High don\u2019t understand the concept of virginity.\n\nThe 13-year-old, who bought the shirt at a Christian music festival, was told she had to change shirts.\n\n\u201cIt was so bizarre,\u201d Mrs. Crozier told me. \u201cShe had the shirt for several years at wore it a number of times to school.\u201d\n\nI called the school district hoping to talk to the person in charge of the fashion police \u2013 but no one\u2019s called me back. A spokesperson told local news outlets that they have a rule banning any clothes that might cause a distraction.\n\n\u201cWhy is it such a bad thing to talk about virginity when they\u2019re handing out condoms and girls are pregnant?\u201d Mrs. Crozier wondered. \u201cIt blows my mind.\u201d\n\nIt does make you wonder why the guidance counselors are doling out condoms to the junior high crowd.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re bigger concern (is) they just don\u2019t want to talk about virginity,\u201d she said. \u201cToday, people think that virginity is a dirty word. It\u2019s not in our household.\u201d\n\nOr maybe they\u2019re concerned the \u201cVirginity Rocks\u201d shirt might cut down on condom distribution?\n\nWho knows?\n\nMrs. Crozier said her daughter did as she was instructed to do and put on a gym shirt.\n\n\u201cWe totally believe in respecting rules,\u201d she said. \u2018We totally believe in listening to leadership. If that\u2019s what their request is \u2013 that\u2019s okay. There are certain battles in life you are going to choose and whether or not you can wear a shirt is not a big deal.\u201d\n\nSo being a good church-going girl, Chloe abided by the school\u2019s orders \u2013 because heaven forbid a 21st century teenager be caught promoting abstinence. Planned Parenthood must be having convulsions.\n\nMrs. Crozier said she was taken aback by the national attention her daughter\u2019s shirt has received.\n\n\u201cAll I did was post on Facebook to my friends,\u201d she said. \u201cNow my daughter has gone viral.\n\nChloe, meanwhile, seems to be taking her 15 minutes of fame in stride.\n\n\u201cShe thinks it\u2019s cool,\u201d Mr. Crozier said. \u201cShe updated her Instagram page to say \u2018Chloe: As Seen on TV.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Virginity does not rock at Ramay Junior High School in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
