Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nOnce in a great while there comes a snack we obsess over because it's just that good. The latest addition to that pantheon (and heir apparent to the cheese straw, that holiday-entertaining stalwart): blue cheese shortbreads from Farmstead, a Providence, R.I., specialty foods store and restaurant. The cookie/cracker hybrid \"is mostly cheese and butter,\" according to resident baker and co-owner Kate Jennings. She uses whatever leftover blue cheese she has on hand in the shop that day\u2014could be a Stilton from England, say, or Bayley Hazen from Vermont\u2014and mixes it with butter, flour, sugar, salt and cornstarch to create a hefty shortbread with a shattering crumb. The salty-sweet flavor (the dough is rolled in coarse sugar prior to baking), flaky texture and lactic tang are addictive. A natural addition to a cheese plate, the shortbreads also make a delicious snack on their own or with tea or coffee. $20 for 24 shortbreads, farmsteadinc.com\n\nThe Beverage\n\nSome Like It Hot (and Fizzy)\n\nENLARGE Rachel's Ginger Beer F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nWith the season of overeating upon us, there is nothing like the tummy-soothing bubbly refresher ginger beer. No, not the sugary mass-produced soda: Once we tried the homespun version from Rachel's Ginger Beer, we could never go back to the super-sweet stuff. The three-year-old business, which recently opened a ginger-beer bar in Seattle's Pike Place Market, has just started shipping its namesake libation nationally. Founder Rachel Marshall handcrafts the Original flavor by carbonating a blend of freshly squeezed lemon and ginger juices, organic sugar and water. The result is a concentrated quaff that's fiery yet tart, and tastes as good on its own as it is does mixed into cocktails. (Try it in a Moscow Mule.) Also on offer are seasonal varieties, such as pomegranate, blood orange and cranberry\u2014a perfect non-alcoholic alternative for the Thanksgiving table. $78 for four 32-ounce bottles, rachelsgingerbeer.com\n\nThe Condiment\n\nGive Cranberry Sauce a Rest\n\nENLARGE Casa Forcello preserves F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nCranberry sauce may be the usual accompaniment to the Thanksgiving turkey. But for those looking to branch out this holiday season, Casa Forcello, a maker of small-batch preserves in Mantua, Italy, has just the thing. Owner Paola Calciolari has been producing mostarda\u2014the spicy candied-fruit condiment typically served in Italy with boiled meats\u2014and preserves, some of which are based on her grandmother's recipes, for almost 20 years. Her plum smoked-tea compote is a full-flavored mix of plums, lapsang souchong tea and sugar, and her blood-orange marmellata, made from organic Sicilian fruit, is sunshine-bright. Like the rest of her creations, both would complement any rich bird, be it turkey or roast duck. From $10 for plum smoked-tea compote, fairwaymarket.com\n\n\u2014Gabriella Gershenson", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2013-11-08T19:06:00.000Z", "article.section": "Life and Style", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "Off Duty's round-up of what's delicious now: blue cheese shortbreads from Farmstead; all-natural Rachel's Ginger Beer; mostardas and preserves from Casa Forcello, an Italian cranberry sauce alternative.", "title": "Farmstead's Blue Cheese Shortbread, Rachel's Ginger Beer and Casa Forcello Preserves", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-AZ586_BITSBI_G_20131106124729.jpg", "alt": "Consume this now: Farmstead blue cheese shortbread, Rachel's Ginger Beer, Casa Forcello mostarda", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-AZ586_BITSBI_D_20131106124729.jpg"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303618904579169521485139900&headline=Consume%20this%20now%3A%20Farmstead%20blue%20cheese%20shortbread%2C%20Rachel%26apos%3Bs%20Ginger%20Beer%2C%20Casa%20Forcello%20mostarda&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303618904579169521485139900"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "beer,political,general news,food,cooking review,drink,living,lifestyle,wine,beer ,spirits,content types,factiva filters,fc&e exclusion filter,review", "news_keywords": "beer,political,general news,food,cooking review,drink,living,lifestyle,wine,beer", "article.headline": "Consume this now: Farmstead blue cheese shortbread, Rachel's Ginger Beer, Casa Forcello mostarda", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-AZ586_BITSBI_E_20131106124729.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-AZ586_BITSBI_D_20131106124729.jpg"}}, "description": "Off Duty's round-up of what's delicious now: blue cheese shortbreads from Farmstead; all-natural Rachel's Ginger Beer; mostardas and preserves from Casa Forcello, an Italian cranberry sauce alternative.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303618904579169521485139900&headline=Consume%20this%20now%3A%20Farmstead%20blue%20cheese%20shortbread%2C%20Rachel%26apos%3Bs%20Ginger%20Beer%2C%20Casa%20Forcello%20mostarda&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303618904579169521485139900", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "Life and Style", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "Off Duty's round-up of what's delicious now: blue cheese shortbreads from Farmstead; all-natural Rachel's Ginger Beer; mostardas and preserves from Casa Forcello, an Italian cranberry sauce alternative.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "B", "article.published": "2013-11-08T19:06:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-9b17", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj", "embed_count": 3, "image_count": 3, "word_count": 438, "external_link_count": 3}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Off Duty's round-up of what's delicious now: blue cheese shortbreads from Farmstead; all-natural Rachel's Ginger Beer; mostardas and preserves from Casa Forcello, an Italian cranberry sauce alternative.", "title": "Farmstead's Blue Cheese Shortbread, Rachel's Ginger Beer and Casa Forcello Preserves", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303618904579169521485139900", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-AZ586_BITSBI_G_20131106124729.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Farmstead\u2019s Blue Cheese Shortbread, Rachel\u2019s Ginger Beer and Casa Forcello Preserves", "article.type": "Bits & Bites", "article.id": "SB10001424052702303618904579169521485139900", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-11-08T19:06:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90e3\"", "article_summary": "The latest addition to that pantheon (and heir apparent to the cheese straw, that holiday-entertaining stalwart): blue cheese shortbreads from Farmstead, a Providence, R.I., specialty foods store and restaurant.\nThe ProvisionCheese and Crackers Rolled Into OneENLARGE Farmstead's blue cheese shortbread F.
