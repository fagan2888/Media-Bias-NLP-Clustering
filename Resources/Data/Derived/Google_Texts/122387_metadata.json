Willock.\n\nIn the case, the court unanimously upheld a trial court imposition of a $7,000 fine on a photographer and a finding that she violated the state\u2019s Human Rights Act when she refused to photograph a same-sex wedding on grounds that the assignment would conflict with her Christian beliefs.\n\nThe state law forbids businesses operated as places of \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d and open to serve the general public, to refuse to provide services to gays and lesbians.\n\nThe criticism of the ruling by the ADM is that it infringes on the photographer\u2019s free religious practice. The criticism by the Cato Institute and leading scholars, including Eugene Volokh of UCLA and Dale Carpenter of Minnesota, is that it compels the photographer to take a point of view, or compels speech.\n\nThe photographer argues both: She says that requiring her to take photos of a same-sex wedding compels her to express approval of same-sex marriage, which she disapproves of, and interferes with her free exercise of religion through her business.\n\nIn general, the criticism is that the ruling means private businesses can\u2019t make private decisions.\n\nIf the Supreme Court decides to hear this case, it would be the second major church-state case of the term, along with Town of Greece v. Galloway.\n\nThe highly watched Greece case is about whether it violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment for a town council to open its legislative meetings with a prayer because by mostly choosing Christian pastors to lead the prayer, the town is endorsing a relief or whether the prayer is acceptable because it doesn\u2019t coerce anyone to prayer or adopt the belief of the prayer.\n\nAnd there is another possible case working its way toward the Court, in dozens of lawsuits challenging the requirement of the Affordable Care Act that businesses with more than 50 employees provide health-care insurance that covers contraception and screening for reproductive health.\n\nFederal circuits have reached conflicting views about whether private corporations have a right to the free exercise of religion under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, with the Tenth Circuit saying yes and the Third Circuit saying no.\n\nAs Lyle Denniston reported on Scotusblog, \u201cThe Supreme Court has never ruled on a case involving \u2018free exercise\u2019 claims by a profit-making company organized for ordinary business activity.\u201d\n\nRecent Constitution Daily Stories\n\nConstitution Check: Is President Obama claiming too much war power?\n\nThe price of privacy in a post-9/11 world\n\nVote Now: An amendment to ensure equal rights for all\n\nVote Now: A constitutional amendment about campaign finance\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "A recent court case in New Mexico could find its way to the Supreme Court as a test of several First Amendment freedoms.", "title": "Another possible Supreme Court case involving religion and gay rights", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/09/another-possible-supreme-court-case-involving-religion-and-gay-rights/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/5728223962_e22a83b8be_b.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/5728223962_e22a83b8be_b.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-12T14:41:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-12T14:50:45+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/ncc/"}, "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2763\"", "article_summary": "On Wednesday, the Alliance Defending Marriage said it will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review an August ruling of the New Mexico Supreme Court in Elane Photography v.
