Pixabay, public domain\n\nWhether you tend to be an upbeat optimist who sees the light, or a \u201crealistic\u201d pessimist who just wants to keep their expectations low to prevent disappointment, the way you look at the world may have a lot to do with the size of your orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a part of the brain linked to anxiety and behavioral regulation.\n\nA new study published in Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience has found that the thicker your OFC, the less likely you are to be anxious. A larger OFC is also associated with a more optimistic attitude, giving all those anxiety balls hope that optimism may perhaps be a shield of sorts against the condition. Anxiety is, after all, a difficult mental illness that prevents people from enjoying their daily lives.\n\n\u201cOptimism has been investigated in social psychology for years,\u201d Yifan Hu, a graduate student who worked on the study, said in the press release. \u201cBut somehow only recently did we start to look at functional and structural associations of this trait in the brain. We wanted to know: If we are consistently optimistic about life, would that leave a mark in the brain?\u201d\n\nPositive Thoughts: Leaving A Mark On The Brain\n\nThere are plenty of studies that examine the role of a shrinking OFC in anxiety; one 2013 study examined the brains of people who survived the Great East Japan Earthquake, finding that shrinking gray matter in the OFC was associated with a greater risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nBut the researchers of the latest study wanted to focus on how both optimism and a bigger OFC had a protective role. \u201cWe wanted to go in the opposite direction,\u201d Sanda Dolcos, a researcher at the University of Illinois who authored the study, said in the press release. \u201cIf there can be shrinkage of the orbitofrontal cortex and that shrinkage is associated with anxiety disorders, what does it mean in healthy populations that have larger OFCs? Could that have a protective role?\u201d\n\nIn the study, the researchers examined 61 healthy young adults, taking MRIs of their brain structure \u2014 particularly the OFC. They measured the amount of gray matter in each brain region, comparing it to the total volume of their brain (gray matter controls muscles, hearing, seeing, memory, emotions, speech, and decision-making). Afterward, the participants completed surveys that measured their optimism, anxiety, and depression \u2014 as well as their general mood (also referred to as positive or negative affect), whether that was enthusiastic and interested, or irritable and upset.\n\nThe researchers\u2019 results were fascinating: A thicker OFC was linked to higher levels of optimism and lower levels of anxiety. The researchers believe that optimism helped protect people from anxiety.\n\n\u201cYou can say, \u2018OK, there is a relationship between the orbitofrontal cortex and anxiety,\u201d Dolcos said in the press release. \u201cWhat do I do to reduce anxiety? And our model is saying, this is working partially through optimism. So optimism is one of the factors that can be targeted.\u201d\n\nBut is there a way to change the size of your OFC and train yourself to become more optimistic and less anxious? More research will need to be completed before any conclusions can be made, but the good thing is that our brains are plastic \u2014 able to change and develop over time, and renew circuits that in turn influence our behavior. Improved brain plasticity has been achieved through learning new things, exercising the mind, and exercising the body \u2014 as well as reducing stress.\n\nThere are many reasons to take initiative in reducing anxiety through optimism. One recent study found that optimism was linked to a healthier heart; positive thoughts and humor in a negative situation ended up improving quality of life, while negativity lessened quality of life even more. In addition to channeling positive energy into situations, try a few other anxiety-mitigating tips \u2014 like taking a walk in nature, reminiscing about good times in your life, and eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. You might find that you have a bit of an upbeat optimist in yourself that you never thought you had.\n\nSource: Dolcos S, Hu Y, Iordan A, Moore M, Dolcos F.
