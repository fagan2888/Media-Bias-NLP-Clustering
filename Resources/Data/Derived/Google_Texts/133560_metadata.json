The high dose vaccine contains four times the antigens as the regular flu vaccine and is intended to create a stronger immune response for seniors, who are at greater risk of developing severe flu-related illnesses. The problem is that the majority of seniors are not aware of its importance. A new survey from CVS/pharmacy found that three in five U.S. adults (61 percent) are unaware of the importance of the high dose flu vaccine in flu prevention for adults 65 years and older. According to the study, nearly one in three (30 percent) Americans have a role in helping an elderly family member or loved one aged 65 years or older make healthcare decisions, reinforcing the importance of the general population to be aware of the availability of the high dose flu vaccine. \"Getting an annual flu shot is the best way to help prevent the spread of influenza, especially for seniors who are more susceptible to developing complications from the flu,\" said Papatya Tankut, RPh, Vice President of Pharmacy Affairs, CVS Caremark. Flu Information\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention >> CDC page for information on 2013-14 flu season. >> Special information for senior citizens (65 and older) \"The results of our consumer survey indicate the need for greater awareness among all Americans to understand the benefits of getting vaccinated and assisting older loved ones in making the decision, as well.\" The news release said all CVS/pharmacy and MinuteClinic locations have begun to offer flu vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone who is at least 6 months old get a flu shot as soon as the vaccine is available. Among Americans who have ever received a flu shot, more than one-third (35 percent) indicated that convenience plays a major role in their decision about where to get the vaccination. More than 7,600 CVS/pharmacy stores and 850 MinuteClinics inside select CVS/pharmacy locations will provide flu shots every day, including evening and weekends, with no appointment needed. Getting the flu shot at CVS/pharmacy or MinuteClinic is also very affordable. Nearly half of Americans (46 percent) are unaware that the flu vaccine is a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act, fully covered and available at no cost through most insurance plans, including Medicare Part B. CVS/pharmacy and MinuteClinic can directly bill many national and regional health plans that cover all or part of the cost of a flu shot.
