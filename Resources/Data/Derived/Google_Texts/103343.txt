Reading between the lines, I gather that Republicans are starting to coalesce around a legislative agenda to celebrate their recent midterm victory:

Ban abortions after 20 weeks.

Wipe out all of Obama's new and pending EPA regulations.

Repeal Obamacare bit by bit.

Figure out a way to obstruct Loretta Lynch's nomination as Attorney General.

Oh, there's still some desultory happy talk about tax reform and fast-track trade authority and other "areas of agreement," but that seems to be fading out. Poking a stick in President Obama's eye is very quickly becoming the order of the day.

And no reason not to, I suppose. Republicans won, after all. But they shouldn't be surprised if Obama continues to plan to poke back.
