The county apparently went ahead and built the road, then billed FEMA for the costs, which the agency paid without \u201cproviding reasonable justification\u201d or conducting a cost-benefit analysis to determine how much of the project it would cover.\n\n\u201cAs a result, FEMA and taxpayers had no assurance that the work was cost effective, as federal regulations and FEMA guidelines require,\u201d the IG said.\n\nThe agency said it had since gone back and performed a cost-benefit analysis to determine that the grant was justified. Still, this is just the latest example of the agency\u2019s oversight and grant-processing issues.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. The agency\u2019s grant awarding process has been under scrutiny for years.\n\nA separate audit from the IG included a list of the most crucial issues FEMA needs to address this year\u2014and unsurprisingly, a number of items included the agency\u2019s grant issuing process.\n\nThe auditors found that FEMA is lacking a comprehensive process to demonstrate that grant obligations and cash payments are being documented efficiently and accurately.\n\nRelated: More FEMA Screw Ups Cost Taxpayers $12 Million\n\n\u201cWe recommend that FEMA dedicate the resources to implement a process to monitor which grant programs are flowing through which grant systems in order to facilitate the assessment of system-based controls over obligations, de-obligations and payments related to grant programs,\u201d the report said.\n\nSeparately, the list included deficiencies within FEMA\u2019s flood insurance program and issues with FEMA employees failing to comply with ethics policies.\n\nFEMA is routinely under intense scrutiny for botching the administration of financial assistance to storm victims.\n\nThe agency is still trying to recoup billions of improper payments it doled out to Hurricane Sandy victims in 2012.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Auditors are once again flagging the Federal Emergency Management Agency for not keepi", "title": "FEMA Flagged For Lax Oversight\u2026Again", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/25/FEMA-Flagged-Lax-Oversight-Again", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232013_FEMA_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/25/FEMA-Flagged-Lax-Oversight-Again", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232013_FEMA_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Auditors are once again flagging the Federal Emergency Management Agency for not keepi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5849\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAs a result, FEMA and taxpayers had no assurance that the work was cost effective, as federal regulations and FEMA guidelines require,\u201d the IG said.\nThe agency\u2019s grant awarding process has been under scrutiny for years.\nThe auditors found that FEMA is lacking a comprehensive process to demonstrate that grant obligations and cash payments are being documented efficiently and accurately.\nSeparately, the list included deficiencies within FEMA\u2019s flood insurance program and issues with FEMA employees failing to comply with ethics policies.\nA separate audit from the IG included a list of the most crucial issues FEMA needs to address this year\u2014and unsurprisingly, a number of items included the agency\u2019s grant issuing process."}
