LOUIS \u2014 If St. Louis loses its NFL team, experts say it\u2019d have a \u201csmall potatoes\u201d economic impact. The blow to region\u2019s psyche, they say, would be far greater.\n\nThe beleaguered fan base took another hit on Monday, when Rams owner Stan Kroenke joined in a development group that\u2019s planning an 80,000-seat stadium in the Los Angeles suburbs. Yes, the Rams appear to be going back west, perhaps in 2016, just two decades after St. Louis swiped the team from L.A.\n\nIt\u2019d make St. Louis a two-time loser in NFL circles \u2014 the Cardinals bolted for Arizona in 1987. Though St. Louis and Missouri officials are fighting to keep a team \u2014 be it the Rams or another one \u2014 even going so far as to unveil a design for a new riverfront stadium, it appears at this point to be a longshot.\n\nMissouri Gov. Jay Nixon knows there are precious few franchises in the nation\u2019s favorite sport.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of 32 in the world,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cIt\u2019s very valuable to our state.\u201d\n\nBut that value is more about civic pride, not economics, economists and city leaders say. \u201cIf you want to be a major-league city, you want to have an NFL team,\u201d St. Louis Sports Commission President Frank Viverito said.\n\nAnd losing the Rams would pale in comparison financially to some of the other businesses that have left the region at a cost of thousands of high-paying jobs. In the 20 years since the team arrived, St. Louis lost a Ford plant and two Chrysler plants; Trans World Airlines folded into American Airlines; McDonnell Douglas was purchased by Boeing; andMay Department Stores was bought by Macy\u2019s. Even Anheuser-Busch \u2014 synonymous with St. Louis \u2014 was sold.\n\nThe Rams, meanwhile, employ about 200 people full-time, less than 1 percent of the 26,000-plus employed by BJC HealthCare, the region\u2019s largest employer. The team\u2019s annual revenue, about $225 million, ranks low among both NFL teams and public companies in the region.\n\nAs for the economic benefit of home games, the Rams again come up short when compared to the NHL\u2019s Blues and the city\u2019s dominant team, the St. Louis Cardinals \u2014 mostly because hockey and baseball seasons have so many more games, said Glenn MacDonald, economist at the Olin Business School at Washington University.\n\nCounting preseason and postseason games, the Blues typically play at home about 50 times a year, drawing fans from nearby rival teams Nashville Predators and Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nAnd no team in the region comes close to the economic impact generated by the Cardinals, who draw more than 3 million fans a year to 81 regular-season home games. Their fan base is spread throughout the Midwest and South, and with mostly three- and four-game series, downtown hotels fill up.\n\nThe St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association has estimated the Cardinals\u2019 annual economic value in the $320 million to $350 million range, depending on how far they go into the postseason.\n\nRams games are different. The fan base is mostly local \u2014 unlike the Packers, Cowboys or Steelers, the Rams have little following outside of the area (except for die-hard fans who remain in California) \u2014 so they don\u2019t stay at hotels and aren\u2019t much into tailgating.\n\nThe Rams also play only two preseason and eight regular-season games at home. And playoffs? The Rams haven\u2019t had a winning season in 11 years and haven\u2019t hosted a playoff game since 2003.\n\nEach football game\u2019s economic impact is in the neighborhood of $10 million, MacDonald said. \u201cIt really boils down to small potatoes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lots of reasons to be interested in the Rams, but the direct economic effect is relatively minor.\u201d\n\nMajor-league teams, like the Rams, end up becoming \u201cpart of your civic identity,\u201d said Jeff Rainford, chief of staff for St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay.\n\n\u201cWe have the Arch, the St. Louis Symphony, the Cardinals and Rams and Blues, and that becomes part of who we are,\u201d he said.\n\nSt. Louis certainly isn\u2019t giving up. A committee appointed by Nixon announced plans Friday for a new open-air stadium along the Mississippi River. The stadium, expected to cost between $860 million and $985 million, would built through a combination of team and NFL funding, seat licensing and public funding already in place. Nixon and city leaders agree new public money is not an option.\n\n\u201cWe want an NFL franchise, but not at any cost,\u201d Rainford said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers R.B.
