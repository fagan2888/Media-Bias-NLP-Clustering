A measure that could have taken Insure Tennessee to a voter referendum in November met opposition from Franklin Rep. Jeremy Durham Wednesday in a House subcommittee.

Insure Tennessee would expand the state's Medicaid financing. Gov. Bill Haslam heavily backed the plan during the 2015 legislative session, though efforts to revive it have continue to sputter out. Durham pushed to have the issue placed in a summer study, rather than on the ballot. State Rep. Larry Miller also moved a companion resolution that would authorize the Haslam administration to move forward with initiative, but withdrew the bill because he felt he didn't have sufficient support among committee Republicans.

"I've opposed Obamacare Medicaid Expansion from the start," Durham said. "Our state almost went bankrupt the last time we expanded Medicaid, and I don't want to put Tennessee into similar financial predicament again. We must protect taxpayers and reject short-term federal dollars that will increase our national debt and create expenses that our state cannot afford long-term."

House Democrats said they blamed Durham for no further progress made on the issue, citing that they believe Tennesseans want to see an expansion of that program.

"We have polling that shows no matter the political leanings of respondents, the majority of Tennesseans want access to healthcare," House Democratic Leader Craig Fitzhugh said. The minority leader from Ripley suggested letting voters cast an official opinion at the polls.

"They are tired of our state leaving money on the table in Washington. We are charged with making sure that we do the bidding of our bosses--the voters and citizens of the state of Tennessee. By not allowing this language to go on the ballot this fall, we are failing in our job description as office holders."

Insure Tennessee will now wait until the 2017 session before the legislature will take any further action.
