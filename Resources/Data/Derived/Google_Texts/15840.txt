Fire ripped through a south-side business early Sunday morning in a strip center near south 12th Avenue and west Nebraska Street.

Tucson Fire Department firefighters were dispatched at 4:24 a.m. to a business in the 5300 block of south 12th Avenue after several people called 911 to report fire and heavy smoke in the area, according to a TFD press release. Pictures from the scene indicate the business was Novias and Princess Forever, 5329 S. 12th Ave., which specializes in formal wear.

Eight units and 21 firefighters had the blaze under control in 14 minutes, according to the press release.

None of the businesses in the strip center were open at the time, so no evacuations were necessary.

The fire was contained to just the one business, where it originated, and the origin, cause and damages are yet to be determined.
