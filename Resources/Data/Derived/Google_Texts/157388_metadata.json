Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nToday in Obama:\n\n\n\nSay Please: A pair of liberal House members wants President Barack Obama to ask Congress for a war declaration to fight the Islamic State group \u2013 preferably after they come back from the Christmas break.\n\n[READ: War Against ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Now Libya Appears Rudderless]\n\nIf You Can\u2019t Lick \u2018Em: The president gave some bipartisan face time to the nation\u2019s governors, hosting them in a White House confab Friday. It was Obama\u2019s first meeting with the new batch of Republicans who seized statehouse power during the 2014 midterms \u2013 and since some govs sued him over his immigration plan.\n\nHRH, POTUS, VPOTUS to Meet: The White House announced Prince William will swing down from New York on his North American tour and chat up Obama and Vice President Joe Biden on Monday. It\u2019s the first get-together Obama \u2013 whom some Republicans have compared to a royal \u2013 has had with an actual one since the president and his wife traveled to London in 2011.\n\n\n\nToday in 2016:\n\nBridge Too Far: An investigative panel reported \u201cno conclusive evidence\u201d that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a presumed Republican presidential contender, engineered or knew about the George Washington Bridge lane closures that happened last year. Salon.com thinks Christie\u2019s ambitions are dead in the water, anyway.\n\nThird Time\u2019s the Charm: Perhaps owing to his strong showing in the latest polls \u2013 but in spite of his repeated denials \u2013 those close to failed 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney say he hasn\u2019t ruled out a third try for the White House. Romney met this week with some financial backers in New York who were key to his last campaign.\n\n\n\nToday in Hillary:\n\nTest the Mettle: Despite her commanding lead in the polls, liberal Democrats want Hillary Clinton to face some kind of challenge to test her progressive bonafides. She may get one in former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, who\u2019s staffing up his exploratory committee. But Yahoo! News doesn\u2019t think it will make any difference.\n\n[ALSO: Elizabeth Warren Liberals Eye Jim Webb to Pressure Hillary Clinton]\n\nStock Slide: Warren Buffett\u2019s investment in her super PAC notwithstanding, some political futures analysts are advising hitting the \u201csell\u201d button on shares of Hillary for President. RealClearPolitics notes Clinton's poll ratings are down, and FiveThirtyEight says the juggernaut might be out of gas. But Buffett\u2019s track record is pretty strong, so \u201chold\u201d may be the watchword.\n\n\n\nToday in Everything Else:\n\nFlex Time: With a simmering revolt from angry conservatives about to wreck his no-shutdown plan, House Speaker John Boehner needs some Democratic votes to pass his plan and \u2013 reaching out in the spirit of bipartisanship \u2013 asked House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for some. But Pelosi, showing a little muscle, let Boehner know Friday, very publicly, that those votes won\u2019t come cheap.\n\nNot Covered Under Obamacare: The Boehner-Pelosi dialogue had more than the GOP\u2019s tea party backbenchers grumbling. Influential RedState.com blogger Erick Erickson said Boehner\u2019s outreach to Pelosi suggests the man of the House could use a pair of new ones \u2013 brass, perhaps \u2013 and asked his Twitter audience to kick in for the replacements.\n\nNo More Candy: CNN President Jeff Zucker has announced network mainstay Candy Crowley, host of the Sunday political chat show \"State of the Union,\" will be leaving the network \u201cso she can embark on the next chapter of her already prolific career.\u201d Her show stays, though there\u2019s no word on who will succeed her.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Last Call: Declare War, Mr. President", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Liberal Dems want the president on the record vs. ISIS, Christie is cleared of Bridgegate, and Mitt's still a Hitt.", "title": "Last Call: Declare War, Mr. President", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/12/05/last-call-declare-war-mr-president", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/ba/83/6ba7fed94d0abf3d93c89b6b60b6/141205-obama-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Liberal Dems want the president on the record vs. ISIS, Christie is cleared of Bridgegate, and Mitt's still a Hitt.", "card": "summary", "title": "Last Call: Declare War, Mr. President"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
