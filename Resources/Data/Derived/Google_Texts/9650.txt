BOULDER — The dog days of preseason camp may be taking their toll a bit on the Colorado football team.

CU coach Mike MacIntyre acknowledged Tuesday that the defense was “sluggish” early during the morning practice.

“Then (the defense) got it going — they had to run a few laps and woke up,” MacIntyre said. “We should have run them earlier.”

This week could be considered the most demanding portion of the month-long camp. The schedule includes two-a-day practices for Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and also a scrimmage on Saturday.

MacIntyre said the players seem to be holding up through it all.

“I think we’re doing a good job of that,” he said. “Our nutrition is good — the way we’re feeding them, giving them Gatorade and some other supplements morning and night. So they’re in good shape.

“There’s also a mental aspect to two-a-days. You have to mentally fight through it.”

The morning practice was highlighted by senior defensive lineman Juda Parker screaming at teammates to get focused. Parker is a team captain.

“That’s what a leader does,” MacIntyre said. “There are different ways to motivate at different times. I think they responded to that.”
