The IRS is not making this a simple audit either. It is demanding documentation on expenses going back years.\n\nMr. Clements is not the only one feeling the wrath of the IRS. Breitbart News is also being audited. In 2013, all of the 501C4 organizations selected for auditing by the IRS were conservative groups.\n\nThat\u2019s 100 percent of them.\n\nMr. Clements called the audit, a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d\n\nHe is right. It is.\n\nPresidents have used the IRS against their enemies almost since there was an IRS. Lyndon Johnson did, as did Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton and of course, Barack Obama.\n\nOne of the proposed Articles of Impeachment against Richard Nixon was using the IRS against his enemies.\n\nEvery time the IRS is used against a president\u2019s enemies, the calls go out that this should never happen again. No one ever goes to jail and nothing happens until the next president abuses the powers of the IRS.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment states, in part, \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,[a] against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d\n\nAn IRS audit is a textbook example of an unreasonable search and seizure. When the IRS sends a note and tells a taxpayer to show up with all of his or her papers, that is unreasonable.\n\nRepublicans in Washington have denounced the IRS witch hunts against conservatives but have done little more. Next year, the Republican Party should control the Senate as well as the House. They can do something to control not only the IRS but other government agencies that use audits as a way of striking back at political opponents.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment requires the government to obtain a warrant if it wants to conduct a search. Thanks to the Fourth Amendment, the FBI under President Obama or the Department of Homeland Security cannot simply come to a person\u2019s home, demand access and search.\n\nIt is time to give Americans that protection against the IRS.\n\nIn order to obtain a search warrant, the government must go to a judge and show probable cause. The IRS and other agencies should be held to the same standard.\n\nNext year, the Republicans in the Senate and the House should attach a provision to a must pass piece of legislation that says before any agency can conduct an audit, it must have some probable cause to believe there is some wrong doing. That application for a warrant must be presented under oath to a judge and no audit may take place until the judge has signed the application.\n\nAnyone targeted for an audit should also have the right to challenge that audit in court, much as defendants in criminal cases have the right to file motions to suppress evidence from illegal searches.\n\nThe only way to stop these kind of abuses is to permanently deny government agencies like the IRS the ability to abuse American citizens.\n\nThe Constitution and the Bill of Rights exist to protect Americans against an oppressive government.\n\nAn IRS audit is the textbook example of an oppressive government at work. It\u2019s time for the Republicans in Congress to stand up for what they believe and end the IRS\u2018 ability to torment American citizens.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Fourth Amendment states, in part, \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,[a] against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" When the IRS tells a taxpayer to show up with all of his or her papers, that is unreasonable.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Fourth Amendment states, in part, \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,[a] against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d When the IRS tells a taxpayer to show up with all of his or her papers, that is unreasonable.", "title": "PHILLIPS: Use 4th Amendment to tame the IRS", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/8/phillips-use-4th-amendment-tame-irs/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/07/lerner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/07/lerner.jpg", "description": "The Fourth Amendment states, in part, \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,[a] against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" When t", "card": "summary", "title": "PHILLIPS: Use 4th Amendment to tame the IRS"}, "Author": "Judson Phillips", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Internal Revenue Service, Logan Clements"}, "article_summary": "An IRS audit is the textbook example of an oppressive government at work.\nThe director of an anti-Obamcare movie called, \u201cSick and Sicker: Obamacare Canadian style,\u201d Mr. Clements was hit with an IRS audit.\nThe Fourth Amendment requires the government to obtain a warrant if it wants to conduct a search.\nThanks to the Fourth Amendment, the FBI under President Obama or the Department of Homeland Security cannot simply come to a person\u2019s home, demand access and search.\nIn order to obtain a search warrant, the government must go to a judge and show probable cause."}
