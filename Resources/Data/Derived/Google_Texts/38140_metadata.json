That would mean buying about 1,500 metric tons, or 1,650 short tons, of gold worth more than $60 billion.\n\nIf the initiative wins the backing of a majority of voters this Sunday, the Swiss National Bank would also be prohibited from spending any of the treasure, which would have to be locked away in vaults entirely on Swiss soil. The prospect risks causing a spike in gold prices globally.\n\nThe nationalist Swiss People\u2019s Party, the country\u2019s largest, has brought the \u201cSave our Swiss Gold\u201d initiative, arguing it will restore trust in the central bank and its paper money. The proposal is opposed by the government and financial leaders but aims to capitalize on a growing sense of caution among the Swiss about the perceived dangers and increasing volatility of financial markets.\n\nThough the country is among the world\u2019s most prosperous, the initiative argues that owning physical gold in vaults would protect the country\u2019s wealth from trouble in markets beyond the control of this small Alpine nation. The experience of the 2008 global financial crisis, triggered in part by complex investments that brought down multiple banks and bankrupted states, is fresh in people\u2019s memories.\n\nJacques Mayor, a Geneva accountant, said he was wary of the idea of Switzerland buying or selling gold in large amounts in international markets.\n\n\u201cThe last time they sold gold, we had an enormous loss,\u201d Mayor said, referring to the central bank going $10 billion in the red in 2013, when the value of its gold holdings slumped.\n\nDespite the perception that gold\u2019s value is protected by the fact it is a physical good, its market price can in fact be quite volatile. The metal is used often by speculators as a safe haven.\n\nRecently, gold has lost much of its sheen. Its price has fallen 11 percent since the summer to around $1200 an ounce.\n\nSwiss polling firm gfs.bern has found the initiative is likely to fail, with just 38 percent supporting it, short of the required majority. About 47 percent were opposed as of early November.\n\nFor investors, the vote is still too close for comfort.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Swiss to vote on massive gold-buying plan", "title": "Swiss to vote on massive gold-buying plan", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Swiss to vote on massive gold-buying plan", "title": "Swiss to vote on massive gold-buying plan", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/28/swiss_to_vote_on_massive_gold_buying_plan/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/switzerland-saving-the-gold.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Swiss to vote on massive gold-buying plan", "title": "Swiss to vote on massive gold-buying plan", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/switzerland-saving-the-gold.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Heilprin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3f3\"", "article_summary": "The nationalist Swiss People\u2019s Party, the country\u2019s largest, has brought the \u201cSave our Swiss Gold\u201d initiative, arguing it will restore trust in the central bank and its paper money.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsGENEVA (AP) \u2014 In Switzerland, a campaign is on to protect the country\u2019s wealth by investing in gold \u2014 a lot of gold.\nIn a test of their sense of financial security, the Swiss are being asked to vote on a proposal to make the central bank hold a fifth of its reserves in gold within five years.\nSwiss polling firm gfs.bern has found the initiative is likely to fail, with just 38 percent supporting it, short of the required majority.\nThat would mean buying about 1,500 metric tons, or 1,650 short tons, of gold worth more than $60 billion."}
