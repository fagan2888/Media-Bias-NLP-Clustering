If you are to get it done, you must survive the onslaught of the NBA\u2019s most lethal duo to do it.\n\nThe Nuggets found themselves in position to get their biggest win of the season Sunday night. They clung to a one-point lead, at 97-96, with 8:12 to play.\n\nBut then \u2026\n\nDurant hits a runner with 3:17.\n\nDurant hits another runner at 2:45.\n\nWestbrook draws a foul and makes two free throws with 2:24 left. He had already directed a nearly flawless Thunder offense that nearly resulted in a triple double.\n\nAnd though the Nuggets were game through all of this, the weight of having to hold off both stars was too much as they lost 122-112 at Chesapeake Arena. Westbrook finished it off with a thunderous dunk with 46.5 seconds to go.\n\n\u201cStopping Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant is a challenge,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cThey\u2019re great players, two of the best players in the NBA. When they get off, it makes it difficult. Stopping those guys is hard. The challenge is limiting the other guys.\u201d\n\nAlmost.\n\nIt\u2019s a word the Nuggets have been all too familiar with this season.\n\n\u201cIt does get old,\u201d Malone. \u201cI hate losing. It drives me crazy.\u201d\n\nMalone paused.\n\n\u201cIt gives you a little bit of hope that you can go into San Antonio and play well, that you can come into OKC and play well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what is hope? When I read the sports page, it\u2019s going to say the Denver Nuggets are 12-19, and that does not sit well with me.\u201d\n\nOffensively, the Nuggets were solid. They found production from different places while leading scorer Danilo Gallinari sat out because of a sprained ankle. Kenneth Faried (25 points, 11 rebounds) played one of his best games of the season. Will Barton (19 points) was his usual steady self off the bench. Jameer Nelson (15 points) and Gary Harris (16) provided the Nuggets with shooting punch.\n\nBut defensively, they were just a little too ragged.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to play better defense,\u201d forward Darrell Arthur said. \u201cGiving up 122 points, you don\u2019t have any excuses for that.\u201d\n\nOklahoma City challenges your transition defense. The Nuggets allowed 22 fast-break points. Oklahoma City challenges foes on the boards. Though the Nuggets grabbed a season high-tying 17 offensive rebounds, they ultimately lost the rebounding battle 43-37.\n\nOklahoma City won\u2019t brag about this one, but a win is a win.\n\nAnd in that win, Westbrook fell a rebound shy of his fourth triple-double of the season. He \u201csettled\u201d for 30 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds. Durant added 26 points and 10 assists.\n\nThey owned the night.\n\nThe Nuggets fumed that former Colorado star Andre Roberson was allowed 10 points, that Enes Kanter was allowed 21 points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the other guys that we have to do a better job on,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe did great on the offensive end, but we have to bear down and get stops down the stretch.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets lose lead in fourth quarter, fall to Thunder in Oklahoma City", "title": "Nuggets lose lead in fourth quarter, fall to Thunder in Oklahoma City", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/27/nuggets-lose-lead-in-fourth-quarter-fall-to-thunder-in-oklahoma-city/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151227_070332_will-barton.jpg", "height": 452}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151227_070332_will-barton.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-27T19:36:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:00:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "There is no faking a win at Oklahoma City.\nOklahoma City won\u2019t brag about this one, but a win is a win.\nOklahoma City challenges foes on the boards.\nOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Thing is, there are always Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.\nAnd in that win, Westbrook fell a rebound shy of his fourth triple-double of the season."}
