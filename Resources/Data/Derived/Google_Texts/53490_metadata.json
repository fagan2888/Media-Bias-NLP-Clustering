She told Park that Tavenner did not have a good enough understanding of the risks of launching before the website was ready to fight for a delay.\n\n\u201cDo you really think (Tavenner) has enough understanding of the risks to fight for a delay --- no and hell no,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe later added: \u201cI appreciate you (sic) belief in the goodness of others but at this point I am too tired to pretend that there is a decision to be made - it is just how much crap my team will have to take if it isn\u2019t sufficiently successful \u2013 you haven\u2019t lived through the temper tantrums and threats of the last 9 months.\u201d\n\nSnyder was in charge of the rocky rollout and announced her retirement last December in the midst of the turmoil. Tavenner said at the time that Snyder had actually planned to retire the previous year, but had stayed on in order to help \"with the challenges facing CMS in 2013.\"\n\nThe CMS did not respond to an emailed request for comment from FoxNews.com.\n\nThe House Science, Space and Technology Committee obtained the email and others through a subpoena to compel Park to testify on how much knowledge he had about security concerns with the website before it launched in October 2013.\n\nThe committee is investigating how much Park and the White House knew about the problems with the website before the launch.\n\nPark has distanced himself from the website\u2019s problems, telling a House committee last year that he did not \u201cactually have a really detailed knowledge\u201d of the website before the launch and was \u201cnot even familiar with the development and testing regimen that happened prior to October 1.\u201d\n\nHowever, the emails from Park, who briefed the White House on the progress of the website, seem to indicate he had more knowledge of the website than his statements indicate. In the emails, he mentions specific teams, hardware and user targets for the website.\n\nThe Wednesday hearing comes after the beginning of the second round of open enrollment for the health care law. The enrollment period began Saturday with few issues compared to the previous period, which was plagued with site outages and other problems.\n\nCommittee chairman Rep. Lamar Smith told FoxNews.com in a statement the hearing is especially important because Americans are in the process of signing up for ObamaCare.\n\n\"It\u2019s time for the White House to come clean with the American people about the security of the Obamacare website,\" Smith, R-Texas, said.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care,/FOX
