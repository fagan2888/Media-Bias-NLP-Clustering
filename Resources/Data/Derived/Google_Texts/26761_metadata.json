The book he published earlier this year,\u201dMother of God,\u201d combines adrenaline-fueled stories about his adventures in the rainforest with an earnest call to preserve the natural world. Reading through it, as Rosolie suggested his critics do, one\u2019s struck by the passion he obviously felt for an ecosystem under threat, and particularly by the caution and respect with which he treated the anacondas he encountered there. Almost all of that is missing from \u201cEaten Alive\u2019s\u201d trailer, which comes off, as Salon\u2019s Joanna Rothkopf put it, as an attempt at entertainment that \u201ccrosses the line from bad taste to outright\u2026 animal abuse.\u201d A Change.org petition attempting to prevent it from airing has more than 37,000 signatures as of this writing.\n\nIs it really possible that Rosolie abandoned his principles entirely for the benefit of the network that brought us \u201cShark Week\u201d? It will be impossible to know before the show itself airs, but the reality of what really happened may be somewhere in the middle. Rosolie wasn\u2019t able to reveal much about the stunt itself, but from what he did say, the whole \u201cgetting eaten alive by an anaconda\u201d thing is sort of a bait-and-switch: come for the drama, stay for the important message about conservation (or, as he calls it, the \u201cvegetables\u201d).\n\nSalon spoke with Rosolie about his critics\u2019 concerns and about why he feels saving the Amazon is in dire need of rebranding. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nI expect you\u2019re not actually going to be able to tell me whether or not you were eaten by an anaconda, right?\n\n[Laughs] Jumping right into it, huh? No. That\u2019s one thing they want me to keep until the end, just like they don\u2019t tell you if Nik Wallenda makes it across the tightrope. You just have to wait until Sunday.\n\nA lot of people think it\u2019s going to be fake. There was one expert online saying it would probably be impossible, even for a large snake, to swallow a human\u2026\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know who the \u201cexpert\u201d was but I\u2019ve worked with anacondas for years in the Amazon and I\u2019ve seen them eat animals significantly bigger than humans. One of the factors that makes it difficult for an anaconda to potentially eat a human is that, unlike a deer that goes from head to neck to shoulders very gradually, humans have this sharp angle where their shoulders go out. That\u2019s one of the things that makes it difficult, but these things crush their prey to death before they eat, so once a human ribcage is collapsed and your clavicle is snapped, your shoulders aren\u2019t so much of a problem. Actually, my cook, when I was a guide for ecotours in the Amazon \u2014 her father was eaten by an anaconda.\n\nA lot of people are saying things they think are true, but anacondas are a pretty powerful species. They live in an environment with black caiman that grow to be 18 feet, with jaguars that can grow to be 250 pounds. Humans aren\u2019t that formidable; we don\u2019t have any claws or spikes or teeth to speak of, you know?\n\nThat\u2019s horrifying about your cook. I\u2019m assuming, since I\u2019m speaking with you, that you weren\u2019t crushed quite in the same way?\n\nThe carbon-fiber suit that was designed to protect me during the stunt \u2014 we tested it to make sure that I wouldn\u2019t get crushed to death while doing this.\n\nI read a bit of your book and I know you care a lot about conservation. Obviously the point of the documentary wasn\u2019t to see whether or not you could be eaten alive. Could you tell me a little bit more about what you are hoping to achieve with it?\n\nAbsolutely. I have worked in the Amazon for almost a decade now, and when you\u2019re actually there\u2026 I\u2019ve seen the Trans-Amazon Highway cut through thousands of miles of forest, I\u2019ve seen illegal gold mining completely raze what was once pristine rainforest to the ground. I\u2019ve been on the front lines of this developing story for a while now, and I\u2019ve seen scientists writing papers, I\u2019ve seen activists starting petitions, but I still feel like the world still turns.\n\nI look at the Amazon as: It produces a fifth of our planet\u2019s oxygen and contains another fifth of our planet\u2019s fresh water. There\u2019s more biological diversity here than anywhere else on the planet, so whether you\u2019re a politician in Tokyo or you live in New York or L.A., our planet\u2019s weather is heavily influenced by this one gigantic forest biome. It\u2019s not just about saving the animals or saving the rainforest, it\u2019s something at the crossroads of global politics and the health of life on Earth.\n\nFor me, getting eaten by an anaconda addresses a lot of people\u2019s worst fears and nightmares, but it\u2019s also a chance for us to start studying this really awesome, beautiful, charismatic animal \u2014 we call it a flagship species in conservation, when we can use a charismatic ambassador for the ecosystem. If you can protect an apex predator, you can protect everything else in the ecosystem. By doing this show\u2026 I mean, look, just the trailer on YouTube got 15 million views in a week; when you search \u201cEaten Alive\u201d on Google you get something like 250,000 results of articles written. People all over the world are interested, offended, curious, and people are talking to experts and asking questions about anacondas, about the Amazon, about why this guy would do this. For me, that\u2019s a huge success. I would like wildlife and the natural world to be a greater part of the dialogue in our culture.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The star of Discovery Channel's controversial new show insists it's all in the name of conservation", "title": "Meet the man who was (maybe) devoured by an anaconda", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The star of Discovery Channel's controversial new show insists it's all in the name of conservation", "title": "Meet the man who was (maybe) devoured by an anaconda", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/06/meet_the_man_who_was_maybe_devoured_by_an_anaconda/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/eaten_alive.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The star of Discovery Channel's controversial new show insists it's all in the name of conservation", "title": "Meet the man who was (maybe) devoured by an anaconda", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/eaten_alive.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, anacondas, animal abuse, Conservation, Discovery Channel, Editor's Picks, endangered species, Rainforest, the amazon, wildlife", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb303\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019ve been on the front lines of this developing story for a while now, and I\u2019ve seen scientists writing papers, I\u2019ve seen activists starting petitions, but I still feel like the world still turns.\nActually, my cook, when I was a guide for ecotours in the Amazon \u2014 her father was eaten by an anaconda.\nI expect you\u2019re not actually going to be able to tell me whether or not you were eaten by an anaconda, right?\nIs it really possible that Rosolie abandoned his principles entirely for the benefit of the network that brought us \u201cShark Week\u201d?\nRosolie\u2019s a dedicated naturalist who has made protecting the Amazon and its species his life\u2019s mission."}
