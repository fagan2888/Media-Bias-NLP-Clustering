As the unrest in Ferguson, Mo.. and Baltimore showed the nation, these people believe that rioting and looting are legitimate forms of political activism.\n\nThe pro-violence radicalism among Sanders supporters comes straight from the top. The Vermont senator vocally supports unrepentant Marxist terrorist Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera whom he describes as \u201cone of the longest-serving political prisoners in history \u2014 34 years, longer than Nelson Mandela.\u201d\n\nSanders told a town hall meeting in Puerto Rico that if Obama doesn\u2019t release L\u00f3pez Rivera, \u201cI will pardon him\u201d if elected president.\n\nHere is what the longtime prisoner did:\n\n\u201cL\u00f3pez Rivera conspired to transport explosives with intent to destroy federal government property and committed other related crimes \u2014 or that the [Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional Puertorrique\u00f1a terrorist group] was deemed responsible for a reign of terror that killed six people and injured 130 others in at least 114 bombings. They includes the 1975 bombing of historic Fraunces Tavern in the city\u2019s Financial District, which left four people dead and wounded more than 50 others, and a New Year\u2019s Eve 1982 bombing at Police Headquarters that maimed three NYPD cops who tried to defuse the explosives.\n\n\u201cOn January 24, 1975, a ten-pound dynamite bomb planted by the FALN at Fraunces Tavern in lower Manhattan exploded, killing his father, 33-year-old Frank Connor. In 2011, Joe Connor attended a parole hearing for L\u00f3pez Rivera in Terre Haute, Indiana. He and the other survivors of the FALN\u2019s murder spree offered L\u00f3pez Rivera \u2018multiple opportunities\u2019 to express remorse. He rebuffed all of them.\u201d\n\nThat Sanders would support granting clemency to such a man tends to undermine his ad nauseam-repeated claim to be a \u201cdemocratic socialist.\u201d Ideologically, Sanders is a communist, though he never joined the party. Of course he is comfortable standing with a violent leftist revolutionary who waged war against the United States.\n\nAnd like Barack Obama, Sanders pals around with terrorists and their backers. In March he met with the Florida chapter of the Muslim terrorist-linked Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Sanders strongly supports the Apollo Alliance, a left-wing enviro-pork barrel group that wants the government to take over America\u2019s energy industry and one of whose leaders is Weather Underground terrorist Jeff Jones. Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union and is a fan of Fidel Castro and Daniel Ortega.\n\nSo when Sanders denounces violence, don\u2019t be impressed: it is a tactic. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nDistancing himself from his unhinged followers would be both disingenuous and absurd of Sanders, reminiscent of Barack Obama\u2019s half-hearted shrug after the Rev. Jeremiah Wright\u2019s crazed anti-American rants became headline news. \u201cI can no more disown him than I can disown the black community,\u201d Obama said on the campaign trail in 2008 of his deranged pastor of 20 years.\n\nSanders is following the Saul Alinsky playbook. As an aide to the Rules for Radicals author wrote, while Alinsky was shying away from praising violence in public and sounding \u201cthe trumpet blast for democracy,\u201d in private \u201che would say that violence has its uses.\u201d Saying you support politically motivated violence implies you don\u2019t support democracy \u2013 so Bernie lies.\n\nNote that he refused to apologize for \u2013 or even criticize \u2013 the actions of his supporters at the state convention. Like many leftist radicals, Sanders is skilled at bouncing between studied reverence for nonviolent action and refusing to condemn violent left-wing activism, which is a slippery way of endorsing violent left-wing activism. He offered a milquetoast, perfunctory, blanket condemnation of violence in general, the kind of thing any competent left-wing politician could do sleepwalking.\n\n\u201cOur campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals,\u201d Sanders said of the mostly peaceful convention.\n\nHe then rubbed salt in the wounds, complaining in detail about the perceived railroading his side experienced at the convention. \u201cThe Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nLying about violence comes naturally to left-wingers.\n\nAlthough right-wing political violence doesn\u2019t take place a lot in modern American politics, Sanders and the media want Americans to believe otherwise. This helps to explain why they falsely accused Tea Party groups of violence (and racism and other undesirable isms) during the fight over Obamacare. The right-wing populism spurred by Obama\u2019s un-American policies presents an existential threat to the Left.\n\nSanders accuses Donald Trump\u2019s supporters of unprovoked physical aggression against his supporters, while at the same time denying that he is encouraging his supporters to rough up Trump rally attendees.\n\nOf course Sanders\u2019 denials, however passionate at times, ring hollow. It is a longstanding practice of the Left to accuse its enemies of its own antisocial misdeeds in order to avoid accountability. (This is not to excuse or make light of the relatively few incidents in which Trump supporters have thrown punches at Sanders-supporting protesters, but for the most part fans of The Donald were trying to deal with obnoxious protesters who were disrupting Trump rallies. Excessive enthusiasm in cracking down on the rude is not the same as trying to prevent free speech and political expression.)\n\nOn the weekend, Sanders\u2019 backers acted out their unhappiness with Nevada\u2019s byzantine delegate-selection process. They became abusive and physically aggressive as they tried to silence speakers like Hillary Clinton surrogate Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) with loud boos and profanities. The Nevada Democratic Party went as far as writing the Democratic National Committee accusing Sanders supporters of having a \u201cpenchant for extra-parliamentary behavior \u2014 indeed, actual violence \u2014 in place of democratic conduct in a convention setting.\u201d\n\nAccording to one news report:\n\n\u201cDemocratic officials released text messages and voicemails with threats against the Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman Roberta Lange. They included such comments as \u2018Hey bitch, loved how you broke the system, we know where you live, where you work, where you eat, where your kids go to school \u2026 You made a bad choice, prepare for hell, calls won\u2019t stop.\u2019 Another one said, \u2019You\u2019re fired bitch, #FeelTheBern, speak or else, corrupt bitch, answer the phone you pussy.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlarmed at the prospect of internecine violence, party elites put the heat on Sanders to denounce the obnoxious behavior forcefully.\n\n\u201cThere is no excuse for what happened in Nevada, and it is incumbent upon all of us in positions of leadership to speak out,\u201d said Clinton marionette Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida congresswoman who heads the DNC.\n\n\u201cI grew up in Brooklyn. I\u2019m not afraid of bullies,\u201d Boxer said at the convention. \u201cWe need civility in the Democratic Party,\u201d she said with a straight face. \u201cCivility.\u201d\n\nStephanie Schriock, president of EMILY\u2019s List, a pro-Clinton PAC, added, \u201cThese disgraceful attacks are straight out of the Donald Trump playbook, and Bernie Sanders is the only person who can put a stop to them. Sanders needs to both forcefully denounce and apologize for his supporters\u2019 unacceptable behavior \u2014 not walk away.\u201d\n\nWhen left-wingers complain about the violent tactics other left-wingers use against them you just know something big is afoot.\n\nIt could be that the Democratic Party is just as fragmented, or even more bitterly divided, than the Republican Party.\n\nBernie Sanders is fine with that.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://capitalresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/favicon-144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It could be that the Democratic Party is just as fragmented, or even more bitterly divided, than the Republican Party.\nThe pro-violence radicalism among Sanders supporters comes straight from the top.\nAlthough right-wing political violence doesn\u2019t take place a lot in modern American politics, Sanders and the media want Americans to believe otherwise.\n\u201cWe need civility in the Democratic Party,\u201d she said with a straight face.\nSo when Sanders denounces violence, don\u2019t be impressed: it is a tactic."}
