I would like to voice my concern regarding the plans to annex, rezone for mixed use, and construct multi-family affordable housing on the undeveloped parcels of land at 6655 and 6600 Twin Lakes Road. These two parcels currently lie in unincorporated Boulder County on land that has been zoned "Rural Residential" since 1954.

My husband and I have lived in the Twin Lakes housing subdivision since 1986, we both work in Boulder and have experienced all of the growth and traffic/infrastructure related changes first-hand over the years. I understand the need for affordable housing within the city of Boulder, but aren't the three new housing developments in the King Soopers area enough for the existing infrastructure? And if affordable housing is so important, why are developers allowed to pay a fee to avoid that?

I have noticed the stress due to the increased population in Gunbarrel already and it's not done yet — long lines at the gas station, hard to find a parking spot at the grocery store, more aggressive drivers on the already crowded roads, etc...

Neither of the two parcels at 6655 and 6600 Twin Lakes Road are good candidates for multi-family affordable housing for many reasons, including:

• This area is a designated wetland area and home to owls, herons, foxes, coyotes and migratory wildlife; that makes it unsuitable for future development and prone to flooding.

• Poor 'walkability' score — a vehicle is needed to access the local shopping, banks, restaurants, and medical center. RTD bus service (route 205) is located on 63rd and Twin Lakes Road. It's about a third of a mile walk to the bus stop. This is within walking distance for most people, but not all.

• Lack of nearby family-related services — no nearby public schools, libraries, recreational centers, or Housing and Human services.

• Access — there is only one road in and out of the Twin Lakes/Red Fox Hills subdivisions, it is not that well maintained now.

Development of large multi-family housing structures on these parcels will violate multiple commitments of the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan and will seriously degrade the established, low-density, rural residential character of the Twin Lakes and Red Fox Hills neighborhoods.

There is overwhelming opposition by affected residents in nearby neighborhoods to city annexation of and multi-family housing development on these parcels. For example, check out what the Twin Lakes Action Group has to say at http://tlag.org
