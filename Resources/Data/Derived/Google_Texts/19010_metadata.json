Powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively or to the people. This power over marriage which came from god under our organic law is not to be redefined by the United States Supreme Court or any federal court.\u201d\n\nMoore responded to a comment from President Barack Obama earlier this week that federal law overrules state law.\n\nRELATED: Chris Cuomo Battles AL Justice Roy Moore in Epic 25 Minute Interview on Gay Marriage\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to tell President Obama that he\u2019s entirely correct, federal law does trump state law,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut what this Harvard professor who is president of the United States does not understand, is that a trial court\u2019s decision on the constitutionality of a federal question is just that \u2014 it\u2019s an opinion. It may be law of the case before her. It is not overturning the Alabama constitution. Federal law is not made by judges.\u201d\n\nWallace accused Moore of being \u201ca little fuzzy\u201d on whether state judges would have to adhere by a SCOTUS ruling in favor of allowing same-sex marriage. Moore again cited the Supreme Court\u2019s 1857 Dred Scott fiasco, a favorite crutch of gay marriage opponents.\n\n\u201cState courts are bound by the ruling of the Supreme Court,\u201d Moore replied. \u201cBut when a strict interpretation of the Constitution\u2026is abandoned in the theoretical opinion of individuals are allowed to control its meaning, we have no longer a Constitution. We\u2019re under the government of individual men who for the time being declared what the Constitution is according to their own views.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut when the Supreme Court rules, the Supreme Court rules,\u201d Wallace concluded.\n\nWatch the clip below, via Fox News:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Controversial Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, who has ordered probate judges in his state to ignore a Supreme Court ruling allowing same-sex marriages to go", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wallace.jpg", "title": "Fox\u2019s Wallace Challenges AL Justice Moore: \u2018When the Supreme Court Rules, It Rules\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "Controversial Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, who has ordered probate judges in his state to ignore a Supreme Court ruling allowing same-sex marriages to go forward over the state's constitutional ban, battled Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace Sunday morning over whether he...", "title": "Fox's Wallace Challenges AL Justice Moore: 'When the Supreme Court Rules, It Rules'", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wallace.jpg", "creator": "@@evanmcmurry", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-02-15T13:17:15+00:00", "keywords": "tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda514\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019re under the government of individual men who for the time being declared what the Constitution is according to their own views.\u201d\u201cBut when the Supreme Court rules, the Supreme Court rules,\u201d Wallace concluded.\nRELATED: Chris Cuomo Battles AL Justice Roy Moore in Epic 25 Minute Interview on Gay Marriage\u201cI\u2019d like to tell President Obama that he\u2019s entirely correct, federal law does trump state law,\u201d Moore said.\n\u201cState courts are bound by the ruling of the Supreme Court,\u201d Moore replied.\n\u201cWhen a word\u2019s not in the Constitution, clearly the powers of the Supreme Court do not allow them to redefine words and seize power.\nMoore again cited the Supreme Court\u2019s 1857 Dred Scott fiasco, a favorite crutch of gay marriage opponents."}
