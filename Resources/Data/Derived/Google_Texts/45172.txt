Thousands of riders from all across the country headed back home Sunday after spending the week in Panama City Beach.

Sunday marked the last day of the Thunder Beach Autumn Rally, which according to law enforcement saw tens of thousands of riders coming in to visit the World's Most Beautiful Beaches.

According to Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) Trooper Sean Hill, Panama City Beach Police responded to about six crashes throughout the rally.

"If you take 75,000 or 100,000 people on a general basis, and the 6 crashes that we had. It's a tragedy that we have a crash anyway, but if you take 6 crashes, and compare it to 75,000 people, I'd say those numbers are pretty good," Hill said.

Hill said FHP responded to about two crashes in their jurisdiction during the rally.
