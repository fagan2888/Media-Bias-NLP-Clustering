(CBSNewYork/AP) \u2014 The New Jersey U.S. Senate race was in a fight to the finish Tuesday, a day before voters were set to head to the polls in a special election.\n\nAs CBS 2\u2019s Christine Sloan reported, Democrat Cory Booker is hitting the Democrat-favoring communities of Belleville, New Brunswick, Hoboken and Newark, where he is mayor.\n\nRepublican Steve Lonegan is campaigning Tuesday in Basking Ridge, Flemington, Belvidere, Morristown and Middletown \u2014 all places where Republicans usually get the most votes. He\u2019s also stopping in Jersey City.\n\nLonegan also received the endorsement of former Jersey City Acting Mayor Joe Rokawski. And Lonegan attacked Booker for his performance as Newark mayor.\n\n\u201cTwo people were shot to death on the streets of Newark last night. Unemployment in Newark has gone from 8 to 14 percent,\u201d Lonegan said. \u201cMr. Booker has failed Newark. That\u2019s extreme. See, he\u2019s an extreme failure.\u201d\n\nBooker fired back, calling Lonegan extreme as he met with senior citizens in Newark.\n\n\u201cHe is the leader of the tea party in New Jersey, period,\u201d Booker said. \u201cDo we want to send the tea party to Washington that is continuing to shut down our government?\u201d\n\nBooker also took issue with Lonegan\u2019s claims about his record as Newark mayor.\n\n\u201cShootings are down 27 percent in Newark. That is a fact. Murders are down over 15 percent, that\u2019s a fact,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWhat we need in Washington isn\u2019t someone who talks down to our cities and gives such negative characterizations.\u201d\n\nDuring a stop in Little Falls, Booker said the special election is about more than just Booker versus Lonegan.\n\nHeavy Campaigning For Booker, Lonegan Day Before N.J. Senate Vote playpause\n\n\u201cThis a chance for people to send a real message to Washington. This is a referendum in many ways on a shutdown on Tea Party tactics,\u201d Booker told WCBS 880\u2019s Jim Smith. \u201cWill New Jersey send the leader of our Tea Party to join the ranks of [Sen.] Ted Cruz and others shutting down our government, attacking the expansion of health care and things like that. Or, will we send someone down who\u2019s been the mayor of our largest city who hasn\u2019t even had the time to play partisan politics.\u201d\n\nBooker said the eyes of the nation will be watching as New Jerseyans cast their ballots in the only federal election during this government shutdown.\n\n\u201cYou either endorse the shutdown and if you do, vote for Steve Lonegan. If you endorse those Tea Party sort of radical politics of pushing our government from crisis to crisis, vote for Steve Lonegan,\u201d Booker said.\n\nThere are stark differences between the candidates. Lonegan is against the Affordable Care Act and what he calls big government, and said it chokes the liberties of Americans.\n\nHe also opposes gay marriage, and believes the welfare system has institutionalized poverty. A business owner and legally blind, Lonegan said after college he refused to stay on disability.\n\n\u201cThe government and bureaucrats would have simply kept me in that entitlement state for the rest of my life, happily,\u201d he said.\n\nBooker took issue with Lonegan\u2019s claim that he favors liberty.\n\n\u201cHe is so for liberty that he tells gay and lesbian couples. \u2018Oh by the way, you can\u2019t be treated equal under the law.\u2019 By the way, he wants to say gay and lesbian couples can\u2019t adopt children,\u201d Booker said.\n\nBut at a news conference, Lonegan thanked Jersey City\u2019s current mayor Steve Fulop \u201cfor allowing us to come here today and have this press conference without being attacked by thugs and hoodlums.\u201d\n\nLonegan trumpeted the endorsement of the former Democratic mayor Rakowski. He was Jersey City\u2019s acting mayor for four months in 1992.\n\n\u201cJust look at Cory Booker\u2019s record. It is a failure,\u201d Rakowski said.\n\nHeavy Campaigning For Booker, Lonegan Day Before N.J. Senate Vote playpause\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s really just an omen for me to be here,\u201d Lonegan said.\n\nBesides asking for votes, both candidates are reminding voters that the special election is on Wednesday, a day when polls usually are not open.\n\nThe Newark mayor said he anticipates sizable voter turnout.\n\nThe winner will serve the remaining 15 months of the late Frank Lautenberg\u2019s term in the Senate.\n\nA Monmouth University poll released Monday finds the Newark mayor maintaining a double-digit lead over Lonegan, 52 to 42 percent among likely voters.\n\nA Rutgers-Eagleton Poll shows Booker with a 22-point lead over Lonegan. The poll, released Monday afternoon, gives the Democrat a 58 to 36-point lead over his competitor.\n\nPolitical analysts said it\u2019s highly unlikely that Lonegan will be able to overcome his deficits in the polls, but they added voter turnout will be crucial in determining the election.\n\nSome analysts said independent voters and moderate Republicans may skip Wednesday\u2019s vote.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories:\n\nCBS News: TSA Replaces Top Official In Charge Of Airport Security\n\nClinton Declines Invitation To Debate Sanders In California\n\n22-Day Push Up Challenge Sheds Light On The Dark Side Of PTSD Among Vets\n\nAnimal Advocates Fuming As Hansome Cabbies Get First Rate Hike Since 2010\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
