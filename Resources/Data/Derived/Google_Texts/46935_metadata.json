The senior apologized when Oregon State announced the suspension, which was affirmed by the Pac-12 Conference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m well aware that my actions not only embarrassed my family, but also the university and the Oregon State basketball program,\u201d Reid said in a statement. \u201cI was not raised to act in that manner that was displayed on that play. I\u2019m well aware that I made a mistake that has damaged my image. My actions are inexcusable and I am willing to accept any and all consequences that are to follow.\u201d\n\nCoach Wayne Tinkle said Reid\u2019s conduct over the next two weeks will determine if additional discipline will be taken.\n\nReid sent Nunez tumbling to the court and was ejected with 2:56 remaining in Utah\u2019s 59-53 win over Oregon State in Salt Lake City on Sunday night.\n\nAfter stealing the ball from Utah\u2019s Jakob Poeltl, who was driving to the basket, Reid tried dribbling up court. But Poeltl appeared to bump Reid and the Oregon State player slipped and fell to the floor.\n\nReid complained that there was no foul call, and while getting up seemed to make eye contact with Nunez. Then, he stuck his right leg out and Nunez fell.\n\nAfterward, Tinkle said he didn\u2019t see the play, but said Reid \u201cswore he didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are obviously very disappointed and apologize to everyone involved,\u201d Tinkle said in a statement Monday. \u201cOur university and our program do not condone this type of conduct on or off the court. We acted swiftly and severely, but also fairly with the understanding that we are dealing with a 22-year-old young man that we need to help grow through this tough situation.\u201d\n\nThe Pac-12 Conference reviewed and accepted Oregon State\u2019s punishment.\n\n\u201cRegardless of Mr. Reid\u2019s frustration and emotion, such behavior towards a game official is unacceptable and the conference supports Oregon State\u2019s disciplinary actions,\u201d Commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement. \u201cThe Conference will take no further disciplinary action.\u201d\n\nUtah coach Larry Krystkowiak said Tinkle texted him following the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a high-emotion, high-energy (environment), you know? And we\u2019re still dealing with 18-, 20-, 21-year-old kids. And not everything always goes as planned. You know?\u2019 Krystkowiak said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s an unfortunate incident. It\u2019s obviously a pretty slow news time because it\u2019s garnered a lot of national attention. I feel sorry for the kid and I feel sorry for their team.\u201d\n\nReid will be allowed to practice during the suspension, but he cannot be with the team on game days.
