Brookings, SD

Hundreds of children have received lifesaving help from the Children's Miracle Network and now some of those kids are sharing their story to help others.

"We wrote thanks for making our family smile. Love Brooklyn and Katelyn," said Brooklyn Tennant who co-designed the green mug with her sister Katelyn.



"I've gotten cured from so many things so it makes us smile," said Katelyn Tennant

A project started as a fundraiser has a very personal message attached with it. Each Miracle Mug bears a hand written note from a child helped by CMN.

"I really wanted to do a project that was bigger and really involved more of the public. And I love raising money for Children's Miracle Network," Said Miss State Fair Jade Possail, organizer of the Miracle Mug project.

"So I thought of a news idea and I just had the kids write little thank you notes and we had them printed on mugs and they are selling like hot cakes," said Possail.

Choco Latte in Brookings hosted the Miracle Mug event. And with every aspect of the project sponsored by donors the event is a win for the children of CMN.

"All procedes go to the Children's Miracle Network and it just makes you feel really proud to be a part of it," said Choco Latte Manager and Co-Owner Donna Beahernd.

As the Tennant sisters reflect on the mug they designed they hope it will bring a smile for others as well.

"I think they are really inspiring because they were made by the kids who were in the hospital and everything. Its just kinda like how they felt and everything when they were in the hospital," said Brooklyn Tennant.

Possail expects to raise almost three thousand dollars for CMN with the mugs. And if you missed out on the Brookings event itâ€™s not too late You can contact Miss State Fair to order a Mug.
