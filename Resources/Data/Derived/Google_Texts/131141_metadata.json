Sometimes the monsters who commit them have names like Dylann Roof, but more often than not they have names like Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez or Nidal Malik Hasan. Given the fact that the vast majority of people in America are Christian, and only a small minority are Muslim, the preponderance of Muslim mass killers only further highlights the disproportionate number of killers who come from that community. Let's be very direct: a substantial minority of Muslims in the world support terrorism and genocide. That has to be true for organizations like ISIS, the Taliban, Boko Haram, al-Qaeda, al-Shabaab, and so on to exist. These are large organizations, and they cannot exist without members and supporters, most (but not all) of them from countries in the Middle East.\n\nDoes it make sense, then, that we allow immigration of Muslims into the U.S.? Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez was a Muslim Palestinian immigrant from Kuwait. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who bombed the Boston Marathon, was a Muslim immigrant from Kyrgyzstan. They both killed many people. And they are not the only ones. Most Muslims we let into the United States will not become mass murderers. But the problem is that a substantial minority of them sympathize with mass murderers, and some of those will go on to actually become mass murderers. And the biggest point to make is that there is often no way for authorities to distinguish between a \"conservative religious Muslim\" and a \"conservative religious Muslim who will commit mass murder.\" Given that, does it not make sense that we should limit immigration of Muslims into America? If this were World War II, would we admit immigrants from Germany? If this were the 1950s, would we admit immigrants from Korea, or from North Vietnam in the 1960s? Of course not. Because we were at war with them. Let's be frank: we are currently at war with a extremely violent and radical minority of the Muslim population of the world. When they are off the battlefield, they are often impossible to identify. Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez was not on anyone's radar. He seemed like a normal middle-class boy (well, normal except for the marijuana and the use of a \"white powdery substance\" under his nose that he told the police was caffeine powder). Given that, why can't we speak frankly and say, \"We don't know who these killers are in advance. But quite frequently they are foreign-born Muslims, some of whom we are at war with, or more to the point feel that they are at war with us. Why shouldn't we have a discussion about limiting their entry into the United States?\" You know, if we had white immigrants from South Africa, and a minority of those were mass-murdering blacks in America, you can bet that immigration would be stopped immediately. Why should this be any different? If people can be made to understand that open borders and the importation of Muslim refugees has a part in mass murders, perhaps minds can be changed. Politicians call dismissively for \"better screening,\" but how can you really look into the background of thousands of people from a third-world country? Unless they are already on a terrorist watch list, what the State Department does is basically take them at their word. If people could be made to realize that this \"screening\" is a sham, perhaps minds could be changed. Above all, we have to fight the racism or \"Islamophobia\" tag. A phobia, after all, is a fear not based in reality. But this fear is based on a very real threat. We take our first steps when each of us speaks out. The left silences us by making us afraid to talk. But if enough of us start talking about it, it will create a space that will be acceptable. That's what Mark Levin does, making topics acceptable so other hosts can talk about them. And on a smaller scale, you can do it, too, in your own community with your friends and neighbors.
