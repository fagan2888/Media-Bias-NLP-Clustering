Instead, Chairman Bob Connolly said it hopes to stand out by being a nonprofit run by its members.\n\n\u201cThe difference is who we are, what we represent and what we stand for,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nThe cooperative is being started with up to $56.4 million in loans awarded under the Affordable Care Act. The money will go toward startup costs and meeting state requirements on reserves for insurance companies. It cannot be used for marketing, so the cooperative is relying on volunteers to get the word out by distributing fliers and talking to neighbors.\n\n\u201cHow many people do you know that are going door-to-door telling their neighbors about health insurance?\u201d Connolly asked a recent meeting of organizers.\n\nThe goal is to sign up 10,000 customers in the first year. Bob De Vita, Common Ground\u2019s chief executive officer, estimated the cooperative can break even with 20,000 to 30,000 customers.\n\nJim Wesp, owner of Kettle Moraine Hardwoods and vice president of Common Ground\u2019s board, said he was interested in the idea of a nonprofit because his company and five of its workers are paying about $50,000 a year for health coverage. He also liked the idea of a cooperative.\n\n\u201cAs a member, I will have the ability to have some say in how the plan is run,\u201d Wesp said.\n\nCommon Ground is not the first nonprofit health insurance company in Wisconsin. Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin was started in the 1970s with a federal loan. Its former director, Larry Zanoni, was an early adviser to Common Ground.\n\n\u201cThe best advice he gave us is to be persistent,\u201d De Vita said, \u201cbecause people thought he was crazy.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 Associated Press.
