In the past five years alone, more than 44,000 millennials have moved here.\n\n\u201cAnd that number keeps on growing,\u201d Michael Hecht, president and CEO of Greater New Orleans Inc., an organization that promotes local businesses in the area, told The Daily Signal.\n\nTo document the area\u2019s growing transformation, The Daily Signal traveled to New Orleans to interview three millennials who moved there for a short stint with Teach for America, then decided to stay.\n\nOne of them, Cari Killian, is now the chief academic officer at ARISE charter schools. After working hands-on for Teach for America after the storm, she decided she wanted to see the city through its charter school transformation. Before the storm, Killian told The Daily Signal she never could have imagined raising children in a city notorious for its failing school system. Today, she couldn\u2019t imagine living anywhere else\u2014and is pregnant with her second child.\n\n>>> Related: Here\u2019s How Hurricane Katrina Changed Schools in New Orleans\n\nTom Hayes, another Teach for America alum, helped launch 4.0 Schools, which equips entrepreneurs to create new education startup companies and schools. Now Hayes is the general manager for Uber New Orleans, and he recently succeeded in getting the ride-sharing program approved in a city that previously had a hard time embracing change. With a business degree from Stanford University, Hayes is used to investing in the future of young companies. But today, he\u2019s investing in something different: the future of New Orleans. \u201cI\u2019m here and fully invested because believe in this place,\u201d Hayes told The Daily Signal.\n\nBrian Bordainick also moved to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to work for Teach for America. After building the now famous \u201cField of Dreams\u201d to provide inner-city schoolchildren a place to play sports after school, Bordainick founded Dinner Lab, a company that identifies up-and-coming chefs and lets them test their menus at pop-up locations for small dinner parties in front of strangers who become friends. What started in Bordainick\u2019s small French Quarter apartment now has locations across the country. He says New Orleans wasn\u2019t just a ripe location to start a company, but also a place with a quality of life he couldn\u2019t get anywhere else.\n\nKillian, Hayes, and Bordainick have all been a part of New Orleans\u2019s so-called \u201crebirth,\u201d and in doing so, they have challenged a narrative so often heard in the media\u2014that this generation is \u201cselfish and entitled.\u201d\n\n>>> Related: How One Catholic School Found Faith in the Floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina", "article_metadata": {"description": "They want to give back.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "They want to give back.", "title": "Millennials Are Moving to New Orleans", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Dinnerlabnola.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-07T09:22:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KujVBl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "They want to give back.", "title": "Millennials Are Moving to New Orleans", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Dinnerlabnola.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "American Dream", "published_time": "2015-09-07T03:01:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-07T09:22:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "millennials, new orleans, greater new orleans inc, dinner lab, arise schools, uber new orleans, Brian Bordainick"}, "article_summary": "NEW ORLEANS\u2014Millennials are moving to New Orleans by the thousands, and it\u2019s not just for Bourbon Street.\nBrian Bordainick also moved to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to work for Teach for America.\nSince Hurricane Katrina, young entrepreneurs have flooded the city, finding opportunities to start businesses, have families, and give back.\nTo document the area\u2019s growing transformation, The Daily Signal traveled to New Orleans to interview three millennials who moved there for a short stint with Teach for America, then decided to stay.\nIn the past five years alone, more than 44,000 millennials have moved here."}
