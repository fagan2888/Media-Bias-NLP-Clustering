However, when Kevin Bond tried to boost the reach of his community page on Facebook, Hudson\u2019s Heart, not only did the social media site reject his $20 advertising purchase, but it also placed the picture he used of his son in the same category as zombies, ghosts, and dismembered bodies, WTVD reported.\n\n\"Facebook thinks my Son is offensive,\" Bond wrote on the Hudson's Heart Facebook page. \"In an effort to get the word out about Hudson I occasionally pay a small amount to boost posts here on Hudson's Heart. Yesterday Facebook refused my $20.00 boost and sent the following: Reason(s): Your ad wasn't approved because the image or video thumbnail is scary, gory, or sensational and evokes a negative response. Images including accidents, car crashes, dead and dismembered bodies, ghosts, zombies, ghouls, and vampires are not allowed.\"\n\nThe picture that did not meet Facebook\u2019s advertisement guidelines shows 2-month-old Hudson on a hospital bed in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit at Duke Children\u2019s Hospital with tubes taped to his nose and stuffed animals at this side. Bond hoped that boosting the Hudson\u2019s Heart Facebook page would help get his family a little closer to their goal of $75,000, which is needed to pay for Hudson\u2019s heart transplant. Thankfully, generous contributors have already helped raise over $29,100 on Hudson\u2019s Children\u2019s Organ Transplant Association page.\n\n\u201cI read Facebook's response on media outlets last night,\u201d Bond said on his most recent Facebook post. \u201cThey apologized for the inconvenience this caused my family. Inconvenience was never an issue. Having my beautiful Son compared to dismembered bodies, vampires, zombies, etcetera hurt me, and my family. The ad in question was time sensitive. Reversing their decision days later fixes nothing. Further, the company still hasn't contacted me directly. Had I not read their half hearted apology on the media I'd have no idea it existed.\u201d\n\nFacebook/Hudson's Heart Facebook/Hudson's Heart", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "facebook, son, heart, transplant", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Facebook told a North Carolina father he could not boost the reach of his fundraising page in hopes of raising money for his son's heart transplant because the picture he used of his son was \"offensive.\"", "title": "Facebook Thinks Dad Raising Money For Son's Heart Transplant Is 'Offensive'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/facebook-tells-dad-raising-money-infant-sons-heart-transplant-his-page-offensive-302292", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/hudson-azera-bond.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Facebook told a North Carolina father he could not boost the reach of his fundraising page in hopes of raising money for his son's heart transplant because the picture he used of his son was \"offensive.\"", "title": "Facebook Thinks Dad Raising Money For Son's Heart Transplant Is 'Offensive'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/facebook-tells-dad-raising-money-infant-sons-heart-transplant-his-page-offensive-302292", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/hudson-azera-bond.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/hudson-azera-bond.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-10T11:39:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-10T11:39:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Facebook told a North Carolina father he could not boost the reach of his fundraising page in hopes of raising money for his son's heart transplant because the picture he used of his son was \"offensive.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3774\"", "article_summary": "\"Facebook thinks my Son is offensive,\" Bond wrote on the Hudson's Heart Facebook page.\nBond hoped that boosting the Hudson\u2019s Heart Facebook page would help get his family a little closer to their goal of $75,000, which is needed to pay for Hudson\u2019s heart transplant.\nHad I not read their half hearted apology on the media I'd have no idea it existed.\u201dFacebook/Hudson's Heart Facebook/Hudson's Heart\n\"In an effort to get the word out about Hudson I occasionally pay a small amount to boost posts here on Hudson's Heart.\nThankfully, generous contributors have already helped raise over $29,100 on Hudson\u2019s Children\u2019s Organ Transplant Association page."}
