Eugene Washington, chancellor for health affairs and president and CEO of Duke University Health System, already knows what he wants to accomplish.\n\n\u201cWe can really make this a model city, county and area from the perspective of population health improvement,\u201d Washington said.\n\nSince taking over for Victor Dzau\u2014who held the position for a decade, established multiple institutes and implemented an electronic medical records system\u2014on April 1, Washington has been preparing to make his own mark on DUHS. In overseeing education, healthcare and clinical practice, Washington hopes to strengthen cross-campus collaboration between the School of Medicine and the University\u2019s other schools to counteract the effects of dwindling research funding and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOne of the main reasons Washington chose to come to Duke was the opportunity to drive high-caliber programs related to medicine from other disciplines\u2014law, business, public policy and engineering\u2014in close proximity to one another, he explained, noting that his goal of building a model for population health management is more realistic in his new role.\n\n\u201cI jokingly say to just about everybody, last time I checked it says chancellor for health affairs at Duke, not chancellor for health affairs in the medical school or the Nursing School,\u201d Washington said about the opportunity to work across the entire campus.\n\nWashington, 64, previously held major administrative positions at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, San Francisco, where \u201che has done many of the things we\u2019re interested in building at Duke,\u201d Provost Sally Kornbluth said.\n\nAn already decorated health-policy scholar, he is now hoping to use his role as a University representative to partner with businesses, the city of Durham and other forms of government to begin improving health beyond campus borders and to \u201ccreate something that few institutions could match.\u201d\n\nPart of Washington\u2019s extensive research background has been in assessing the effects of medical technologies. These will become increasingly important as a result of the Affordable Care Act, since DUHS and other health systems will be incentivized to minimize the number of patients coming into hospitals and shift from individual healthcare to population-based treatment, he explained.\n\n\u201cAffordable care from my vantage point is going to motivate us to focus more on health promotion and wellness,\u201d Washington said.\n\nWashington also explained that the use of different forms of telemedicine at Duke and across the nation, as well as virtual communication between health providers, will be crucial for managing the health of both individual patients and entire populations. Ways to more efficiently use resources within a changing healthcare landscape will be a major focus of Washington\u2019s strategic planning efforts and meetings with the DUHS Board of Directors in the upcoming year.\n\nEfforts will be made to prepare the schools of medicine, nursing and others for the future as well, Washington noted, explaining that he hopes to foster more interdisciplinary professional education.\n\n\u201cI see it as a first order of business, if we think about healthcare in 2020 and what that looks like. One of the things that we\u2019ll see is even more of a team approach for taking care of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does include the physician assistant program we have, but it certainly includes nursing and medicine.\u201d\n\nAs part of his push to maximize resources through cross-campus initiatives, Washington also wants to emphasize quantitative science because of its wide applications in medicine and because of Duke\u2019s strengths in engineering, math, computer science and statistics.\n\n\u201cFrom whether you\u2019re doing research at the molecular level to studying whole populations, understanding quantitative signs in terms of big data\u2014how you constitute it, how you access it, how you form it and package it to get it out for use\u2014starts with the having the right people in our community and the right infrastructure to work with,\u201d he explained.\n\nAlthough Duke\u2019s on-campus programs and people led Washington to move his career across the country, its global presence also attracted him to the role, especially the Duke Global Health Institute and the University\u2019s partnership with the National University of Singapore through Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore. Washington has already funded multiple global health programs that were up for renewal and traveled to Singapore as part of his mission to use the University\u2019s resources to change population healthcare.\n\nOne of the reasons to expect more instances of University medicine-related collaboration under Washington\u2019s direction is his personality, which Kornbluth noted is a major reason that discussions about partnerships involving quantitative sciences have been so productive.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so affable, friendly and easy to talk to. It\u2019s not only his intellectual talents \u2014 it\u2019s the fact that he can really get along with everybody and get people to work together,\u201d she said.\n\nNow with his transitional first 100 days as chancellor behind him, Washington has his sights set on not only making the areas surrounding Duke a model for population healthcare, but making the path to get there a blueprint for other universities to use as well.\n\n\u201cThe whole goal is at Duke is that we don\u2019t just do this to take care of ourselves, or even to be ready for today. We accept the obligation to create this for the future, to help other institutions figure this out,\u201d Washington said. \u201cIf not at Duke, then where?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://ds4q8c259towh.cloudfront.net/20160415XJlq9-dXcb/dist/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "He has only been at Duke since April, but Dr. A.
