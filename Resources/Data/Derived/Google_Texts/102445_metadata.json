It\u2019s the second time the father has placed second to the son. It\u2019s the fifth consecutive year that the title has gone to a Seavey.\n\nBut fans will equally remember Aliy Zirkle\u2019s third-place finish \u2013 her fifth consecutive top-5 finish \u2013 after a harrowing nighttime encounter on the trail with a snowmobile in which one of her dogs was injured. The snowmobile was driven by a Nulato man who was allegedly drunk at the time.\n\nRELATED: Iditarod Dog-Slaying Accident \u2018Tip of Iceberg\u2019 in Substance Abuse Issues in Rural Alaska\n\nZirkle and the rest of her team recovered enough emotionally from the incident to finish the race. Jeff King and team later had an encounter with the same snowmobile, which struck and killed one of his dogs and injured two others. King, a four-time Iditarod champion, and team finished ninth \u2013 King\u2019s 20th career top-10 finish.\n\nPete Kaiser, Yup\u2019ik, of Bethel capped a great season \u2013 he earlier won his second consecutive Kuskokwim 300 \u2013 by placing fifth, arriving in Nome two minutes after fourth-place finisher Wade Marrs. It\u2019s Kaiser\u2019s second fifth-place finish and his third top-10 finish in seven Iditarods.\n\nJoar Leifseth Ulsom of Mo I Rana, Norway, placed sixth \u2013 his fourth top-10 Iditarod finish in as many races.\n\nFourth-year Iditarod competitor Richie Diehl, Dena\u2019ina Athabascan, finished 12th, his career best.\n\nRELATED: Iditarod Updated: Pete Kaiser Fourth at Mid-Point\n\nJohn Baker, Inupiaq, the last champion before the Age of Seavey, finished 17th, arriving in Nome to traditional drumming, song and dance.\n\nRookie Lars Monsen, Sami, finished 29th.\n\nAnother memorable performance: Mike Williams Jr., Yup\u2019ik, of Akiak (eighth, 2012), skipped the 2015 Iditarod to train for this year\u2019s race. But Akiak is on the front lines of global warming \u2013 a large chunk of his father\u2019s property sloughed off into the Kuskokwim River, the permafrost having melted \u2013 and it was hard to find suitable places to train because of lack of snow. As the sun set in Nome on March 15, Williams and team (he was down to six dogs, from 16), were five checkpoints back, in Shaktoolik, setting their sights on just finishing the race. They finished 48th, crossing the finish line at 5:15 p.m. March 17.\n\n\u201cThe eyes of the world every first Saturday and Sunday in March are on [the Iditarod] because of what could be \u2013 the great unknown this trail has to offer all of these mushers, both men and women, over 80 teams this year,\u201d Iditarod commentator Greg Heister said on Iditarod Insider. \u201cIn the Alaska Range, the creek and river crossings [were] just a part of what we saw.\u201d\n\nFellow commentator Bruce Lee added, \u201cAlaska always throws something at the musher. That\u2019s part of the intrigue. Whether windstorms or whatever \u2013 water, lack of snow \u2013 that\u2019s just part of the Iditarod.\u201d\n\nLee recalled that at Rainy Pass, mushers and dogs had to cross flowing creeks, exposed because of melted ice. Most mushers and dogs arrived at the Rohn checkpoint with wet gear and in wet clothes. \u201cThen, on the other side of the Alaska Range, they were running on dirt for 20 to 30 miles,\u201d Lee recalled.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dallas Seavey, 28, at one time the youngest musher to win the Iditarod (2012), became the youngest to win three consecutive titles.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/03/19/dallas-seavey-continues-iditarod-dominance-win-163816", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/dallas_seavey_and_his_lead_dogs_at_the_finish_line_of_the_iditarod_trail_sled_dog_race_-_ap_photo_mark_thiessen.jpeg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Dallas Seavey Continues Iditarod Dominance With Win"}, "abstract": "Dallas Seavey, 28, at one time the youngest musher to win the Iditarod (2012), became the youngest to win three consecutive titles.", "dc": {"title": "Dallas Seavey Continues Iditarod Dominance With Win"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/03/19/dallas-seavey-continues-iditarod-dominance-win-163816", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Dallas Seavey, Mitch Seavey, Aliy Zirkle, Jeff King, Pete Kaiser, Wade Marrs, Joar Leifseth Ulsom, Richie Diehl, John Baker, Lars Monsen, Mike Williams Jr., Ellen Halvorson, Greg Heister, Bruce Lee, Dee Dee Jonrowe, Brent Sass, Lance Mackey, Rick Swenson, Richard Walker", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2016-03-19T09:25-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Dallas Seavey Continues Iditarod Dominance With Win"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b0a\"", "article_summary": "Joar Leifseth Ulsom of Mo I Rana, Norway, placed sixth \u2013 his fourth top-10 Iditarod finish in as many races.\nKing, a four-time Iditarod champion, and team finished ninth \u2013 King\u2019s 20th career top-10 finish.\nIt\u2019s Kaiser\u2019s second fifth-place finish and his third top-10 finish in seven Iditarods.\nDallas Seavey, 28, at one time the youngest musher to win the Iditarod (2012), became the youngest to win three consecutive titles (2016, 2015, 2014) when he crossed the finish line in Nome at 2:20 a.m. March 15.\nFollowing Seavey in second place was his father, two-time champion Mitch (2013, 2004), who crossed the finish line 45 minutes later."}
