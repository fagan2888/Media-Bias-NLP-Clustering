At U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan's town hall meeting this week, where he hosted the acting Social Security Commissioner, members of the audience -- almost exclusively Social Security recipients -- had some interesting things to say about next year's lack of a cost-of-living adjustment.

They mentioned how Medicare premium increases tend to swallow up whatever rise in monthly benefits does occur. Diana Profant of Sarasota said lots of her friends are signing up for the for-profit Medicare Advantage plans -- even though they know that they're not as good a deal as the traditional Medicare parts B and D for most people -- because there's often no premium charge upfront.

A light went on in my head when she said this, because I have been puzzled at the success of these for-profit plans, which can involve high co-pays and even higher out-of-network costs -- and I've heard from readers that a lot of their costs turn out to be outside those strictly limited networks of health care providers. I thought it was glossy brochures and soft-focus TV ads that were luring elders away from traditional Medicare.

But I see now that the choose-now-pay-later option must have a lot to do with it. Who wouldn't be entranced by the lure of no monthly premium, and decide to hope for the best as far as actual health care costs go?

But if you are among the 87 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries who coast through the annual open enrollment period -- going on now, through Dec. 7 -- this might be a good time to consider making a change. Premiums are expected to increase for a lot of the Part D drug plans, and Part B increases of 52 percent are a strong probability for people who are in high income brackets, new to Social Security in 2016, or enrolled in Medicare but not in Social Security.
