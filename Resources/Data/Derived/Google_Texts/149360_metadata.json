But this lifestyle isn\u2019t expensive. Quite the opposite: It saved us over $100,200 in a single year.\n\nAnd we got to live in places like this:\n\nAnd this:\n\nAnd enjoy office views like this:\n\nHow did we do it?\n\nWe followed three simple strategies:\n\nStop paying rent and other monthly expenses. Stop paying for (or reduce) health insurance. Eliminate (or reduce) federal income tax.\n\nWho can do this?\n\nThese three strategies work perfectly if you:\n\nWant to travel the world\n\nCan stay outside the US for 11 months in a year\n\nWork remotely\n\nNote: You don\u2019t need all three of the above to save big. If only one of the above works for you, great. If all three apply, however, you\u2019ll get the most value from this article.\n\nFor example, my wife and I are business consultants, own our own websites (KeepInspiring.me and 10xToday.com), and work from anywhere in the world, so we benefit greatly from all three strategies. Let\u2019s take a look at each strategy in detail.\n\nThese strategies aren\u2019t just for jetsetters without kids. Each of the following three strategies work equally well for families, and people who, like us, prefer to travel slowly. Talon, from 1Dad1Kid.com, told us he\u2019s been traveling with his son since May 2011.\n\nStrategy 1: House-sitting\n\nTwo years ago, we discovered house-sitting as a way to see the world for next to nothing. If you're unfamiliar with house-sitting, it's a simple process.\n\nHomeowners need someone (i.e. you) to look after their home and pets while they\u2019re away. (They might be going on vacation, or extended assignment.) Because of this, you can stay in their home \u2014 for free.\n\nSince we started house-sitting, we have lived in:\n\nEngland\n\nMorocco\n\nVancouver, Canada\n\nAshland, Oregon\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\nSonoma, California\n\n\n\nHere's a picture of our current \u201coffice\u201d view in Asilah, Morocco:\n\nHouse-sitting is a win-win: Homeowners have someone care for their home and pets while they\u2019re away; house sitters get to travel, make new friends \u2014 and save a ton of money.\n\nWhere can you find house-sits? The most common locations are in:\n\nEngland\n\nEurope\n\nCanada\n\nUnited States\n\nAustralia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nAt any given time there are over well over 1,000 house-sits available worldwide on main house-sitting sites.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s a map of current house-sits available on TrustedHousesitters.com:\n\nWhen we started house-sitting, we would accept assignments between two weeks and three months. But we transitioned to long-term assignments \u2014 ranging from three to six months \u2014 because we found it easier to work while traveling less frequently.\n\nRegardless of how long you travel, the savings are huge. When we lived in California, we paid about $2,500 for rent and monthly expenses like Wi-Fi, utilities, and garbage.\n\nBy comparison, house-sitting lets us travel the world, make new friends, and save roughly $30,000 a year.\n\nTotal savings: $30,000 a year.\n\nStrategy 2: Get cheaper health insurance abroad (and avoid Obamacare penalties)\n\nIn the US, you\u2019re required to pay health insurance.\n\nIf you decide against insurance, you must pay the Obamacare penalty, also known as the Individual Shared Responsibility Fee. (You gotta love that name, right?)\n\nAccording to HealthCare.gov, the fee for not having insurance is:\n\n$325 per adult and $162.50 per child (up to $975 for a family); or\n\n2.5% of your 2015 taxable income \u2014 whichever is greater.\n\nTo avoid the penalty last year, we spent $7,200 on health insurance \u2014 which we didn\u2019t use.\n\nBut if you\u2019re outside of the US for a year, you don't have to pay the Obamacare fee. Instead, you simply pay for travel insurance that covers emergency medical care.\n\nTo be honest, we didn't pay for health insurance this year. (Dumb, I know; we\u2019re getting insurance now.)\n\nIf you do want insurance while traveling \u2014 which is a good idea \u2014 you can buy cheap travel insurance for $500\u2013$2,000 a year, which is still a significant savings over health insurance in the US. Here\u2019s a list of Frommer\u2019s top eight travel insurance providers.\n\nTotal savings: $7,200 a year\n\nStrategy 3: Save big on taxes with the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve covered two strategies that saved us $37,200 while traveling abroad. But I'm sure you\u2019ll agree we saved the best for last: the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion.\n\nThe exclusion is a tax break for US citizens living abroad.\n\nAccording to the IRS, if you\u2019re looking to qualify, you must meet one of the following criteria:\n\nA US citizen who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries for an uninterrupted period that includes an entire tax year,\n\nA US resident alien who is a citizen or national of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty in effect and who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries for an uninterrupted period that includes an entire tax year, or\n\nA US citizen or a US resident alien who is physically present in a foreign country or countries for at least 330 full days during any period of 12 consecutive months.\n\nThat last item applies to my wife and me. Because we\u2019re house sitting abroad, we spend the required 330 days \u2014 11 months \u2014 outside the US. (Note: Your 330 days abroad needn\u2019t be consecutive. For example, you will still qualify if you spend 180 days abroad, return to the US for 30 days, and then leave the US for at least another 155 days.)\n\nFor income earned in 2015, you can write off up to $100,800. Since we\u2019re married, we can write off $201,600 \u2014 which translates to $63,000 in tax savings. (Note: The savings may be higher or lower in your case; check with your financial planner or CPA before you proceed with this.)\n\nTotal savings: $63,000\n\nTotal savings from these three strategies: $100,200\n\nWhat\u2019s even better?\n\nYou can use the money you saved to increase your income even more. Instead of investing it in real estate or the stock market, consider buying an online business, giving you the freedom to travel. The options are endless!\n\nRemember, the way we\u2019ve been taught to save money is wrong. Follow these simple strategies and save more money \u2014 while living your best life possible.\n\nWhat\u2019s stopping you?\n\nAdam Costa is a business consultant, travel junkie, house-sitter, and writer.
