Focus (Feb 27th)

An original film for an adult audience is a rarity in 2015. Bad Santa writers Glen Ficarra and John Requa are giving it a go with a modern twist on a classic con man tale. Will Smith, in bad need of a win, plays the grizzled veteran con man who takes a young player under his wing only for his feelings to get in the way.
