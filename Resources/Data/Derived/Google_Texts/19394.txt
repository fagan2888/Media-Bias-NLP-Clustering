The latest viral hit today is Kristen Bell as Mary Poppins, singing about how much it sucks to make minimum wage. Well, of course, a politically-tinged video like that was going to warrant a response, but perhaps none so creative as this: a musical rebuttal by Reason Magazine’s Remy, who dresses up like another familiar Mary Poppins character…

Lyrics in this Mary Poppins rebuttal (that feels weird to say) include, “I don’t mean to sound too partial, you’re forgetting, Sarah Marshall, unintended consequences of these laws!” and “Just three pages of econ and perhaps your mind will change!”

The video also takes a few shots at the Veronica Mars Kickstarter and how Funny or Die, the site hosting the Poppins video, offers unpaid internships.
