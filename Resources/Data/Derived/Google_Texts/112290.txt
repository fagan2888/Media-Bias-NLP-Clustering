Authorities say no one was injured when a fire erupted at a prison in Florence.

It happened at the Florence Correctional Center around 5 p.m. Saturday at Bowling Road and Division Dam Road in Florence.

The blaze at the prison, which is operated by Corrections Corporation of America, started in the prison laundry in a dryer.

Embers from the dryer got into vents and went up to the roof. The roof had a lot of plastic on it because of work that was being done on the roof. The plastic caused a huge plume of black smoke.

One housing unit was moved to another area of the prison.
