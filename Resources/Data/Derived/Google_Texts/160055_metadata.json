His pickings are, indeed, very slim. So are the chances of Ohio Gov. John Kasich winning the GOP nomination. But Laramore reluctantly voted for him on Tuesday anyway.\n\n\u201cOf the three options, he is by far the least objectionable to me,\u201d Laramore said during a phone interview from Indianapolis. \u201cTrump is a buffoon. I\u2019ve never believed he was truly serious about being president of the United States.\u201d\n\nKasich, who seems like a moderate but really isn\u2019t, has not been campaigning in Indiana before Tuesday\u2019s primary as part of his alliance with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to stop Trump from earning enough delegates to earn the nomination before the GOP convention.\n\nAs for Cruz, Laramore said, \u201cI actually think of him as rather dangerous from the standpoint that he is a smart guy. Harvard trained attorney. But he\u2019s an ideologue.\u201d\n\nLaramore, 50, a writer and social investment banker, sees himself as a \u201cstrong defense\u201d and \u201cfiscal conservative\u201d kind of Republican. But, when it comes to race, he says there is an acute disconnect between the party and black Americans like himself. Laramore blames the Republican Party for what he thinks are his poor primary choices: the racism it refused to curtail, the religious fervor that targets anything not Christian as the enemy and its overall refusal to foster relationships in non-white communities.\n\nSo Laramore is now left to pick between a man who thinks building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico is sound foreign policy, his preferred candidate who is not even campaigning in his home state and another who one once tweeted that net neutrality is akin to Obamacare. While the media have enjoyed the circus, Laramore feels isolated within his own party.\n\n\u201cYour average base Republican would really consider me a big RINO,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m generally conservative, but I\u2019m black and I don\u2019t forget the history of black people in America.\u201d\n\nA Republican for 10 years, Laramore has yet to vote for a GOP candidate for president. In 2008 and 2012, he cast his ballot for Barack Obama. The obstructionist mindset Republican leadership took toward Obama during his first four years further alienated him; Laramore responded by canvassing for the President in 2012.\n\n\u201cMy party is hilarious.\u201d\n\nLeah Wright Rigueur, Assistant Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, says black Republicans are more likely to switch their party support during presidential elections than any other voting demographic. In her recently published book The Loneliness of the Black Republican: Pragmatic Politics and the Pursuit of Power, Rigueur goes into great detail about the GOP\u2019s successes and failures of retaining black voters.\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, she says, there was a back and forth between both parties for black support. In fact, prior to 1948, black people were just as likely to claim they were Republican as they were Democrat.\n\nHowever, African-Americans left the party in droves the 1960s, after it nominated Sen. Barry Goldwater for president. During the height of the Civil Rights Movement, Goldwater voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act, claiming it was unconstitutional. Black Americans responded by voting against him in large numbers. Some people have dubbed him as the \u201cFather of the Tea Party\u201d and believe his extremist views set the precedent for the current state of the GOP. Most people blame Trump for the state of xenophobic and anti-immigrant fervor that is energizing much of the party\u2019s base, but Rigueur says that claim is not historically accurate.\n\n\u201cThe idea that you can exploit racial and economic anxiety for political gain is not a new idea at all,\u201d she said. \u201cSome black Republicans have wrestled with this. Most are uncomfortable doing so because it means indicting the party they have affiliated themselves with for much of their political lives.\u201d\n\nAbdul-Hakim Shabazz, a black conservative and political commentator in Indianapolis, agrees with Rigueur, adding that the GOP has long struggled to strike a balance with its the hyper-conservative base of its party.\n\n\u201cFor Republicans to win and have a base that\u2019s motivated, they\u2019ve relied on the more ideological, far right crowd,\u201d said Shabazz, who runs the blog Indy Politics. \u201cAnd now the chickens have come home to roost. And there are your candidates: Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nRigueur also points out that it is very challenging to find data that truly gauges how black Republicans are responding to the current slate of Republican candidates. What we do know is that during the last 50 years, no more than 15 percent of black voters have voted for a GOP candidate for president or identified as Republican.\n\nThose are very humbling numbers and it is not likely that Trump or Cruz will reverse that trend, given how little effort the party puts into electing diverse candidates who are not extremists. Asked about the state of his party, Laramore said, \u201cMy party is hilarious.\u201d\n\nOne thing that is not a joke is Trump\u2019s chances of winning Indiana and the GOP nomination. Every major poll has Trump winning Tuesday\u2019s primary in Indiana easily. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday has Cruz trailing Trump by 15 points. During a campaign stop in Terre Haute on Sunday, Trump made it clear that the GOP nomination is his if he bags the Hoosier state.\n\n\u201cIf we win Indiana, it\u2019s over,\u201d he said to a crowd of approximately 1,500 people packed into a small theater.\n\nThough he did not say who he voted for on Tuesday, Shabazz, a Republican since 1994, recalled a joke he tells friends whenever he is asked about his voting options in the general election: \u201cHey, Abdul. Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton? Who would you vote for. I said, \u2018(Justin) Trudeau, in Canada, because that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be living.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "Who do you vote for when you're a moderate and the leading candidates are a xenophobic opportunist and a religious zealot?", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Who do you vote for when you're a moderate and the leading candidates are a xenophobic opportunist and a religious zealot?", "title": "This Black Republican Doesn't Want to Vote for Anyone\u2014and Blames the GOP", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/298225/black-republicans/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettyImages-527325402.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Who do you vote for when you're a moderate and the leading candidates are a xenophobic opportunist and a religious zealot?", "title": "This black Republican doesn't want to vote for anyone\u2014and blames the", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/298225/black-republicans/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettyImages-527325402.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "donald trump, 2016 presidential election, 2016 election, ted cruz, indiana primary, john kasich"}, "article_summary": "In her recently published book The Loneliness of the Black Republican: Pragmatic Politics and the Pursuit of Power, Rigueur goes into great detail about the GOP\u2019s successes and failures of retaining black voters.\nAaron Laramore is a black Republican in Indiana whose party\u2019s leading candidates are a xenophobic opportunist and a religious zealot.\nAs for Cruz, Laramore said, \u201cI actually think of him as rather dangerous from the standpoint that he is a smart guy.\nBut, when it comes to race, he says there is an acute disconnect between the party and black Americans like himself.\nIn fact, prior to 1948, black people were just as likely to claim they were Republican as they were Democrat."}
