What do candidates think about the issues? What measures will be on your ballot? What will happen if a given measure passes or fails? You can find out with our interactive Voter Guide, now live at oregonlive.com/voterguide.

Our guide to the Nov. 4 general election offers information on local, state and federal candidates, including their answers to a series of questions posed by reporters.

You can enter your address to get a customized ballot showing what races and measures you'll vote on. You can go to any race and compare candidates side by side. The guide also outlines statewide ballot measures and local initiatives, explaining what happens with a yes or no vote.

In the governor's race, we asked the candidates whether they support or oppose legal marijuana, driver cards, GMO labeling and other issues that will be decided in statewide measures.

In the U.S. Senate race that pits Republican Monica Wehby, Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley and some minor-party candidates, we asked for opinions on the Affordable Care Act, the Highway Trust Fund and other hot topics.

Try the interactive guide and let us know what you think.
