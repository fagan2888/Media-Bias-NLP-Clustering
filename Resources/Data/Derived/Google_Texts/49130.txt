Story highlights Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Tuesday announced he was ending his campaign for president

"This is not my time," Jindal told Fox News' Bret Baier

Washington (CNN) Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Tuesday announced he was ending his campaign for president.

"This is not my time," Jindal told Fox News' Bret Baier. "I've come to the realization that this is not my time. So I've come here to announce that I am suspending my campaign for president of the United States."

Jindal, 44, was once seen as a rising star in the Republican Party and a strong contender for the White House. The Brown University graduate and Rhodes Scholar was viewed as a strong voice for a Republican Party looking to reach out to minorities and broaden its base.

He rose to prominence at the start of President Barack Obama's first term and was given a major spot delivering the Republican Party's rebuttal to the State of the Union address in 2009, but delivered a widely-panned performance.

Jindal's presidential campaign never gained traction as he, along with other establishment Republican candidates, fell victim to the GOP's desire for outsider candidates such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who have never held public office.
