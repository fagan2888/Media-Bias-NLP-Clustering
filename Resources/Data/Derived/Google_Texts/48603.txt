The ensemble is also not one to shy away from ambitious projects or new music Â— both of which will be a part of its performance Sunday afternoon as part of Chamber Music Tulsa's season.

This quartet of British musicians, which formed in 1998 when the members were students at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, will include a work commissioned for it as well as one of the string quartets by Beethoven in its concert, which begins at 3 p.m. at the Tulsa PAC, 110 E. Second St.

The Beethoven work is significant, as the Elias quartet earlier this year began a series of performances at London Wigmore Hall that will encompass all the string quartets Beethoven wrote. Each concert in this Beethoven cycle, which will take 18 months to complete, will be recorded.

Sunday's concert will feature the second of the so-called "Razumovsky" Quartets, the Quartet No. 8 in E Minor, Op. 59, No. 2.

Also on the program is "Reed Stanzas," a quartet by the English composer Sally Beamish, written in 2011 and inspired by the Scottish landscape where the composer now lives. Rounding out the program will be the Quartet in F Major, Op. 77, No. 2, Hob. III:82, by Haydn.

Tickets are $5-$25. 918-596-7111, myticketoffice.com

'Paint It Black'

Today's the last opportunity to see Tulsa Ballet's mixed-bill program "Paint It Black," with ballets including the industrial "In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated," the mysteriously elegiac "Extremely Close," and the raucous "Rooster," which will make you think about some classic Rolling Stones songs in a whole new way.

Performance is 3 p.m. Sunday at the Lorton Performance Center at the University of Tulsa, 550 S. Gary Ave. Tickets are $20-$99. 918-749-6006, myticketoffice.com

Henry Zarrow Center For Art And Education

'Painted Faces'

Practically from the moment man first started making marks on whatever surface was at hand, capturing the human face has been a primary artistic pursuit.

Tulsa artist Mark Lewis, who is also an applied associate professor at the University of Tulsa, has curated the exhibit "Painted Faces," now on display at the Henry Zarrow Center for Art and Education, 124 E. Brady St.

The exhibit, which draws a great deal from a local collector, features some of the myriad ways contemporary artists have dealt with the challenge of painting the human face.

Among the artists included in the show are Michael Ananian, Frank Auerbach, Robert Bauer, Susanna Coffey, Ann Gail, Sedrick Huckaby, Ruth Miller, Wilbur Niewald, Clifton Peacock and David Stern.

In his curator's statement, Lewis said, "The painters in this exhibition are utilizing light, form, pigment and time to touch, measure, construct, configure, conjure, discover and invent. (They) share their perceptions, their personal reflections and the people around them, touch-by-touch, accumulating one painted thought to the next.

"At times these paintings offer moments of poignant observations or insight into the tools of abstraction," Lewis writes. "They do not merely create appearances but also establish a presence."

The exhibit will be on display through April 13. For more information: utulsa.edu/zarrow

Tulsa PAC

'A Few Good Men'

A young Marine dies under mysterious circumstances while serving at Guantanamo Bay. Was it an accident during a hazing incident? Or was it a more deliberate act?

That is the mystery at the heart of "A Few Good Men," which Theatre Tulsa is presenting through March 30 at the Tulsa PAC, 110 E. Second St.

Mitch Adams and Brian Rattlingourd head the cast in this Aaron Sorkin play that moves beyond the question of who is responsible to examine ideas about honor, loyalty, betrayal and the terrible things that war sometimes requires.

Performances are 2 p.m. Sunday and March 30, 8 p.m. Thursday-Saturday. Tickets are $14-$18. 918-596-7111, myticketoffice.com

Ragtime for Tulsa

"The real American folk song," Irving Berlin wrote near the start of the 20th century, "is a rag." Ragtime for Tulsa works to maintain this art form with concerts such as the one it will present 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Tulsa PAC, 110 E. Second St.

It will feature performances by two acclaimed pianists, Bryan Wright and Dalton Ridenhour.
