What lays behind the phenomena of self-censorship in the media these days?\n\nWriting in The Weekly Standard, Tom Gross argues that the refusal by The New York Times to come clean on the targets of militant Islam is a congenital defect. Inconvenient facts simply do not appear in reports in The Times if they conflict with its worldview.\n\n\n\nCommenting on the Gray Lady\u2019s coverage of the terrorist attack in Copenhagen, Gross writes:\n\nAt the present time, over a dozen hours after other media (such as The Guardian) reported prominently on the specifically anti-Semitic nature of [the Feb. 14] attack in Copenhagen and on the fact there was a Bat Mitzvah going on in the synagogue while it was being attacked (with over 80 people including many children inside), the lengthy report on the New York Times website on the Copenhagen shootings doesn\u2019t mention the word \u201canti-Semitism\u201d once. Instead New York Times correspondent Steven Erlanger writes in his piece \u201canti-Muslim sentiment is rising in Europe.\u201d\n\nNor does The New York Times mention the bat mitzvah.\n\nThere are not so many Jews in Denmark and not many bat mitzvahs -- it seems the terrorist had done his research carefully. Yet the New York Times website home page says, at the time of writing, that the shooting was \u201cnear a synagogue.\u201d No, it wasn\u2019t near a synagogue. It was at a synagogue. The synagogue was the target. Which is why a Jew guarding the synagogue was shot dead.\n\nWith the New York Times\u2019 reporting one starts to understand how Obama and his spokespeople could say the kosher attack in Paris was \u201crandom\u201d even though the perpetrator -- interviewed live on French radio during the attack -- proudly boasted that he had come all the way across Paris in order to kill Jews gathering before the sabbath.\n\n\n\n(None of this is new, of course. Even during the Holocaust, the New York Times did all it could to avoid mentioning that those being deported to Auschwitz and other camps were being deported because they were Jews.)\n\nFor Gross, this is more than sloppy reporting. It is a choice driven by ideology. The New York Times chooses not to report on the victims of religious hatred when those victims are Jews.\n\n\n\nNot all newspapers lack the self-awareness of the New York Times. Last Thursday, Jonas Nordling, Chairman of the Swedish Union of Journalists, told parliament that free speech was under threat in Sweden. The threat came not from the state but from fear of Muslim extremists and the potential impact of threats and harassment on the reporting of unwelcome news.\n\n\n\nCommenting on Nordling\u2019s testimony, the liberal daily Sydsvenskan warned that self-censorship was now the greater threat in the West to free speech.\n\nContinue reading \"Islam, media self-censorship, The New York Times and beyond\" by George Conger.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cowardice, political correctness, or social constraints?
