One would require preschool and child care workers to have certain vaccinations; another seeks to improve vaccination rates for 2-year-olds.\n\nIf SB792 becomes law, California will be the first state in the country to require that all preschool and child care workers be immunized against measles, pertussis and the flu.\n\nSen. Tony Mendoza (D-Montebello) says that most people are startled to find out such a mandate is not already in place. \u201cMost people \u2026 say \u2018We don\u2019t do that now?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cSo this is something that\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nMendoza says that the bill is designed to protect children who cannot be vaccinated or fully vaccinated because of their age or medical condition. Ensuring that adults in close contact with the children are vaccinated will help protect these children.\n\nAs the bill currently reads, violations would be a criminal offense. Mendoza says lawmakers are working to change that.\n\nKat DeBurgh is the executive director of the Health Officers Association of California, which sponsored SB792. She said the bill is about disease control.\n\n\u201cWe certainly aren\u2019t out to arrest people who aren\u2019t vaccinated,\u201d DeBurgh said. \u201cWe wanted to make this just like any other violation of code that an inspector would look for. If you don\u2019t remediate, then there is a fine to the day care center.\u201d\n\nChild care workers who cannot show proof of vaccination would be given 90 days to comply \u2014 or employers would be required to fire them. If the employer failed to fire an unvaccinated worker, the company would face a fine of $25-$50 per day. The fines would begin after 90 days.\n\nMendoza compared the requirement to tuberculosis tests, which are already required for child care workers.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t come back with proof that you took the [tuberculosis] test and show that you\u2019re negative, you can\u2019t come back to work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same.\u201d\n\nIf the bill becomes law, it would affect more than 300,000 child care workers in more than 40,000 child care centers across the state, according to Community Care Licensing Division of the California Department of Social Services (CDSS).\n\nWhile philosophical and religious exemptions to immunization have been discussed when amending other vaccination bills, Mendoza said, lawmakers drafting SB792 are only allowing for medical exemption.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any religion against [vaccination,]\u201d Mendoza said. \u201dIf people want to read into their religion in a certain way to make it seem like they\u2019re against this as a religious right, I\u2019m not sure how they do that.\u201d\n\nAnother bill, AB1117, aims to promote vaccination of 2-year-olds who are insured under Medi-Cal managed care plans. In 2013, 39,000 2-year-olds lacked one or more recommended immunizations.\n\nThe bill proposes a five-year demonstration project to be reviewed under a contract with the University of California and other researchers. AB1117 is currently on hold in the Assembly suspense file.\n\nSB792 was scheduled to be heard by the Senate Appropriations Committee Monday, but since there are few costs associated with the bill, it is likely to bypass Appropriations and head to the Senate floor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California bill would require that child care workers are vaccinated against measles, pertussis and flu.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Next Up for Vaccines: Required for California's Child Care Workers?\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/05\\/18\\/next-up-for-vaccines-required-for-californias-child-care-workers\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-18 10:46:50\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-05-18 17:19:41\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":28132,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Children's Health\",\"Vaccine\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/05\\/462294288-e1431629128325.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "California bill would require that child care workers are vaccinated against measles, pertussis and flu.", "title": "Next Up for Vaccines: Required for California\u2019s Child Care Workers?", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/05/18/next-up-for-vaccines-required-for-californias-child-care-workers/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/05/462294288-1440x993.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "children\\'s health,vaccine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a19\"", "article_summary": "One would require preschool and child care workers to have certain vaccinations; another seeks to improve vaccination rates for 2-year-olds.\nMendoza compared the requirement to tuberculosis tests, which are already required for child care workers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same.\u201dIf the bill becomes law, it would affect more than 300,000 child care workers in more than 40,000 child care centers across the state, according to Community Care Licensing Division of the California Department of Social Services (CDSS).\nIf SB792 becomes law, California will be the first state in the country to require that all preschool and child care workers be immunized against measles, pertussis and the flu.\nIf you don\u2019t remediate, then there is a fine to the day care center.\u201dChild care workers who cannot show proof of vaccination would be given 90 days to comply \u2014 or employers would be required to fire them."}
