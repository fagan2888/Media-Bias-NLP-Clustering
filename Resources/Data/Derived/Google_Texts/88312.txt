Some hotels are starting to extend luxury benefits to all customers by completely eliminating check-in and check-out times.

According to Yahoo Travel, a “24-hour check-in/check-out policy” is the newest trend in travel.

“Early check-in and late check-out used to be something reserved for VIP hotel guests, but more and more luxury hotels are introducing flexible check-out as a general amenity to make guests feel special and give them more for their money,” Travelocity’s senior travel editor Courtney Scott told Yahoo.

In addition to offering guests flexibility, it gives them added value for their stay and could improve their overall impression of a hotel.

The Ritz-Carlton in Charlotte, N.C. recognized the popularity of its “Stay and Play 24″ package, which allowed guests checking in on Saturday to leave at any time on Sunday, and now offers the option every night.

With expensive hotel chains quickly adapting this newest trend, it remains unclear which hotel chains will lead the way with flexible check-in and check-out times.
