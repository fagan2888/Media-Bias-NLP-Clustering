When the funeral service began, they sang the national anthem in an emotional rendition in which some mourners placed fists over their chests.\n\nMandela\u2019s portrait looked over the assembly in the white marquee from behind a bank of 95 candles representing each year of his remarkable life. His casket, transported to the tent on a gun carriage and draped in the national flag, rested on a carpet of cow skins below a lectern where speakers delivered eulogies.\n\n\u201cA great tree has fallen, he is now going home to rest with his forefathers,\u201d said Chief Ngangomhlaba Matanzima, a representative of Mandela\u2019s family. \u201cWe thank them for lending us such an icon.\u201d\n\nThe songs and speeches in the tent ceremony were broadcast on big screens in the area, including at one spot on a hill overlooking Mandela\u2019s property. Several hundred people gathered there, some wearing colors of the African National Congress \u2014 the liberation movement-turned political part that Mandela used to lead \u2014 and occasionally breaking into song.\n\nNandi Mandela said her grandfather went barefoot to school in Qunu when he was boy and eventually became president and a figure of global import.\n\n\u201cIt is to each of us to achieve anything you want in life,\u201d she said, recalling kind gestures by Mandela \u201cthat made all those around him also want to do good.\u201d\n\nIn the Xhosa language, she referred to her grandfather by his clan name: \u201cGo well, Madiba. go well to the land of our ancestors, you have run your race.\u201d\n\nAhmed Kathrada, an anti-apartheid activist who was jailed on Robben Island with Mandela, remembered his old friend\u2019s \u201cabundant reserves\u201d of love, patience and tolerance. He said it was painful when he saw Mandela for the last time, months ago in his hospital bed.\n\n\u201cHe tightly held my hand, it was profoundly heartbreaking,\u201d Kathrada said, his voice breaking at times. \u201cHow I wish I never had to confront what I saw. I first met him 67 years ago and I recall the tall, healthy strong man, the boxer, the prisoner who easily wielded the pick and shovel when we couldn\u2019t do so.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"A great tree has fallen, he is now going home to rest with his forefathers,\" said a member of Mandela's family", "title": "South Africa holds state funeral for Mandela", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"A great tree has fallen, he is now going home to rest with his forefathers,\" said a member of Mandela's family", "title": "South Africa holds state funeral for Mandela", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/15/south_africa_holds_state_funeral_for_mandela/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/460x.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"A great tree has fallen, he is now going home to rest with his forefathers,\" said a member of Mandela's family", "title": "South Africa holds state funeral for Mandela", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/460x.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Christopher Torchia", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Nelson Mandela, South Africa", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe24\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Nelson Mandela, South Africa, Life News, News, Politics NewsQUNU, South Africa (AP) \u2014 Songs, speeches and the boom of artillery rang across Nelson Mandela\u2019s home village during his funeral Sunday as a tribal chief draped in animal skin declared: \u201cA great tree has fallen.\u201dSouth Africa was saying goodbye for the last time to the man who reconciled the country in its most vulnerable period.\nWhen the funeral service began, they sang the national anthem in an emotional rendition in which some mourners placed fists over their chests.\nHe said it was painful when he saw Mandela for the last time, months ago in his hospital bed.\nNandi Mandela said her grandfather went barefoot to school in Qunu when he was boy and eventually became president and a figure of global import.\nMandela\u2019s portrait looked over the assembly in the white marquee from behind a bank of 95 candles representing each year of his remarkable life."}
