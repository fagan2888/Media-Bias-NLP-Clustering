This is the term used when a coach has one, and only one more year left on the contract.\n\nListen to me, men. Problem is, players tend to not fully listen knowing their coach is on the hot seat.\n\nThere will be no such distraction for the 2014 Broncos. Fox will not be a lame duck this season as the Broncos tore up the final year of his initial contract and gave him a new three-year deal that runs through the 2016 seasons.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s never easy,\u201d Fox said Saturday morning. \u201cI\u2019ve done it before (with Carolina in 2010). I was prepared, but that\u2019s not something you\u2019d like to do. This is the ultimate good thing to happen. I think it\u2019s a good deal all the way around.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a personal side to this, too. My wife and I love it here. Shoot, my boys don\u2019t even live here and they love it here. We\u2019ve got great fans. I love working for Pat Bowlen. John Elway is a great boss. It\u2019s a great organization. All of that plays a part in it.\n\nPhotos: Broncos coach John Fox\n\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s all good and dandy but, shoot, we\u2019ve still got work to do. We\u2019ve made some progress but we haven\u2019t reached our ultimate goal yet and that\u2019s a world championship.\u201d\n\nFox, 59, is going on his 13th season as an NFL head coach. His first 10 were spent trying to win without an elite quarterback, meaning no disrespect to the overachieving Jake Delhomme and Tim Tebow.\n\nFor going on his third season, Fox\u2019s quarterback will be Peyton Manning. He\u2019d much prefer it this way, although there can be a thankless aspect to having such an elite quarterback.\n\n\u201cSure the expectations are high,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThat comes with the territory. You understand the criticism. There\u2019s three sets of hats. We\u2019ve won the division hat every year for three. We\u2019ve won one conference hat. Now we want to win the world championship hat. We haven\u2019t done that yet. That\u2019s our goal.\u201d\n\nWhen Fox was hired by the Broncos in 2011, he inherited a team coming off a 4-12 record. The team has improved each year. With Tebow at quarterback, the Broncos won the AFC West and a first-round playoff game in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, his first year with Manning, the Broncos went 13-3 to earn a No. 1 AFC playoff seed but lost a heartbreaking second-round postseason game to Baltimore.\n\nIn 2013, the Broncos again went 13-3 with a No. 1 seed, but this time won two AFC playoff games to advance to the Super Bowl. Where upon the team got trounced by Seattle.\n\nGood as the Broncos have been in their three seasons under Fox, they have yet to win it all. Then again, the Broncos weren\u2019t the only good team to play in the 12-team postseason tournament the past three years.\n\nNew England has a great quarterback in Tom Brady and they haven\u2019t won the Super Bowl for going on 10 years. New Orleans and Drew Brees has only won one.\n\nGreen Bay\u2019s Aaron Rodgers is a great quarterback. Brett Favre before him was great. They only have one Super Bowl title each.\n\nSan Diego\u2019s Philip Rivers is real good, yet he has not even played in the Super Bowl.\n\nManning has one Super Bowl championship but that was with Indianapolis in 2006. To get one with the Broncos in 2014, Manning and Fox should have a more balanced team to work with as the defense picked up three Pro Bowlers through free agency in DeMarcus Ware, Aqib Talib and T.J. Ward,\n\n\u201cThe challenge for us \u2014 I\u2019m not talking about everyone in the building, whether it\u2019s assistant coaches, personnel \u2014 is the personality of your team changes every year,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos coach John Fox talks about his new contract", "title": "Broncos coach John Fox talks about his new contract", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/05/broncos-coach-john-fox-talks-about-his-new-contract/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140405__john-fox-press-conference-filep1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140405__john-fox-press-conference-filep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-05T11:30:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:46:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "As his contract extension was laboring through negotiations, Broncos coach John Fox was preparing himself for a worst-case scenario.\nPhotos: Broncos coach John Fox\u201cNow, that\u2019s all good and dandy but, shoot, we\u2019ve still got work to do.\nWith Tebow at quarterback, the Broncos won the AFC West and a first-round playoff game in 2011.\nThen again, the Broncos weren\u2019t the only good team to play in the 12-team postseason tournament the past three years.\nThat\u2019s our goal.\u201dWhen Fox was hired by the Broncos in 2011, he inherited a team coming off a 4-12 record."}
